david morrell nightscape this is the excellent foppery of the world that when we are sick in fortune often the surfeits of our own behavior we make guilty of our disasters the sun the moon and the stars as if we were villains by necessity fools by heavenly compulsion shakespeare king lear to henry james who showed new ways in which tales of terror could be writtenand the human secrets they could hide introduction my mother didnt like bedroom doors hated them in fact as i grew up whenever we moved from apartment to apartment sometimes above bars almost the first thing she did was remove the bedroom doors one reason for this i suspect is that she wanted to convert a normally private space into an area so public that my stepfather would feel uncomfortable making sexual overtures knowing that i would hear everything where i lay closeby in a doorless bedroom as it was i heard plenty for my mother suffered from nightmares and i was often kept awake by her frightened murmurs fidgets and groans as she fought horrors in her sleep she never talked about these persistent nightly onslaughts and it wasnt a household where i felt comfortable asking but from what she blurted while asleep i gather it often had something to do with fire thats the major reason she took the doors off the bedrooms i believe fear for most people closing a bedroom door before they go to sleep creates a feeling of security of safe boundaries but for my mother that closed door made her feel imprisoned smothered trapped as far as she was concerned whatever haunted her in her sleep might in fact have been creeping along the hallway out there crouching about to pounce better to leave the door open so that she might hear the threat coming and be ready for it although i never knew the content of her nightmares i did learn the actual horrors shed survived for without prompting she often told me about them this was usually after my stepfather had picked a dinnerhour family fight so that he could storm away and play poker with his brothers my mothers name was beatrice and whenever i think about her dismal life im reminded of a contrasting beatrice dantes representation of beauty and truth my mother lied about her age so its difficult to reconstruct when the waking nightmare began sometime around on a farm in southern ontario canada when the area had as many horses as automobiles her mother died giving birth to her her father married his dead wifes sister to some this is a form of incest the new wife blamed my mother for her sisters death my mother had an older sibling estelle who could do no wrong in the eyes of the stepmother in contrast the stepmother decided that my mother couldnt do anything right the consequences were frequent severe beatings my mother described one occasion on which she hid all day under a porch while her stepmother waited with a club she described another occasion on which she and estelle put on their best clothes to go to a party as they stepped from the farmhouse their stepmother stalked toward them with a dead maggoty groundhog shed found and threw it at my mother splattering her dress meanwhile estelle was permitted to get into a buggy and ride off to the party my mother loved her sister and never stopped mourning that estelle died young from breast cancer somewhere in these accounts never explained only furtively alluded to was a reference to being terrorized in the night something about a fire the upshot of this hell was that when my mother was sixteen she fled to a convent where she somehow managed to remain until she was of legal age she then moved to a city a hundred miles away supported herself by working in factories and also using her considerable skills as a dressmaker to see her use a sewing machine was a joy eventually she met my father george who was an raf bombardier assigned to train canadian airmen for world war ii in soon after i was born he was reassigned to active status in britain and was shot down during a bombing raid over france or so i was told as a child the truth was inadvertently revealed to me when i was and my mother made a casual stunning comment in actuality my father had survived wounded but having parachuted safely into a field he was discovered by the french resistance and smuggled across the english channel to an raf hospital where he wrote letters to my mother and died from pneumonia to try to repress her painful memories my mother got rid of everything he left behind his clothes their marriage license his letters everything except a cigarette lighter and a very few photographs then came more tough times trying to support the two of us in the final years of the war my mother took in as many dressmaking jobs as she could manage in our tworoom groundfloor apartment she fell sick on the thanksgiving of my second year i still remember how fiery red her face was and how impossible amounts of sweat kept streaming from it i sat next to her on the bed using an entire box of kleenex to mop her cheeks when hunger finally insisted i climbed onto the kitchen table to the turkey my mother had taken from the oven just before shed collapsed on the bed a physician who lived down the street happened to walk past our window and look in at me on the table clawing meat from the turkey a half hour later my mother was in an ambulance on the way to the hospital the disease that had felled her an acute strep skin infection known as erysipelas was potentially fatal and extremely contagious but even though i had practically bathed myself in her sweat while i blotted her cheeks with tissue after tissue of kleenex i never got sick she spent weeks in the hospital and subsequently unable to support the two of us while remaining home and taking care of me she made a difficult choice i was around four and i still remember the family friend who had a car and who took us for a ride in the country we came to a remote gothiclooking building where children played on swings and slides invited to join them i eagerly accepted only to interrupt my laughter to look behind me and see my mother getting into the car and driving away you may have guessed that the building was an orphanage my mother claims i was there only a couple of months but i seem to recall the passage of seasons and feel as if i was there a year during which i twice attempted to escape eventually my mother remarried and reclaimed me but i never got over the sense that i might have been adopted and i never got along with my stepfather who disliked children and who on one occasion struck my face with his fingers curved like claws ripping my mouth open in lessons from a lifetime of writing i described how the fights between him and my mother were so frightening that at night i put a pillow under my covers hoping to make it look as if i was there while i slept under the bed the bedroom door had of course been removed that brings me to this collection whose title nightscape is appropriate to what ive just told you by and large the kind of tales an author writes are metaphors for the scars in the nooks and crannies of hisher psyche in my youth thrillers and horror stories both in print and on the screen provided an escape from my nightmarish reality is it any wonder that as an adult obsessed with being a writer i would compulsively turn to the types of stories that provided an escape when i was a child perhaps im eager to provide an escape for others or perhaps im still trying to escape from my past in any case when i was rereading and arranging these tales i was struck by a common theme i was startled in fact to recognize it when i wrote each story i didnt realize how important a factor this theme was throughout my work the obsession and determination i just alluded to in most of these stories a character gets an idea in his head a hook in his emotions a need that has to be fulfilled and he does everything possible to carry through no matter how difficult truly this emphasis on determination was a revelation to me although probably not to my family and friends it got me wondering why and it led me to poignant memories about my mother who died when she was maybe she was a little younger or olderas i said she lied about her age and whose genes should have allowed her to live to the functioning years that her father and stepmother did if not for the lung cancer that finished her she never smoked but my stepfather did compulsively if i had to select a solitary memory about my mother it would be this my stepfather seldom failed to destroy a holiday on thanksgiving christmas new years day and easter just as my mother who hated to cook was about to set a big meal on the table he would pick a fight and leave my mother and i would sit across from one another trying to enjoy dinner usually she was sobbing and this is what she would say to me david you can be anything you want to be as long as you work hard enough again and again at every ruined family occasion david you can be anything you want to be as long as you work hard enough experience shows that isnt true a person can work brutally hard every long day until death and still not achieve anything im reminded of when i was a professor of american literature and taught the theme of naturalism in the works of stephen crane and theodore dreiser basically naturalism can be defined as pessimistic determinism a compact way of saying that were environmentally and biologically doomed for the worst although naturalism insists there is no god the american version of it can be traced back to the calvinistic sense of being damned that came to america with its early new england settlers calvinists believe that human beings are too unworthy and despicable to earn salvation only gods mercy can save us call it luck and lord knows luck has a lot to do with getting along comfortably in life we all know people who worked hard all their days and never got their just desserts but even the colonial calvinists believed that against the logic of their fatalistic religion we still couldnt give up working and trying that was my mothers attitude life had dealt her shock after shock i think she hated every aspect of her existence i think she hated being a woman ill explain in a few paragraphs a week before my mother died my wife asked her what she would have done differently if she could go through her life again i wouldnt have gotten married my mother said but then you wouldnt have had david what you dont have and dont know youd have had she said you dont miss in my mothers experience sex meant emotional pain she was taught that by being born she had caused her own mothers death marrying my father who was an anglican while my mother was a catholic she caused lifelong tension with her stepmother a catholic who believed that marrying out of the faith was a sin ive always had a sense of a deeper source of tension between her and her stepmother and i wonder if that wasnt caused by pregnancy before marriage conception out of wedlock a grievous social taboo in those days then shortly after my birth the already considerable emotional pain was followed by an even greater onemy fathers death all related to sex and its consequences i think my mother wished shed been a man i also suspect that if shed lived during our less judgmental age shed have been far more content inasmuch as she was probably without knowing it gay david you can be anything you want to be as long as you work hard enough yes and no determination was the mainspring of my mothers existence the obsession to make something of herself to survive her past and achieve something in her future was what kept her going sometimes she had as many as three jobs upholstering furniture in a factory then mowing lawns then making buttons in the basement until midnight so that she could buy a house and stop living over bars so that she could have a degree of comfort and possibly a relief from fear in many ways she achieved her goals but she was never really happy and as her persistent nightmares indicated she really never got over her fears you can be anything you want to be as long as you work hard enough she instilled that into me work hell if its only a matter of work lets roll up our sleeves no big deal all it takes is obsession discipline and determination which might be a good description of what it takes to be a writer in the obsession of the characters in nightscape i recognize myself i recognize my youth i recognize my mothers youth and the absence of bedroom doors with slight exaggeration the events in this story actually happened in the late s i flew from iowa city to ottawa canada to attend that years world fantasy convention a wonderful opportunity for writers and fans to mingle i remember it as an interminable journey during a long layover in toronto s airport i dug into a book id brought along a history of the vatican that i needed to do research for a thriller i was writing the league of night and fog fighting fatigue and weary eyelids i resolutely turned the pages and suddenly straightened when i came across the fascinating real events only tangentially about the vatican that form the basis for what youre about to read if youre tempted to say ive got a sick imagination remember that history is much sicker a few years later robert bloch asked me to write a story for an anthology he was putting together psychopaths wondering what kind of weird tale the legendary creator of psycho might find amusing i remembered torontos airport and what id read about argentinas dictator juan peron remains to be seen on my honor your excellency carlos clicked his heels together and jerked his right arm upward outward clenching his fist in a salute more than your honor your life carlos swear it on your life my life your excellency i swear it the great man nodded his dark eyes burning his once robust face had shrunk around his cheekbones giving him a grimace of perpetual sorrow his pencilthin mustache formerly as dark as his eyes was now gray his once swarthy skin now sallow even if a miracle occurred and his excellencys forces were able to crush the rebellion carlos knew that the strain of the past months worsening crisis would leave the marks of its ravages upon his leader but of course the miracle would not occur already the rattle of machine guns from the outskirts of the city intensified the echo of explosions rumbled over rooftops the shimmer of fires reflected off dense black smoke in the night a frantic bodyguard approached his bandoleer slapping against his chest his rifle clutched so rigidly his knuckles were white your excellency you have to leave now the rebels have broken through but the great man hesitated on your life carlos remember you swore it ill never disappoint you i know the great man clasped his shoulders you never have you never will carlos swelled with pride but sadness squeezed his heart the gunfire and explosions reminded him of the massive fireworks that had celebrated the great mans inauguration now the golden years were over despondent he followed his leader toward a truck its rear compartment capped by a tarpaulin a crate lay on the cobblestoned courtyard it was wooden eight feet long four feet wide the great man squinted at it his gaunt cheeks rippling he clenched his teeth and nodded in command six soldiers stepped forward three on each side and hastily lifted the crate it tilted something inside thumped gently his excellency ordered straining with its bulk glancing fearfully toward the shots that approached the heart of the city the soldiers slid the crate inside the truck one yanked down a section of the tarpaulin another raised the creaky back hatch the great man himself snapped the lockpins into place your excellency please we have to go the bodyguard implored an explosion shook windows the great man seemed not to have heard he continued to stare at the truck your excellency the great man blinked and turned toward the bodyguard of course he scanned the flamehaloed outskirts of the city we must leave but one dayone day well return he pivoted toward carlos do your duty you have the itinerary when im able ill contact you flanked by bodyguards he rushed toward his armored limousine but your excellency arent you coming with me carlos asked racing the great man shouted back no separately we have a greater chance of confusing the rebels we have to mislead them remember carlos on your life with a final look at the truck the great man surged into his limousine guards charging after him as the car roared out of the palace courtyard speeding southward from the direction of the attack carlos felt suddenly empty but at once he remembered his vow you heard his excellency we must go men snapped to attention carlos scrambled into the truck a sergeant slid behind the steering wheel the truck raced eastward a jeep before and behind it each filled with soldiers clutching automatic weapons theyd gone five blocks when a rebel patrol attacked the front jeep blew apart fragments of metal and flaming bodies twisting through the air the trucks driver jerked the steering wheel skidding around the wreckage gunfire shattered the windshield glass showered the driver gasped his brains erupting from the back of his skull while the truck kept moving carlos lunged past the shuddering corpse shoved open the drivers door and thrust the dead sergeant onto the street the body bounced and hit a wall stomping the accelerator carlos rammed through a wooden barricade gripping the steering wheel with his right hand while using his left hand to fire his pistol through the shattered windshield he and the remaining jeep swerved around a gloomy warehouse raced along the murky waterfront and screeched to a stop beside the only ship still in port its frightened crew flinched from nearby gunfire and scurried down the gangplank toward the truck they yanked the crate from the back again something thumped gently carlos ordered heeding the nearby gunshots more than his command they dropped the crate on a sling and shouted orders to someone on deck a motor whined a derrick raised the crate a rope broke carlos felt his heart lurch as the crate dangled halfway out of the sling but it kept rising he held his breath while it swung toward the freighter and slammed onto the deck an explosion followed a moment afterward as a block from the freighter a building erupted in a thunderous blaze the freighters crew raced up the gangplank carlos and his men rushing after them the gangplank beginning to rise already the freighter was moving scraping from the dock it mustered speed ghostly reflections from the fires in the city guided it toward the harbors exit carlos barked orders to his mento remove the tarpaulins from the fiftycaliber machine guns at the bow and stern as they armed the weapons he tensely watched the freighters crew repair the sling and lower the crate through an open hatch sweating he waited for the shout from below that would signal the crates safe arrival in the hold only then did he feel the ache of tension drain from his shoulders he wiped sweat from his brow the first stage of his mission had been completed for now he had nothing to do except wait until he reached his next destination and then wait again for further orders from his excellency behind him a woman whispered his name maria he turned beaming she hurried toward him short with ebony hair and copper skin handsome more than beautiful her pregnancy emphasized her stocky build her strongboned features suggested faithfulness and endurance they embraced during the previous hectic week carlos hadnt seen his wife at all despite his devotion to the great man hed felt the strain of being separated from her a strain that must have shown for the great man had finally told him to send maria a message asking her to meet him on this freighter carlos had been overwhelmed by the great mans consideration is it over are we safe maria asked for now carlos kissed her but his excellency didnt come with you no he plans to meet us later and the crate what about it why is it so important that you had to bring it here under guard his excellency never said i would never have been so bold as to ask but it must have tremendous value for him to entrust it to you to ask you to risk your life to protect it by all the saints yes it must have tremendous value maria gazed worshipfully into his eyes at three am in a cabin that the great man had arranged for them carlos made love to his wife hearing her moan beneath him he felt a pang of concern for his benefactor he prayed that the great man had escaped from the city and would contact him soon his wife thrust a final time against him and went to sleep with a patient sigh as if proud that her marital duty had been accomplished obedience carlos thought of all the virtues obedience is the greatest at dawn he was startled awake by a soldier pounding on the cabins door rebel boats maria stay here the twohour battle was fierce so much so that carlos didnt realize hed been wounded in his left arm as he manned the sterns cannon after the soldier at the trigger was sprayed by machinegun fire the freighter too sustained damage but the rebel boats were repelled the crate was protected the mission continued as one of his men bandaged his bleeding arm carlos ignored the throbbing pain concentrating on a message that the radio operator had given him his excellency had escaped from the city and was fleeing through the mountains may god be with him carlos said but the radio operator looked troubled what is it what havent you told me carlos asked the boats that attacked us i monitored their radio transmissions they knew his excellency was in the mountains they knew before they attacked us carlos frowned the radio operator continued if they knew his excellency wasnt on board why were they so determined to attack us i have no idea carlos said but he lied he did have an idea the crate he thought in the holds fishstinking darkness carlos aimed his flashlight toward the wooden planks that formed the crate pensive he walked around it examining every detail a bottom corner had been splintered not surprising given the rough way the crew had brought it aboard but fortunately no bullets had pierced the wooden planks he leaned against a damp bulkhead and stared in puzzlement at the crate whats in it he wondered twenty minutes later while he continued to stare at the crate a crew member brought a radio message carlos aimed his flashlight at the sheet of paper escape from the mountains accomplished avoid first destination proceed to checkpoint two instructions will follow remember on your life carlos nodded to the messenger he folded the piece of paper and tucked it into a pocket pushing away from the bulkhead he fully intended to follow the crew member from the hold but he couldnt resist the impulse to aim his flashlight at the crate your arm maria said when carlos at last emerged onto the deck does it hurt carlos shrugged and repressed a wince you mustnt strain yourself you need to rest i rest when his excellency reclaims his property whatever it is maria said do you think its gold or jewels rare coins priceless paintings secret documents most likely its none of my business tomorrow evening thank god my responsibility ends but the great man wasnt waiting when the freighter docked at the neutral port that was checkpoint two instead a nervous messenger raced up the gangplank wiping his brow he blurted that although his excellency had reached a neighboring country the rebels persisted in chasing him he cant risk coming to the freighter he asks you to proceed to checkpoint three three days to the north carlos subdued his disappointment hed looked forward to showing the great man how well hed done his duty his excellency said to remind you you vowed on your honor on my life carlos straightened i was with him from the beginning when he and i were frightened peasants determined to topple the tyrant i swore allegiance ill never disappoint him that night while the freighter was still in port a rebel squad disguised as stevedores snuck on board and nearly succeeded in reaching the hold before a vigilant soldier sounded an alarm in the furious gun battle carlos lost five members of his team all eight invaders were killed but not before a grenade was thrown into the hold the explosion filled carlos with panic he emptied his submachine gun into the rebel whod thrown the grenade he rushed down to the hold aimed his flashlight and was shocked to discover that the grenade had detonated fifteen feet from the crate shrapnel had splintered its wooded slats a jagged hole gaped in the side carlos felt smothered he drew trembling fingers along the damaged wood if the contents entrusted to him had been destroyed how could he explain his failure to his excellency i swore to protect fear made carlos stiffen what if the shrapnel had stayed hot enough to smolder inside the crate what if the contents were secret documents and they burst into flames grabbing a crowbar he jammed it beneath the lid nails screaked wood snapped he jerked the lid up desperate to peer inside to make sure there wasnt a fire what he saw made him gasp a footstep scraped behind him slamming the lid shut he drew his pistol and spun maria emerged from shadows caught by the beam of his flashlight she frowned are you all right carlos exhaled i almost shaking he holstered his pistol never creep up behind me but the shooting i felt so worried go back to our cabin try to sleep come with me you need to rest no what did you find when you opened the crate youre mistaken maria i didnt open it but i saw you its dark down here my flashlight must have cast shadows and tricked your eyes but i heard you slam down the lid no you heard me lose my balance and fall against the crate i didnt open it go back to our cabin do what i tell you with a plaintive look maria obeyed as the echo of her footsteps dwindled the flashlight revealed her pregnant silhouette at the top of murky metal stairs the hatch banged shut behind her carlos forced himself to wait finally certain that she was gone he turned again toward the crate and slowly lifted the lid before hed been interrupted hed had a quick glimpse of the contents enough to verify that there wasnt a fire although he didnt dare tell maria what was in there for fear shed reveal the secret because what hed seen had been more startling than a fire the coffin was made of burnished copper its gleaming surface marred by pockmarks from shrapnel his knees faltered fighting dizziness he leaned down to inspect the desecration with a sharp breath of satisfaction he decided the damage was superficial the coffin had not been penetrated but what about the body yes the body it was none of his business the great man hadnt seen fit to let him know what hed pledged his life to protect no doubt his excellency had his reasons carlos subdued his intense curiosity lowered the lid and resecured it hed exceeded his authority granted but for a just motive to protect what had been entrusted to him his duty had been honored the coffin wasnt in danger for the moment he could have its copper made smooth again he could replace the crate with one that hadnt been damaged his excellency would never know that carlos had almost failed but the mystery still wasnt solved the ultimate questions remained why were the rebels so determined to destroy the crate who was in the coffin burdened with responsibility carlos climbed from the hold and ordered a crewman bring down a mattress and blankets a thermos of coffee food a lantern he told maria ill be staying in the hold tonight every night until his excellency reclaims whats his no its damp down there the air smells foul youll get sick i made a vow ive tripled the guards on deck no one but me is allowed down there not even you three awful days later carlos shuffled from the hold unshaven gaunt and feverish he squinted through blurred vision toward the northern neutral port that was checkpoint three but again his excellency wasnt waiting another distraught messenger rushed on board its worse than we feared the rebels are determined to hunt him to the ends of the earth theyve cut off his route here he has to keep running these are your new instructions shuddering carlos studied them to europe marseilles thats the only chance to complete the mission carlos wavered his excellency said to remind you you swore on your life carlos trembled my oath was solemn not just my life my soul in the hold enduring turbulence nausea and delirium carlos felt more compelled during the seemingly endless route across the atlantic the crate and its contents beckoned the coffin his only companion drew him as his lantern hissed and his wounded arm throbbed he paced before his obligation the crate the coffin the corpse whose at last he couldnt resist again he grabbed the crowbar again he pried up the wooden lid leaning down trembling he fingered the catches on the coffins seam released them and pushed upward gradually revealing the secret this time he gasped not from surprise but reverence his knees wavered he almost knelt before her majesty the patronness of her people the blessed mother of her country how many days and far into how many nights had she made herself available to her people allowing endless streams of petitioners to come to her dispensing food comfort and hope how many times had she interceded with his excellency for the poor and homeless whom shed described as her shirtless ones the church had called her a saint the people had called her a godsend her works of mercy had been equalled only by her beauty tall trim and statuesque with graceful contours and stunning features she embodied perfection her blonde hair rare among her people emphasized her uniqueness her locks so golden so radiant they seemed a halo the cancer that ravaged her uterus had been both a real and symbolic abomination how could someone so giving so emotionally fertile have been brought down by a disease that attacked her female essence god had turned his back on his special creation the world would not see her likes again the people mourned his excellency more so he grieved so hard that he felt compelled to preserve her memory in the flesh to capture her beauty for as long as science could make possible no one knew for sure the process involved rumor had it that hed sent for the worlds greatest embalmer the mortician whod been entrusted with the corpse of the secular god of the soviets lenin himself it was said that the great man had instructed the embalmer to use all his skills to preserve her majesty forever as she had been in life her blood had been replaced with alcohol glycerine at one hundred and forty degrees fahrenheit had been pumped through her tissues her corpse had been immersed in secret chemicals even more secret techniques had preserved her organs although her skin had tightened somewhat it glistened with a radiance greater than shed had in life her blonde hair and red lips were resplendent carlos froze with awe the rumors were true her majesty had been made eternal he cringed with expectation that she would open her eyes and speak in turmoil he remembered the rest of the tragedy her majestys death had begun the great mans downfall hed tried to maintain his power without her but the people always demanding always ungratefulhad turned against him it didnt matter that his excellency had planned future social reforms while his wife had soothed social woes merely from day to day from the peoples point of view the good of now was greater than that of soon when a rabblerouser had promised immediate paradise a new revolution toppled the great mans government now carlos understood why the rebels were so determined to destroy the crate to eradicate all vestiges of the great mans rule they had to destroy not only his excellency but the immortalized remains of the great mans love and source of his power the goddess of her country burdened with greater responsibility carlos bowed his head in worship an hour having seemed like a minute he lowered the coffins lid and resecured the top of the crate he trembled with reverence during the turbulent voyage across the atlantic he twice gave in to temptation raised the lids from the crate and the coffin and studied the treasure entrusted to him the miracle continued her majesty remained as lifelike as ever soon the great man will have you back carlos thought but his excellency wasnt waiting when the freighter docked at marseilles yet another frantic messenger hurried aboard reporting that their leader was still being chased delivering new instructions he frowned at carloss beardstubbled cheeks flushed skin and hollow eyes but are you well enough perhaps someone else should i vowed to his excellency i must complete the mission when maria privately objected that he wasnt well he told her you dont understand whats involved distressed he arranged for the crate to be unloaded from the freighter and placed in a truck under guard it was driven to a secret airstrip from where the crate was flown to italy and placed on a train bound for rome three times rebel teams attempted to intercept it but carlos was watchful the teams were destroyed although at the cost of several of his men he paced in front of the crate in an otherwise empty boxcar how had the rebels anticipated the itinerary as the train reached rome he was forced to conclude that there was a spy one of his excellencys advisers must be passing information to the rebels the itinerary had to be modified as scheduled the crate was rushed to a warehouse but twelve hours later carlos had it moved to the basement of a church and two days later to a storage room in a mortuary after an uneventful week only then was it taken to its intended destination an abandoned villa outside rome carlos hoped that his variation of the schedule had confused the rebels into thinking that the entire itinerary had been altered further variations tempted him but he had to insure that his excellency could get in touch with him and more important rejoin her majesty the villa was in disrepair decrepit depressing the stainedglass windows were cracked the lights didnt work cobwebs floated from the great halls ceiling in the middle of the immense dusty marble floor the crate lay surrounded by candles so carlos could see to aim if any of the ruins numerous rats dared to approach the crate and its sacred contents his men patrolled the grounds guarding the mansions entrances while maria had orders to remain in an upperfloor bedroom periodically carlos opened the crate and the coffin to remind himself of the reason for his sacrifice of his need for constant vigilance his vision of the blessed mystery became increasingly profound her majesty seemed ever more lifelike beatific radiant the illusion was overwhelmingshe wasnt dead but merely sleeping he couldnt remember the last time hed bathed his hair and beard were shaggy his garments were wrinkled and filthy as he slumped in a musty chair unable to fight exhaustion his chin on his chest his gunhand drooping he vaguely recalled a time when his dreams had been restful but now he had only nightmares assaulted by ghosts a scrape of metal jerked him awake a footstep on marble made him spin his skill defeated his sleepclouded eyes he shot repeatedly roared in triumph and rushed toward the enemy whod brazenly violated her majestys sanctum preparing to deliver a justtobecertain shot to the head he gaped down at maria unmoving in a pool of blood every bullet having pierced her pregnancy he shrieked until his throat seized shut maria was buried behind the villa in one of its numerous untended gardens he couldnt risk sending for a priest who in spite of a bribe would no doubt inform the authorities about the killing what was more to leave the villa to take his wife to a church and then a graveyard was out of the question at all extremes his duty remained her majesty had to be guarded weeping he patted his shovel on the dirt that covered marias corpse he knelt and planted a single flower a yellow rose her favorite his grief was mixed with anger you were told to stay upstairs you had your orders just as i have mine why didnt you listen how many times did i tell you obedience is the greatest virtue holding back sobs he returned to the villas great hall relieved the guards who had taken his place and commanded them to remain outside he locked the great halls door and wearily approached the crate to open the coffin wavering before her majesty her blonde hair glowed her red lips glistened her sensuous cheeks were translucent now you understand how solemly i swore on my soul i sacrificed my wife for you i killed my unborn child there is nothing i wouldnt do for you sleep in peace never fear no matter the cost i will always protect you his tears dropped onto her forehead her eyelids seemed to flicker he inhaled sharply but he was only imagining he told himself the movement had simply been the shimmer of light through his misted eyes he wiped the tears from her forehead im sorry your majesty he tried to resist but couldnt he kissed her brow where the tears had fallen a messenger at last arrived after restless nights of sleeping beside the crate carlos sighed anticipating that the great man had escaped and intended to reclaim his treasure at the same time he surprised himself by regretting that his mission had come to an end it hadnt however with an odd relief he learned that the great man was still being chased carlos studied his new instructions to take the crate to madrid his excellency is obliged to you for your loyalty the messenger said he told me to tell you he wont forget carlos fought to still his trembling hands tugged at his unkempt beard and brushed back his shaggy hair its my privilege to be the great mans servant no sacrifice is too burdensome youre an inspiration his excellency heard about the unfortunate loss of your wife he sends his deep condolences carlos gestured in grief as well as devotion but devotion to whom he wondered as i said any sacrifice in madrid he noticed her majestys lips move and knew he had to feed her three months later having been ordered to move the crate to lisbon he knew that her majesty would be cold en route and covered her with a blanket six months later having relocated in brussels he knew that her majesty would have trouble breathing in the coffin and ordered his men to bring him an electric drill finally the message arrived escape accomplished faithful friend your obligation is at an end directions enclosed with heartfelt thanks and immense anticipation i ask you to return what is mine yours carlos turned to her majesty and sobbed the motorcade fishtailed up the snowy road that approached the chateau outside geneva the great man waited anxiously breathing frost as he paced the driveway pressing his chilled hands under the crate he helped his servants carry it through the opened double door impatient he ordered it placed in the steepleroofed living room and commanded everyone to leave except for the genius mortician who had used his secret skills to preserve the great mans love and who now had been summoned to validate the results of his promise each breathed quickly ready with crowbars to raise the crates lid but finding that it wasnt secure distressed they reached to open the coffin but discovered that it wasnt locked her majesty looked astonishingly lifelike even more than the genius had guaranteed but a hole had been drilled in the lid of her coffin there was a matching hole in her skull the drill having gone too deep and rotten food bulged from her mouth and brains and blood covered her face carlos lay on top of her a bullet hole in his skull a pistol in his hand a beatific expression on his face in my fifteenyearold son matthew died from strep and staph infections the consequence of complications in a bonemarrow transplant that was a desperate attempt to cure his rare form of bone cancer thereafter my imagination dwelled on the theme of grief eventually i wrote several stories on the subject many of which appeared in my earlier collection black evening in this further griefthemed story i couldnt help thinking of ted bundy commissioned by writeranthologist dennis etchison it appeared in the anthology metahorror andwas nominated for that years horror writers of america bestnovella award nothing will hurt you later the song would have agonizing significance for him i cant stop hearing it chad would tell his psychiatrist and fight to control his rapid breathing his eyes would ache it doesnt matter what im doing meeting a client talking to a publisher reading a manuscript walking through central park even going to the bathroom i hear that song ive tried my damnedest not to i hardly sleep but when i manage to i wake up feeling ive been humming it all night chad vividly remembered the first time hed heard it he could date it exactly wednesday april he could give the time precisely pm because although hed found the song poignant and the singers performance outstanding hed felt an odd compulsion to glance at his watch it must have been a tougher day than i realized hed thought so tired nine fortysix is that all sweeney todd the demon barber of fleet street stephen sondheims musical had opened on broadway in march a critical success tickets impossible to get except that chad had a playwright client with contacts in the production company when chad s wife linda broke one of their marriages rules and gave chad a surprise birthday party the client pretending to be a magician pulled two tickets from behind chad s ear happy fortysecond old buddy but chad remembered the precise date he saw the musical not because it had anything to do with his birthday instead he had a deeper reason the demon barber of fleet street come in for a shave and a haircut have your throat slit get dumped down a chute ground up into hamburger and baked into mrs lovetts renowned everpopular scrumptious howdoyougetthatdistinctivetaste meat pies cant eat enough of them to startle the audience a deafening whistle shrilled each time sweeney slashed a throat blood spurted and one of mrs lovetts waiters was an idiot kid who hadnt the faintest idea of what was going on but he had misgivings that something was wrong he confessed his fears to mrs lovett who thought of him fondly as her son she promised that shed protect him she sang that nothing would hurt hima magnificent performance by angela lansbury of a tune that forever after would torture chad its title not while im around a lilting heartbreaking song in the midst of multiple murders and cannibalism after the show chad and linda had trouble finding a taxi and didnt get back to their upper east side apartment until almost midnight they felt so disturbed by the plot yet elated by the music that they decided to have some brandy and discuss their reactions to the show and thats when the phone rang scowling chad wondered who in hell would be calling at such an hour immediately he suspected one of his nervous not to mention important authors with whom hed been having tense conversations all week because of a publishers unfavorable reaction to the authors new manuscript chad tried to ignore the phones persistent jangle let the answering machine take it he thought at once he angrily picked up the phone a mans gravelly voice made faint by the hiss of a longdistance line sounded tense this is lieutenant raymond mackenzie im with the new haven police force i know its late i apologize if i woke you but theres been an emergency i m afraid what chad heard next made him quiver in response he insisted no youre wrong theres got to be some mistake dont i wish the lieutenants voice became more gravelly you have my deepest sympathy times like this i hate my job the lieutenant gave instructions chad murmured compliance and set down the phone linda whod been staring demanded to know why chad was so pale when chad explained linda blurted no dear god it cant be urgency canceled numbness they each threw clothes into a suitcase hurried from their apartment to the rental garage three blocks away where they stored their twoyearold ford theyd bought the car at the same time theyd bought their cottage in connecticut so they could spend weekends near their daughter and sped with absolutely no memory of the drive except that they kept repeating no its impossible to new haven and lieutenant mackenzie whose husky voice it turned out didnt match his short thin frame denial was reflexive insistent stubborn even when the lieutenant sympathetically repeated and rerepeated that there had not been a mistake when he regretfully showed them stephanies purse her wallet her drivers license when he showed them a statement from stephanies roommate that she hadnt come back to the dormitory last nighteven when chad and linda went down to the morgue and identified the body or what was left of the body although it hadnt been stephanies face that was mutilatedthey still kept insisting no this had to be someone who looked like stephanie someone who stole stephanies purse someone whosome mistake nothing would hurt him angela lansbury had sung to the boy her character thought of as a son in sweeney todd and the night before when chad had listened to the lilting nearlullaby he had been briefly reminded of his own and only child dear sweet stephanie when she was a tot and he had read to her at bedtime had sung nursery rhymes to her and had taught her to pray now i lay me down to sleep his beloved daughter had obediently repeated i pray the lord my soul to keep if i should die before i wake i pray the lord my soul to take daddy is there a bogeyman no dear its just your imagination go to sleep dont worry daddys here nothing will hurt you not while im around the song had been called but two years earlier stephanie had gone to new haven for a ba in english at yale and last night there had been a bogeyman and despite chad s longago promise he had not been around when the bogeyman very definitely hurt stephanie when did it chad struggled to breathe as he stared at lieutenant mackenzie what time did she the body was discovered at just before eleven last night based on heat loss from the brain the medical examiner estimates the time of death between ninethirty and ten pm nine fortysix the lieutenant frowned more or less its difficult to be that precise sure chad bit his lip tasting tears nine fortysix he remembered the odd compulsion hed felt to glance at his watch the previous night when angela lansbury had sung that nothing would hurt her friend while the bogeyman killed stephanie chad knew he was absolutely certain nine fortysix that was when stephanie had died hed felt the tug of her death as if a little girl had jerked at the sleeve of his suit coat daddy is there a bogeyman not while i can help it chad must have said that out loud because the lieutenant frowned asking what im sorry sir i didnt quite hear what you just said nothing sobbing uncontrollably holding linda whose features were rawred dripping with tears contorted with grief chad felt the terrible urge to ask the lieutenant to take him down to the morgue againjust so he could see stephanie one more time even if she looked like even if her all he wanted was to see her again stephanie no it couldnt be jesus not stephanie numbness denial confusion chad later tried to reconstruct the conversations remembering them through a haze no matter how often he was given details he needed more and more clarification i dont understand what the hell happened have you any clues witnesses have you found the son of a bitch who did this the lieutenant looked bleak as he explained stephanie had gone to the university library the previous afternoon a friend had seen her leave the library at six on her way back to the dormitory someone must have offered her a ride or asked her to help him carry something into a building or somehow grabbed her without attracting attention the usual method was to appeal to the victims sympathy by pretending to be disabled however it was done she had disappeared afterward the killer had stopped his car at the side of a road outside new haven and dumped stephanies body into a ditch the absence of blood at the scene indicated that the murder had occurred at another location the road was far from a highway at night all the killer had to do was drive along the road until there werent any headlights before or behind him then stop and rush to open the trunk and get rid of the body twenty seconds later hed have been back on his way the lieutenant sighed its only coincidence that a car on that road last night happened to have a flat tire where the killer left your daughter the drivers a farmer who lives in the area he switched on his flashlight walked around the car to check his tire and his light picked up your daughter pure coincidence but clues yes because of that coincidence this time weve got some tire tracks at the side of the road it rained yesterday afternoon any tracks in the dirt would have to be fresh forensics got a very clear set of impressions tire tracks but they wont identify the killer what can i say mr dolan at the moment those tire tracks are all weve got and believe me theyre more than any other police force involved in these killings has managed to get except of course for the consistent marks on the victims plural on that point at least chad didnt need an explanation one look at stephanies body at what the bastard had done to her body and chad knew who the killer was not the bastards name of course but everybody knew his nickname one of those cheap tabloids at the supermarket checkout counter had given it to him the biter and reputable newspapers had stooped to the tabloids level by repeating it because in addition to raping and strangling his victims eighteen so far all caucasian females attractive blond in their late teens in college the killer left bite marks on them police reports revealed the published details were sketchy chad had grimly imagined teeth impressions on a neck an arm a shoulder but nothing had prepared him for the horrors done to his daughters corpse for the killer didnt merely bite his victims he chewed on them he gnawed huge pieces from their arms and legs he chomped holes in their stomachs bit off their nipples nipped off their labia the son of a bitch was a cannibal multiple murders and sweeney todd nothing will hurt you imagining stephanies lonely panic chad moaned until he screamed in a stupor he and linda struggled through the nightmare of arranging for a funeral waiting for the police to release the body and collecting their daughters things from her dormitory room on her desk they found a halffinished essay about shakespeares sonnets a page still in the typewriter a quotation never completed shall i compare thee to a summers on a shelf beside her bed they picked up textbooks sections of them underlined in red that stephanie had been studying for final exams she would never take clothes keepsakes her radio her winniethepooh bear everything filled a suitcase and three boxes so little so easily removed now youre here now you arent chad bitterly thought oh jesus im sorry mr and mrs dolan stephanies roommate said she had freckles and wore glasses her long red hair hung in a ponytail she looked devastated i really am stephanie was kind and smart and funny i liked her im going to miss her she was special it just isnt fair gosh im so confused i wish i knew what to say ive never known anyone close to me who died before i understand chad said bleakly his father had died from a heart attack at the age of seventy but that death hadnt struck chad with the overwhelming shock of this death after all his father had battled heart disease for several years and the massive coronary had been inevitable hed passed away succumbed joined his maker whatever euphemism hid the fact best and gave the most comfort but what had happened to stephanie was cruelly starkly brutally that shed been murdered dear god it couldnt be chad and linda carried stephanies things to the car returned to the police station and badgered lieutenant mackenzie until he finally gave them directions to the road and the ditch where stephanie had been found dont torture yourselves the lieutenant tried to tell them but chad and linda were already out the door chad didnt know what he expected to find or feel or achieve by seeing the spot where the killer had parked and dumped stephanies body like a sack of garbage as it turned out he and linda werent able to get close anyhow a police officer was standing watch over a section of the side of the road and a portion of the ditch both enclosed by a makeshift fence of stakes linking yellow tape labeled police crime scene do not enter on the grass at the bottom of the ditch the outline of stephanies twisted body had been drawn with white spray paint linda wept chad felt sick and hollow at the same time his heart and profoundly his soul swelled with rage the bastard thewhoever did this when they find himchad imagined punching him stabbing him choking him until his tongue bulged and at once remembered that stephanie had been choked he leaned against the car and couldnt stop sobbing finally after seemingly endless bureaucratic delays they were given their daughter following a hearse they made the solemn drive back to new york for the funeral although stephanies face had not been mutilated chad and linda refused to allow a public viewing of her remains granted mourning friends and relatives wouldnt be able to see the obscene marks on her body beneath her burial clothes but chad and linda would see those marks in their minds as if the burial clothes were transparent more chad and linda couldnt tolerate inflicting upon stephanie the indignity of being forced to lie in her grave for all eternity with that monsters filthy marks on her she had to be cremated purified made innocent again ashes to ashes cleansed with fire each day chad and linda drove out to the cemetery to visit her the trip became the event around which they scheduled their other activities not that they had many other activities chad had no interest in reading manuscripts meeting authors and dealing with publishers although his friends said that the thing to do was get back on track distract himself immerse himself in his literary agency but his work didnt matter and he spent more and more of each day taking long walks through central park he had dizzy spells he drank too much for her part linda quit teaching piano sequestered herself in the apartment studied photographs of stephanie stared into space and slept a great deal they sold the cottage in connecticut which theyd bought and gone to each weekend only so they could be close to stephanie in new haven if she had wanted to visit they sold their ford which theyd needed only to get to the cottage nothing will hurt you the bittersweet song constantly faintly echoed in the darkest chambers of chad s mind he thought hed go crazy as he trembled from stress and obeyed the compulsion to visit places he associated with stephanie the playground of the grade school shed attended her high school the zoo at central park the jogging track around the lake he conjured images of her different ages different heights different hair and clothes styles ghostly mental photographs eerie double exposures in which then and now coexisted a little girl she giggled on a swing in a neighborhood park that had long ago become an apartment building i cant stand this chad thought in mental rage and imagined the blessed release that he would feel if he hurled himself in front of a speeding subway train what helped him was that stephanie told him not to oh he knew that her voice was only in his mind but she sounded so real and her tender voice made him feel less tormented he heard her so clearly dad think of mother if you kill yourself youll cause her twice the pain she has now she needs you for my sake help her chad s legs felt unsteady he slumped on a chair in the kitchen where at three am hed been pacing nothing will hurt you oh baby im sorry you couldnt have saved me dad its not your fault you couldnt watch over me all the time it could have happened differently i could have been killed in a traffic accident a block from our apartment there arent any guarantees its just that i miss you so damned much and i miss you dad i love you but im not really gone im talking to you arent i yesat least i think so im far away but im also inside you and whenever you want to talk we can all you have to do is think of me and ill be there but its not the same its the best we can do dad where i am isbright im soaring im ecstatic you mustnt feel sorry for me youve got to accept that im gone youve got to accept that your life is different now youve got to become involved once more stop drinking stop skipping meals start reading manuscripts again answer your clients phone calls get in touch with publishers work but i dont care youve got to dont throw your life away just because i lost mine ill never forgive you if no please sweetheart please dont get angry ill try i promise i will ill try for my sake sobbing chad nodded as the speck of light faded but angela lansburys voice continued echoing faintly nothing will hurt you no matter how hard he tried chad couldnt get the song from his mind the more he heard it the more a lurking implication in the lyrics began to trouble him a halfsensed deeper meaning dark and disturbing felt but not understood a further horror the biters next victim was found by a hiker on the bank of a stream near princeton that was three months later although the victim a coed who worked for the universitys library during the summer had been missing for two weeks and exposed to scavenging animals and the blistering sun her remains were sufficiently intact for the medical examiner to establish the cause of death as strangulation and to distinguish between animal and human bite marks that information was all the police revealed to the press but chad now knew what bite marks meant and he shuddered remembering the chunks that the killer had gnawed from stephanies body by then linda had started taking students again chad true to his promise to stephanie had forced himself to pay attention to his authors and their publishers but now the news of the biters latest victim threatened to tear away the fragile control that he and linda had managed to impose on their lives compulsively he wrote a letter to the murdered girls parents we mourn for your daughter as we mourn for our own we pray that theyre at peace and beg god for justice may this monster be caught before he kills again may he be punished to the limits of hell in truth chad didnt need to pray that stephanie was at peace he knew she was she told him so whenever he stumbled sleeplessly into the kitchen at two or three am and found her speck of light hovering waiting for him nonetheless chad s rage intensified each morning he mustered a motive to get out of bed hoping that today would be the day when the authorities caught the monster what they found instead in september soon after the start of the fall semester was the biters next victim maggotridden in a storm drain near vassar college chad urgently phoned lieutenant mackenzie demanding to know if the vassar police had found any clues yes mackenzies voice sounded even more gravelly it rained again the vassar police found the same tire marks he exhaled wearily mr dolan i understand your despair your anger your need for revenge but you have to let go you have to get on with your life while we do our job every police department involved in these killings has formed a network i promise you were doing everything we can to compare information and chad slammed down the phone and scribbled a letter to the parents of the biters latest victim we share your loss we weep as you do if theres a god in heaven as opposed to this devil out of hell our beautiful children will not have died unatoned their brilliantly speeding souls will be granted justice the desecrations inflicted upon their innocent bodies will be avenged chad never received responses from those other parents it didnt matter he didnt care hed done his best to console them but if they were too overwhelmed by sorrow to muster the strength to comfort him as he strained to comfort them well that was all right he understood the main thing was hed assured them that he wouldnt rest until the monster was punished each day he made phone calls to all the police departments in the areas where the biter had disposed of his victims canceling lunches with publishers postponing meetings with authors leaving manuscripts unread chad concentrated on questioning homicide detectives he demanded to know why they werent trying harder why they hadnt achieved results why they hadnt tracked down the bastard allowing his victims to rest with the knowledge that their abuser would be punished at the same time preventing other potential victims from suffering his brutality just before thanksgiving the biters next target the same profile female late teens caucasian blond was discovered in a dumpster bin behind a restaurant a mile from wellesley college sure chad thought a dumpster bin the monster treated her the same way he did stephanie and all his other victims like garbage he wrote another letter but again he didnt receive an answer the parents must be too stunned to react he concluded whatever it doesnt matter i did my duty i shared my grief i let them realize theyre not alone im their and my daughters advocate new years eve another victim dartmouth college more phone calls to detectives more letters to parents more visions in chad s kitchen at three am a speck of brilliant light a tender voice youre out of control dad please im begging you get on with your life shave take a bath change your clothes most of your authors have left you mothers left you im afraid for you chad shook his head your motherwhat she left me with a shudder chad realized that linda had packed several suitcases anddear god he remembered now linda had shouted its been too long its bad enough to grieve for stephanie but to watch you do this to yourself its too damned much dont destroy my life while you destroy yours ah of course so be it chad dismally thought she needs a comfort i cant give her god willing shell find it with someone else vengeance retribution with greater fury chad pursued his mission more phone calls more frantic letters and then a breakthrough what the detectives hadnt told chad but what he now learned was that the tire tracks left by his daughters desecrater had been identified last year back in april as standard equipment on a particular model of american van not only stephanies corpse near yale but the later victim near vassar had been linked with the tire tracks on that year and model of van because the biters numerous targets had all been students at colleges and universities in new england the authorities had concentrated their search in that area when a blond attractive female student narrowly escaped being dragged inside a van as she strolled toward her dormitory at brown university the local police braced for the threat ordered roadblocks around the area and stopped the type of van that theyd been seeking the handsome ingratiating male driver complied too calmly his responses were too respectful not at all curious on a hunch an officer asked the driver to open the back of the van the drivers eyes narrowed chilled by the intensity of his gaze the policeman grasped his revolver and repeated his request what he and his team discovered after the driver hesitated after they took his keys were stacks of boxes in the rear of the van and behind the boxes a bound gagged unconscious coed that night the police announced the suspected biters arrest and chad shouted in triumph finally a textbook salesman the bastards district was new england colleges he stalked each campus he studied his variety of quarry reduced his choices selected his final target and chad imagined the biters enticement these boxes of books theyre too heavy ive sprained my left wrist would you mind could you help me id really appreciatethank you by the way whats your major no kidding english what a coincidence thats my major here in the back help me with this final box you wont believe the first editions ive got in there rape torture cannibalism and murder were what he had in there step in farther nothings going to hurt you but now the bastard had finally been caught his name was richard putnam the alleged biter the media carefully called him although chad had no doubt of putnams guilt as he studied the television images of the monster the unafraid expression the unemotional eyes the handsome suspect should have been sweating with fear blustering with indignation but instead he gazed directly at the cameras disturbingly confident a sociopath chad phoned policemen and district attorneys to warn them not to be fooled by putnams calm manner he wrote letters to the parents of every victim urging them to make similar calls each night at three am as he wandered through his cluttered apartment he always found stephanies brilliant light hovering in the kitchen at last they found him she said at last you can give up your anger sleep eat rest distract yourself work its over no it wont be over until the son of a bitch is punished i want him to suffer to feel the terror you did but he cant feel terror he cant feel anything except when he kills believe me sweetheart when the court finds him guilty when the judge pronounces his sentence that sociopath will suddenly find he can definitely feel emotion thats what im afraid of i dont understand dont you want revenge im speeding so brilliantly i dont have time toim afraid afraid about what stephanies radiant light faded what are you afraid of nothing will hurt you the song kept echoing in chad s mind while he hadnt been able to protect his daughter as he had promised when she was a child he could do his utmost to guarantee he was there to make sure that the monster suffered calls to police departments revealed that the various states in which the murders had occurred were each demanding to put the biter on trial the result was bureaucratic chaos arguments about which city would have the first chance to prosecute as the authorities persisted in quarreling chad s frustration compelled him to visit the parents of each victim to convince them to form a group to conduct news conferences to insist that jurisdictional egos be ignored in favor of the strongest evidence in any one city to plead for justice it gave chad intense satisfaction to believe that his efforts produced results and even greater satisfaction that new haven was selected as the site of the trial that stephanies murder would be the crime against which the biter was initially prosecuted by then a year had passed as part of his divorce settlement chad had sold his coop apartment in manhattan splitting the proceeds with linda he moved to cheaper lodgings in new haven relying on the income he received from his ten percent of royalties that his former authors were required to pay him for contracts that hed negotiated successful sure before stephanie was nothing will hurt you wrong it hurts like hell each day at the trial chad sat in the front row far to the side so he could have a direct view of putnams unemotional thisisallamistake confident profile damn you show fear show remorse show anything chad thought but even when the district attorney presented photographs of the horrors done to stephanie the monster did not react chad wanted to leap across the courtrooms railing and claw putnams eyes out it took all his selfcontrol not to scream his litany of mental curses the jury deliberated for ten days why did they need so long they finally declared him guilty and yet again the monster showed no reaction nor did he react when the judge pronounced the maximum punishment connecticut allowed life in prison but chad reacted he shrieked life in prison change the law that son of a bitch deserves to be executed chad was removed from the courtroom outside putnams lawyer make a speech about a miscarriage of justice vowing to demand a new trial to appeal to a higher court thus began a different kind of horror the complexities and loopholes in the legal system another year passed the monster remained in prison yes but what if a judge decided that a further trial was necessary that putnam was obviously insane and should have pleaded accordingly a year in prison for what hed done to stephanie if he was released on a technicality or sent to a mental institution where he would pretend to respond to treatment and perhaps eventually be pronounced cured hed kill again at three am in chads gloomy new haven apartment he raised his haggard face from where hed been dozing at the kitchen table he smiled toward stephanies speck of light hi dear its wonderful to see you where have you been how ive missed you youve got to stop doing this im getting even for you youre making me scared for me of course i understand but as soon as i know that hes punished ill put my life in order i promise ill clean up my act thats not what i mean i dont have time to explain im soaring so fast so brilliantly stop what youre doing i cant how can you rest in peace if he isnt im afraid putnams appeal was denied but that was another year later in the meantime chads former wife linda had married someone else and chads percentage of royalties from his past authors dwindled he was forced to move to more shabby lodgings he began to withdraw money with tax penalties from his pension he now had a beard less trouble no necessity to shave so what if his unwashed hair drooped over his ears there was no one to impress no authors no publishers no one except stephanie where in gods name was she shed abandoned him why while stephanies murder had officially been solved others attributed to the biter had not putnam refused to admit that hed killed anyone and the authorities furious about putnams stubbornness decided to put pressure on him to close the books on those other crimes to force him to confess before hed been a book salesman in new england hed worked in florida a blonde attractive coed had been murdered years before at floridas state university the killer had used a knife instead of his teeth to mutilate the victim there wasnt any obvious reason to link the biter with that killing but a search of that florida citys records revealed that putnam had received a parking ticket near where the victim had disappeared as she left the universitys library further putnams rare blood type matched the type derived from the semen that the killer had left within the victim just as the semen that the monster had left within stephanie contained putnams blood type years ago that evidence could not have been used in court because of limitations in forensic technology but now putnam was arrested for the coeds murder his lawyer had insisted on another trial well the monster would get one in florida where the maximum penalty wasnt life in prison it was death chad moved to the outskirts of florida state university his pension and his portion of royalties from contracts hed negotiated increasingly declined his clothes became more shabby his appearance more unkempt his frame more gaunt at some hazy point in the intervening years his former wife linda died from breast cancer he mourned for her but not as he mourned for stephanie the florida trial seemed to take forever again chad came to stare at the monster again he endured the complexities of the legal system again the evidence presented at the trial made him shudder but finally putnam was found guilty and this time the judge chad cheered and had to be evicted from the courtroom again sentenced the monster to death in the electric chair antideathpenalty groups raised a furor they petitioned floridas supreme court and the states governor to reduce the sentence for his part chad barraged the media and the parents of the biters victims with phone calls and letters urging them to use all their influence to insist that the judges sentence be obeyed richard putnam finally showed a reaction apparently now convinced that his life was in danger he tried to make a deal he hinted about other homicides hed committed offering to reveal specifics and solve murders in other states in exchange for a reduced sentence detectives from numerous states came to question putnam about unsolved disappearances of coeds in the end after they listened in disgust to his explicit descriptions of torture and cannibalism they refused to ask the judge to reduce the sentence there were four stays of execution but finally putnam was shaved placed in an electric chair and exterminated with two thousand volts through his brain chad was with the prodeathsentence advocates in the darkness of a midnight rain outside the prison along with them he held up a sign burn putnam burn i hope old sparky makes you suffer as much as stephanie did the execution occurred on schedule at last after so many years chad felt triumphant vindicated at peace but when he returned to his cockroachinfested oneroom apartment when at three am he drank cheap red wine in victory he blinked in further triumph because stephanies light again appeared to him chads heart thundered he hadnt seen or spoken to her in so many years despite his efforts on her behalf he had thought that she had abandoned him he had never understood why after all she had promised that she would be there whenever he needed to talk to her at the same time she had also demanded that he stop his efforts to punish the monster he had never understood that either but now in horror he did i warned you dad i tried to stop you why didnt you listen im so afraid i got even for you you can finally rest in peace no now it starts again what do you mean hes free hes coming for me dont you remember i told you he doesnt feel emotion except when he kills and now that hes been released he cant wait to do it again hes coming for me but you said youre soaring so brilliantly how can he catch up to you two thousand volts hes like a rocket hes grinning hes reaching out his arms help me daddy you promised based on the note chad left his psychiatrist concluded that chads final act made perfect irrational sense chad bled profusely as he struggled over the barbedwire fence his hands were mangled that didnt matter nor did his fear of heights matter as he climbed the high tower while guards shouted for him to stop all that mattered was that stephanie was in danger what choice did he have except to grasp the highvoltage lines to be struck by twenty thousand volts ten times the power that had launched the biter toward stephanie chads body burst into flames but his agony meant nothing the impetus of his soul meant everything keep speeding sweetheart as fast as you can but ill speed faster the monster wont catch you nothing will hurt you not while i can help it i readily admit that elvis is the most cryptic title ive ever used but i wouldnt change it for the world you see i never got over being on the highschool social committee that was empowered to select and buy the records for the weekend dances as this story indicates in those ancient days there were listening booths in record stores my friends and i could spend all afternoon there if we wanted not playing cds of course that format hadnt been invented vinyl along with elvis was king a lot of you are too young to have heard vinyl i continue to believe it sounds better than cds do or if you have the word probably suggests ips longplaying records the size of pizzas that held a halfdozen songs on each side and turned at thirtythreeandonethird revolutions per minute but there was another vinyl format the small onesongoneachside fortyfive revolutions per minute that gives this story its title as do the revolvers elvis liked to play with the title also refers to a number of a course at a university as in english or presley hey i told you it was cryptic in any case the story was written for a anthology called the king is dead andgave me a chance to experiment with an unusual technique there is no exposition no description i avoided speech tags in the dialogue the story is presented solely in dialogue fragments or in dialoguelike substitutes elvis you want to teach a course on elvis presley elvis presley thats what i was afraid i heard you say do you have a bias against elvis presley not in his proper place on goldenoldie radio when im stuck in traffic fred are you really serious about this this isnt the music department not that i can imagine them offering a course in elvis either musical appreciation of elvis what a joke so how could i justify teaching elvis in the english department the subtlety of the lyrics the poetry of jailhouse rock give me a break the dean would think id lost my mind hed ask me to resign as chair fred you dont look as if im getting my point across not a literature course what a culture course i still dont we already offer victorian culture and nineteenthcentury american culture this would be twentiethcentury american culture fred dont you think youre interpreting culture rather broadly i mean listen to what youre saying elvis presley for gods sake the department would be a laughingstock and for you in particular to want to teach such a course i thats what i mean you said i instead of me perfect grammar youre the only person in the department who speaks as if hes writing an essay for philological quarterly correctness of language wonderful but fred youre hardly the type toyoud sound ridiculous teaching elvis presley youre a little how would the students put it uncool for the topic maybe thats why i want to teach the course high school when i was fifteen what are you talking about if youll stop interrupting me edna ill explain when i was fifteen my high school had a student committee that selected the records for the fridaynight dances after the football and basketball games so its going to be another stroll down memory lane every night at dinner well if im going to have to hear one more story youd better pass me the wine i dont need to tell it edna in that case i have a phone call to make i was the president of the social committee i had three subordinates and every friday after school we went to our favorite record store i thought you said you werent going to tell the story i was wrong i do need to tell it and i still need to make my phone call to peter robinson what makes you think id be calling the two of you seem awfully chummy are you insinuating just drink your wine the record store had soundproofed booths customers were allowed to choose records they were interested in buying and to play the records in the booths each saturday my committee and i fred did anyone ever tell you you talk as if youre lecturing would spent hours playing records there the committee was allowed to buy only two records each week the small ones fortyfives that format had recently been introduced fred i know i remember what fortyfives looked like but we played as many as thirty before we bought our quota of two strange the owner didnt seem to mind to me that booth in the record store felt like fred how can i drink my wine if you dont pass the bottle home ought to be and i never had closer friends than the students on that committee we debated each record with absolute fervor determined to supply the best music possible for the dances i was underweight even then and of course im short and fred is there a point to this story i didnt have a chance to be popular as the football players and basketball players were come to think of it all the members of my committee were i guess you would say geeky like me so we tried to be popular in a different way by controlling the music at the dances other students would have to come up to us and make requests they would have to be nice to us or else we wouldnt play the records they wanted fred of course i never danced i was far too shy the dances were really only the excuse that allowed me to be able to go to the record store after school on fridays i dont think i ever experienced anything as exciting as hearing elvis presley sing dont be cruel in that soundproofed booth i sensed that he was singing directly to me i felt his emotionthe feeling of being picked upon of being an outcast what a revelation what a sense of being privileged to listen to that record before the students at the dance could fred i asked you before does this story have a point since then i dont think ive ever been so happy two hundred and twentyfive students enrolled in the course i must say im gratified i never expected to attract so many elvis presley enthusiasts hes a funnylooking dude isnt he check out the cokebottle glasses and the bow tie as i emphasized on the syllabus that i distributed among you the subjectelvis aron presleymay be misleading to some you may have concluded that this is what you call a freshair course that you can expect high grades for very little work quite the contrary i expect the same intense diligence that my students bring to my courses in semiotics and poststructuralism talks funny our subject is one of those rare individuals who through talent character and coincidence becomes the focus of the major trends in that persons culture in this case a young southern male who adapted black musical themes and techniques making them acceptable to a segregationminded white audience it can be argued that presleys music bridging the division between white and black created a climate in which desegregation was possible similar arguments can be made about presleys contribution to the counterculture of the fifties and the later sexual revolution that sexual revolution sounds interesting i must say my initial instinct was not to let fred teach the course im pleased that i listened to his idea however and needless to say the deans very happy with our increased enrollment would i like another martini by all means these receptions make me thirsty speaking of the dean look at fred over in that corner talking to him lecturing to him is probably more accurate these days all fred can talk about is elvis the poor dean looks like hes afraid theres going to be an examination after the reception freds got elvis on the brain and im one of the few people i ever met who saw elviss first television appearance no i dont mean the ed sullivan show everyone knows about that and sullivans insistence that elvis not wiggle his hips when he sang that the camera focus on elvis only from the waist up the incident is a perfect example of the cultural and sexual repression that elvis overcame what im talking about is an earlier television show when jackie gleason went on summer hiatus the dorsey brothers filled in for him and it was the dorsey brothers who introduced elvis gyrating hips and all to viewers most of them unfamiliar with rock and roll and most of them burdened by conventions wigglin his ass why i never saw any thin like ought to be a law the mans no better than a pervert and look at that long hair what is he a man or a woman every time he jerks his head back and forth his hair falls into his eyes them sideburns is butt ugly now hes wigglin his pa you know what they call him dont you elvis the pelvis shut your pie hole fred go to your room and study i dont want you watchin this junk its difficult to overstate the importance of elviss appearance with the dorsey brothers those who hadnt seen his performance were told about it and enhanced it with their own imagination a phenomenon was about to professor please wait until the end of my lecture but i just want to say dont you think its ironic that elvis was introduced on television by musicians who seemed as outdated to elviss generation as elvis seems to the metallica generation is that a question or a statement i was just thinking maybe some day somebodyll offer a course on metallica har har fred enough is enough its three in the morning i cant sleep with that noise youre making how many times do i have to hear all shook up the neighbors will start complaining there i told you thats probably one of them phoning right now look at the sideburns freds trying to grow they remind me of caterpillars as bald as he is thats the only place he can grow hair those blue suede shoes dont do anything for him either the next thing you know hell be taking guitar lessons and boring us with concerts instead of lectures or making us read that book hes writing the corruption of a legend chapter sixthe crucial demarcation in elviss career occurred in when he was drafted by the united states military and sent to germany to paraphrase a lyric from one of his bestknown songs thats when the downfall begins the episode is rife with implications politically the government has proven itself stronger than the rebel sexually the sheering of presleys magnificent ducktailstyle hair symbolizes societys disapproval and conquest of his virility a metaphorical emasculation two years of military indoctrination have their effect elviss longawaited return to society is shocking the constant sneer with which he signaled to his young audience his disdain for authority has been replaced by an eagertoplease grin his yes sir no sir manner earlier had the hidden insolent tone of a black servant who is hypocritically polite to his white employers but now elvis seems genuinely determined to suck up to the establishment even his newly grown hair appears flaccid if we discount the regional southern hits that elvis had from to it is clear that his astonishing career remained pure for only two years for rebellious millionselling records from to after the military interruption the hits continued but the selfmocking my way is afar cry from the innocence of hound dog he did it his way all right he became a tool of the establishment fred the jordinaires were shunted aside instead of a small rhythmandblues section he now had the equivalent of the mormon tabernacle choir fred the songs lost all pretense of substance that wretched remake of o solo mio for example which was called its now or never sounded so muzaksweet its a wonder his audience didnt die from sugar shock fred you havent shut up since we started dinner its been forty minutes im sick of hearing you talk about elvis in fact im sick of hearing you period im certain the robinsons would like a chance to get a word in oh im terribly sorry i must have gotten carried away good gracious what was i thinking by the way mrs robinson did you know that your husband peter here is fucking my wife thirtythree wretched movies word is our prof is getting a divorce each more insipid than the previous ones increasingly their only theme seems to be that its audience should take a vacation at las vegas fort lauderdale acapulco hawaii or wherever the film is set as if elvis has become a travel agent or a chamber of commerce booster maybe his wife isnt an elvis fan las vegas that symbol of excess becomes synonymous with the decay within elvis his antiestablishment zootsuit appearance in the midfifties changes to a parody of bikers leather after his return from the military and finally to sequined suits with capes that rival liberace for ostentation when elvis reappears on television in he looks like the vegas act that hell soon become i hear the today show is coming to do a story about him nine years later hell die on the toilet professor hopkins what made you think that elvis would be a proper subject for a university course if you look closely at him he represents america what professor im afraid i dont follow you bryant ican you hear me yes the remote transmission is coming through clearly bryant you take a boy who was raised to sing gospel music at his pentecostal church a boy who worshiped his mother a boy who from all accounts ought to have blended with the establishment but who instead chose to fight the establishment he was only nineteen when he made his first recording for sam phillips in memphis and its hard to imagine that someone so young could have been such a significant force in cultural change by making black music popular he promoted racial understanding and was easily as important in the civil rights movement as martin luther king jr professor hopkins in terms of the sexual revolution he professor hopkins your remark about elvis the civil rights movement and martin luther king jr dont you think thats somewhat overstated nothing about elvis can be overstated for a brief moment in the middle of this century he changed this century professor hopkins but the messenger became the victim society fought back society defeated him just as elvis symbolized the rebel so he eventually symbolized the vindictiveness and viciousness of american society when he died on the toilet a drug addict a glutton bloated wearing diapers he delivered his final message by showing how destructive capitalism is professor hopkins in effect hed already been dead a long while and graceland that garish monument to decadence was the mausoleum for his walking corpse professor hopkins im afraid were almost out of time i wore this sequined suit and cape today because in elviss perverted image there must be retribution you see this revolver for gods sake professor one of the most publicized events in elviss life is the incident in which he shot the picture tube of a television set form without substance even in his drugdemented stupor he knew that television was his enemy just as television is the enemy the manipulator and destroyer of the american people and proper values in elviss name shot the lens on the television camera being used for the remote broadcast of the today show shot and killed the remote segments producer shot several students whom hed brought to the interview as representative of the other students in his course went to the english department office and shot his chairman went to the university administration building and shot his dean went to his former home and shot his estranged wife along with a friend peter robinson who was visiting her and finally went to a downtown record store where he clutched an armful of elvis cds put his pistol to his head shouted wheres the booth never been so happy long live rock and roll and blew his brains out a note in his sequined suit coat pocket said simply all shook up officials continue to investigate one of the worst mass murders to take place at an american university this has been an nbc news update due to its live coverage of what have been called the elvis murders the today show last week received its highest ratings in two years a tv movie has been announced later in this book youll read about the negative side of the film and television industry in contrast the background to the script for habitat was my most positive hollywood experience i put hollywood in quotes because the company that produced this script was in fact located in new york city just down the street from the flatiron building the companys name was laurel entertainment its two main executives were richard rubenstein and mitchell galin and their two main products apart from occasional films such as stephen kings creepshow were the fantasy and horror tv programs tales from the darkside and monsters during the late s fans of twilight zone type stories made these halfhour series popular on latenight syndicated tv periodically richard and mitchell asked me to write a script for monsters but i had trouble complying because i couldnt imagine a story that would fit the shows strictly controlled budgetary requirement of very few characters and sets meanwhile theyd hired me to do a screen adaptation of michael palmers medical thriller the sisterhood as so often happens in the film business the project never got further than the development stage but in the process richard and mitchell showed me remarkable courtesy id been on the road for several weeks promoting a new novel when i returned home exhausted i received a call from them suggesting various dates when we could get together to discuss revisions on the script the way this normally works the writer being low in the food chain goes to the producers always but when richard and mitchell realized how tired i was they immediately proposed that they would fly to iowa city where i then lived to have the script discussions at my home find they actually did i cant tell you how floored i was and how impressed i was by these two gentlemen as we sat on my back porch tweaking the script in finally had an idea that i thought would work for the limited budget of monsters if a few characters were good a solitary character would be better i decided to my surprise the script was in production two months after i submitted it the actress lili taylor six feet under portrayedjamie neal habitat fade in int control room day we open with a large vivid image of a moonscape barren weathered mountains waterless river beds forbidding crevasses and canyons rocky gray and dismal we might be fooled for a moment but quickly realize that this is not the real thing instead a huge mural we hear a persistent electronic beep as we pan down from the image of the bleak terrain we see a model of a lunar habitat domed with arched corridors that lead to other buildings the model is on a metal table along with the mural it gives us the impression were in a complex on the moon lingering on the model of the habitat we hear a further sound its out of place surprising a guitar being tuned and abruptly the guitar begins strumming a womans lilting voice begins singing a folk song about oceans and forests and how the earth and the sky belong to you and me we pan away from the habitat and discover that were in a control room with electronic consoles and glowing lights on monitors the beep we first heard is like a metronome that supplies the beat for the guitar and the womans song we track past the consoles and stop on the singer a woman late twenties wearing jeans and a lakers sweatshirt her hair in a ponytail shes lithe and lovely leaning back on a metal chair with her bare feet on a counter next to a console her name is jamie neal she reminds us of a cheerleader grown up to be a graduate student in a college dorm her eyes are closed in a world of her own she continues strumming singing her voice muted tinged with melancholy yes the earth and the sky belong to us all midway through a poignant line about a fertile majestic land she hesitates her strum becoming irregular her voice drops relentless the electronic beep persists jamie sighs lowers the guitar opens her eyes and scans the control room perhaps she expected the song to transport her magically to the glorious landscapes she sang about if so the spell didnt work despondent she sets the guitar next to a monitor rises sadly from the chair and approaches the mural of the moon the barren mountains and canyons look even more forbidding she studies the model of the habitat then squints toward the electronic equipment around her tense as if shes in prison with a sigh she raises her head musters her thoughts and starts talking but as weve seen theres no one else in the room the initial effect is puzzling disorienting jamie i dont know if im supposed to say this i mean for all i know this isnt what you want to hearif youre listening the electronic beep continues she cocks her head frowning jamie i wish youd turn that she gestures in frustration noise off you cant imagine how she gestures again annoying it is she exhales if youre listening she pivots from the model and approaches a computer jamie but of course youre listening you hear every breath i take my heartbeat the alpha waves in my brain the sounds i make when i need to relieve my she hugs her chest embarrassed do i snore her eyes become bitter i had a fiancee once good old whatshisname he wanted a corporate wife translation he wanted me to be obedient to conform wear the right clothes say the right things advance his career he said i was too independent i always suspected he broke the engagement chuckles because i snored even asleep i had to conform i couldnt ever let my guard down stares at the ceiling so do i snore all we hear is the beep jamie come on she glares you can tell me she looks all around her you know me better than he ever did you and i were closer than yin and yangice cream and peanuts laurel and hardycloser than my mother and father ever were so tell me do i snore the beep continues but the room seems terribly silent she hugs her arms again jamie just talk to me beep jamie look i know we agreed but unclasping her arms she lowers a hand to her guitar and strums it jamie teasing just once just one word just hello just to let me know youre out there she smiles her best smile no answer the beep persists she sags against a console jamie okay so we made a bargain no contact no a frustrated gesture communication a fatalistic shrug which reminds me of whatever his name was i hope the ceramic doll he married divorces him because a grin the secret i never told him was that he snored beep she stares at the floor jamie just one hello she turns and frowns toward a section of wall thats recessed theres a glowing box above it and a door jamie see im trembles a little clutches her arms after all this time shuts her eyes scared she frowns harder toward the door jamie does that mean i failed lord i hope so please stop this please say hello and please unseal the hatch please let me out beep jamie the forests are my land the rivers are no theyre not anybodys exceptwhatevers inplease dont make me do it again dont make me go in there i know i agreed i signed your damned contract nine months in here in exchange for flinches but all the money you promised doesnt matter now keep it just say hello then tell me i dont have to go in there again im not trembling alone cant you talk to me cant we discuss whats happening to me dont you understand i dont care about the money anymore i want out she spins toward the mural of the moon glaring she grabs the model of the habitat and throws it across the room its glass and metal shatter jamie home i want to go home i want to see people breathe fresh air again eat chocolate cake walk barefoot in grass smile at the stars i want to be her shoulders sag in despair she rubs her forehead jamie free she gazes up hoping no response beep jamie her voice drops free she stoops to pick up sections of the model she destroyed jamie i never understood what that meant before suddenly animated she crushes the remnants of the model and hurls them away they crash against the consoles jamie angry but you wont release me from our contract will you this is what you wanted isnt it to watch me fall apart paces you think youre so clever no way what you dont realize is you made a mistake you didnt tell me it would be here with me gestures in fury toward the door full disclosure ever heard of it you didnt tell me everything you held back crucial information and one thing i learned from my fiancee whatever his name was is a contract demands good faith another furious gesture toward the door and that thing in there is definitely not good faith what kind of monsters are you let me out of here jamie storms toward a bare wall the only one in the room and pounds on it in desperation jamie null and void you hear me the contracts i want to be free abruptly a siren wails jamie flinches and covers her ears the siren keeps shrieking jamie no please im sorry i didnt mean it the siren persists beneath it the beep continues jamie sinks to her knees still clutching her ears jamie im sorry dont please stop the cringing from the sirens wail ill do it yes whatever you want whatever i promised if only stop the forget what i said tears trickle ill keep my word ill obey the contract whatever you want she shudders in pain ill do it the siren begins to diminish its wail less torturing jamie eases her hands from her ears testing the threat as the wail becomes fainter she shudders again and slowly relaxes jamie thank you i will ill do it presses her hands together as if in prayer thank you thank you wiping tears from her eyes she struggles to stand unsteady she again surveys the control room the siren has finally stopped but the beep continues jamie as if hypnotized to the rhythm of the beep the oceans and the forests the earth and the sky belong to faltering god help me the siren blares a shrill attentiongetter she stiffens and glares toward the ceiling jamie i told you i promised with a frightened glance toward the door she shuffles toward a section of the control room that we havent seen there she reaches a treadmill breathes deeply and straps what looks like a bloodpressure cuff to each arm wires lead out of the cuff to a monitor nervous she glances toward the door jamie if youd just been honestif youd only prepared me the siren warns her jamie cowers jamie i know i know i hear you but why wont you talk to me with a frantic gaze she studies the ceiling no answer distraught she steps on the treadmill and pushes a button the treadmill begins to move beneath her she starts to walk close up on the monitor to which her cuffs and wires are attached like an ekg it shows flashing red numbersblood pressure pulse and other numbers that we dont understand jamie walks in place the treadmill moving beneath her a whistle blows jamie presses another number on the treadmill the treadmill moves faster the monitors numbers increase jamie paces increasingly faster and begins to recite jamie my name is jamie neal im an assistant professor of deepspace psychology the whistle blows again flinching jamie presses another number on the controls the treadmill moves faster she hastens her pace the flashing red numbers go higher despite the effort of her increased pace jamie continues reciting jamie specialty adaptation to confinement reactions to a limited environment potential aberrant behavior caused by the stress of when the whistle shrills again jamie presses another number on the treadmills console shes forced to pace even faster jamie claustrophobia sweat beads on her brow jamie five rooms two here in this central unit a nervous glance toward the door three others an entrance bay a solar power station and sleeping quarters linked to this central unit by corridors swallows wipes sweat from her brow but i cant reach my sleeping quarters an even more nervous glance toward the door unless i pass through there another shrill whistle jamie hurriedly presses another button as the treadmill increases speed shes almost forced to run jamie and we all know whats in there she shudders jamie you bet for sure we all know what i have to face in there out of breath after youve made me fulfill my bargain the flashing red numbers on the monitor go higher jamies running now jamie after youve put me through my paces for today wipes sweat from her brow or is this yesterday i dont know anymore isnt that what you want to find out how much stress can someone take on the monitor the red numbers flash as if out of control instead of the whistle the siren once again blares breathing rapidly jamie presses another number on the treadmills console her pace decreases nervous but relieved she presses more numbers reducing her speed until the treadmill stops and she steps off at once after raising her lakers sweatshirt to wipe her face she stares toward the ceiling then the door in apprehension jamie my name is jamie neal im twenty eight ive been herei thinkfor sixtyfour days i think why didnt you give me windows i want to see paws at a wall the stars the sun sets even here not on the schedule im used to but i could get used to that schedule and id love to see it after sixtyfour days she squints toward the ceiling jamie or nights how can i know if only i could see i bet the sunsetno smog herethe colors must be her voice drops i remembercrimsonlike a flowera rosein blossom melancholy beautiful in a sudden rage she kicks the remnants of the habitats model she earlier crushed jamie never mind windows why didnt you give me she spins toward the numerous consoles jamie computers temperature gauges pressure readouts oxygen monitors humidity gravity even dust i can measure everything except the single most precious thing in my life she slumps against a table jamie time maybe its only sixtythree days or maybe sixtynine or maybe ive been here only a couple of weeks but it feels like despairing eternity beep jamie why didnt you at least allow me to wear a watch she gestures frantically toward the consoles jamie or let me have a clock nothing fancy no digital astrotime calculator no computerized stardate monitor with comparative readouts for here and home and the gemini galaxy and just a plain oldfashioned clock makes a twisting motion with one hand pretending to hold an object in the other the kind you wind up at night and it ticks and the hands go around and if you want to wake up at a certain hour you set the alarm and when it rings you know its tomorrow and if you make a mark pretends she has a pencil on a page every time the alarm goes offand if you count the marks youre sure how many days youve been here you dont feel as if youre slumps against the wall going crazy is that the point of the test how would i react not if but when i broke down because of she stares in horror toward the door jamie time the siren wails jamie no a second wail jamie please dont make me go in there again a third wail tears stream down jamies face a fourth wail jamie walks toward the door as if hypnotized jamie fulfill my contract obey my orders jamies point of viewapproaching the door jamie go through my paces she pauses off stage we hear the hiss of the door sliding open we zoom toward a closeup of jamies face contorted apprehensive horrified jamie time yes again time the door has slid open beyond it we see a corridor but as if this is alice in wonderland the corridor narrows and becomes lower the beep persists jamie time she feels her pulse jamie the beat of my heart the only time i know she takes a walkmansized object from a counter straps it around her wrist stares at a suction cup at the end of the object and reaches beneath her lakers sweatshirt apparently attaching the suction cup to her chest at once the beep becomes a little faster as if the object on her wrist monitors the speed of her heart jamie the constant motion of time except that its meaningless without something to compare it towithout something to appreciate without a sunrise i could imagine a sunrise ifwhy didnt you give me a watch the siren wails jamie flinches clutches her fists in fury and glares at the ceiling jamie all right im going the beep that measures her heartrate increases she shifts through the doorway the roof is low enough that shes forced to stoop now the walls narrow until they touch her shoulders the beep gains a little more speed jamie walking stooped glaring up what i want to know is when my heart beats faster does that mean im getting older swallows staring at the crawlspace would sixtynine days that feel like sixtythree daysor however long ive been here actually be the equivalent of a hundred and twenty days six months the nine months youre paying me to stay here because time drags the lowering ceiling compels her to kneel the narrowing walls squeeze her shoulders theres a crawlspace directly ahead jamie shudders the beep increases jamie but my heart feels like its on rocket fuel speed does the speed of my heart affect time have i been here the ceiling is now so low that shes forced to drop to her hands and knees jamie forever she places a hand toward the crawlspace about to insert her head trembles hesitates and the siren wails jamie give me a break i told you im going i just need a minute to abruptly the door hisses shut behind her she whirls the beep increases speed and something sizzles the hum and crackle of electrical current she flinches in agony raising one hand then another trying to push herself off the floor but the ceilings so low she cant raise her back she jerks one knee then the other off the floor desperate to minimize contact with the crackling electrical current jamie no please stop im going promise she scurries into the crawlspace at once the crackling current stops her face is contorted with pain as she sprawls on her stomach the crawlspace is so small it reminds us of an airconditioning duct she breathes heavily exhausted by the electrical current slumping in relief jamie no more this cant go on forever a sigh of despair jamie or maybe this is hell she crawls awkwardly wincing bumping her head on the ceiling scraping her shoulders against the tight walls jamie maybe you never meant to keep your word maybe youre just playing with me are you enjoying this putting me through my paces watching the way i react am i just some kind of just a cruel sadistic game to you with effort jamie reaches the end of the crawlspace and squirms toward another compartment her brow is moist her elbows and knees are dirty the shoulders of her sweatshirt are frayed and grimy she musters strength and struggles to standwaversleans against a wall wiping sweat from her forehead she stares ahead what she sees makes her close her eyes in despair she reopens them squinting her voice cracks jamie why did you no you broke the bargain again you changed the rules you the beep increases with a sob she struggles not to sink to the floor jamie its not the same why do you keep changing the now we see the room jamie has entered its completely bare more important the floor tilts upward severely jamie not the same not the same a siren wails jamie i hear it you she staggers forward reaches the incline attempts to climb it while standing but falls to her stomach and claws her way toward the top jamie my name is jamie neal claws upward i think claws upward im twentyeight claws upward i think claws upward going on a hundred claws upward im an assistant professor of jamie hesitates nods in fierce resolve and continues crawling higher jamie deepspace jamie hesitates again shakes her head in confusion jamie psychology i think my specialty is she reaches the crest and slumps across it head on one side legs on the other jamie adaptation to confinement how long dear god how long the siren blares jamie raises her weary head her determined eyes glare toward the ceiling jamie i need to rest again we hear the sizzle and crackle of electrical current jamie screams the beep increases she strains to raise her body off the painful torturing peak of the slope in a frenzy she topples over the rim on the opposite side she tumbles groaning down a slope she lands hard on a level surface she struggles for breath kneels and manages to stand jamie my name is jamie neal im twentyeight im an assistant professor ofim a human being and no matter how much you break your word no matter how much you torture me ill fight back i swear it ill fight back the siren wails jamie flinches the beep increases but she stays in place abruptly the current crackles and sizzles and as if thrust by a cattle prod she lurches forward the beep becomes even more rapid jamie you broke your word ill break mine more crackling and sizzling her face contorted with agony jamie stumbles across an open space and reaches a metal ladder prodded by the sizzling electrical current she scurries upward jamie jamie neal jamie neal jamie neal she disappears through a circle in the ceiling above the ladder the sizzling stops as jamie topples from the ladder and lands hard in another area groaning she slowly raises her head squints shakes her head to clear her vision jamie seeking refuge in her song the oceans and the forests the earth and the sky belong to you and me the room is filled with mirrors like a fun house in an amusement park jamie you changed it again with enormous effort she stands the beep increases jamie its all a lie you never meant to she struggles forward glaring toward the mirrors each reveals a different image shes fat shes thin shes tall shes short shes twisted concave convex jamie now im the one whos a monster youve turned me into recoils from the mirrors you ill get even i swear ill get even off stage we hear a hiss jamie spins in terror the beep even faster a door slides open a shadow fills the entrance jamie cringes the shadow becomes awhat to call itnot humanmisshapen with ganglia and boils and several eyes monster voice distorted an electronic simulation youve done very well today youve been especially adaptiveand especially amusing youve earned your reward the monster raises a flat box monster your nourishment just the way you prefer it with double cheese and black olives jamie im allergic to black olives the monsters grotesque arm sags monster im sorry im new at this facility i was told that your species craves those foods jamie straightens braces her shoulders inhales and glowers the beep becomes very rapid jamie and i told you id fight back you broke your bargain now ill break mine monster theres nothing you can do this is the way things are you have one more task to perform before you can eat suddenly horizontal rays of light fill the space between them the rays are like transparent multicolored poles in a grotesque climbing gym they crackle and hiss with electrical current jamie looks more angry jamie im jamie neal monster we know jamie crawls under one of the rays a portion of it touches her back and shocks her groaning she stands she squeezes between two other rays but comes too close and again gets shocked jamie im a human being monster we know that also jamie wrong you dont have the faintest idea watch me prove it she braces herself and walks straight into the remaining rays electricity jolting her as the crackle becomes unbearable she takes slow agonized determined steps plodding toward her captor blisters appear on her face emerging from the rays she staggers toward the monster grabs the box hurls it angrily away wavers then falls to the floor close up on her burned bleeding hand as it twitches then becomes motionless the frantic beep stops the monster stares down in bewilderment a section of the ceiling slides away revealing another monster monster distorted voice how unfortunate she was particularly entertaining monster after all this timei still dont understand their emotions but lowers his head i suspect that im feelingwhat do they call it monster grief monster yes an unusual emotion the experiment failed monster not totally we learned something monster what monster when we scanned her mind we learned that her species kept rodentlike creatureshamstersin similar cages what they called habitats apparently her kind were hypocrites they enjoyed havingbut didnt likein fact they loathedbeing pets fade out few writers have been as prolific as stirling silliphant whose literate yet actionfilled scripts for the classic tv series route made me want to be a writer over the decades we became friends indeed thanks to his urging nbc produced a miniseries of my novel the brotherhood of the rose a pleasant stocky man with sandy hair a boyish smile and a wonderful tenor voice he was when i last saw him during our final dinner together he confided in me that he was being offered fewer and fewer writing assignments in a youthoriented industry im perceived as too old he told me it didnt matter that he had received an academy award for s in the heat of the night or that his script for s charly had given cliff robertson the opportunity to deliver an oscarwinning performance or that stirling had written some of the most financially successful movies of the s the poseidon adventure and the towering inferno fill the industry cared about was the young new flavor of the month in fact most of the executives with whom stirling had meetings were so young in their midtwenties that they had never seen in the heat of the night charly or the towering inferno as for route the series had been on tv so long ago that it was rerun as a nostalgia series on nick at nite hardly the with it factor that executives worship the intelligence of the industry had so declined that stirlings agent advised him not to take a complete list of his credits to a studio interview because a the executive wouldnt believe that anyone could write that much and b the executive would feel intimidated stirling eventually decided to chuck it all and move to thailand where he believed that in a past incarnation he had been an oriental he had what he called a beverly hills garage sale relocated to bangkok and became a buddhist we exchanged letters and tried to make plans for me to visit him but something always interfered in at the age of he died from prostate cancer front man tell me that again i said he must have been joking mort you know what its like at the networks these days my agent sighed cost cutting layoffs executives so young they think seinfeld is nostalgia he wasnt joking hes willing to take a meeting with you but hes barely seen your work and he wants a list of your credits all two hundred and ninety of them steve i like to think im not vain but how can this guy be in charge of series development and not know what ive written this conversation was on the phone midweek midafternoon id been revising computer printouts of what id written in the morning but frustration at what steve had told me made me press my pencil down so hard i broke its tip rising from my desk i clutched the phone tighter steve hesitated before he replied no argument you and i know how much you contributed to television the golden age playhouse kraft theater alcoa presents you and rod serling and paddy chayefsky practically invented tv drama but that was then this executive just started his job three months ago hes only twentyeight for christs sake hes been clawing his way to network power since he graduated from business school he doesnt actually watch television hes too damned busy to watch it except for current inhouse projects what he does is program check the ratings and read the trades if youd won your emmys for something this season he might be impressed but the sidewalks of new york thats something they show on nickelodeon cable reruns a company he doesnt work for so what does he care i stared out my study window from my home on top of the hollywood hills i had a view of rushing traffic on smoggy sunset boulevard of spago tower records and chateau marmont but at the moment i saw none of them indignation blinding me steve am i nuts or are the scripts i sent you good dont put yourself down theyre better than good they dont only grab me theyre fucking smart i believe them and i cant say that for he named a current hit series about a female detective that made him a fortune in commissions but was twothirds tits and ass and onethird car chases so whats the real problem i asked unable to suppress the stridency in my voice why cant i get any work the truth since when did i tolerate lies you wont get pissed off i will get pissed off if all right already the truth is it doesnt matter how well you write the fact is youre too old the networks think youre out of touch with their demographics out of you promised you wouldnt get pissed off but after i shifted from television i won an oscar for the dead of noon twenty years ago to the networks thats like the dark ages you know the axiom what have you done for us lately the fact is mort for the past two years youve been out of town out of the country out of the goddamn industry my tear ducts ached my hurried breathing made me dizzy i had a good reason the most important reason absolutely steve said in your place id have done the same and your friends respect that reason but the movers and shakers the new regime that doesnt give a shit about tradition they think you died or retired if they give you a moments thought at all then isnt now to them last weeks ratings are ancient history whats next they want to know whats new they keep asking what they really mean is whats young that sucks of course but young viewers are loose with their dough my friend and advertisers pay the bills so the bottom line is the networks feel unless youre under thirtyfive or better yet under thirty you cant communicate with their target audience its an uphill grind for writers like you of a certain age no matter your talent swell my knuckles ached as i squeezed the phone so what do i do throw my word processor out the window and collect on my writers guild pension its not as bad as that but bear in mind your pension is the highest any guild member ever accumulated but if i retire ill die like no what im saying is be patient with this network kid he needs a little educating politely you understand just pitch your idea look confident and dependable show him your credits hell come around its not as if you havent been down this path before when i was in my twenties there you go you identify with this kid already youre in his mind my voice dropped whens the meeting friday his office i pulled in some favors to get you in so soon four pm ill be at my house in malibu call me when youre through steve yeah mort thanks for sticking with me hey its an honor to me youre a legend what i need to be is a working legend ive done what i can now its up to you sure i set down the phone discovered i still had my broken pencil in one hand dropped it and massaged the aching knuckles of my other hand the reason id left l a two years ago at the age of sixtyeight was that my dear wife doris my best friend my cleverest editor my exclusive lover had contracted a rare form of leukemia as her strength had waned as her sacred body had gradually failed to obey her splendid mind id disrupted my workaholics habit of writing every day and acted as her constant attendant wed traveled to every major cancer research center in the united states wed gone to specialists in europe wed stayed in europe because their hospice system is humane about painrelieving drugs wed gotten as far as sweden where doris had died and now struggling with grief id returned to my career what other meaning did i have it was either kill myself or write so i wrote and wrote even faster than in my prime when id contributed every episode in the fouryear run of the sidewalks of new york and now a network yuppie bastard with the cultural memory of a fouryearold had asked for my credits before i gulped a stiff shot of scotch i vowed id show this town that this old fuck still had more juice than when id first started century city every week you see those monoliths of power behind the credits on this seasons hit lawyer show but i remembered bitterly nostalgic when the land those skyscrapers stood upon had been the back lot for twentiethcentury fox i parked my leased audi on the second level of an underground garage and took an elevator to the seventeenth floor of one of the buildings the networks reception room was wide and lofty with plentiful leather couches where actors writers and producers made hurried phone calls to agents and assistants while they waited to be admitted to the holy of holies i stopped before a young attractive woman at a desk thin no bra presumably she wanted to be an actress and was biding her time waiting for the right connections she finished talking to one of three phones and studied me her boredom tempered by the fear that if she wasnt respectful she might lose a chance to make an important contact im not badlooking although seventy i keep in shape sure my hairs receding i have wrinkles around my eyes but my familys genes are spectacular i look ten years younger than i am especially when im tanned as i was after recent daily halfhour laps in my swimming pool my voice has the resonance of ed mcmahons mort davidson to see arthur lewis ive got a four oclock appointment the wouldbeactress receptionist scanned a list of course youre expected unfortunately mr lewis has been detained if youll please wait over there she pointed toward a couch and picked up a judith krantz novel evidently shed decided that i couldnt promote her career so i waited and waited an hour later the receptionist gestured for me to come over miracle of miracles arthur lewis was ready to see me he wore an armani linen suit fashionably wrinkled no tie gucci loafers no socks his skin was the color of bronze his thick curly black hair had a calculated windblown look photographs of his blonde wife and infant daughter stood on his glasstopped desk his wife seemed even younger and thinner than he was posters of various current hit series hung on the wall a tennis racket was propped in a corner its an honor to meet you im a fan of everything youve done he lied i made an appropriate humble comment his next remark contradicted what hed just said did you bring a list of your credits i gave him a folder and sat on a leather chair across from him while he flipped through the pages his expression communicated a mixture of boredom and stoic endurance finally his eyebrows narrowed impressive i might add astonishing really its hard to imagine anyone writing this much well ive been in the business quite a while yes you certainly have i couldnt tell if he referred to my age or my numerous credits there used to be a joke i said oh his eyes were expressionless how can mort davidson be so prolific this was back in the early sixties the answer was he uses an electric typewriter very amusing he said as if id farted these days of course i use a word processor of course he folded his hands on the desk and sat straighter so your agent said you had an idea that might appeal to us thats right the phone rang excuse me a moment he picked up the phone obviously if hed been genuinely interested in my pitch hed have instructed his secretary that he didnt want any calls an actor named sid was important enough for arthur lewis to gush with compliments and by all means sid shouldnt worry about the rewrites that would make his character more with it in todays generation the writer in charge of the project was under orders to deliver the changes by monday morning if he didnt that writer would never again work on something called the goodtime guys sid was a helluva talent arthur lewis assured him next weeks episode would get a ratings share at least arthur chuckled at a joke set down the phone and narrowed his eyebrows again so your idea that you think we might like he glanced at his rolex its about an atrisk youth center a place where troubled kids can go and get away from their screwedup families the gangs and the drug dealers on the streets theres a center in the valley that i see as our model an old victorian house that has several additions each week wed deal with a special problem teenage pregnancy substance abuse runaways but mostly this would be a series about emotions about people the kids but also the staff a wide range of interesting committed professionals an elderly administrator a female social worker an hispanic who used to be in the gangs a priest whatever mix works i call it the phone rang again just a second arthur lewis said another grin a producer this time a series about a college sorority next to a fraternity crazy u had just become this seasons new hit arthur lewis was giving its cast and executives a party at le dome tomorrow evening yes he guaranteed ten cases of dom perignon would arrive at the producers home before the party and beluga caviar enough for an afterparty power party no problem and yes arthur lewis was having the same frustrations as the producer it was mighty damned hard to find a preschool for gifted children he set down the phone his face turned to stone so thats your idea drama significance emotion action and realism but whats the hook i shook my head in astonishment why would anyone want to watch it arthur lewis asked to feel what its like to help kids in trouble to understand those kids didnt you have a stroke a while ago what i believe in honesty so ill be direct you put in your time you paid your dues so why dont you back away gracefully i didnt have a stroke then why did i hear my wife had cancer she died i caught my breath six months ago i see im sorry i mean that sincerely but television isnt the same as when you created he checked my list of credits the sidewalks of new york a definite classic one of my absolute personal favorites but times have changed the industrys a lot more competitive the pressures unbelievable a series creator has to act as one of the producers to oversee the product to guarantee consistency im talking thirteen hours a day minimum and ideally the creator ought to contribute something to every script thats what i did on the sidewalks of new york oh arthur lewis looked blank i guess i didnt notice that in your credits he straightened but my points the same televisions a pressure cooker a game for people with energy did i need a wheelchair when i came in here youve lost me energys not my problem im full to bursting with the need to work what matters is what do you think of my idea its the phone rang arthur lewis looked relieved let me get back to you of course i know youre busy thanks for your time hey anytime im always here and ready for new ideas again he checked his rolex the phone kept ringing take care he said you too i took my list of credits off his desk the last thing i heard when i left was no that old fucks wrong for the part hes losing his hair a rug get real the audience can tell the difference for gods sake a hairpiece is death in the ratings steve had said to phone him when the meeting was over but i felt so upset i decided to hell with phoning him and drove up the pacific coast highway toward his place in malibu traffic was terrible rush hour friday evening for once though it had an advantage after an hour my anger began to abate enough for me to realize that i wouldnt accomplish much by showing up unexpectedly in a fit at steves hed been loyal he didnt need my aggravation as hed told me ive done what i can now its up to you but there wasnt much i could do if my age and not my talent was how i was judged certainly that wasnt steves fault so i stopped at something called the pacific coast diner and took the advice of a bumper sticker on a car id been stuck behindchill out maybe a few drinks and a meditative dinner would calm me down the restaurant had umbrellatopped tables on a balcony that looked toward the ocean i had to wait a half hour but a scotch and soda made the time go quickly and the crimson reflection of the setting sun on the ocean was spectacular or would have been if id been paying attention the truth was i couldnt stop being upset i had another scotch and soda ordered poached salmon tried to enjoy my meal and suddenly couldnt swallow suddenly felt about as lonely as id felt since doris had died maybe the network executives are right i thought maybe i am too old maybe i dont know how to relate to a young audience maybe its time i packed it in mort davidson a voice said excuse me i blinked distracted from my thoughts my waiter was holding the credit card id given him mort davidson he looked at the name on the card then at me the screenwriter i spared him a bitter used to be and nodded with what i hoped was a pleasant manner wow he was tall and thin with sandy hair and a glowing tan his blue eyes glinted he had the sort of chiseled handsome face that made me think he was yet another wouldbe actor he looked to be about twentythree when i saw your name i thought no it couldnt be who knows how many mort davidsons there are the odds against this being but it is you the screenwriter guilty i managed to joke i bet ive seen everything you ever wrote i must have watched the dead of noon twentyfive times i really learned a lot oh i was puzzled what would my screenplay have taught him about acting about structure about pace about not being afraid to let the characters talk thats whats wrong with movies today the characters dont have anything important to say at once it hit me he wasnt a wouldbe actor im a writer he said or trying to be i mean ive still got a lot to learn that im working here proves it the glint went out of his eyes i still havent sold anything his enthusiasm was forced but hey nothing important is easy ill just keep writing until i crack the market the boss isid better not keep chattering at you he doesnt like it for sure youve got better things to do than listen to me i just wanted to say how much i like your work mr davidson ill bring your credit card right back its a pleasure to meet you as he left it struck me that the speed with which he talked suggested not only energy but insecurity for all his good looks he felt like a loser or maybe i was just transferring my own emotions onto him this much was definite getting a compliment was a hell of a lot better than a sharp stick in the eye or the meeting id endured when he came back with my credit card i signed the bill and gave him a generous tip thanks mr davidson hang in there youve got one important thing on your side whats that youre young youve got plenty of time to make it unless i wondered what he meant unless i dont have what it takes well the best advice i can give you is never doubt yourself as i left the restaurant and passed beneath hissing arc lamps toward my car i couldnt ignore the irony the waiter had youth but doubted his ability i had confidence in my ability but was penalized because of my age despite the roar of traffic on the pacific coast highway i heard waves on the beach and thats when the notion came to me a practical joke of sorts like stories you hear about frustrated writers submitting oscarwinning screenplays casablanca for example but the frustrated writers change the title and the characters names the notes they get back from producers as much as say that the screenplays are the lousiest junk the producers ever read so then the frustrated writers tell the trade papers what theyve done the point being that the writers are trying to prove it doesnt matter how good a writer you are if you dont have connections why not i thought it would be worth seeing the look on those bastards faces whats your name ric potter short for richard no for eric i nodded breakingtheice conversation the reason i came back is i have something i want to discuss with you a way that might help your career his eyes brightened at once they darkened as if he thought i might be trying to pick him up strictly business i said heres my card if you want to talk about writing and how to make some money give me a call his suspicion persisted but his curiosity was stronger what time eleven tomorrow fine thats before my shift starts come over bring some of your scripts that was important i had to find out if he could write or if he was fooling himself my scheme wouldnt work unless he had a basic feel for the business so the next morning when he arrived exactly on time at my home in the hills above west hollywood we swapped i let him see a script id just finished while i sat by the pool and read one of his i finished around one oclock hungry starved your script is wonderful ric said i cant get over the pace the sense of reality it didnt feel like a story thanks i took some tuna salad and perrier from the refrigerator wholewheat bread and kosher dills okay or maybe youd rather go to a restaurant after working in one every night ric laughed but i could tell that he was marking time that he was frustrated and anxious to know what i thought of his script i remembered how i had felt at his age the insecurity when someone important was reading my work i got to the point i like your story i said he exhaled but i dont think its executed properly his cheek muscles tensed given what theyre paying alist actors these days you have to get the main character on screen as quickly as possible your main character doesnt show up until page fifteen he sounded embarrassed i couldnt figure out a way to and the romantic element is so familiar its tiresome a shower scene comes from a washedup imagination that was tough i knew but i waited to see how hed take it if he turned out to be the sensitive type i wasnt going to get anywhere yeah okay maybe i did rely on a lot of other movies id seen his response encouraged me the humorous elements dont work i dont think comedy is your thing he squinted the ending has no focus i continued was your main character right or not simply leaving the dilemma up in the air is going to piss off your audience he studied me you said you liked the story right i did then why do i feel like im on the titanic because youve got a lot of craft to learn and its going to take you quite a while to master it if you ever do there arent any guarantees the average guild member earns less than six thousand dollars a year writing screenplays is one of the most competitive enterprises in the world but i think i can help you why excuse me we met just last night i was your waiter for gods sake now suddenly im in your house having lunch with you and youre saying you want to help me it cant be because of the force of my personality you want something yes but not what youre thinking i told you last night this is strictly business sit down and eat while i tell you how we can both make some money this is ric potter i said we were at a reception in one of those mansions in the hills near the hollywood bowl sunset a string quartet champagne plenty of movers and shakers fox is very hot on one of his scripts i think itll go for a million the man to whom id introduced ric was an executive at warners he couldnt have been over thirty oh yeah its got a youth angle oh the executive looked ric up and down confused never having heard of him at the same time worried because he didnt want to be out of the loop fearing he ought to have heard of him if i sound a little proud i said its because i discovered him i found him last may when i was giving a talk to a young screenwriters workshop at the american film institute ric convinced me to look at some things andim glad i did my agents glad i did i chuckled the executive tried to look amused although he hated like hell to pay writers significant money for his part ric tried to look modest but unbelievably talented young young young and hot hot hot well dont let fox tie you up the executive told ric have your agent send me something ill do that mr ballard thanks ric said do i look old enough to be a mister call me ed we made the rounds while all the executives considered me too old to be relevant to their audience they still had reverence for what they thought of as an institution sure they wouldnt buy anything from me but they were more than happy to talk to me after all it didnt cost them any money and it made them feel like they were part of a community by the time i was through introducing ric my rumors about ric had been accepted as fact various executives from various studios considered themselves in competition with executives from other studios for the services of this hot new young writer who was getting a million dollars a script ric had driven with me to the reception on the way back he kept shaking his head in amazement and thats the secret i just needed the right guy to give me introductions to be anointed as a successor not quite dont let their chumminess fool you they only care if you can deliver well tomorrow ill send them one of my scripts no i said remember our agreement not one of your scripts one of mine by eric potter so there it was the deal ric and i had made was that id give him ten percent of whatever my scripts earned in exchange for his being my front man for his part hed have to take calls and go to meetings and behave as if hed actually written the scripts along the way wed inevitably talk about the intent and technique of the scripts thus providing ric with writing lessons all in all not a bad deal for him except that he had insisted on fifteen percent hey i cant go to meetings if im working threetoeleven at the restaurant hed said fifteen percent and ill need an advance youll have to pay me what im earning at the restaurant so i can be free for the meetings i wrote him a check for a thousand dollars the phone rang interrupting the climactic speech of the script i was writing instead of picking up the receiver i let my answering machine take it but i answered anyhow when i heard my agent talking about ric what about him steve ballard over at warners likes the script you had me send him he wants a few changes but basically hes happy enough to offer seven hundred and fifty thousand ask for a million ill ask for nothing i dont understand is this a new negotiating tactic you told me not to bother reading the script just to do the kid a favor and send it over to warners because ballard asked for it as you pointed out im too busy to do any reading anyhow but i made a copy of the script and for the hell of it last night i looked it over mort what are you trying to pull ric potter didnt write that script you did under a different title you showed it to me a year ago i didnt respond mort im making a point the only thing wrong with my scripts is an industry bias against age pretend somebody young wrote them and all of a sudden theyre wonderful mort i wont be a part of this why not its misrepresentation id be jeopardizing my credibility as an agent you know how the clause in the contract reads the writer guarantees that the script is solely his or her own work if somebody else was involved the studio wants to know about itto protect itself against a plagiarism suit but if you tell ballard i wrote that script he wont buy it youre being paranoid mort facing facts and being practical dont screw this up i told you i wont go along with it then if you wont make the deal ill get somebody else who will a long pause do you know what youre saying ric potter and i need a new agent ill say this for steve even though he was furious about my leaving him he finally swore for old times sake at my insistence that he wouldnt tell anybody what i was doing he was loyal to the end it broke my heart to leave him the new agent i selected knew squat about the arrangement i had with ric she believed what i told her that ric and i were friends and by coincidence wed decided simultaneously to get new representation i could have chosen one of those superhuge agencies like caa but ive always been uncomfortable when im part of a mob and in this case especially it seemed to me that small and intimate were essential the fewer people who knew my business the better the linda carpenter agency was located in a stone cottage just past the gates to the old hollywoodland subdivision years ago the land part of that subdivisions sign collapsed the hollywood part remained and you see that sign all the time in film clips about los angeles its a distance up past houses in the hills nonetheless from outside linda carpenters stone cottage you feel that the signs looming over you i parked my audi and got out with ric he was wearing sneakers jeans and a blue cotton pullover at my insistence i wanted his outfit to be selfconsciously informal and youthful in contrast with my own mature conservative slacks and sport coat when we entered the office linda whos thirty with short red hair and loves to look at gorgeous young mensat straighter when i introduced ric his biceps bulged at the sleeves of his pullover i was reminded again of how much with his sandy hair blue eyes and glowing tanhe looked like an actor linda took a moment before she reluctantly shifted her attention away from him as if suddenly realizing that i was in the room good to see you again mort but you didnt have to come all this way i could have met you for lunch at le dome a courtesy visit i wanted to save you the long drive not to mention the bill i said it as if i was joking the rule is that agents always pick up the check when theyre at a restaurant with clients lindas smile was winning her red hair seemed brighter any time im still surprised that you left steve she tactfully didnt ask what the problem had been i promise ill work hard for you i know you will i said but i dont think youll have to work hard for my friend here ric already has some interest in a script of his over at warners oh linda raised her elegant eyebrows whos the executive ballard my my she frowned slightly and steve isnt involved in this your ties are completely severed completely if you want call him to make sure that wont be necessary but i found out later that linda did phone steve and he backed up what id said also he refused to discuss why wed separated i have a hunch the script can go for big dollars i continued how big is big a million lindas eyes widened that certainly isnt small ballard heard theres a buzz about ric ballard thinks that ric might be a young joe eszterhas the reference was to the screenwriter of basic instinct who had become a phenomenon for writing sensationbased scripts on speculation and intriguing so many producers that hed manipulated them into a bidding war and collected megabucks i have a suspicion that ballard would like to make a preemptive bid and shut out the competition mort you sound more like an agent than a writer its just a hunch and steve doesnt want a piece of this i shook my head no linda frowned harder but her frown dissolved the moment she turned again toward ric and took another look at his perfect chin did you bring a copy of the script sure ric grinned with becoming modesty the way id taught him right here linda took it and flipped to the end to make sure it wasnt longer than pages a shootable size whats it about ric gave the pitch that id taught himthe high concept first then the target audience the type of actor he had in mind and ways the budget could be kept in check the same as when wed clocked it at my house he took four minutes linda listened with growing fascination she turned to me have you been coaching him not much rics a natural he must be to act this polished and hes young i said you dont need to remind me and ballard certainly doesnt need reminding i said ric linda said from here on in whatever you do dont get writers block im going to make you the highest paid new kid in town ric beamed and mort linda said i think youre awfully generous to help your friend through the ropes like this well i shrugged isnt that what friends are for i had joked with linda that our trip to her office was a courtesy visit to save her a long drive and the cost of buying us lunch at an expensive restaurant that was partly true but i also wanted to see how ric made his pitch about the script if he got nerves and screwed up i didnt want it to be in le dome where producers at neighboring tables might see him get flustered we were trying out the show on the road so to speak before we brought it to town and i had to agree with linda ric had done just fine i told him so as we drove along sunset boulevard i wont always be there to back you up in fact itll be rare that i am we have to keep training you so you give the impression theres very little about writing or the business you dont understand most of getting along with studio executives is making them have confidence in you you really think i impressed her it was obvious ric thought about it peering out the window nodding yeah so we went back to my home in the hills above west hollywood and i ran him through more variations of questions he might get asked where hed gotten the idea what actors would be good in the roles who he thought could direct the material that sort of thing at the start of a project producers pay a lot of attention to a screenwriter and they promise to keep consulting him the way theyre consulting him now its all guff of course as soon as a director and a name actor are attached to a project the producers suddenly get amnesia about the original screenwriter but at the start hes king and i wanted ric to be ready to answer any kind of question about the screenplay so he could be convincing that hed actually written it ric was a fast study at eight when i couldnt think of any more questions he might have to answer we took a drive to dinner at a fish place near the santa monica pier afterward we strolled to the end of the pier and watched the sunset so this is what its all about ric said im not sure what you mean the action i can feel the action dont get fooled by lindas optimism nothing might come of this ric shook his head im close ive got some pages i want to do tomorrow but if youll come around at four with your own new pages ill go over them for you im curious to see how youre revising that script you showed me ric kept staring out at the sunset and didnt answer for quite a while yeah my script as things turned out i didnt get much work done the next day i had just managed to solve a problem in a scene that was running too long when my phone rang that was around ten oclock and rather than be interrupted i let my answering machine take it but when i heard rics excited voice i picked up the phone slow down i said take it easy what are you so worked up about they want the script i wasnt prepared warners can you believe that this is happening so fast ballards actually taking it how did you find this out linda just phoned me linda i frowned but why didnt linda i was about to say why didnt linda phone me then i realized my mistake there wasnt any reason for linda to phone me except maybe to tell me the good news about my friend but she definitely had to phone ric after all he was supposedly the author of the screenplay ric kept talking excitedly linda says ballard wants to have lunch with me great the truth is i was vaguely jealous when today i was stunned any executive with power was always booked several weeks in advance for ballard to decide to have lunch with ric this soon he would have had to cancel lunch with someone else it definitely wouldnt have been the other way around no one cancels lunch with ballard amazing i said apparently hes got big plans for me by the way he likes the script as is no changes at least for now linda says when they sign a director the director always asks for changes lindas right i said and then the directorll insist that the changes arent good enough and ask to bring in a friend to do the rewrite no fucking way ric said a screenwriter doesnt have any clout against a director youve still got a lot to learn about industry politics school isnt finished yet sure ric hurried on linda got ballard up to a million and a quarter for the script for a moment i had trouble breathing great and this time i meant it ric phoned again in thirty minutes he was nervous about the meeting and needed reassurance ric phoned thirty minutes after that saying that he didnt feel comfortable going to a power lunch in the sneakers jeans and pullover that i had told him were necessary for the role he was playing you have to i said youve got to look like you dont belong to the establishment or whatever the hell it is they call it these days if you look like every other writer trying to make an impression ballard will treat you like every other writer were selling nonconformity were selling youth i still say id feel more comfortable in a jacket by ric mentioned the name of the latest trendy designer even assuming thats a good idea which it isnt how on earth are you going to pay for it a jacket by that designer costs fifteenhundred dollars ill use my credit card ric said but a month from now youll still have to pay the bill you know the whopping interest rates those credit card companies charge hey i can afford it i just made a million and a quarter bucks no ric youre getting confused all right i know linda has to take her ten percent commission youre still confused you dont get the bulk of that money i do what you get is fifteen percent of it thats still a lot of cash almost two hundred thousand dollars but remember you probably wont get it for at least six months what on a spec script they dont simply agree to buy it and hand you a check the fine points on the negotiation have to be completed then the contracts have to be drawn up and reviewed and amended then their business office drags its feet before issuing the check i once waited a year to get paid for a spec script but i cant wait that long ive got yes responsibilities look mort i have to go i need to get ready for this meeting and i need to get back to my pages with all this excitement you mean youre actually writing today every day no shit but i was too preoccupied to get much work done ric finally phoned around five lunch was fabulous i hadnt expected to feel so relieved ballard didnt ask you any tricky questions hes still convinced you wrote the script not only that he says im just the talent hes been looking for a fresh imagination someone in tune with todays generation he asked me to do a lastminute rewrite on an action picture hes starting next week the warlords thats the one ive been hearing bad things about it i said well you wont hear anything bad anymore wait aare you telling me you accepted the job damned right without talking to me about it first i straightened in shock what in gods name did you think you were doing why would i need to talk to you youre not my agent ballard called linda from our table at the restaurant the two of them settled the deal while i was sitting there man when things happen they happen all those years of trying and now wham pow all of a sudden im there and the best part is since im a writer for hire on this job they have to pay some of the money the minute i sit down to work even if the contracts arent ready thats correct i said on work for hire you have to get paid on a schedule the writers guild insists on that youre learning fast but ric before you accepted the job dont you think it would have been smart to read the script first to see if it can be fixed how bad can it be ric chuckled youd be surprised it doesnt matter how bad the fees a hundred thousand dollars i need the money for what you dont live expensively you can afford to be patient and take jobs that build a career hey ill tell you what i can afford are you using that portable phone in your office yes but i dont see why that matters take a look out your front window frowning i left my office went through the tv room and the living room and peered past the blossoming rhododendrum outside my front window i scanned the curving driveway then focused on the gate ric was wearing a designer linen jacket sitting in a red ferrari using a car phone waving to me when he saw me at the window like it he asked over the phone for gods sake i broke the connection set down the phone and stalked out the front door like it ric repeated when i reached the gate he gestured toward his jacket and the car you didnt have time to whered you get this morning after linda phoned about the offer from ballard i ordered the car over the phone picked it up after my meeting with ballard nifty huh but you dont have any assets you mean they just let you drive the car off the lot bought it on credit i made linda sign as the guarantor you made linda i couldnt believe what i was hearing damn it ric why dont you let me finish coaching you before you run off andafter i taught you about screenplay technique and industry politics i wanted to explain to you how to handle your money hey whats to teach moneys for spending not in this business youve got to put something away for when you have bad years well im certainly not having any trouble earning money so far what happened today is a fluke this is the first script ive sold in longer than i care to think about there arent any guarantees then its a good thing i came along huh ric grinned before you accepted the rewrite job you should have asked me if i wanted to do it but youre not involved in this why should i divide the money with you im going to do it in that case you should have asked yourself another question what whether youve got the ability to do it ric flushed with anger of course ive got the ability youve read my stuff all i needed was a break i didnt hear from ric for three days that was fine by me id accomplished what id intended id proven that a script with my name on it had less chance of being bought than the same script with a youngsters name on it and to tell the truth rics lack of discipline was annoying me but after the third day i confess i got curious what was he up to he called at nine in the evening hows it going fine i said i had a good days work yeah thats what im calling about work oh i havent been in touch lately because of this rewrite on the warlords i waited i had a meeting with the director ricsaid then i had a meeting with the star he mentioned the name of the biggest action hero in the business he hesitated i was wondering would you look at the material ive got you cant be serious after the way you talked to me about it you all but told me to get lost i didnt mean to be rude honestly this is all new to me mort come on give me a break as you keep reminding me i dont have the experience you do im young i had to hand it to him hed not only apologized hed used the right excuse mort at first i didnt want to be bothered i had my own work to think about and the warlords would probably be so bad that it would contaminate my mind but then my curiosity got the better of me i couldnt help wondering what ric would do to improve junk mort when do you want me to look at what youve done how about right now now its after nine itll take you an hour to get here and im already here what im on my car phone outside your gate again ric sat across from me in my living room i couldnt help noticing that his tan was darker that he was wearing a different designer jacket a more expensive one then i glanced at the title page on the script hed handed me the warlords revisions by eric potter i flipped through the pages all of them were typed on white paper that bothered me rics inexperience was showing again on lastminute rewrites its always helpful to submit changed pages on differentcolored paper that way the producer and director can save time and not have to read the entire script to find the changes these are the notes the director gave me ric said he handed me some crudely typed pages and these ric handed me pages with scribbling on them are what the star gave me its a little hard to decipher them more than a little jesus i squinted at the scribbling and got a headache id better put on my glasses they helped a little i read what the director wanted i switched to what the star wanted these are the notes the producer gave me ric said i thanked god that they were neatly typed and studied them as well finally i leaned back and took off my glasses well i sighed typical as near as i can tell these three people are each talking about a different movie the director wants more action and less characterization the star has decided to be serious he wants more characterization and less action the producer wants it funny and less expensive if theyre not careful this movie will have multiple personalities ric looked at me anxiously okay i said feeling tired get a beer from the refrigerator and watch television or something while i go through this it would help if i knew where youd made changes next time youre in a situation like this identify your work with colored paper ric frowned whats the matter i asked the changes so what about them well i havent started to make them you havent but on this title page it says revisions by eric potter ric looked sheepish the title page is as far as i got sweet jesus when are these revisions due ballard gave me a week and for the first three days of that week you didnt work on the changes what have you been doing ric glanced away again i noticed that his tan was darker dont tell me youve just been sitting in the sun not exactly then what exactly ive been thinking about how to improve the script i was so agitated i had to stand you dont think about changes you make changes how much did you say you were being paid a hundred thousand dollars ric nodded uncomfortable and the writers guild insists that on work for hire you get a portion of the money as soon as you start fifty thousand ric squirmed linda got the check by messenger the day after i made the deal with ballard what a mess ric lowered his head more uncomfortable if you dont hand in new pages four days from now ballard will want his money back i know ric said then added but i cant what i already spent the money a deposit on a condo in malibu i was stunned and the money isnt the worst of it i said your reputation thats worse ballard gave you an incredible break he decided to take a chance on the bright new kid in town he allowed you to jump over all the shit but if you dont deliver hell be furious hell spread the word all over town that youre not dependable you wont be hot anymore we wont be able to sell another script as easily as we did this one look im sorry mort i know i bragged to you that i could do the job on my own i was wrong i dont have the experience i admit it im out of my depth even on a piece of shit like this ric glanced down then up i was wondering could you give me a hand my mouth hung open in astonishment before i could tell him no damned way ric quickly added it would really help both of us how do you figure that you just said it yourself if i dont deliver ballard will spread the word no producer will trust me you wont be able to sell another script through me my head began to throb he was right of course if i wanted to keep selling my scripts if i wanted to see them produced i needed him there was no doubt in my mind that as old as i was i would never be able to sell another script with my name on it i finally had to admit that all along secretly i had never intended the deception with ric to be a onetimeonly arrangement i swallowed and finally said all right thank you but i wont clean up your messes for nothing of course not the same arrangement as before all i get out of this is fifteen percent by rights you shouldnt get anything hey without me ballard wouldnt have offered the job since you already spent the first half of the payment how do i get that money ric made an effort to think of a solution well have to wait until the money comes through on the spec script we sold ill give you the money out of the two hundred thousand thats owed to me but you owe the ferrari dealer a bundle otherwise lindas responsible for your debt ill take care of it ric gestured impatiently ill take care of all of it whats important now is that you make the changes on the warlords ballard has to pay the remaining fifty thousand dollars when i hand in the pages that moneys yours fine it wasnt until later that i realized how ric had set a precedent for restructuring our deal regardless of his promise to pay me what i was owed the reality was that he had pocketed half the fee instead of getting fifteen percent he was now getting fifty percent the script for the warlords was even worse than id feared how do you change bad junk into good junk in the process how do you please a director a star and a producer who ask for widely different things one of the rules ive learned over the years is that what people say they want isnt always what they mean sometimes its a matter of interpretation and after i endured reading the script for the warlords i thought i had that interpretation the director said he wanted more action and less characterization in my opinion the script already had more than enough action the trouble was that some of the action sequences were redundant and others werent paced effectively the biggest stunts occurred twothirds of the way into the story the last third had stunts that suffered by comparison so the trick here was to do some pruning and restructuring to take the good stunts from the end and put them in the middle to build on them and put the great stunts at the end all the while struggling to retain the already feeble logic of the story the star said he wanted less action and more characterization as far as i could tell what he really wanted was to be sympathetic to make the audience like the character he was playing so i softened him a little threw in some jokes had him wait for an old lady to cross a street before he blew away the bad guys basic things like that since his character was more like a robot than a human being any vaguely human thing he did would make him sympathetic the producer said he wanted more humor and a less expensive budget well by making the hero sympathetic i added the jokes the producer wanted by restructuring the sequence of stunts i managed to eliminate some of the weaker ones thus giving the star his request for less action and the producer his request for holding down the budget since the preponderance of action scenes had been what inflated the budget in the first place i explained this to ric as i made notes theyll all be happy amazing ric said thanks no what i mean is the ideas you came up with i could have thought of them oh my voice hardened then why didnt you because well they seem so obvious after i thought of them good ideas always seem obvious in retrospect the real job is putting them on paper im going to have to work like crazy to get this job done in four days and then theres a further problem i have to teach you how to pitch these changes to ballard so hell be convinced youre the one who wrote them you can count on me ric said i want you to suddenly i found myself yawning and looked at my watch three am im not used to staying up this late id better get some sleep if im going to get this rewrite done in four days im a night person myself ric said well come back tomorrow at four in the afternoon ill take a break and start teaching you what to say to ballard ric didnt show up of course when i phoned his apartment i got his answering machine i couldnt get in touch with him the next day or the day after that but the day the changes were due he certainly showed up he phoned again from his car outside the gate and when i let him in he was so eager to see the pages that he barely said hello to me where the hell have you been mexico what with all this stress i needed to get away what have you done to put you under stress im the one whos been doing all the work instead of responding ric sat on my livingroom sofa and quickly leafed through the pages i noticed he was wearing yet another designer jacket his tan was even darker yeah he said this is good he quickly came to his feet id better get to the studio but i havent coached you about what to say to ballard ric stopped at the door mort ive been thinking if this partnership is going to work we need to give each other more space you take care of the writing let me worry about what to say in meetings ballard likes me i know how to handle him trust me and ric was gone i waited to hear about what happened at the meeting no phone call when i finally broke down and phoned him an electronicsounding voice told me that his number was no longer in service it took me a moment to figure out that he must have moved to the condo in malibu so i phoned linda to get the new number and she awkwardly told me that ric had ordered her to keep it a secret even from me especially from you did you guys have an argument or something no well he made it sound as if you had he kept complaining about how you were always telling him what to do of all the i almost told linda the truththat ric hadnt written the script she had sold but rather had then i realized that shed be consciencebound to tell the studio the deception would make the studio feel chilly about the script after all as far as they were concerned an old guy couldnt possibly write a script that appealed to a young generation they would reread the script with a new perspective prejudiced by knowing the true identity of the author the deal would fall through id lose the biggest fee id ever been promised so i mumbled something about intending to talk with him and straighten out the problem then i hung up and cursed after i didnt hear from ric for a week it became obvious that linda would long ago have forwarded to him the check for the rewrite on the warlords hed had ample time to send me my money he didnt intend to pay me that made me furious partly because hed betrayed me partly because i didnt like being made to feel naive and partly because im a professional to me its a matter of honor that i get paid for what i write ric had violated one of my most basic rules my arrangement with him was finished when i read about him in daily variety and hollywood reporterabout how ballard was delighted with the rewrite and predicting that the script he had bought from ric would be next years smash hit not to mention that ric would win an oscar for it i was apoplectic ric was compared to robert towne and william goldman with the advantage that he was young and had a powerful understanding of todays generation ric had been hired for a halfmillion dollars to do another rewrite ric had promised that he would soon deliver another original script for which he hinted that his agent would demand an enormous price quality is always worth the cost ballard said i wanted to vomit as i knew he would have to ric eventually came to see me again the car phone at the gate three weeks later after dark a night person after all i made a pretense of reluctance feigned being moved by his whining and let him in even in the muted lights of my living room he had the most perfect tan i had ever seen his clothes were even more expensive and trendy i hated him you didnt send me my money for the rewrite on the warlords im sorry about that ric said thats part of the reason im here to pay me to explain my condo at malibu the owners demanded more money as a down payment i couldnt give up the place its too fabulous so i had towell i knew youd understand but i dont mort listen to me i promise as soon as the money comes through on the script we sold ill pay you everything i owe you went to fifteen percent of the fee to fifty percent to one hundred percent do you think i work for nothing mort i can appreciate your feelings but i was in a bind you still are ive been reading about you in the trade papers youre getting a halfmillion for a rewrite on another script and youre also promising a new original script how are you going to manage all that well i tried to do it on my own i handed ballard the script i showed you when we first met jesus no he didnt like it what a surprise i had to cover my tracks and tell him it was something id been fooling with but that i realized it needed a lot of work i told him i agreed with his opinion from now on i intended to stick to the tried and true the sort of thing id sold him i shook my head i guess you were right ric said good ideas seem obvious after somebodys thought of them but maybe i dont have what it takes to come up with them ive been acting like a jerk i couldnt agree more so what do you say ric offered his hand lets let bygones be bygones i screwed up but ive learned from my mistake im willing to give our partnership another try if you are i stared at his hand suddenly beads of sweat burst from his brow he lifted his hand and wiped the sweat whats the matter i asked hot in here not really actually i thought it was getting chilly feels stuffy the beer i gave you maybe you drank it too fast maybe you know ive been thinking i said the beer was drugged of course after the nausea wore off giddiness set in as it was supposed to the drug which id learned about years ago when i was working on a tv crime series left its victim open to suggestion it took me only ten minutes to convince him it was a great idea to do what i wanted as i instructed ric giddily phoned linda and told her that he was feeling stressed out and intended to go back down to mexico he told her he suddenly felt trapped by materialism he needed a spiritual retreat he might be away for as long as six months linda was shocked listening to the speaker phone i heard her demand to know how ric intended to fulfill the contracts hed signed she said his voice was slurred and accused him of being drunk or high on something i picked up the phone switched off the speaker and interrupted to tell linda that ric was calling from my house and that wed made up our differences that hed been pouring out his soul to me he was drunk yes but what he had told her was no different than what he had told me when he was sober he was leaving for mexico tonight and might not be back for quite a while how was he going to fulfill his contracts no problem just because he was going on a retreat in mexico that didnt mean he wouldnt be writing honest work was what he thrived on it was food for his soul by then ric was almost asleep after i hung up i roused him made him sign two documents that id prepared then made him tell me where he was living in malibu i put him in his car drove over to his place packed a couple of his suitcases crammed them into the car and set out for mexico we got there shortly after dawn he was somewhat conscious when we crossed the border at tijuana enough to be able to answer a few questions and to keep the mexican immigration officer from becoming suspicious after that i drugged him again i drove until midafternoon took a back road into the desert gave him a final lethal amount of the drug and dumped his body into a sinkhole i drove back to tijuana left rics suitcases minus identification in an alley left his ferrari minus identification in another alley the key in the ignition and caught a bus back to los angeles i was confident that neither the suitcases nor the car would ever be reported i was also confident that by the time rics body was discovered if ever it would be in such bad shape that the mexican authorities with limited resources wouldnt be able to identify it ric had once told me that he hadnt spoken to his parents in five years so i knew they wouldnt wonder why he wasnt in touch with them as far as his friends went well he didnt have any hed ditched them when he came into money they wouldnt miss him for an old guy im resilient id kept up my energy driven all night and most of the day i finally got some sleep on the bus not shabby although toward the end i felt as if something had broken in me and i doubt ill ever be able to put in that much effort again but i had to you see ric was going to keep hounding me enticing me using me and i was going to be too desperate to tell him to get lost because i knew that no matter how well i wrote i would never be able to sell a script under my own name again when i first started as a writer the money and the ego didnt matter to me as much as the need to work to tell stories to teach and delight as the latin poet horace said but when the money started coming in i began to depend on it and i grew to love the action of being with powerful people of having a reputation for being able to deliver quality work with amazing speed ego thats why i hated ric the most because producers stroked his ego over scripts that i had written but not anymore ric was gone and his agent had heard him say that hed be in mexico and i had a document with his signature on it saying that he was going to mail in his scripts through me that i was his mentor and that he wanted me to go to script meetings on his behalf another document gave me his power of attorney with permission to oversee his income while he was away and that should have been the end of it linda was puzzled but went along after all shed heard ric on the phone ballard was even more puzzled but he was also enormously pleased with the spec script that i pulled out of a drawer and sent in with rics name on it as far as ballard was concerned if ric wanted to be eccentric that was fine as long as ric kept delivering really his speed and the quality of his work were amazing so in a way i got what i wanted the action and the pleasure of selling my work but theres a problem when i sit down to do rewrites when i type revisions by eric potter i suddenly find myself gazing out the window wanting to sit in the sun at the same time i find that i cant sleep like ric ive become a night person ive sold the spec scripts that i wrote over the years and kept in a drawer all i had to do was change the titles nobody remembered reading the original stories but i couldnt seem to do the rewrites and now that ive run out of old scripts now that im faced with writing something new for the first time in my life ive got writers block all i have to do is think of the title page and the words by eric potter and my imagination freezes its agony all my life every day ive been a writer for thirtyfive years of married life except for the last two when doris got sick i wrote every day i sacrificed everything to my craft i didnt have children because i thought it would interfere with my schedule nothing was more important than putting words on a page now i sit at my desk stare at my word processor and mary had a little i cant bear this anymore i need rest the quick brown fox jumped over i need to forget about ric now is the time for all good men to arialthe relationship between fathers and sons metaphoric or actual is a frequent theme in my work because i never adjusted to my fathers death in world war grew up craving the attention of a positive male authority figure eventually i found three of them stirling silliphant whom ive spoken about philip young the great hemingway critic and philip klass under the pen name william tenn he was part of the golden age of science fiction in the s in black evening and lessons from a lifetime of writing i discussed at length the many things philip klass taught me about writing given his specialty i found it interesting that of the many genres in which ive worked i hadnt tried anything in science fiction after three decades that changed when writereditoranthologist al sarrantonio asked me to contribute a story to a sciencefiction anthology he was putting together redshift i decided to move the parentchild relationship from algebra into something like quantum physics exploring it in the most complex way i could imagine part of my impetus was that after my sons death i no longer identified with sons searching for fathers rather i was a father searching fora son in this story reprinted in years best sf was able to combine both approaches and even add a third philip klasswilliam tenns collected fiction and nonfiction are now available in three gorgeous volumes from nsfr press wwwnesfapresscom resurrection anthony was nine when his mother had to tell him that his father was seriously ill the signs had been therepallor and shortness of breathbut anthonys childhood was so perfect his parents so loving that he couldnt imagine a problem they couldnt solve his fathers increasing weight loss was too obvious to be ignored however but but whats wrong with him anthony stared uneasily up at his mother hed never seen her look more tired she explained about blood cells its not leukemia if only it were these days thats almost always curable but the doctors have never seen anything like this its moving so quickly even a bone marrow transplant wont work the doctors suspect that it might have something to do with the lab with radiation he picked up after the accident anthony nodded his parents had once explained to him that his father was something called a maintenance engineer a while ago thered been an emergency phone call and anthonys father had rushed to the lab in the middle of the night but the doctors theyre trying everything they can think of thats why daddys going to be in the hospital for a while but cant i see him tomorrow anthonys mother sounded more weary both of us can see him tomorrow when they went to the hospital anthonys father was too weak to recognize him he had tubes in his arms his mouth and his nose his skin was gray his face was thinner than it had been three days earlier the last time anthony had seen him if anthony hadnt loved his father so much hed have been frightened as things were all he wanted was to sit next to his father and hold his hand but after only a few minutes the doctors said that it was time to go the next day when anthony and his mother went to the hospital his father wasnt in his room he was having a procedure the doctors said they took anthonys mother aside to talk to her when she came back she looked even more solemn than the doctors had everything possible had been done she explained no results her voice sounded tight none at this rate she could barely get the words out in a couple of days theres nothing the doctors can do anthony asked afraid not now maybe not ever but we can hope we can try to cheat time anthony hadnt the faintest idea what she meant he wasnt even sure that he understood after she explained that there was something called cryonics which froze sick people until cures were discovered then they were thawed and given the new treatment in a primitive way cryonics had been tried fifty years earlier in the late years of the twentieth century anthonys mother found the strength to continue explaining it had failed because the freezing method hadnt been fast enough and the equipment often broke but over time the technique had been improved sufficiently that although the medical establishment didnt endorse it they didnt reject it either then why doesnt everybody do it anthony asked in confusion because his mother took a deep breath because some of the people who were thawed never woke up anthony had the sense that his mother was telling him more than she normally would have that she was treating him like a grownup and that he had to justify her faith in him others who did wake up failed to respond to the new treatment she reluctantly said couldnt they be frozen again anthony asked in greater bewilderment you cant survive being frozen a second time you get only one chance and if the treatment doesnt work she stared down at the floor its so experimental and risky that insurance companies wont pay for it the only reason we have it as an option is that the laboratorys agreed to pay for the procedure there was that word again while the doctors try to figure out how to cure him but if its going to happen it has to happen now she looked straight into his eyes should we do it to save daddy we have to itll be like hes gone dead anthonys mother reluctantly nodded but he wont bedead thats right his mother said we might never see him alive again though they might not ever find a cure they might not ever wake him up only much later did anthony understand the other issues his mother had to deal with in the worst case if his father died at least his life insurance would allow his mother to support the two of them in the unlikely event that she ever fell in love again shed be able to remarry but if anthonys father was frozen in effect dead to them theyd be in need of money and the only way for her to remarry would be to get a divorce from the man who a year after her wedding might be wakened and cured but its the only thing we can do anthony said yes his mother wiped her eyes and straightened its the only thing we can do anthony had expected that it would happen the next day or the day after that but his mother hadnt been exaggerating that if it was going to happen it had to happen now his unconscious father was a gray husk as they rode with him in an ambulance at a building without windows they walked next to his fathers gurney as it was wheeled along a softly lit corridor and into a room where other doctors waited there were glinting instruments and humming machines a man in a suit explained that anthony and his mother had to step outside while certain preparations were done to anthonys father to make the freezing process safe after that they would be able to accompany him to his cryochamber again it wasnt what anthony expected in contrast with the humming machines in the preparation room the chamber was only a niche in a wall in a long corridor that had numerous other niches on each side metal doors with pressure gauges on them anthony watched his fathers gaunt naked body being placed on a tray that went into the niche but his fathers back never actually touched the tray as the man in the suit explained a force field kept anthonys father elevated otherwise his back would freeze to the tray and cause infections when he was thawed for the same reason no clothes not even a sheet could cover him although anthony thinking of how cold his father was going to be dearly wished that his father had something to keep him warm while the man in the suit and the men who looked like doctors stepped aside a man dressed in black but with a white collar arrived he put a purple scarf around his neck he opened a book and read i am the way the truth and the life a little later he read i am the resurrection anthonys father was slid into the niche the door was closed something hissed its done the man in the suit said that quickly anthonys mother asked it wont work if it isnt instantaneous may god grant a cure the man with the white collar said years earlier anthonys father had lost his parents in a fire anthonys mother had her parents but without much money the only way they could help was by offering to let her and anthony stay with them for a time anthonys mother fought the notion after all she had her job as an administrative assistant at the laboratory although without her husbands salary she didnt earn enough for the mortgage payments on their house the house was too big for her and anthony anyhow so after six months she was forced to sell it using the money to move into a cheaper smaller townhouse by then the job at the lab had given her too many painful memories about anthonys father in fact she blamed the lab for what had happened to him her bitterness intensified until she couldnt make herself go into the labs offices any longer she quit got a lesser paying job as a secretary at a realestate firm persuaded a sympathetic broker to sell her townhouse but not charge a commission and went with anthony to live with her parents she and anthony spent all their free time together even more than before the accident so he had plenty of opportunity to learn what she was feeling and why shed made those decisions the times she revealed herself the most however were when they visited his father she once complained that the corridor of niches reminded her of a mausoleum a reference that anthony didnt understand so she explained it but so vaguely that he still didnt understand and it was several years before he knew what shed been talking about visiting hours for the cryochambers were between eight and six during the day as long as a new patient wasnt being installed at first anthony and his mother went every afternoon after she finished work gradually that lessened to every second day every third day and once a week but they didnt reach that point for at least a year sometimes there were other visitors in the corridor solitary people or incomplete families staring mournfully at niches sometimes leaving small objects of remembrance on narrow tables in the middle of the corridor notes photographs dried maple leaves and small candles shaped like pumpkins to mention a few the company placed no names on any of the niches so visitors had used stickon plaques that said who was behind the pressurized door when he or she had been born when they had gotten sick of what and when they had been frozen often there was a bit of a prayer or something as movingly simple as we love you well see you soon here and there anthony noticed just a name but for the most part the plaques had acquired a common form the same kind of information and in the same order as over the years a tradition had been established over the years indeed some of the people in the niches had been frozen at least twentyfive years he read it made him fear that his father might never be wakened his fear worsened each time his mother came back from visiting his fathers doctors who were no closer to finding a cure for his sickness eventually his mother took him along to see the doctors although the visits grew wider apart every other month every six months and then every year the message was always depressingly the same by then anthony was fifteen in his first year of high school he decided that he wanted to become a doctor and find a way to cure his father but the next year his grandfather had a heart attack leaving a small life insurance policy enough for his mother and his grandmother to keep the house going but hardly enough for anthonys dreams of attending medical school meanwhile his mother began dating the sympathetic broker at the realestate firm anthony knew that she couldnt be expected to be lonely forever that after so much time it was almost as if his father was dead and not frozen and that she had to get on with her life but as if his father was dead wasnt the same as actually being dead and anthony had trouble concealing his unhappiness when his mother told him that she was going to marry the broker but what about dad youre still married to him im going to have to divorce him no anthony we did our best we couldnt cheat time it didnt work your fathers never going to be cured no ill never stop loving him anthony but im not betraying him hes the same as dead and i need to live tears dripped from anthonys cheeks hed have wanted me to his mother said hed have understood hed have done the same thing ill ask him when he wakes up when anthony became eighteen it struck him that his father had been frozen nine years half of anthonys life if it hadnt been for pictures of his father he feared that he wouldnt have been able to remember what his father had looked like no not had looked like anthony corrected himself his father wasnt dead once a new treatment was discovered once he was thawed and cured hed look the same as ever anthony concentrated to remember his fathers voice the gentle tone with which his father had read bedtime stories to him and had taught him how to ride a bicycle he remembered his father helping him with his math homework and how his father had come to his school every year on career day and proudly explained his job at the lab he remembered how his father had hurried him to the emergency ward after a branch snapped on the backyard tree and anthonys fall broke his arm his devotion to his father strengthened after his mother remarried and they moved to the brokers house the broker turned out to be not as sympathetic as when hed been courting anthonys mother he was bossy he lost his temper if everything wasnt done exactly his way anthonys mother looked unhappy and anthony hardly ever talked to the man whom he refused to think of as his stepfather he stayed away from the house as much as possible often lying that hed been playing sports or at the library when actually hed been visiting his fathers chamber which the broker didnt want him to do because the broker insisted it was disloyal to the new family the broker also said that he wasnt going to pay a fortune so that anthony could go to medical school he wanted anthony to get a degree in business and that was the only education he was going to pay for so anthony studied extra hard got nothing but as and applied for every scholarship he could find eventually being accepted as a science major in a neighboring state the university there had an excellent medical school which he hoped to attend after his bachelor of science degree and he was all set to go when he realized how much it would bother him not to visit his father that almost made him change his plans until he reminded himself that the only way his father might be cured was if he himself became a doctor and found that cure so after saying goodbye to his mother he told the broker to go to hell he went to college and halfway through his first year he learned from his mother that the lab had decided that it was futile to hope for a cure a number of recent deaths after patients were thawed had cast such doubt on cryonics that the lab had decided to stop the monthly payments the cryocompany charged for keeping anthonys father frozen for his part the broker refused to make the payments saying that it wasnt his responsibility and anyway what was the point since the freezing process had probably killed anthonys father anyhow taking a job as a waiter in a restaurant sometimes working double shifts even as he struggled to maintain his grades anthony managed to earn just enough to make the payments but in his sophomore year he received a notice that the cryocompany was bankrupt from so many people refusing to make payments for the discredited process the contract that his mother had signed indemnified the company against certain situations in which it could no longer keep its clients frozen and bankruptcy was one of those situations smaller maintenance firms agreed to take the companys patients but the transfer would be so complicated and hence so expensive that anthony had to drop his classes and work fulltime at the restaurant in order to pay for it at school hed met a girl who continued to see him even though his exhausting schedule gave him spare time only at inconvenient hours he couldnt believe that hed finally found some brightness in his life and after he returned from making sure that his father was safely installed in a smaller facility after he resumed his classes completing his sophomore and junior year he began to talk to her about marriage i dont have much to offer but youre the gentlest most determined most hardworking person ive ever met id be proud to be your wife at the start we wont have much money because i have to pay for my fathers maintenance but well live on what i earn after youre a doctor you can take care of me therell be plenty enough for us and our children and your father how many children would you like three anthony laughed youre so sure of the number its good to hear you laugh you make me laugh by the time youre a doctor maybe therell be a cure for your father and you wont have to worry about him anymore isnt it nice to think so anthonys mother died in a car accident the year he entered medical school her remarriage had been so unsatisfying that shed taken to drinking heavily and had been intoxicated when she veered from the road and crashed into a ravine at the funeral the broker hardly acknowledged anthony and his fiancee that night anthony cried in her arms as he remembered the wonderful family he had once been a part of and how badly everything had changed when his father had gotten sick he took his fiancee to the firm that now maintained his father since the transfer anthony had been able to afford returning to his hometown to visit his father only sporadically the distance made him anxious because the new firm didnt inspire the confidence that the previous one had it looked on the edge of disrepair floors not dirty but not clean walls not exactly faded and yet somehow in need of painting rooms seemed vaguely underlit the units in which patients were kept frozen looked cheap the temperature gauges were primitive compared to the elaborate technology at the previous facility but as long as they kept his father safe that thought left anthony when he took another look at the gauge and realized that the temperature inside his fathers chamber had risen one degree from when hed last checked it whats wrong his fiancee asked words caught in his throat all he could do was point the temperature had gone up yet another degree he raced along corridor after corridor desperate to find a maintenance worker he burst into the companys office and found only a secretary my father startled the secretary took a moment to react when he finished explaining she phoned the control room no one answered its almost noon the technicians must have gone to lunch for gods sake wheres the control room at the end of the corridor where his father was as anthony raced past the niche he saw that the temperature gauge had gone up fifteen degrees he charged into the control room saw flashing red lights on a panel and hurried to them trying to figure out what was wrong among numerous gauges eight temperature needles were rising and anthony was certain that one of them was for his father he flicked a switch beneath each of them hoping to reset the controls the lights kept flashing he flicked a switch at the end of their row nothing changed he pulled a lever every light on the panel went out jesus pushing the lever back to where it had been he held his breath exhaling only when all the lights came back on the eight that had been flashing were now constant sweating he eased onto a chair gradually he became aware of people behind him and turned to where his fiancee and the secretary watched in dismay from the open door then he stared at the panel watching the temperature needles gradually descend to where they had been terrified that the lights would start flashing again he was still concentrating on the gauges an hour later when a bored technician returned from lunch it turned out that a faulty valve had restricted the flow of freezant around eight of the niches when anthony had turned the power off and on the valve had reset itself although it could fail again at any time and would have to be replaced the technician explained then do it he would never again be comfortable away from his father it made him nervous to return to medical school he contacted the cryofirm every day making sure there werent any problems he married became a parent of a lovely daughter graduated and was lucky enough to be able to do his internship in the city where hed been raised and where he could keep a close watch on his fathers safety if only his father had been awake to see him graduate he thought if only his father had been cured and could have seen his granddaughter being brought home from the hospital one night while anthony was on duty in the emergency ward a comatose patient turned out to be the broker whod married his mother the broker had shot himself in the head anthony tried everything possible to save him his voice tightened when he pronounced the time of death he joined a medical practice in his hometown after he finished his internship he started earning enough to make good on his promise and take care of his wife after shed spent so many years taking care of him she had said that she wanted three children and she got them sooner than she expected for the next time she gave birth it was to twins a boy and a girl nonetheless anthonys work prevented him from spending as much time with his family as he wanted for his specialty was blood diseases and when he wasnt seeing patients he was doing research trying to find a way to cure his father he needed to know the experiments that the lab had conducted and the types of rays that his father might have been exposed to but the lab was obsessed with security and refused to tell him he fought to get a court order to force the lab to cooperate judge after judge refused meanwhile he was sadly conscious of all the family celebrations that his father continued to miss the day anthonys first daughter started grade school the afternoon the twins began swimming lessons the evening anthonys second daughter played chopsticks at her first piano recital anthony was thirtyfive before he knew it then forty all of a sudden his children were in high school his wife went to law school he kept doing research when he was fiftyfive and his eldest daughter turned thirty she was married with a daughter of her own the laboratory made a mistake and released the information anthony needed among a batch of old data that the lab felt was harmless it wasnt anthony who discovered the information but instead a colleague two thousand miles away who had other reasons to look through the old data and recognized the significance of the type of rays that anthonys father had been exposed to helped by his colleagues calculations anthony devised a treatment tested it on computer models subjected rats to the same type of rays found that they developed the same rapid symptoms as his father had gave the animals the treatment and felt his pulse quicken when the symptoms disappeared as rapidly as they had come on with his wife next to him anthony stood outside his fathers cryochamber as arrangements were made to thaw him he feared that the technicians would make an error during the procedure the word echoed from his youth that his father wouldnt wake up his muscles compacted as something hissed and the door swung open the hatch slid out anthonys father looked the same as when hed last seen him naked gaunt and gray suspended over a force field you thawed him that quickly anthony asked it doesnt work if it isnt instantaneous his fathers chest moved up and down my god hes alive anthony said hes actually but there wasnt time to marvel the disease would be active again racing to complete its destruction anthony hurriedly injected his father with the treatment we have to get him to a hospital he stayed in his fathers room constantly monitoring his fathers condition injecting new doses of the treatment precisely on schedule to his amazement his father improved almost at once the healthier color of his skin made obvious what the blood tests confirmed the disease was retreating not that his father knew one effect of being thawed was that the patient took several days to wake up anthony watched for a twitch of a finger a flicker of an eyelid to indicate that his father was regaining consciousness after three days he became worried enough to order another brain scan but as his father was being put in the machine a murmur made everyone stop where am i anthonys father asked in a hospital youre going to be fine his father strained to focus on himwho your son no my sons a child looking frightened anthonys father lost consciousness the reaction wasnt unexpected but anthony had his own quite different reaction to deal with while his father hadnt seen him age and hence didnt know who anthony was anthonys father hadnt aged and hence looked exactly as anthony remembered the only problem was that anthonys memory came from when he was nine and now at the age of fiftyfive he looked at his thirtytwoyearold father who wasnt much older than anthonys son marians dead anthony reluctantly nodded yes a car accident when anthony had trouble saying it twentytwo years ago no im afraid its true ive been frozen fortysix years no one told me what was going to happen we couldnt you were unconscious near death his father wept our house was sold a long time ago my friends anthony looked a way with a shudder his father pressed his hands to his face its worse than being dead no anthony said you heard the psychiatrist depressions a normal part of coming back youre going to have to learn to live again just like learning to walk again his father said bitterly your muscles never had a chance to atrophy as far as your bodys concerned no time passed since you were frozen but as far as my mind goes learn to live again thats something nobody should have to do are you saying that mom and i should have let you die our lives would have gone on just the same mom would have been killed whether you were frozen or you died nothing would have changed except that you wouldnt be here now with your mother gone anthony waited with my son gone im your son my son had his ninth birthday two weeks ago i gave him a new computer game that i looked forward to playing with him ill never get to see him grow up to see me grow up but im here now we can make up for lost time lost time the words seemed like dust in his fathers mouth dad it was the last time anthony used that termthis is your grandson paul these are your granddaughters sally and jane and this is janes son peter your greatgrandson seeing his fathers reaction to being introduced to grandchildren who were almost as old as he was anthony felt heartsick fortysix years but everything changed in a second his father said it makes my head spin so much ill teach you anthony said ill start with basics and explain what happened since you were frozen ill move you forward look here are virtual videos of what are virtual videos of news shows from back then well watch them in sequence well talk about them eventually well get you up to the present anthonys father pointed toward the startlingly lifelike videos from fortysix years earlier thats the present is there anything youd like to do go to marian so anthony drove him to the mausoleum where his father stood for a long time in front of the niche that contained her urn one instant shes alive the next tears filled his fathers eyes take me home but when anthony headed north of the city his father put a trembling hand on his shoulder no youre taking the wrong direction but we live at home i want to go home so anthony drove him back to the old neighborhood where his father stared at the rundown house that he had once been proud to keep in perfect condition weeds filled the yard windows were broken porch steps were missing there used to be a lawn here anthonys father said i worked so hard to keep it immaculate i remember anthony said i taught my son how to do somersaults on it you taught me in an instant his father sounded anguished all gone in an instant anthony peered up from his breakfast of black coffee seeing his father at the entrance to the kitchen it had been two days since theyd spoken i want to tell you his father said that i realize you made an enormous effort for me i can only imagine the pain and sacrifice im sorry if imno matter how confused i feel i want to thank you anthony managed to smile comparing the wrinklefree face across from him to the weary one that hed seen in the mirror that morning im sorry too that youre having such a hard adjustment all mom and i thought of was you were so sick we were ready to do anything that would help you your mother anthonys father needed a moment before he could continue grief doesnt last just a couple of days it was anthonys turn to need a moment he nodded ive had much of my life to try to adjust to mom being gone but i still miss her youll have a long hard time catching up to me i yes i dont know what to do for starters why dont you let me make you some breakfast anthonys wife was defending a case in court itll be just the two of us do waffles sound okay theres some syrup in that cupboard how about orange juice the first thing anthonys father did was learn how to drive the new types of vehicles anthony believed this was a sign of improving mental health but then he discovered that his father was using his mobility not to investigate his new world instead to visit marians ashes in the mausoleum and to go to the oncepristine house that hed owned fortysix years previously a time period that to him was yesterday anthony had done something similar when hed lied to his mothers second husband about being at the library when actually hed been at the cryofirm visiting his father it worried him i found a for sale sign at the house his father said one evening at dinner i want to buy it but anthony set down his fork the place is a wreck it wont be after im finished with it anthony felt as if he argued not with his father but with one of his children when they were determined to do something that he thought unwise i cant stay here his father said i cant live with you for the rest of my life why not youre welcome a father and his grownup son well get in each others way but weve gotten along so far i want to buy the house continuing to feel that he argued with his son anthony gave in as he always did all right okay fine ill help you get a loan ill help with the down payment but if youre going to take on this kind of responsibility youll need a job thats something else i want to talk to you about his father used his maintenance skills to become a successful contractor whose specialty was restoring oldstyle homes to their former beauty other contractors tried to compete but anthonys father had an edge he knew those houses inside and out hed helped build them when he was a teenager working on summer construction jobs hed maintained his when that kind of house was in its prime almost a half century earlier most important he loved that old style of house one house in particular the house where hed started to raise his family as soon as the renovation was completed he found antique furniture from the period when anthony visited he was amazed by how closely the house resembled the way it had looked when he was a child his father had arranged to have marians urn released to him it sat on a shelf in a study off the living room next to it were framed pictures of anthony and his mother when theyd been young the year anthonys father had gotten sick his father found antique audio equipment from back then the only songs he played were from that time he even found an old computer and the game that hed wanted to play with anthony teaching his greatgrandson how to play it just as hed already taught the little boy how to do somersaults on the lawn anthony turned sixty the hectic years of trying to save his father were behind him he reduced his hours at the office he followed an interest in gardening and taught himself to build a greenhouse his father helped him i need to ask you something his father said one afternoon when the project was almost completed you make it sound awfully serious his father looked down at his calloused hands i have to ask your permission about something permission anthonys frown deepened his wrinkles yes iits been five years iback then you told me that i had to learn to live again youve been doing a good job of it anthony said i fought it for a long time his father looked more uncomfortable whats wrong i dont know how to say it i loved your mother to the depth of my heart anthony nodded pained with emotion i thought id die without her his father said five years i never expectedive met somebody the sister of a man whose house im renovating weve gotten to know each other andwell iwhat i need to ask is would you object would you see it as a betrayal of your mother if anthony felt pressure in his tear ducts would i object his eyes misted all i want is for you to be happy anthony was the best man at his fathers wedding his stepmother was the same age as his daughters the following summer he had a halfbrother sixtyone years younger than himself it felt odd to see his father acting toward the baby in the same loving manner that his father had presumably acted toward him when he was a baby at the celebration when the child was brought home from the hospital several people asked anthony if his wife was feeling ill she looked wan shes been working hard on a big trial coming up he said the next day she had a headache so bad that he took her to his clinic and had his staff do tests the day after that she was dead the viral meningitis that killed her was so virulent that nothing could have been done to save her the miracle was that neither anthony nor anybody else in the family had caught it especially the new baby he felt drained plodding through his house he tried to muster the energy to get through each day the nights were harder his father often came and sat with him a young man next to an older one doing his best to console him anthony visited his wifes grave every day on the anniversary of her death while picking flowers for her he collapsed from a stroke the incident left him paralyzed on his left side in need of constant care his children wanted to put him in a facility no his father said its my turn to watch over him so anthony returned to the house where his youth had been wonderful until his father had gotten sick during the many hours they spent together his father asked anthony to fill in more details of what had happened as anthony had grown up the arguments hed had with the broker his double shifts as a waiter his first date with the woman who would be his wife yes i can see it his father said the next stroke reduced anthonys intelligence to that of a nineyearold he didnt have the capacity to know that the computer on which he played a game with his father came from long ago in fact the game was the same one that his father had given him on his ninth birthday two weeks before his father had gotten sick the game that hed never had a chance to play with his son one morning he no longer had a nineyearolds ability to play the game his neurological functions are decreasing rapidly the specialist said nothing can be done anthonys father asked im sorry at this ratein a couple of days anthonys father felt as if he had a stone in his stomach well make him as comfortable here as possible the specialist said no my son should die at home anthonys father sat next to the bed holding his sons frail hand painfully reminded of having taken care of him when anthony had been sick as a child now anthony looked appallingly old for sixtythree his breathing was shallow his eyes were open glassy not registering anything anthonys children and grandchildren came to pay their last respects at least hell be at peace his second daughter said anthonys father couldnt bear it he didnt give up on me i wont give up on him that theorys been discredited the specialist said it works in isolated cases but im one of them of the few at your fathers age he might not survive the procedure are you refusing to make the arrangements im trying to explain that with the expense and the risk my son will be dead by tomorrow being frozen cant be worse than that and as far as the expense goes he worked hard he saved his money he can afford it but theres no guarantee a treatment will ever be developed for brain cells as damaged as your sons are theres no guarantee it wont be developed either he cant give his permission he doesnt need to he made me his legal representative all the same his children need to be consulted there are issues of estate a risk of a lawsuit ill take care of his children you take care of the arrangements they stared at him anthonys father suspected they resisted the idea because they didnt want to drain money from their inheritance look im begging hed have done this for you he did it for me for gods sake you cant give up on him they stared harder its not going to cost you anything ill work harder and pay for it myself ill sign control of the estate over to you all i want is dont try to stop me anthonys father stood outside the cryochamber studying the stickon plaque that hed put on the hatch it gave anthonys name his birthdate when hed had his first stroke and when hed been frozen sweet dreams it said at the bottom wake up soon soon was a relative word of course anthony had been frozen six years and there was still no progress in a treatment but that didnt mean there wouldnt be progress tomorrow or next month theres always hope anthonys father thought youve got to have hope on a long narrow table in the middle of the corridor there were tokens of affection left by loved ones of other patients family photographs a baseball glove and a guitar pick anthonys father had left the disc of the computer game that he and anthony had been playing well play it again hed promised it was anthonys fathers birthday he was fortynine he had gray in his sideburns wrinkles in his forehead ill soon look like anthony did when i woke up from being frozen and saw him leaning over me he thought he couldnt subdue the discouraging notion that one of these days hed be the same age as anthony when hed been frozen but now that he thought about it maybe that notion wasnt so discouraging if they found a treatment that year and they woke anthony up and the treatment workedwed both be sixtysix we could grow old together ill keep fighting for you anthony i swear you can count on me i couldnt let you die before me its a terrible thing for a father to outlive his son douglas winter is a fiction writer run critic books about stephen king and clive barker anthologist and attorney his first anthology prime evil is one of the great collections of the macabre in the mids he phoned to tell me about a second anthology he was planning millennium when published in the book was retitled revelations because of a conflict with a tv series that had the same name but the original title millennium givesyou a sense of what doug had in mind he invited various writers to choose a decade in the twentieth century and write an apocalyptic story about it one that would be rooted in history and give a sense of the ultimate issues that the decade had faced i was immediately intrigued as many of my novels show the professor in me has always loved working with history the forties fifties and sixties had already been taken doug said so which of the remaining decades did i want the teens i said because of the first world war no although the war would be in the story the subject i wanted to dramatize had been potentially more apocalyptic than the war and foreshadowed later similar global threats it gave me nightmares if i should die before i wake it wasnt the first case but it was dr jonas bingamans first case although he would not realize that until two days later the patient a boy with freckles and red hair lay listlessly beneath the covers of his bed bingaman who had been leaving his office for the evening when the boys anxious mother telephoned paused at the entrance to the narrow bedroom and assessed immediately that the boy had a fever it wasnt just that joey carter whom bingaman had brought into the world ten years earlier was red in the face after all the summer of had been uncommonly hot and even now at the end of august the doctor was treating cases of sunburn no what made him conclude so quickly that joey had a fever was that despite the lingering heat joey was shivering under a sheet and two blankets hes been like this since he came home just before supper joeys mother rebecca said a slim plain woman of thirtyfive she entered joeys room ahead of the doctor and gestured urgently for him to follow i found his wet bathing suit hed been swimming at the creek i warned him about that creek joeys father edward said elmdales best carpenter the gangly man still wore his coveralls and work boots and had traces of sawdust in his thick dark hair i told him to stay away from it the creek bingaman turned toward edward who waited anxiously in the hallway the waters no good makes you sick i know cause bill kendricks boy got sick swimming in it last summer breathed wrong swallowed some of the water threw up all night long i warned joey not to go near it but he wouldnt listen the creek through larrabees farm thats the one the cattle mess in the water the stuff flows downstream and into the swimming hole yes i remember bill kendricks boy getting sick from the water last summer bingaman said has joey been vomiting no rebeccas voice was strained id better take a look as bingaman went all the way into the room he noted a baseball bat in a corner a balsawood model of one of the curtiss biplanes that the american expeditionary force was using against the germans hung above the bed attached by a cord to the ceiling not feeling well joey it took an obvious effort for the boy to shake his head no his eyelids were barely open he coughed been swimming in the creek joey had trouble nodding shoulda listened to dad he murmured hoarsely next time youll know the right thing to do but for now i want you to concentrate on getting better im going to examine you joey ill try to be as gentle as i can bingaman opened his black bag and leaned over joey feeling heat come off the boy joeys mother and father stepped closer watching intently joeys cough deepened ten minutes later bingaman put his stethoscope back into his bag and straightened is that what it is edward asked quickly bad water from larrabees farm bingaman hesitated why dont we talk somewhere else and let joey rest downstairs the evenings uneaten dinner of potatoes carrots and pork chops cooled in pots and a frying pan on the stove but what do you think it is rebecca asked the moment they were seated at the kitchen table how serious is this edward demanded his temperatures a hundred and two his glands are swollen he has congestion in his lungs my god you dont think he has diphtheria from the water rebeccas anxiety was nearing a quiet panic edward stared at the floor and shook his head i was afraid of this no i dont think its diphtheria bingaman said joeys father peered up hoping some of the symptoms are those of diphtheria but diphtheria presents bluishwhite lesions that have the consistency of leather the lesions are surrounded by inflammation and are visible near the tonsils and in the nostrils but joey doesnt have the lesions bingaman said i think he may have bronchitis bronchitis ill know more when i examine him again tomorrow in the meantime lets treat his symptoms give him onehalf an adult dose of aspirin every six hours give him a sponge bath with rubbing alcohol both will help to keep down his fever when his pajamas and bedding get sweaty change them keep his window open the fresh air will help chase the germs from his chest and joeys father asked bingaman didnt understand thats all thats the most you can do that and tell you to make certain he drinks plenty of water if he can keep it down its water that got him into this trouble possibly did joey tell you if any other boys went swimming with him yes pete williams ben slocum bingaman nodded he not only knew them he had delivered them just as he had delivered joey take joeys temperature every couple of hours telephone me if it gets higher or if other symptoms appear mrs williams this is dr bingaman calling this might sound strange but i was wondering is your son pete feeling all right no fever no swollen glands no congestion he made another call nothing like that at all mrs slocum your sons as fit as can be good thank you give my regards to your husband why did i telephone to ask just a random survey you know how i like to make sure elmdales students are all in good health before they go back to school good night thanks again bingaman set the longstemmed ear piece onto the wooden wall phone in the front corridor of his home troubled he shut off the overhead light and leaned against the wall peering out his frontdoor window twilight was dimming in the yard fireflies began to twinkle a model t rattled past on a porch across the street illuminated by a glow of light from the livingroom window over there harry webster sat in his rocking chair smoking his pipe jonas whats wrong bingaman turned to his wife marion whose broadshouldered outline approached him in the shadows of the hallway the daughter of a german immigrant an ancestry that she avoided mentioning given the war in europe marion had been raised on a farm in upstate new york before she received her nurses training and her robust appearance had been one of the reasons that bingaman was initially attracted to her twentyfive years ago now at the age of fiftytwo she was as robust as ever and he loved her more than ever true the honeycolored hair that he enjoyed stroking had acquired streaks of silver but then his own hair had not only turned silvery but had thinned until he was almost bald marion called it distinguished wrong bingaman echoed im not sure anythings wrong youve been pensive since you came home for dinner after visiting joey carter its a problem ive been mulling over joey seems to have bronchitis his father thinks he got it from swimming in infected water this afternoon but bronchitis takes several days to develop and none of the boys joey went swimming with is sick what are you thinking whatever it is joey must have gotten it somewhere else but usually i dont see just one case of bronchitis it spreads around so where did he catch it if no one else in town has it rebecca carter fidgeted at the open screen door impatient for bingaman to climb the front steps and enter the house i was afraid i wouldnt be able to reach you actually when you telephoned i was just about to drive over joeys the first patient on my list this morning feeling burdened by the weight he had put on recently bingaman started up the stairs to the second level then paused frowning when he heard labored coughing from the bedroom directly at the top has joey been coughing like that all night not as bad rebeccas face was haggard from lack of sleep this started just before dawn ive been giving him aspirin and sponge baths like you told me but they dont seem to do any good the doctor hurried up the stairs alarmed by what he saw when he entered the bedroom joey looked smaller under the covers his face was much redder but he also had a dark blue color around his lips his chest heaved as if he was coughing even when he wasnt bingaman went urgently to work removing instruments from his bag noting that joeys temperature had risen to a hundred and four that his lungs sounded more congested that the inside of his throat was inflamed that his glands were more swollen and that the boy didnt have the energy to respond to questions the day before joeys pulse and respiration rate had been and now they were and im sorry to tell you this mrs carter whats wrong with him it might be pneumonia rebecca carter gasped i know youd prefer to keep him at home bingaman said but whats best for joey right now is to admit him to the hospital rebecca looked as if she doubted her sanity as if she couldnt possibly be hearing what the doctor had just told her no i can take care of him im sure you can but joey needs special treatment that isnt available here rebecca looked more frightened like what ill explain after i telephone the hospital and make the arrangements hoping that he had distracted her bingaman hurried downstairs to the wall phone near the front door what he didnt want to tell her was that the dark blue color around joeys mouth was an indication of cyanosis the congestion in the boys lungs was preventing him from getting enough oxygen if joey wasnt hooked up to an oxygen tank at the hospital he might asphyxiate from the fluid in his lungs it certainly has the symptoms of pneumonia the elmdale hospitals chief of staff told bingaman his name was brian powell and his wiry frame contrasted with bingamans portly girth the two physicians had been friends for years and powell who happened to be in the emergency ward when joey carter was admitted had invited bingaman to his office for a cup of coffee afterward in his mind bingaman kept hearing mrs carter sob but if it is pneumonia how did he get it bingaman ignored the steaming cup of coffee on the desk in front of him do you have any patients who present these symptoms powell shook his head during the winter the symptoms wouldnt be unusual colds and secondary infections leading to pneumonia but in summer id certainly remember it just doesnt make any sense bingaman sweated under his suit coat why is joey the only one no rebecca carter waited outside joeys hospital room in the hopes that shed be allowed to enter her eyes were red from tears nothing different it was just an ordinary summer we did what we always do and what would that be bingaman asked rebecca dabbed a handkerchief against her eyes picnics joey likes to play baseball we go to the park and edward teaches him how to pitch and the movies sometimes we go to the movies joey likes charlie chaplin thats it thats all just an ordinary summer i have my sewing club we dont often get a chance to do things as a family because edward works late taking advantage of the good weather why do you ask didnt joey get sick from the water in the creek can you think of anything else that joey did this summer anything even the slightest bit unusual no im sorry i she was interrupted by her husband hurrying along the hospital corridor rebecca edward carters lean face glistened with sweat i decided to come home for lunch and check on joey mrs wade next door said you and he had gone tomy god doctor whats wrong with joey were still trying to find that out it might be pneumonia pneumonia the door to joeys room opened for a moment the group had a brief glimpse of joey covered by sheets in a metal bed an oxygen mask over his face then a nurse came out and shut the door how is he joeys mother asked lightheaded the nurse answered he keeps talking about feeling as if hes on a ferris wheel ferris wheel bingaman asked hes probably remembering the midway joeys father said midway in riverton last week i had to drive over there to get some special lumber for a job im working on joey went with me we spent an hour at the midway he really loved the ferris wheel yes patients with fever swollen glands and congestion bingaman explained using the telephone in dr powells office a possible diagnosis of pneumonia he was speaking to the chief of staff at rivertons hospital fifty miles away nothing not one case why am i im trying to understand how one of my patients came down with these symptoms he was in riverton last week i thought perhaps the midway you had thereif you remember anything would you please call me thank you bingaman hooked the ear piece onto the telephone and rubbed the back of his neck throughout the conversation powell had remained seated behind his desk studying him take it easy pneumonia can be like pollen in the wind youll probably never know where the boy caught the disease bingaman stared out a window toward a robin in an elm tree pollen in the wind he exhaled you know what im like im compulsive i think too much i cant leave well enough alone and in this case my patient isnt doing well at all marion watched him stare at his plate you dont like the pot roast what bingaman looked up ohim sorry i guess im not much company tonight youre still bothered bingaman raised some mashed potatoes on his fork i dont like feeling helpless youre not helpless this afternoon you did a lot of good for the patients who came to your office without tasting the potatoes bingaman set down the fork because their problems were easy to correct i can stitch shut a gash in an arm i can prescribe bicarbonate of soda for an upset stomach i can recommend a salve that reduces the itch of poison ivy and stops the rash from spreading but aside from fighting the symptoms there is absolutely nothing i can do to fight pneumonia we try to reduce joeys fever keep him hydrated and give him oxygen after that its all a question of whether the boy is strong enough to fight the infection its out of my hands its in gods hands and sometimes god can be cruel the war certainly shows that marion said she was american stoutly loyal but her german ancestry made her terribly aware that good men were dying on both sides of the hindenberg line all those needless deaths from infected wounds bingaman tapped his fork against his plate in a way its like joeys infection lord how i wish i were young again in medical school again i keep up with the journals but i cant help feeling im using outmoded techniques i wish id gone into research microbiology id give anything to be able to attack an infection at its source maybe some day someone will invent a drug that tracks down infectious microbes and kills them it would certainly make your job easier but in the meantime bingaman nodded solemnly we do what we can youve been putting in long hours why dont you do something for yourself go up to your study try out the wireless radio you bought id almost forgotten about that you certainly were determined when you spent that sunday afternoon installing the antenna on the roof and you were certainly determined to warn me i was going to fall off the roof and break my neck bingaman chuckled that radio seemed like an exciting thing when i bought it a wonder of the twentieth century it still is the ability to talk to someone in another state in another country without wires to listen to a ship at sea or a report from a battlefield bingaman sobered well that part isnt wonderful the rest of it thoughyes i believe i will do something for myself tonight but the telephone rang as he walked down the hallway to go upstairs wearily he unhooked the ear piece and leaned toward the microphone hello he listened oh his voice dropped oh his tone became somber im on my way an emergency marion asked bingaman felt pressure in his chest joey carter is dead marion turned pale dear lord with oxygen i thought he had a chance tohow terrible he felt paralyzed and struggled to rouse himself id better go see the parents but after bingaman put on his suit coat and reached for his black bag the telephone rang again he answered listened and when he replaced the ear piece he felt older and more tired what is it marion touched his arm that was the hospital again joeys father just collapsed with a hundredandtwo fever hes coughing his glands are swollen the two boys joey went swimming with now have joeys symptoms also their parents just brought them into the emergency ward if it was only joeys two friends id say yes they might all have gotten sick from swimming in larrabees creek bingaman told dr powell who had returned to the hospital in response to bingamans urgent summons it was midnight they sat across from each other in powells office a pale desk lamp making their faces look sallow the trouble is joeys father didnt go anywhere near that creek and hes got the infection too youre still thinking of river ton its the only answer that makes sense joey probably got infected at the midway maybe a worker sneezed on him maybe it was a passenger on the ferris wheel however it happened he then passed the infection on to his father and his two friends they showed symptoms a day after he did because theyd been infected later than joey was infected by joey its logical except for one thing whats that why hasnt joeys mother someone knocked on the door without waiting for an answer a nurse rushed in im sorry to disturb you but i was certain youd want to know mrs carter just collapsed with the same symptoms as her son and husband both doctors sprang to their feet well have to implement quarantine precautions bingaman rushed from the office yes powell hurried next to him no visitors mandatory gauze masks for medical personnel anybody who goes into those rooms the emergency ward should be disinfected good idea bingaman moved faster and the room where joey died the nurses who treated him had better scrub down theyd better put on clean uniforms in case theyve been contaminated but we still dont know how to treat this aside from what weve already tried and that didnt work bingamans chest felt hollow if youre right about how the infection started why havent there been cases in riverton powell sounded out of breath i dont know in fact theres almost nothing i do know when do we get the results from joey carters autopsy the stoopshouldered man peeled off his rubber gloves dropped them into a medical waste bin then took off his gauze mask and leaned against a locker his name was peter talbot a surgeon he also functioned as elmdales medical examiner he glanced from bingaman to powell and said the lungs were completely filled with fluid it would have been impossible for the boy to breathe bingaman stepped closer could the fluid have accumulated subsequent to his death what are you suggesting another cause of death did you examine the brain of course was there any sign of what exactly are you looking for could the cause of death have been something as highly contagious as meningitis no no sign of meningitis what killed this boy attacked his lungs pneumonia powell said theres no reason to discount the initial diagnosis except that pneumonia doesnt normally spread this fast spread this fast talbot straightened you have other cases four since the boy died good lord i know this sounds like the start of an epidemic but caused by what bingaman rubbed his forehead ill try to find out talbot pointed toward a table i have tissue samples ready to be cultured ill do my best to identify the microorganism responsible what else can we bingaman started toward the door i think its time to make another telephone call to the riverton hospital blood drained from bingamans face as he listened to the doctor in charge of the emergency room at the riverton hospital but i asked your chief of staff to get in touch with me if any cases were reported damn him bingaman thought too busy no time yes and im very much afraid were all going to get a lot busier as he turned from the telephone he couldnt help noticing the apprehension on powells face how many cases do they have twelve bingaman answered twelve they were all admitted within the past few hours two of the patients have died he parked his model t in his driveway and extinguished the headlights the time was after three am and he had hoped that the chugchug rattlerattle of the automobile would not waken his wife but he saw a pale yellow glow appear in the window of the master bedroom and he shook his head discouraged wishing he still owned a horse and buggy the air had a foul odor from the cars exhaust fumes too many inventions too many complications even so he thought theres one invention you do wish fora drug that eliminates infectious microbes exhausted he got out of the car marion had the front door open waiting for him as he climbed the steps onto the porch you look awful she took his bag and put an arm around him guiding him into the house its been that kind of night bingaman explained what was happening at the hospital the new patients hed examined and the treatment hed prescribed in addition to aspirin were using quinine to control the fever were rubbing camphor oil on the patients chests and having them breathe through strips of cloth soaked in it to try to keep their bronchial passages open is that working we dont know yet im so tired i can hardly think straight let me put you to bed marion what im not sure how to say this just go ahead and say it if this disease is as contagious as it appears to be say it ive been exposed to the infection maybe you ought to keep a distance from me maybe we shouldnt sleep in the same bed after twentyfive years i dont intend to stop sleeping with you now i love you the patient robert wilson was a fortytwoyearold blueeyed carpenter who worked with edward carter the man had swollen glands and congested lungs he complained of a headache and soreness in his muscles his temperature was a hundred and one im afraid im going to have to send you to the hospital bingaman said hospital wilson coughed bingaman stepped back but i cant afford the time off work the heavyset carpenter said cant you just give me a pill or something dont i wish bingaman thought saying not in this case wilson raised a hand to his mouth and coughed again his blue eyes were glassy but what do i have ill need to do more tests on you at the hospital bingaman said his professional tone cloaking the truth what do you have he thought whatever killed joey carter and killed joeys father bingaman learned after he finished with his mornings patients and arrived at the hospital joeys mother and the boys two friends werent doing well either struggling to breathe despite the oxygen they were being given and eight more cases had been admitted were still acting on the assumption that this is pneumonia powell said as they put on gauze masks and prepared to enter the quarantined ward are the quinine and camphor oil having any effect marginally some of the patients feel better for a time their temperatures go down briefly for example rebecca carters dropped from one hundred and four to one hundred and two i thought we were making progress but then her temperature shot up again some of these patients would have died without oxygen but i dont know how long our supply will last ive sent for more but our medical distributor in albany is having a shortage conscious of the tight mask on his face bingaman surveyed the quarantined ward seeing understaffed overworked nurses doing their best to make their patients comfortable hearing the hiss of oxygen tanks and the rack of coughing in a corner a curtain had been pulled around a bed some of the patients are coughing up blood powell said what did you just say blood theyre before that your medical distributor in albany is having a shortage of oxygen yes why their telegram didnt say could it be that too many other places need it what are you talking about the midway had to have come from somewhere to reach riverton after riverton it had to have gone somewhere jonas youre not suggesting do you suppose this whole section of the state is infected im sorry the operator said i cant get through to the switchboard in albany all the lines are busy all of them its the state capital so much business gets done there if everybodys trying to call the operator at once try riverton try the hospital there just a moment im sorry sir i cant get through to the operator there either the lines are busy bingaman gave the operator the names of three other major towns in the area the operator couldnt reach her counterparts in those districts all the lines were in use theyre not the state capital bingaman said whats going on that so many calls are being made at the same time i really have no idea sir well cant you interrupt and listen in only locally as i explained i dont have access to the other operators switchboards besides im not supposed to eavesdrop unless its an emergency thats what this is an emergency the operator coughed what sort of emergency bingaman managed to stop himself from telling her if im not careful he thought ill cause a panic ill try again later he hung up the telephones ear piece his head started aching no luck powell asked this is so damned frustrating but even if we do find out that this section of the state is affected that still wont help us to fight what weve got here it might if we knew what we were fighting bingaman massaged his throbbing temples if only we had a way to get in touch with a tingle rushed through him i do have a way the wireless radio sat on a desk in bingamans study it was black two feet wide a foot and a half tall and deep there were several dials and knobs a morsecode key and a microphone from the day marconi had transmitted the first transatlantic wireless message in bingaman had been fascinated by the phenomenon with each new dramatic development in radio communications his interest had increased until finally curious about whether hed be able to hear radio transmissions from the war in europe he had celebrated his fiftysecond birthday in march by purchasing the unit before him he had studied for and successfully passed the required government examination to become an amateur radio operator then having achieved his goal he had found that the demands of his practice not to mention middle age left him little energy to stay up late and talk to amateur radio operators around the country now however he felt greater energy than he could remember having felt in several years marion who was astonished to see her husband come home in the middle of the afternoon and hurry upstairs with barely a hello to her watched him remove his suit coat sit before the radio and turn it on when she asked him why he had come home so early he asked her to please be quiet he said he had work to do be quiet work to do jonas i know youve been under a lot of strain but thats no excuse for please marion watched with greater astonishment as bingaman turned knobs and spoke forcefully into the microphone identifying himself by name and the operator number that the government had given to him repeatedly trying to find someone to answer him static crackled sometimes marion heard an electronic whine she stepped closer feeling her husbands tension in surprise she heard a voice from the radio with relief bingaman responded yes harrisburg i read you he had hoped to raise an operator in albany or somewhere else in new york state but the capital city of neighboring pennsylvania was near enough an acceptable substitute he explained the reason he was calling the situation in which elmdale found itself the information he needed and he couldnt repress a groan when he received an unthinkable answer far worse than anything hed been dreading forty thousand no i cant be receiving you correctly harrisburg please repeat over but when the operator in harrisburg repeated what he had said bingaman still couldnt believe it forty thousand marion gasped when for only the third time in their marriage she heard him blaspheme dear sweet jesus help us spanish influenza bingamans tone was bleak the words a death sentence powell looked startled talbot leaned tensely forward youre quite certain i confirmed it from two other sources on the wireless the hastily assembled group which also consisted of elmdales other physician douglas bennett and the hospitals sixmember nursing staff looked devastated they were in the largest nonpublic room in the hospital the nurses rest area which was barely adequate to accomodate everyone the combined body heat causing a film of perspiration to appear on brows spanish influenza powell murmured as if testing the ominous words trying to convince himself that hed actually heard them spanish id have to check my medical books bennett said but as i recall the last outbreak of influenza was in eighteen eightynine bingaman said i did some quick research before i came back to the hospital almost thirty years talbot shook his head long enough to have hoped that the disease wouldnt be coming back the outbreak before that was in the winter of bingaman said in that case forty years apart resilient spanish influenza a pale nurse asked why are they calling it did this outbreak come from spain they dont know where it came from bingaman said but theyre comparing it to an outbreak in that did come from spain wherever it came from doesnt matter powell said standing the question is what are we going to do about it forty thousand bewildered he turned toward bingaman the wireless operator you spoke to confirmed that forty thousand patients with influenza in pennsylvania no that isnt correct you misunderstood me powell relaxed i hoped so that figure is almost impossible to believe its much worse than that worse not forty thousand patients with influenza forty thousand deaths someone inhaled sharply the room became very still deaths a nurse whispered thats only in pennsylvania the figures for new york city arent complete but its estimated that theyre getting two thousand new cases a day of those a hundred patients are dying per day a conservative estimate as many as fifteen thousand patients may have died there by now in new york state no in new york city but this is beyond imagination talbot said and theres more bingaman felt the group staring at him the wireless operators i spoke to have been in touch with other parts of the country spanish influenza has also broken out in philadelphia boston chicago denver san francisco and a fullfledged epidemic kramer said why havent we heard about it until now a nurse demanded exactly why werent we warned powells cheeks were flushed albany should have warned us they left us alone out here without protection if wed been alerted we could have taken precautions we could have stockpiled medical supplies we could havecould have his words seemed to choke him you want to know why we havent heard about it until now bingaman said because the telephone and the telegraph arent efficient how many people in elmdale have telephones a third of the population how many of those make longdistance calls very few because of the expense and who would they call most of their relatives live right here in town our newspaper isnt linked to associated press so the news we get is local until theres a national radio network and news can travel instantly across the country each citys more isolated than we like to think but as for why the authorities in albany didnt warn communities like elmdale about the epidemic well the wireless operators i spoke to have a theory that the authorities didnt want to warn anyone about the disease didnt to avoid panic there werent any public announcements the newspapers printed almost nothing about the possibility of an influenza outbreak but thats totally irresponsible the idea seems to have been to stop everyone from losing control and fleeing into the countryside each day the authorities evidently hoped that the number of new cases would dwindle that the worst would be over when things got back to normal order would have been maintained but things havent gone back to normal have they talbot said not at all talbots comment echoed ominously in bingamans mind as the meeting concluded and the doctors and nurses went out to the public part of the hospital what the medical personnel faced as they went to their various duties was the beginning of elmdales own chaos during the half hour of the meeting twenty new patients had shown up with what the staff now recognized as the symptoms of influenza high fever aching muscles severe headache sensitive vision dizziness difficulty in breathing the litany of coughing made bingaman terribly self conscious about the air he breathed he hurriedly reached for his gauze mask he had a mental vision of germs thousands and thousands of them spewing across the emergency room the mental image was so powerful that bingaman feared he was hallucinating mrs brady he told one of the untrained volunteer nurses whod been watching the emergency room while the meeting was in progress your mask you forgot to put on your mask and all these new patients need masks also we cant have them coughing over each other and over us bingaman thought in alarm the end of normalcy the chaos that had burst upon them wasnt signaled only by the welter of unaccustomed activity or by the dramatic increase in new patients what gave bingaman the sense of the potential scope of the unfolding nightmare was that elmdales hospital which was intended to serve the medical needs of the entire county now had more patients than its thirtybed capacity what are we going to do powell asked urgently we can put patients on mattresses and cots in the corridors but at this rate well soon use up those spaces the same applies to my office and the nurses rest area the head nurse virginia keel a strawberry blonde with a notoriously humorless personality turned from administering to a patient this wont do we need to establish an emergency facility a place big enough to accomodate so many patients the highschool gymnasium bingaman said the head nurse and the chief of staff looked at him as if hed lost his mind with school about to start you want to turn the gymnasium into a pest house powell asked in amazement who said anything about school starting powell looked shocked beginning to understand a third of our patients are children bingaman said at the moment i dont see any reason not to assume that well soon be receiving even more patients and a great many of them will be children it would be criminal to allow school to start that would only spread infection faster we need to speak to the school board we need to ask them to postpone school for several weeks until we realize the scope of what were dealing with maybe the epidemic will abate the look on your face tells me you dont think so powell said postpone the start of school mayor halloway who was also the head of the countys board of education blinked thats preposterous school is scheduled to start four days from now can you imagine the response id have to suffer from angry parents the ones who had telephones wouldnt stop calling me the ones who didnt would form a mob outside my office those parents want their lives to get back to normal theyve had enough of their children lollygagging around town all summer they want them in front of a blackboard again learning something a week from now if this epidemic keeps growing at the present rate those parents will be begging you to close the schools bingaman said then thatll be the time to close them halloway said blinking again when the people who elected me tell me what they want youre not listening to me bingaman put both hands on the mayors desk people are dying you need to take the initiative on this halloway stopped blinking im not prepared to make a hasty decision well make some kind of decision will you allow the highschool gymnasium to be turned into another hospital ill have to consult with the other members of the school board thats fine bingaman said angrily while youre consulting ill be setting up beds in the gym this is really as serious as you say it is serious enough that youre going to have to think about closing any places where people form crowds the restaurants the movie theater the stores the saloons the close the business district halloway jerked his head back so sharply that his spectacles almost fell off his nose close the maybe the saloons ive been getting more and more complaints from church groups about what goes on in them this prohibition movement is becoming awfully powerful but the restaurants and the stores all the uproar from the owners because of the business they would lose mayor halloway guffawed you might as well ask me to close the churches it might come to that mayor halloway suddenly wasnt laughing any longer hes worried about the epidemics effect on business bingaman thought in dismay as he drove his model t along elmdales deceptively sleepy streets toward the hospital well theres one business whose prosperity the mayor wont have to worry about the undertakers this premonition was confirmed when bingaman reached the hospitals gravel parking area alarmed to find it crammed with vehicles and buggies evidence of new patients he was further alarmed by powells distraught look when they met at the entrance to the noisy crowded emergency room eighteen more cases powell said three more deaths including joey carters mother for a moment bingaman couldnt catch his breath his headache which had persisted from yesterday had also worsened the emergency room felt unbearably hot sweat making his heavily starched shirt stick to him under his suit coat he wanted to unbutton his strangling shirt collar but knew that his position of authority prohibited such public informality has anybody warned ballard and standish he managed to ask he referred to elmdales two morticians powell nodded guiding bingaman into a corner away from the commotion in the emergency room his manner indicated that he didnt want to be overheard they didnt need to be told he whispered each has been here several times im still adjusting to what ballard said to me what was that powell dropped his voice even lower he said my god where am i going to get enough gravediggers where am i going to find enough coffins were out of oxygen elizabeth keel the head nurse stopped next to them were extremely low on aspirin quinine and camphor oil well have to get everything we can from the pharmacists downtown powell said before the townsfolk panic and start hoarding bingaman said but without medical supplies try to get fluids into them bingaman told the nurse do your best to keep them nourished soups custard anything bland and easy to digest but we dont have anyone to cook for the patients the womens league powell said well ask them to do the cooking and to help my nurses keel said even with the volunteers who arrived this morning im hopelessly understaffed who else can we ask to help us bingaman tried desperately to think has anyone spoken to the police department what about the volunteer fire department and the ministers they can spread the word among their congregations it was almost two am before bingaman managed to get home again he extinguished the headlights of his model t again a pale yellow light appeared in the bedroom window despite his weariness he managed to smile as marion met him at the door you cant keep going like this she said no choice have you eaten a sandwich on the go a cup of coffee here and there well youre going to sit at the kitchen table ill heat up the chicken and dumplings i made for supper not hungry youre not listening to what i said youre going to sit at the kitchen table bingaman laughed if you insist and tomorrow im going with you i should have done it today he suddenly became alert marion im not sure well i am im a trained nurse and im needed but this is different from what you think it is this is what one of our nurses collapsed today she has all the symptoms and the other nurses theyre exhausted but so far they havent gotten sick thank god then the odds are in my favor no i dont want to lose you marion i cant stay barricaded in this house and what about you look at the risk youre taking i dont want to lose you either but if you can take the risk so can bingaman almost continued to argue with her but he knew she was right the townsfolk needed help and neither of them would be able to bear the shame if they didnt fulfill their moral obligation hed seen amazing things today people whom he had counted on to volunteer telling him that he was crazy if he thought they would risk their lives to help patients with the disease others who never went to church or participated in community functions showing up to help without needing to be asked the idea had occurred to him that the epidemic was gods way of testing those who didnt die of determining who was worthy to be redeemed the idea grew stronger after he ate the chicken and dumplings that marion warmed up for him his favorite meal although he barely tasted it he went upstairs but instead of proceeding into the bedroom he entered his study sat wearily at his desk and turned on the wireless radio jonas in a moment hearing crackles and whines he turned knobs and watched dials periodically he spoke into the microphone identifying himself finally he contacted another operator this one in boston but as the operator described what was happening there the three thousand new cases per day in boston a death toll so fierce that the citys hearses were kept constantly busy bingaman brooded again about god according to the radio operator in boston there wasnt a community in the united states that hadnt been hit from minneapolis to new orleans from seattle to miami from north to south and west to east and everywhere in between people were dying at a sanitythreatening rate in canada and mexico in argentina and brazil england and france germany and russia china and japannot an epidemic a pandemic it wasnt just in the united states it was everywhere horrified bingaman thought about the bubonic plague known as the black death that had ravaged europe in the middle ages but what he was hearing about now was far more widespread than the black death had been and if the mortality figures being given to him were accurate the present scourge had the potential to be far more lethal lord the cold weather hadnt arrived yet what would happen when the worst of winter aggravated the symptoms of the disease bingaman had a nightmarish image of millions of frozen corpses strewn around the world with no one to bury them yes the spanish influenza was gods way of testing humanity of judging how the survivors reacted he thought then a further dismaying thought occurred to him making him shiver or could it possibly be the end of the world it appears to have started in kansas bingaman told the medical team they had agreed to meet every morning at eight in the nurses rest area at the hospital to relay information and subdue rumors after the meeting they would disperse to inform volunteers about what had been discussed kansas powell furrowed his brow in confusion i assumed it would have started somewhere more exotic at fort riley bingaman continued he had gotten only two hours sleep the night before and was fighting to muster energy his head throbbed that army facility is one of the main training areas for the allied expeditionary force in march it had a dust storm of unusual force dust talbot said ive been formulating a theory that dust is the principal means by which the disease is carried over distances he turned to the nurses we have to take extra precautions close every window eliminate the slightest dust in this heat elizabeth keel said as head nurse she never failed to speak her mind even to a doctor and with the patients high temperatures they wont be able to bear it talbots eyes flashed with annoyance that hed been contradicted before angry words could be exchanged bingaman distracted them there might be another agent responsible for the initial transmission i spoke to a wireless operator in kansas early this morning and he told me the theory at the camp is that the dust storm which turned the day into night for three hours left not only several inches of dust over everything in the camp but also ashes from piles of burned manure bennetts nostrils twitched burned manure bingaman nodded i realize that its an indelicate subject my apologies to the ladies but we cant stand on niceties during the present emergency theres a considerable cavalry detachment at fort riley thousands of mules and horses its estimated that those animals deposit nine thousand tons of manure a month in the camp an obvious hygiene problem that the forts commander attempted to alleviate by ordering his men to burn the droppings the smoke from the fires and then the ashes blown by the dust storm apparently spread infectious microbes throughout the entire camp subsequent to the storm so many soldiers came down with influenza symptoms that the surgeon general for the fort was afraid theyd take up all three thousand beds in the forts hospital fortunately the outbreak abated after five weeks and then powell frowned he seemed to have a premonition about what was coming two divisions were sent from the fort to join the rest of our expeditionary forces in europe influenza broke out on the troop ships when the soldiers arrived in france they spread it to our units and the british and the french presumably also to the germans at last count the royal navy alone has over ten thousand cases of influenza of course the civilian population has been affected too after that the disease spread from europe throughout asia and africa and everywhere else including of course back to america an alternate theory about the pandemics origin is that it started among farm animals in china and was introduced into france by chinese coolies whom the allies used to dig trenches perhaps the true origin will never be known but what about the death rate a nurse asked obviously afraid of the answer in three months the flu has killed more people in europe soldiers and civilians than have died in military operations on both sides during the entire four years of the war for several moments the group was speechless but youre talking about millions of deaths elizabeth keel said and many more millions who continue to suffer from the disease then yes bingaman turned to a visibly troubled nurse theres no hope bingaman shook his throbbing head if we believe that then there truly wont be any we must hope the nurse raised a hand to her mouth and coughed everyone else in the room tensed and leaned away from her bingaman helped finish admitting twentyfive new patients to the gymnasium that had been converted into a hospital as he and dr bennett left the spacious building which was rapidly being filled with occupied beds they squinted from the brilliant september sunlight and noticed corpses being loaded onto horsedrawn wagons how many died last night fifteen it keeps getting worse bingaman faltered whats the matter kramer asked arent you feeling well bingaman didnt reply but instead took labored steps toward one of the wagons the corpse of a woman in a nurses uniform was being lifted aboard but i saw her only yesterday how could this have happened so quickly ive been hearing reports that the symptoms are taking less time to develop bennett said behind him from the slightest hint of having been infected a person might suddenly have a fullblown case within twentyfour hours i heard a story this morning about a man apparently healthy who left his home to go to work he wasnt coughing none of his family noticed a fever he died on the street a block from the factory where he worked i heard another story yes four women were playing bridge last night the game ended at eleven none of them was alive in the morning bingamans chest felt heavy his shoulders ached his eyes hurt from lack of sleep he tried to assure himself he removed his gauze mask from his pocket having taken it off when he left the hospital from now on i think were going to have to wear our masks all the time even when were not with patients day or night at home or on duty everywhere at home isnt that a little extreme kramer asked is it bingaman gave the dead nurse in her twenties with long brown hair a final look as the wagon clattered away so young so much to live for he thought none of us is immune the disease is all around us theres no telling who might give it to us he glanced at kramer i keep remembering she was the nurse who coughed in the room with us yesterday dont touch me get away the outburst made bingaman look up from the patient he was examining he was in the middle of a row of beds in the gymnasium surrounded by determined activity as nurses and volunteers moved from patient to patient giving them water or soup if they were capable of eating then rubbing their feverish brows with ice wrapped in towels another team of volunteers took care of the unsavory hazardous problem of what to do with the bodily wastes from so many helpless people a stench of excrement sweat and death filled the now hopelessly small area contrary to dr talbots theories about dust and closed windows bingaman had ordered that all the windows in the gymnasium be opened nonetheless the foul odor inside the building made him nauseous i told you damn it get your filthy hands off me the objectionable language attracted bingamans attention as much as the sense of outrage the man responsible coughed hoarsely there bingaman saw to the right three rows over nurses volunteers and those few patients with a modicum of strength looked in that direction also you bitch if you touch me again the mans raspy voice disintegrated into a paroxysm of coughing such language could absolutely not be tolerated bingaman left the patient hed been examining veered between beds reached another row and veered between other beds approaching the commotion three men had evidently carried in a fourth who was sprawled on a cot resisting the attentions of a nurse bingamans indignation intensified at the thought of a nurse being called such things but what he heard next was even more appalling his emotions made it difficult for him to breathe you goddamn german marion the nurse the patient shouted at was bingamans wife the three men who had carried in the patient were pushing her away outraged bingaman reached the commotion dont you touch her whats going on here the patients face reddened from the fury with which he coughed spittle flew bingaman stepped back reflexively making sure that he stayed protectively in front of marion put these masks on no one comes in here without one whats the matter with you shes whats the matter one man said his voice was slurred he was tall wore work clothes and had obviously been drinking lousy german watch what youre saying hun kraut a second man said more beefy than the first yer not foolin anybody he too was obviously drunk yer the one who did it made my friend sick gave everybody the influenza what kind of nonsense spanish nothing the man on the bed coughed again he was losing strength despite his feverish cheeks he had alarming black circles around his eyes its the german influenza the first man took a tottering step toward marion how much did the kaiser pay you kraut pay her the second man said didnt need to pay the bitch shes a german aint she germans love killing americans ive heard enough bingaman shook with rage get out of this hospital now i swear ill send for a policeman and leave her the third man pointed drunkenly past bingaman toward marion leave her to kill more americans shes the one brought the influenza here the german influenza this is how the kaiser thinks hes gonna win the war damned murderous kraut i wont tell you again leave this instant or ill bingaman stepped toward the men urging them toward the door the first man braced himself muttered the huns killed my son in france you goddamn krautlover and struck the doctors face time seemed to stop at once it began again hearing exclamations around him bingaman lurched back distantly aware of blood spewing from his lips beneath his mask then something struck his nose and he saw double blood spurted from his nostrils he lost control of his legs he seemed to float when he struck the floor he heard faraway screaming then everything was a blur he had a vague sense of being lifted carried he heard distant urgent voices his mind reeled as he was set on something a cot in a shadowy supply room at the rear of the gymnasium jonas are you all right jonas he recognized marions voice each anxious word sounded closer as if she was leaning down jonas yes i think im all right let me get your mask off so you can breathe no cant risk contamination leave it on she was wiping blood from his face ill give you a clean one jonas a mans voice worried powell im only dazed bingaman answered slowly caught me by surprise his words seemed to echo ill be all right in a moment he tried to sit up but he felt as if he had ball bearings in his skull and they all rolled backward forcing his head down those men are they gone a policeman did you send for one what would be the point when they closed the schools the restaurants and the stores they also emptied the jail there isnt any place to put those men cant understand what got into them accusing marion outrageous bingaman said he managed to open his eyes and focus his aching vision he saw marions worried face and powells which had a reluctant expression what is it what arent you telling me bingaman asked this isnt the first time i dont understand people are frightened powell said they cant accept that its random and meaningless they want easy explanations something specific i still dont understand someone to blame the germans marion but thats preposterous how could they be so foolish as to think that marion would the discomfited look on marions face made bingaman frown youve been aware of this yes how long has this been going on several days and yet you still volunteered to come down here and help im amazed but then bingaman thought about it and he wasnt amazed marion always did what was right even when it was difficult dont get the wrong impression powell said its not like everyone feels that way only a minority a small minority but theyve certainly made their opinions known im going to have to stay home marion said no powell said you cant let them bully you it isnt because of them i have a more important job feeljonass forehead touch the glands in his throat put your hand on his chest you dont need a stethoscope you can feel the congestion he has it the jolt of wheels into potholes and the noxious fumes of the model t aggravated bingamans excruciating headache making him nauseous as marion drove him home his injuries seemed to have broken the resolve with which hed subdued the symptoms that hed attributed only to fatigue now as delirium took control of him his last lucid thought was an echo of what hed said to dr bennett after seeing the nurses corpse how could this have happened so quickly by the time marion brought him home the pain in his swollen lips and nostrils was insignificant compared to the souldeep aching of his joints and limbs he was so lightheaded that he felt disassociated from himself seeming to hover watching marion struggle to get him out of the car and up the steps into the house he did his best to cough away from her grateful that hed insisted she put a new mask on him but the moment she eased him onto the bed exhaling with effort she loosened his shirt collar and took off the mask which had become bloodsoaked on the ride home no he murmured dont argue with me jonas i have to get you cleaned up should have left me in the hospital not when you have a trained nurse to give you constant care at home she took off his shoes his socks his pants his bloody suit coat and vest and shirt she stripped off his underwear shivering naked on the bed clutching his arms across his chest teeth chattering he watched the ceiling ripple as marion bathed him from head to toe she used warm water and soap dried him thoroughly then made him sit up and slipped his nightshirt over his head pulling it down to his knees she tugged long woolen socks over his feet she covered him with a sheet and three blankets when that still wasnt enough and his shivering worsened she brought him a hotwater bottle and put on the downfilled comforter bingaman coughed and murmured about a face mask it interferes with your breathing marion said might contaminate i dont think it does any good besides ive already been exposed to it working marion breathed harder minutes perhaps hours later she was spooning hot tea into him and when the chills suddenly turned into alarming amounts of sweat oozing from him she tore off the covers stripped him again bathed him with rubbing alcohol ignored his coughing and eased him out of bed onto the floor he had lost control of his bowels and fouled the bed she had to change the sheets then clean him and change his nightshirt then tug him up onto the bed and pull blankets over him again because the chills had returned she covered his brow with a steaming washcloth and spooned more hot tea into him trying to make him swallow pieces of warm bread soaked in the tea he lost all external impressions and floated away into darkness his mind was like a boat on an increasingly choppy sea a night sea stormtossed spinning he had no idea how long he was away but gradually the spinning stopped the weather calmed and when he came back slowly dimly he didnt think that his throat had ever felt so dry or that he had ever been so weak his eyes hurt as if they had sunk into his skull his skin was tight from dehydration greasy from repeated sweating frenzies at the same time it seemed loose as if he had lost weight these sensations came to him gradually he lay passively watching a beam of sunlight enter the bedroom window on his left then it went away and eventually the sunbeam entered through the window on his right and he realized that hed been in a semistupor while the sun passed from east to west but he wasnt so stupefied that he failed to realize that nothing in the room had changed that his nightshirt and covers were the same as in the morning that no one had been in the room that marion hadnt been in the room he tried to call to her but his lungs were too weak his throat too dry and nothing came out he tried again and managed to produce only an animallike whimper marion he thought desperately his fear was not for himself not that he had been left alone helpless his terror was for marion if she wasnt taking care of him that meant she wasnt able to and that meant the effort to move made him cough congestion rattled in his chest breath wheezed past his swollen bronchial passages and up his raw throat but despite his pain and lethargy he had the sense that he was better not as feverish his headache didnt threaten to cause his skull to explode his muscles ached but not as if he were being stretched on a rack when he squirmed to the side of the bed and tried to stand his legs wobbled he slumped to the floor marion he kept thinking he crawled the handoverhand movement reminded him of the fear and determination he had felt when learning to swim a pitcher on a table attracted his attention and he grasped a chair beside the table struggling to raise himself to tilt the pitcher toward his lips water trickled into his mouth over his scabbed cracked parched lips down his chin onto his nightshirt he clumsily set the pitcher back down apprehensive about dropping it the water tasting too precious for him to risk wasting it but as precious as it tasted it was also tepid stale with a slight grit of dust it had obviously been there a while and with his premonition mounting filling him with terror he tried to call marions name shuddered at the weak sound of his croaky voice and crawled again he found her downstairs on the floor in the kitchen his immediate panicked thought was that she was dead but when he moaned he thought he heard an echo only to realize that the second moan had come from her weak faint a moan nonetheless and he fought to increase the effort with which he crawled to her he touched her brow and felt the terrible heat coming off it yes alive but the depth of her cough and the sluggishness of her response when he tried to rouse her filled him with dread and he knew that his first priority was to get fluid into her he gripped the top of a kitchen counter pulled himself up and sweated while he worked the pump handle in the sink filling a bowl with water from the houses well he almost spilled the bowl and barely remembered to bring a spoon but at last he sat exhausted next to marion on the kitchen floor cradled her head and spooned water between her dry swollen lips the heat coming off her was overwhelming he struggled to the icebox used an ice pick and clumsily chipped off chunks from the halfmelted block in the upper compartment with the chunks of ice wrapped in a dish towel he slumped yet again beside marion and wiped the cool cloth over her beetred face he set the cloth on her forehead spooned more water into her mouth then gave in to his own thirst and drank from the bowl only to have it slip from his grasp and topple onto the floor soaking marion and himself he moaned felt dizzy again and lowered his head to the floor time blurred when he regained consciousness he found himself on a chair in the parlor marion was on the couch across from him a throw rug over her her chest rose and fell she coughed a plate of stale bread and a pitcher of water were on a side table someone found us bingaman thought coughing someone came in and helped but during the next few effortfilled hours he was forced to realize that he was mistaken that no one had come that somehow he had shifted marion into the parlor that he had brought the bread and the pitcher of water the bread was so old and hard that he had to soak it in the water before he could gently insert it into marions mouth and encourage her to eat he breathed a prayer of thanks when she swallowed when she coughed he feared that she would expel the food but it stayed down and then he too was eating rinsing a crust of bread down with the unbelievably delicious water again time blurred it wasnt bread but strawberry jam and a spoon that he now found on the table beside the couch he remembered having seen the jam in the ice box marion was coughing he was rubbing her fiery brow with a towel that held the last of the ice he was spooning the jam into her mouth he was raising a glass to her lips he was drinking from another glass feeling his parched mouth and throat seeming to absorb the water darkness light darkness again the cellar stumbling opening the door to the root cellar despite the coolness sweating groping for two jars of marions preserves on a shelf coughing swaying stumbling up the cellar steps reaching the kitchen squinting from the painful brilliance of blazing sunset discovering that the preserves he had expended so much effort to get were dill pickles darkness light darkness light light again marion was no longer coughing bingaman later concluded that what saved her life was her robust constitution although when she was alert enough she insisted that he had been the reason she stayed alive because of his ministrations she called them she told him not to be so modest hush he told her lovingly dont waste your strength in the reverse however he had no doubt that marions own ministrations in the initial stage of his illness had been what saved him the ruthless disease could be attacked only on the basis of its symptoms after that the patient would live or die strictly on the basis of his or her own resources and now that bingaman had endured the intimate experience of the influenzas devastating power he marveled that anyone had the strength to resist it perhaps strength was not the determining factor perhaps it was luck or fate or gods will but if the latter was indeed the case god certainly must have turned against a great many people to a presbyterian such as bingaman who believed in a contract that linked hard work and prosperity with salvation the notion that the influenza might be gods display of worldwide disapproval was disquieting surely even taking the war into account the world couldnt be that bad a place or was the socalled world war with its machine guns and tear gas chlorine gas phosgene gas mustard gas the mounting horrors the millions of needless casualties in fact the problem but in that case did it make sense for god in turn to inflict millions of other casualties dr bingaman the nurse stepped back in fear her face suddenly drained of color almost as white as her uniform it cant be what on earth i was told you were dead dead bingaman took another step toward the nurse in the hospital corridor she almost backed away after dr powell died and dr talbot i wait a second dr powell is dead yes and dr talbot and dead shock overwhelmed him dizzy he feared that he was having a relapse and placed a hand against the wall to steady himself he took a deep breath repressed a cough and studied her what made you think i was dead thats what i was told who told you a lot of people i dont know i dont remember its been so terrible so many people have gotten sick so many people have died i cant remember whos alive and who isnt i cant remember when i slept last or when bingamans fatigue and his preoccupation when he entered the hospital had prevented him from realizing how exhausted the nurse looked sit down he said realizing something else the reason no one had come to his house to find out if he needed help why would anyone have bothered if everyone thought i was dead and there must be a lot of people who have died you need to go home bingaman said get some food rest i cant so many patients i cant keep the living straight from the dying they keep going out and others come in theres so much to do i its all right im giving you permission go home ill speak to elizabeth he referred to the head of the nursing staff im sure shell agree you cant what speak to her i dont understand elizabeths dead he found himself speechless staring at her horrified by the thought of being told that whoever else he referred to would also be dead so much had happened so quickly stretcher bearers passed him carrying the corpse of mayor halloway a further horrifying thought occurred to him how long he managed to ask the weary nurse shook her head in confusion what i mean is his brow felt warm again what day is it confused she answered wednesday he rubbed his forehead what im trying to ask is the date october ninth the nurse frowned in bewilderment october ninth he felt as he had when hed been struck in the face he lurched backward dr bingaman do you feel all right a month i dont understand the last thing i recall it was early september i still dont ive lost the rest of september anda month ive lost a whole month frightened he tried to explain to give the nurse a sense of what it was like to spend so many weeks fighting to breathe through congested lungs all the while enduring a stormtossed black sea of delirium he strained to describe the unbelievable thirst the torture of aching limbs the suffocating heaviness on his chest the disturbed way the nurse looked at him gave him the sense that he was babbling he didnt care because all the time he struggled to account for how hed lost a month of his life he realized that if it had happened to him it must have happened to others dear god he thought how many others are trapped inside their houses too weak to answer their phone if they have one or to respond to someone knocking on their door when hed left his house an hour earlier hed knocked on the doors of his neighbors to his right and left no one had answered he had been troubled by how deserted his elmlined street looked a cool breeze blowing leaves that had turned from green to autumnal yellow with amazing rapidity in just a few days except that he now realized it had been a month and those neighbors hadnt gone away somewhere he had a heartpounding dreadful certainty that they were inside helpless or dead jonas you look terrible youve got to rest dr bennett said go home take care of marion shes doing fine others are worse she insisted i help take care of them but you and i are the only physicians left in town people are dying i cant go home im needed every church in town had been converted into a hospital all of them were full the cemeteries no longer had room for all the corpses gravediggers could not keep up the labor of shoveling dirt from fresh pits corpses lay in rows in a pasture at the edge of town armed sentries were posted to stop animals from eating them each man wearing a gauze mask and praying that he wouldnt catch the disease from the corpses funerals were limited to family members wearing masks ministers rushing as fast as dignity would allow while they read the prayers for the dead we have to keep searching bingaman organized teams who knows how many people need our help even if theyre dead we have to find them theres too great a risk of cholera pestilence the decomposing bodies will cause a secondary plague leading his own group bingaman marched along streets and banged on doors sometimes a trembling hand let them in a bony sunkeneyed face assuring bingaman that everyone inside was over the worst obviously not aware that bingaman had reached them barely soon enough to try to save them other times receiving no answer bingamans team broke in weak coughing led them to a few survivors too often the odor of sickness and decay made everyone gag whole families had been dead for quite a while had a little bird its name was enza i opened the window andinfluenza the rhyme which bingaman happened to hear a gauntcheeked little girl sing hypnotically almost insanely as her parents were carted dead from her house festered in his mind he couldnt get rid of it couldnt still it couldnt smother it i opened the window and influenza the rhythm was insidious like the disease it repeated itself in his thoughts until it made him dizzy and he feared that he would have another bout with enza opened the window yes the disease was everywhere all around in the sky in the air in every breath bingaman knew that after his ordeal he ought to follow kramers advice and rest but no matter how dizzy he feltinfluenzahe persisted as marion urged him to do struggling from home to home performing the corporal works of mercy for the suffering and the dead influenza he persisted because he had come to the firm conclusion that if this disease was gods punishment it was also an opportunity that god was offering to make the world a better place to eradicate evil and work for salvation bingamans team rammed the door open and searched through musty shadows first floor second floor cellar and attic his apprehension had been needless there was no one alive or dead grateful to return outside scuffling their shoes through dead leaves the team followed bingaman along the wooden sidewalk we havent looked in this house no need bingaman said why not its mine but whats that smell i dont know what you mean its coming from the house farther down bingaman said no this house your house nonsense i dont smell anything i think wed better take a look stop the doors locked stay away the smells worse here on the porch give us the key get off my property the drapes are closed i cant see through the windows im telling you to leave that smell issomebody help me break in the door amid bingamans screaming protest they crashed in and the stench that made several men vomit came unmistakably from the parlor bingamans wife had been dead for six weeks her grayskinned gasbloated corpse was smeared with strawberry jam and camphor oil quinine and aspirin pills had been stuffed inside her mouth until her cheeks bulged and her teeth were parted a dill pickle also protruded from her mouth her exposed back resembled a pin cushion except that the pins were large hypodermics which the doctor had pressed between her ribs and inserted into her lungs desperately trying to extract the fluid that had drowned her several pails contained foulsmelling yellow liquid marion bingaman stroked her hair im sorry i tried to keep them away i know how much you like your naps why dont you try to go back to sleep the pandemics peak coincided with the armistice in europe the declaration of peace november thereafter as armies disbanded and exhausted soldiers began their long journey home the flu did not return with them to reinforce the infectious microbes that were already in place to the contrary against all logic the disease began to lose its strength and by the end of during the dead of winter when the symptoms of the flu exacerbated by cold weather should have been at their worst the pandemic approached its end a few remote areas pacific islands and jungle outposts remained to suffer the onslaught otherwise having scoured the entire world making no distinction between eskimo villages and european metropolises the spanish influenza came to an end bingaman whose face would never regain its former ruddy cheerfulness and whose already thinning silvery hair had fallen completely out because of his intense fever rested as did his fellow survivors of elmdales population of twelve thousand eight thousand had collapsed with symptoms of those two thousand had died the remaining four thousand had worked nonstop to care for the sick and to bury the dead some of course had refused to help under any circumstances for fear of being infected they would have to make their peace with god humanity had been tested during the major outbreaks of the black death in europe during the middle ages it was estimated that twentyfive million had died the number of soldiers estimated to have been killed during the five years of the great war was eight and onehalf million the latter figure bingaman learned from his increasingly long nights communicating with radio operators in america and europe but the estimated number of worldwide deaths caused by the influenza was perhaps as much as fifty million even more astonishing the total number of those presumed to have been infected by the disease was twohundred million one twentieth of the worlds population if the pandemic had continued at its exponential devastating rate the human race might have been exterminated by the spring of listening to his fellow radio operators around the country and around the globe bingaman shared their sense of helplessness and loss but he also sympathized with a latent hope in some of their comments yes the cream of american and european youth had been eradicated in the war what the war had failed to accomplish the flu had taken care of among the other age groups society had been gutted but what if and this idea was almost unthinkable and yet a few had given it voice based on their reading of charles darwinwhat if the pandemic had been a means of natural selection and now that the strong had survived humanity would be better for it able to improve itself genetically such a materialistic way of thinking was repugnant to bingaman he had heard enough about darwinism to know that it was based on a theory of random events that at bottom it was atheistic and worshipped accident for bingaman there was no such thing as randomness and accident everything was part of a cosmic plan and had an ultimate purpose and any theory that did not include god was unacceptable but another theory was acceptable and it was this that gave him hope that this plague one of the horsemen of the apocalypse had been gods way of demanding humanitys attention of warning the survivors about their sins and of granting them an opportunity to learn from their transgressions to make a fresh start like the war bingaman said to marion who had walked into his study three weeks after her funeral he had looked up from his tears and smiled hed been talking to her ever since the flu was gods warning that there must never be another war like this one isnt that what theyve been calling it the war to end all wars im convinced this is an opportunity to look ahead marion didnt respond also ive been reading about the movement to make prohibition an amendment to the constitution bingaman said when the saloons were closed to help keep the flu from spreading it was obvious how much better society was without them people have seen the error of their ways the saloons will stay closed still marion didnt respond and something else bingaman said you know i always try to be optimistic im convinced that society will benefit in other ways from the flus devastation we came so close to dying all of us the world so now well all learn to cherish life more to respect it to be better this decades ending a new ones about to start a fresh beginning its going to be fascinating to see how we recover from so much death marion continued to remain silent one thing troubles me though bingaman said on the wireless last night i heard about a medical researcher in new york city who discovered that influenza isnt caused by a bacteria but by a virus in theory that information ought to make it easier to develop a cure normally he frowned all things being equal we should be able to develop a vaccine but not in this case because the researcher also discovered that the influenza virus is constantly mutating any vaccine would be effective only for a limited time meanwhile the everchanging virus could come back in an even more deadly form or a different and worse virus might come along for the first time marion spoke god help us she coughed bloodtinted saliva beaded her bluishblack lips bingaman shuddered afraid that he was going to lose her a second time that the horror would be repeated again and again yes thats what it comes down to an act of faith god help us remember how fervently we tried to have children how deeply disappointed we were to find that we couldnt we told ourselves that it wasnt meant to be that god had given us a burden to test our faith perhaps it was for the best he sobbed as marions image faded i couldnt bear to lose anyone else outside the study window snow had begun to fall a chill wind swept through the skeletal elms burying the last of their funguswilted yellow leaves this mininovel was written for another al sarrantonio anthology newstories of horror and suspense i enjoy doing fiction thats intimately connected to the location in which it occurs when i lived in lowa city i europe a number of tales about the haunting expanse of the midwest when i moved to santa fe new mexico i became interested in the fictional possibilities of what locals call the land of enchantment and the city different rio grande gothic begins a couple of blocks from where i live and involves a phenomenon that i started noticing about ten years agoshoes lying in the middle of the road different ones each day i later discovered that this isnt only a santa fe curiosity throughout the us other communities started noticing the same thing conspiracy theorists take note rio grande gothic when romero finally noticed the shoes on the road he realized that hed actually been seeing them for several days driving into town along old pecos trail passing the adobewalled santa fe womans club on the left approaching the pueblostyle baptist church on the right he reached the crest of the hill saw the jogging shoes on the yellow median line and steered his police car onto the dirt shoulder of the road frowning he got out and hitched his thumbs onto his heavy gunbelt oblivious to the roar of passing traffic focusing on the jogging shoes they were laced together a nike label on the back one was on its side showing how worn its tread was but they hadnt been in the middle of the road yesterday romero thought no yesterday it had been a pair of leather sandals he remembered having been vaguely aware of them and the day before yesterday had it been a pair of womens high heels his recollection wasnt clear but there had been some kind of shoesof that he was certain what the after waiting for a break in traffic romero crossed to the median and stared down at the jogging shoes as if straining to decipher a riddle a pickup truck crested the hill too fast to see him and slow down the wind it created ruffling his blue uniform he barely paid attention preoccupied by the shoes but when a second truck sped over the hill he realized that hed better get off the road he withdrew his nightstick from his gunbelt thrust it under the tied laces and lifted feeling the weight of the shoes dangling from the nightstick he waited for a minivan to speed past then returned to his police car unlocked its trunk and dropped the shoes into it probably that was what had happened to the other shoes he decided a sanitation truck or someone working for the city must have stopped and cleared what looked like garbage this was the middle of may the tourist season would soon be in full swing it wasnt good to have visitors seeing junk on the road ill toss these shoes in the trash when i get back to the station he decided the next pickup that rocketed over the hill was doing at least fifty romero scrambled into his cruiser flicked on his siren and stopped the truck just after it ran a red light at cordova street he was fortytwo hed been a santa fe policeman for fifteen years but the thirty thousand dollars he earned each year wasnt enough for him to afford a house in santa fes highpriced realestate market so he lived in the neighboring town of pecos twenty miles northeast where his parents and grandparents had lived before him indeed he lived in the same house that his parents had owned before a drunk driver speeding the wrong way on the interstate had hit their car headon and killed them the modest structure had once been in a quiet neighborhood but six months earlier a supermarket had been built a block away the resultant traffic noise and congestion blighting the area romero had married when he was twenty his wife worked for an allstate insurance agent in pecos their twentytwoyearold son lived at home and wasnt employed each morning romero argued with him about looking for work that was followed by a different argument in which romeros wife complained he was being too hard on the boy typically he and his wife left the house not speaking to each other once trim and athletic the star of his high school football team romero was puffy in his face and stomach from too much takeout food and too much time spent behind a steering wheel this morning hed noticed that his sideburns were turning gray by the time he finished with the speeding pickup truck a house burglary he was sent to investigate and a purse snatcher he managed to catch romero had forgotten about the shoes a fight between two feuding neighbors who happened to cross paths with each other in a restaurant parking lot further distracted him he completed his paperwork at the police station attended an aftershift debriefing and didnt need much convincing to go out for a beer with a fellow officer rather than muster the resolve to make the twentymile drive to the tensions of his home he got in at ten long after his wife and son had eaten his son was out with friends his wife was in bed he ate leftover fajitas while watching a rerun of a situation comedy that hadnt been funny the first time the next morning as he crested the hill by the baptist church he came to attention at the sight of a pair of loafers scattered along the median after steering sharply onto the shoulder he opened the door and held up his hands for traffic to stop while he went over picked up the loafers returned to the cruiser and set them in the trunk beside the jogging shoes shoes his sergeant asked back at the station what are you talking about over on old pecos trail every morning theres a pair of shoes romero said they must have fallen off a garbage truck every morning and only shoes nothing else besides the ones i found this morning were almost new maybe somebody was moving and they fell off the back of a pickup truck every morning romero repeated these were cole hahns expensive loafers like that dont get thrown on top of a load of stuff in a pickup truck what difference does it makes its only shoes maybe somebodys kidding around sure romero said somebodys kidding around a practical joke the sergeant said so people will wonder why the shoes are on the road hey you wondered the jokes working yeah romero said a practical joke the following morning it was a battered pair of timberland work boots as romero crested the hill by the baptist church he wasnt surprised to see them in fact the only thing hed been uncertain about was what type of footwear they would be if this is a practical joke its certainly working he thought whoevers doing it is awfully persistent who the problem nagged at him all day between investigating a hitandrun on st francis drive and a breakin at an art gallery on canyon road he returned to the crest of the hill on old pecos trail several times making sure that other shoes hadnt appeared for all he knew the joker was dumping the shoes during the daytime if so the plan romero was thinking about would be worthless but after the eighth time he returned and still didnt see more shoes he told himself he had a chance the plan had the merit of simplicity all it required was determination and of that he had plenty besides it would be a good reason to postpone going home so after getting a quarter pounder and fries a coke and two large containers of coffee from mcdonalds he headed toward old pecos trail as dusk thickened he used his private car a fiveyearold dark blue jeep cherokee no sense in being conspicuous he considered establishing his stakeout in the baptist churchs parking lot that would give him a great view of old pecos trail but at night with his car the only one in the lot hed be conspicuous across from the church though east lupita road intersected with old pecos trail it was a quiet residential area and if he parked there he couldnt be seen by anyone driving along old pecos in contrast he himself would have a good view of passing traffic it can work he thought there were streetlights on old pecos trail but not on east lupita sitting in darkness munching on his quarter pounder and fries using the caffeine in the coke and the two coffees to keep him alert he concentrated on the illuminated crest of the hill for a while the headlights of passing cars were frequent and distracting after each vehicle passed he stared toward the area of the road that interested him but no sooner did he focus on that spot than more headlights sped past and he had to stare harder to see if anything had been dropped he had his right hand ready to turn the ignition key and yank the gearshift into forward his right foot primed to stomp the accelerator to relax he turned on the radio for fifteenminute stretches careful that he didnt weaken the battery then traffic became sporadic making it easy to watch the road but after an eleven oclock news report in which the main item was about a fire in a store at the de vargas mall he realized the flaw in his plan all that caffeine the tension of straining to watch the road he had to go to the bathroom but i went when i picked up the food that was then those were two large coffees you drank hey i had to keep awake he squirmed he tensed his abdominal muscles he would have relieved himself into one of the beverage containers but he had crumbled all three of them when he stuffed them into the bag the quarter pounder and fries had come in his bladder ached headlights passed no shoes were dropped he pressed his thighs together more headlights no shoes he turned his ignition key switched on his headlights and hurried toward the nearest public rest room which was five blocks away on st michaels drive at an allnight gas station when he got back two cowboy boots were on the road its almost one in the morning why are you coming home so late romero told his wife about the shoes shoes are you crazy havent you ever been curious about something yeah right now im curious why you think im stupid enough to believe youre coming home so late because of some old shoes you found on the road have you got a girlfriend is that it you dont look so good his sergeant said romero shrugged despondently you been out all night partying the sergeant joked dont i wish the sergeant became serious what is it more trouble at home romero almost told him the whole story but remembering the sergeants indifference when hed earlier been told about the shoes romero knew he wouldnt get much sympathy maybe the opposite yeah more trouble at home after all what hed done last night was he had to admit a little strange using his free time to sit in a car for three hours waiting for if a practical joker wanted to keep tossing shoes on the road so what let the guy waste his time why waste my own time trying to catch him there were too many real crimes to be investigated what am i going to charge the guy with littering throughout his shift romero made a determined effort not to go near old pecos trail a couple of times during a busy day of interviewing witnesses about an assault a breakin another purse snatching and a nearfatal car accident on paseo de peralta he was close enough to have swung past old pecos trail on his way from one incident to another but he deliberately chose an alternate route time to change patterns he told himself time to concentrate on whats important at the end of his shift his lack of sleep the previous night caught up to him he left work exhausted hoping for a quiet evening at home he followed congested traffic through the dust of the eternal construction project on cerrillos road reached interstate and headed north sunset on the sangre de cristo mountains tinted them the blood color for which the early spanish colonists had named them in a half hour ill have my feet up and be drinking a beer he thought he passed the exit to st francis drive a sign told him that the next exit the one for old pecos trail was two miles ahead he blocked it from his mind continued to admire the sunset imagined the beer he was going to drink and turned on the radio a weather report told him that the high for the day had been typical for midmay but that a cold front was coming in and that the night temperature could drop as much as forty degrees with a threat of frost in lowlying areas the announcer suggested covering any recently purchased tender plants and romero took the old pecos trail exit just for the hell of it he thought just to have a look and settle my curiosity what can it hurt as he crested the hill he was surprised to notice that his heart was beating a little faster do i really expect to find more shoes he asked himself is it going to annoy me that they were here all day and i didnt come over to check pressure built in his chest as that section came into view he breathed deeply and exhaled when he saw that there wasnt anything on the road there he told himself it was worth the detour i proved that id have wasted my time if i drove over here during my shift i can go home now without being bugged that i didnt satisfy my curiosity but all the time he and his wife sat watching television while they ate kentucky fried chicken their son was out with friends romero felt restless he couldnt stop thinking that whoever was dumping the shoes would do so again the bastard will think hes outsmarted me you what are you talking about he doesnt have the faintest idea who you are well hell think hes outsmarted whoevers picking up the shoes the difference is the same the beer romero had looked forward to tasted like water and of course the next morning damn it there were a pair of womens tan pumps five yards away from each other along the median scowling romero blocked morning traffic picked up the pumps and set them in the trunk with the others where the hell is this guy getting the shoes he thought these pumps are almost new so are the loafers i picked up the other day who throws out perfectly good shoes even for a practical joke when romero was done for the day he phoned his wife to tell her i have to work late one of the guys on the evening shift got sick im filling in he caught up on some paperwork he needed to do then he went to a nearby pizza hut and got a medium pepperoni with mushrooms and black olives to go he also got a large coke and two large coffees but this time hed learned his lesson and came prepared with an empty plastic gallon jug he could urinate in more he brought a walkman and earphones so he wouldnt have to use the cars radio and worry about wearing down the battery confident that he hadnt forgotten anything he drove to the stakeout santa fe had its share of dirt roads and east lupita was one of them flanked by chamisa bushes and russian olive trees it had widely spaced adobe houses and got very little traffic parked near the corner romero saw the church across from him its bell tower reminding him of a pueblo mission beyond were the pinondotted sun mountain and atalaya ridge the sunset as vividly blood colored as it had been the previous evening traffic passed studying it he put on his headphones and switched the walkman from cd to radio after finding a callin show was the environment truly as threatened as ecologists claimed he sipped his coke dug into his pizza and settled back to watch traffic an hour after dark he realized that he had indeed forgotten something the previous days weather report had warned about low night temperatures possibly even a frost and now romero felt a chill creep up his legs he was grateful for the warm coffee he hugged his chest wishing hed brought a jacket his breath vapor clouded the windshield so much that he had to use a handkerchief to clear it he rolled down his window and that helped control his breath vapor but it also allowed more cold to enter the vehicle making him shiver moonlight reflected off lingering snow on the mountains especially at the ski basin and that made him feel even colder he turned on the jeep and used its heater to warm him all the while he concentrated on the dwindling traffic eleven oclock and still no shoes he kept reminding himself that it had been about this hour two nights earlier when hed been forced to leave to find a rest room when hed returned twenty minutes later hed found the cowboy boots if whoever was doing this followed a pattern there was a good chance something would happen in the next half hour stay patient he thought but the same as had happened two nights earlier the coke and the coffees finally had their effect fortunately he had that problem taken care of he grabbed the empty gallon jug from the seat beside him twisted its cap off positioned the jug beneath the steering wheel and started to urinate only to squint from the headlights of a car that approached behind him reflecting in his rearview mirror his bladder muscles tensed interrupting the flow of urine jesus he thought although he was certain the driver wouldnt be able to see what he was doing he felt selfconscious enough that he quickly capped the jug and set it on the passenger floor come on he told the approaching car he needed to urinate as bad as ever and urged the car to pass him to turn onto old pecos trail and leave so he could grab the jug again the headlights stopped behind him what in gods name romero thought then rooflights began to flash and romero realized that what was behind him was a police car ignoring his urgent need to urinate he rolled down his window and placed his hands on top of the steering wheel where the approaching officer not knowing who was in the car or what he was getting into would be relieved to see them footsteps crunched on the dirt road a blinding flashlight scanned the inside of romeros car assessing the empty pizza box lingering over the yellow liquid in the plastic jug sir may i see your license and registration please romero recognized the voice its okay tony its me whogabe the flashlight beam hurt romeros eyes gabe the one and only what the hell are you doing out here we had several complaints about somebody suspicious sitting in a car like he was casing the houses in the neighborhood its only me were you here two nights ago yes we had complaints then too but when we got here the car was gone what are you doing trying not to squirm from the pressure in his abdomen romero said im on a stakeout nobody told me about any stakeout whats going on realizing how long it would take to explain the oddsounding truth romero said theyve been having some attempted breakins over at the church im watching to see if whoevers been doing it comes back man sitting out here all night this is some pisspoor assignment they gave you you have no idea well ill leave before i draw any more attention to you good hunting thanks and next time tell the shift commander to let the rest of us know whats going on so we dont screw things up ill make a point of it the officer got back in his cruiser turned off the flashing lights passed romeros car waved and steered onto old pecos trail instantly romero grabbed the plastic jug and urinated for what seemed a minute and a half when he finished and leaned back sighing his sense of relaxation lasted only as long as it took him to study old pecos trail again the next thing he scrambled out of his car and ran cursing toward a pair of mens shoes they turned out to be rockports lying laced together in the middle of the road did you tell tony ortega youd been ordered to stake out the baptist church his sergeant demanded romero reluctantly nodded what kind of bullshit nobody put you on any stakeout sitting in a car all night acting suspicious youd better have a damned good reason for romero didnt have a choice the shoes what the shoes i keep finding on old pecos trail his eyes wide the sergeant listened to romeros explanation you dont put in enough hours you want to donate a couple nights free overtime on some crazy hey i know its a little unusual a little whoevers dumping those shoes is playing some kind of game and you want to play it with him what he leaves the shoes you take them he leaves more shoes you take them youre playing his game no it isnt like that well what is it like listen to me quit hanging around that street somebody might shoot you for a prowler when romero finished his shift he found a dozen old shoes piled in front of his locker somebody laughed in the lunch room im officer romero maam and i guess i made you a little nervous last night and two nights earlier i was in my car watching the church across the street we had a report that somebody might try to break in it seems you thought im the one who might try breaking in i just wanted to assure you the neighborhoods perfectly safe with me parked out there im officer romero sir and i guess i made you a little nervous last night and two nights earlier this time he had everything under control no more large cokes and coffees although he did keep his plastic jug just in case he made sure to bring a jacket although the frost danger had finally passed and the night temperature was warmer he was trying to eat better too munching on a burrito grande con polio from felipes the best mexican takeout in town he settled back and listened to the radio callin show on the walkman the program was still on the environmental theme hey man i used to be able to swim in the rivers when i was a kid i used to be able to eat the fish i caught in them id be nuts to do that now it was just after dark the headlights of a car went past no shoes no problem romero was ready to be patient he was in a rhythm nothing would probably happen until it usually did after eleven the walkmans earphones pinched his head he took them off and readjusted them as headlights sped past heading to the right out of town simultaneously a different pair of headlights rushed past heading to the left into town romeros window was down despite the sound of the engines he heard a distinct thunk then another the vehicles were gone and he gaped at two hiking boots on the road holy move he twisted the ignition key and yanked the gearshift into drive breathless he urged the car forward its rear tires spewing stones and dirt but as he reached old pecos trail he faced a hurried decision which driver had dropped the shoes which car right or left he didnt have any jurisdiction out of town left his tires squealing on the pavement he sped toward the receding taillights the road dipped then rose toward the stoplight at cordova which was red and which romero hoped would stay that way but as he sped closer to what he now saw was a pickup truck the light changed to green and the truck drove through the intersection shit romero had an emergency light on the passenger seat shaped like a dome it was plugged into the cigarette lighter he thrust it out the window and onto the roof where its magnetic base held it in place turning it on seeing the reflection of its flashing red light he pressed harder on the accelerator he sped through the intersection rushed up behind the pickup truck blared his horn and nodded when the truck went slower angling toward the side of the road romero wasnt in uniform but he did have his mm beretta in a holster on his belt he made sure that his badge was clipped onto the breast pocket of his denim jacket he aimed his flashlight toward a load of rocks in the back of the truck then carefully approached the driver license and registration please what seems to be the trouble officer the driver was anglo young about thin with short sandy hair wearing a redandbrownchecked work shirt even sitting he was tall you were going awfully fast coming over that hill by the church the young man glanced back as if to remind himself that thered been a hill license and registration romero repeated im sure i wasnt going more than the speed limit the young man said its forty there isnt it he handed over his license and pulled the registration from a pouch on the sun visor above his head romero read the name luke parsons yes sir the young mans voice was reedy with a gentle politeness po box dillon new mexico romero asked yes sir thats about fifty miles north up past espanola and embudo and i know where dillon is what brings you down here selling moss rocks at the roadside stand off the interstate romero nodded the rocks in the back of the truck were valued locally for their use in landscaping the lichenlike moss that speckled them turned pleasant muted colors after a rain hardscrabble vendors gathered them in the mountains and sold them along with homemade bird houses selfplaned roofsupport beams firewood and vegetables in season at a clearing off a country road that paralleled the interstate awful far from dillon to be selling moss rocks romero said have to go where the customers are really whats this all a youre selling after dark i wait until dusk in case folks coming out of harrys road house or the steak house farther along decide to stop and buy something then i go over to harrys and get something to eat love his barbecued vegetables this wasnt how romero had expected the conversation to go hed anticipated that the driver would look uneasy because hed lost the game but the young mans politeness was disarming i want to talk to you about those shoes you threw out of the car theres a heavy fine for shoes youve been doing it for several days i want to know why officer honestly i havent the faintest idea what youre talking about the shoes i saw you throw onto the road believe me whatever you saw happen it wasnt me doing it why would i throw shoes on the road the young mans blue eyes were direct his candid look disarming damn it romero thought i went after the wrong car inwardly he sighed he gave back the license and registration sorry to bother you no problem officer i know you have to do your job going all the way back to dillon tonight yes sir as i said its a long way to travel to sell moss rocks well we do what we have to do thats for sure romero said drive safely i always do officer good night goodnight romero drove back to the top of the hill picked up the hiking shoes and put them in the trunk of his car it was about that time a little before ten that his son was killed he passed the crash site on the way home to pecos seeing the flashing lights and the silhouettes of two ambulances and three police cars on the opposite section of the interstate grimacing at the twisted wrecks of two vehicles he couldnt help thinking poor bastards god help them but god didnt and by the time romero got home the medical examiner was showing the state police the wallet that hed taken from the mutilated body of what seemed to be a young hispanic male romero and his wife were arguing about his late hours when the phone rang answer it she yelled its probably youre damned girlfriend i keep telling you i dont have a the phone rang again yeah hello gabe this is ray becker with the state police sit down would you as romero listened he felt a cold ball grow inside him he had never felt so numb not even when hed been told about the deaths of his parents his wife saw his stunned look what is it trembling he managed to overcome his numbness enough to tell her she screamed she never stopped screaming until she collapsed two weeks later after the funeral after romeros wife went to visit her sister in denver after romero tried going back to work his sergeant advised against it but romero knew hed go crazy just sitting around home the dispatcher sent him on a call that forced him to drive up old pecos trail by the baptist church bitterly he remembered how fixated he had been on this spot not long ago instead of screwing around wondering about those shoes i should have stayed home and paid attention to my son he thought maybe i could have prevented what happened there werent any shoes on the road there werent any shoes on the road the next day or the day after that romeros wife never came back from denver you have to get out more his sergeant told him it was three months later the middle saturday of august as a part of the impending divorce settlement and as a way of trying to stifle memories romero had sold the house in pecos with his share of the proceeds hed moved to santa fe and risked a down payment on a modest house in the el dorado subdivision it didnt make a difference he still had the sense of carrying a weight on his back i hope youre not talking about dating im just saying you cant stay holed up in this house all the time you have to get out and do something distract yourself while i think of it you ought to be eating better look at the crap in this fridge stale milk a twelve pack of beer and some leftover chicken mcnuggets most of the time im not hungry with a fridge like this i dont doubt it i dont like cooking for myself its too much effort to make a salad i tell you what saturdays maria and i go to the farmers market tomorrow morning you come with us the vegetables dont come any fresher maybe if you had some decent food in this fridge youd whats wrong with me the farmers market isnt going to cure hey im knocking myself out trying to be a friend the least you can do is humor me the farmers market was near the old train station past the tracks in an open area the city had recently purchased called the rail yard farmers drove their loaded pickups in and parked in spaces theyd been assigned some set up tables and put up awnings others just sold from the back of their trucks there were taste samples of everything from pies to salsa a bluegrass band played in a corner somebody dressed up as a clown wandered through the crowd see its not so bad the sergeant said romero walked listlessly past stands of cider herbal remedies freerange chicken and sunflower sprouts in a detached way he had to admit yeah not so bad all the years hed worked for the police department hed never been here another example of how hed let his life pass him by but instead of motivating him to learn from his mistakes his regret only made him more depressed how about some of these little pies the sergeants wife asked you can keep them in the freezer and heat one up when you feel like it theyre only one or two servings so you wont have any leftovers sure romero said not caring why not his dejected gaze drifted over the crowd what kind excuse me what kind peach or butter pecan it doesnt matter choose some for me his gaze settled on a stand that offered religious icons made out of corn husks layered over carved wood madonnas manger scenes and crosses the skillfully formed images were painted and covered with a protective layer of varnish it was a traditional hispanic folk art but what caught romeros attention wasnt the attractiveness of the images but rather that an anglo instead of an hispanic was selling them as if hed made them this apple pie looks good too the sergeants wife said fine assessing the tall thin sandyhaired man selling the icons romero added i know that guy from somewhere what the sergeants wife asked nothing ill be back in a second to get the pies romero made his way through the crowd the young mans fair hair was extremely short his thin face emphasized his cheek bones making him look as if hed been fasting he had an esthetic quality similar to that on the faces of the icons he was selling not that he looked ill the opposite his tan skin glowed his voice too seemed familiar as romero approached he heard the reedy gentle tone with which the young man explained to a customer the intricate care with which the icons were created romero waited until the customer walked off with her purchase yes sir i know you from somewhere but i just cant seem to place you i wish i could help you but i dont think weve met romero noticed the small crystal that hung from a woven cord on the young mans neck it had a hint of pale blue in it as if borrowing some of the blue in the young mans eyes maybe youre right its just that you seem so awfully movement to his right distracted him a young man carrying a large basket of tomatoes from a pickup truck and setting it next to baskets of cucumbers peppers squash carrots etc on a stand next to this one but more than the movement distracted him the young man was tall and thin with short sandy hair and a lean esthetic face he had clear blue eyes that seemed to lend some of their color to the small crystal hanging from his neck he wore faded jeans and a white teeshirt the same as the young man to whom romero had been talking the white of the shirt emphasized his glowing tan you are right romero told the first man we havent met your brothers the one i met the newcomer looked puzzled its true isnt it romero asked the two of you are brothers thats why i got confused but i still cant remember where luke parsons the newcomer extended his hand gabe romero the young mans forearm was sinewy his handshake firm romero needed all his discipline and training not to react his mind reeling as he remembered luke parsons christ this was the man hed spoken to the night his son had been killed and his life had fallen apart to distract himself from his memories he had come to this market only to find someone who reminded him of what he was desperately trying to forget and this is my brother mark hello say are you feeling all right why what do you you turned pale all of a sudden its nothing i just havent been eating well lately then you ought to try this luke parsons pointed toward a small bottle filled with brown liquid romero narrowed his eyes what is it homegrown echinacea if youve got a virus thisll take care of you boosts your immune system thanks but when you feel how dramatically it picks you up you make it sound like drugs gods drug nothing false if it doesnt improve your wellbeing well give you a refund there you are romeros sergeant said ive been looking all over for you he noticed the bottle in romeros hand whats that something called homegrown the word eluded him echinacea luke parsons said sure the sergeants wife said i use it when we get colds boosts the immune system works like a charm lord these tomatoes look wonderful as she started buying luke told romero when your appetites off it can mean your body needs to be detoxified these cabbage broccoli and cauliflower are good for that completely organic no chemicals of any kind ever went near them and you might try this he handed romero a small bottle of white liquid milk thistle the sergeants wife said glancing at the bottle while selecting green peppers cleans out the liver where on earth did you learn about this stuff the sergeant asked rosa down the street got interested in herbal remedies she explained later as the three of them crossed the train tracks carrying sacks of vegetables hey this is santa fe the worlds capital of alternate medicines and new age religions if you cant beat em join em yeah those crystals around their necks theyre new agers for sure romero said did you notice their belts were made of hemp no leather nothing from animals no fried chicken and takeout burgers for those guys the sergeant gave romero a pointed look theyre as healthy as can be all right okay i get it just make sure you eat your greens the odd part was that he actually did start feeling better physically at least his emotions were still as bleak as midnight but as one of the selfhelp books hed read advised one way to heal yourself is from the body to the soul the echinacea ten drops in a glass of water the typed directions said tasted bitter the milk thistle tasted worse the salads didnt fill him up he still craved a pepperoni pizza but he had to admit the vegetables at the farmers market were as good as any hed come across no surprise the only vegetables hed eaten before came from a supermarket where theyd sat for god knew how long and that didnt count all the time theyd been in a truck on the way to the store theyd probably been picked before they were ready so they wouldnt ripen until they reached the supermarket and then there was the issue of how many pesticides and herbicides theyd been doused with he remembered a radio callin show that had talked about poisons in food the program had dealt with similar problems in the environment and romero shivered the program had been the one hed listened to in his car the night hed been waiting for the shoes to drop and his son had been killed screw it if im going to feel this bad im going to eat what i want it took him only fifteen minutes to drive in from el dorado and get a big takeout order of ribs fries cole slaw and plenty of barbecue sauce he never ate in restaurants anymore too many people knew him he couldnt muster the energy for small talk another fifteen minutes and he was back at home watching a lawyer show drinking beer gnawing on ribs he was sick before the ten oclock news i swear im keeping to my diet hey dont look at me like that i admit i had a couple of relapses but i learned my lesson ive never eaten more wholesome food in my life fifteen pounds that health club i joined really sweats the weight off hi mark the tall thin sandyhaired young man behind the vegetables looked puzzled at him whats wrong romero asked ive been coming to this market every saturday for the past six weeks you dont recognize me by now youve confused me with my brother the man had blue eyes a hint of their color in the crystal around his neck jeans a white teeshirt a glowing tan and the thinfaced highcheekboned esthetic look of a saint well i know youre not luke im sure id recognize him my name is john his tone was formal pleased to meet you im gabe romero nobody told me there were three brothers actually wait a minute let me guess if theres a mark luke and john theres got to be a matthew right i bet there are four of you johns lips parted slightly as if he wasnt accustomed to smiling very good no big deal its my business to deduce things romero joked oh and what business is john straightened his blue eyes as cold as a star watching luke come through the crowd you were told not to leave the stand im sorry i had to go to the bathroom you should have gone before we started out i did but i cant help it if thats right you cant help me if youre not here were almost out of squash bring another basket im really sorry it wont happen again luke glanced selfconsciously at romero then back at his brother and went to get the squash are you planning to buy something john asked you dont exactly win friends and influence people do you romero thought yeah ill take a couple of those squash i guess with the early frost thats predicted thesell be the last of the tomatoes and peppers huh john simply looked at him id better stock up romero said hed hoped that the passage of time would ease his numbness but each season only reminded him christmas new years then easter and too soon after that the middle of may oddly hed never associated his sons death with the scene of the accident on the interstate always the emotional connection was with that section of road by the baptist church at the top of the hill on old pecos trail he readily admitted that it was masochism that made him drive by there so often as the anniversary of the death approached he was so preoccupied that for a moment he was convinced that hed willed himself into reliving the sequence that he was hallucinating as he crested the hill and for the first time in almost a year saw a pair of shoes on the road rustcolored anklehigh hiking boots they so surprised him that he slowed down and stared the close look made him notice something so alarming that he slammed on his brakes barely registering the squeal of tires behind him as the car that followed almost hit the cruiser trembling he got out crouched stared even more closely at the hiking boots and rushed toward his twoway radio the shoes had feet in them as an approaching police car wailed and officers motioned for traffic to go past on the shoulder of the road romero stood with his sergeant the police chief and the medical examiner watching the lab crew do its work his cruiser remained where hed stopped it next to the shoes a waisthigh screen had been put up ill know more when we get the evidence to the lab the medical examiner said but judging from the straight clean lines i think something like a power saw was used to sever the feet from the legs romero bit his lower lip anything else you can tell us right away the police chief asked there isnt any blood on the pavement which means that the blood on the shoes and the stumps of the feet was dry before they were dropped here the discoloration of the tissue suggests that at least twentyfour hours passed between the crime and the disposal anybody notice anything else the size of the shoes romero said they looked at him mine are tens these look to be sevens or eights my guess is the victim was female the same police officers whod left the pile of old shoes in front of romeros locker now praised his instincts although he had long since discarded the various shoes that hed collected no one blamed him after all so much time had gone by who could have predicted the shoes would be important still he remembered what kind theyd been just as he remembered that hed started noticing them almost exactly a year ago around the fifteenth of may but there was no guarantee that the person whod dropped the shoes a year ago was the person whod left the severed feet all the investigating team could do was deal with the little evidence they had as romero anticipated the medical examiner eventually determined that the victim had indeed been a woman was the person responsible a tourist someone who came back to santa fe each may if so would that person have committed similar crimes somewhere else inquiries to the fbi revealed that over the years numerous murders by amputation had been committed throughout the us but none matched the profile that the team was dealing with what about missing persons reports those in new mexico were eliminated but as the search spread it became clear that so many thousands of people disappeared in the us each month that the investigation team would need more staff than it could ever hope to have meanwhile romero was part of the team staking out that area of old pecos trail each night he used a nightvision telescope to watch from the roof of the baptist church after all if the killer stayed to his pattern other shoes would be dropped and perhapsgod help us romero thoughtthey too would contain severed feet if he saw anything suspicious all he needed to do was focus on the cars license plate and then use his twoway radio to alert police cars hidden along old pecos trail but night after night there was nothing to report a week later a current model red saturn with new hampshire plates was found abandoned in an arroyo southeast of albuquerque the car was registered to a thirtyyearold woman named susan crowell who had set out with her fiance on a crosscountry car tour three weeks earlier neither she nor her fiance had contacted their friends and relatives in the past eight days may became june then july the fourth of july pancake breakfast in the historic plaza was its usual success three weeks later spanish market occupied the same space local hispanic artisans displaying their paintings icons and woodwork tourist attendance was down the sensationalist publicity about the severed feet having discouraged some visitors from coming but a month after that the similar but larger indian market occurred and memories were evidently short for now the usual thirty thousand tourists thronged the plaza to admire native american jewelry and pottery romero was on duty for all of these events making sure everything proceeded in an orderly fashion still no matter the tasks assigned to him his mind was always back on old pecos trail some nights he couldnt stay away he drove over to east lupita watched the passing headlights on old pecos trail and brooded he didnt expect anything to happen not as fall approached but being there made him feel on top of things helped focus his thoughts and in an odd way gave him a sense of being close to his son sometimes the presence of the church across the street made him pray one night a familiar pickup truck filled with moss rocks drove by romero remembered it from the night his son had been killed and from so many summer saturdays when hed watched baskets of vegetables being carried from it to a stand at the farmers market he had never stopped associating it with the shoes granted at the time hed been certain hed stopped the wrong vehicle he didnt have a reason to take the huge step of suspecting that luke parsons had anything to do with the murders of susan crowell and her fiance nonetheless hed told the investigation team about that night the previous year and theyd checked luke out as thoroughly as possible he and his three brothers lived with their father on a farm in the rio grande gorge north of dillon they were hard workers kept to themselves and stayed out of trouble seeing the truck pass romero didnt have a reason to make it stop but that didnt mean he couldnt follow it he pulled onto old pecos drive and kept the trucks taillights in view as it headed into town it turned right at the state capitol building and proceeded along paseo de peralta until on the other side of town it steered into an allsups gas station romero chose a pump near the pickup truck got out of his jeep and pretended to be surprised by the man next to him luke its gabe romero how are you then he was surprised realizing his mistake this wasnt luke john i didnt recognize you the tall thin sandyhaired sombereyed young man assessed him he lowered his eyes to the holstered pistol on romeros hip romero had never worn it to the farmers market i didnt realize you were a police officer does it matter only that its reassuring to know my vegetables are safe when youre around johns stern features took the humor out of the joke or your moss rocks romero pointed toward the back of the truck been selling them over on that country road by the interstate thats usually lukes job well he has other things to do yeah now that i think of it i havent seen him at the market lately excuse me its been a long day its a long drive back you bet i didnt mean to keep you luke wasnt at the farmers market the next saturday or the final one the week after that late october thered been a killing frost the night before and in the morning there was snow in the mountains since the farmers market was closed for the year and romero had his saturday free he thought why dont i take a little drive the sunlight was cold crisp and clear as romero headed north along highway he crested the hill near the modernistic sante fe opera house and descended from the juniperandpinondotted slopes of town into a multicolored desert its draws and mesas stretching dramatically away toward whitecapped mountains on each side no wonder hollywood made so many westerns here he thought he passed the camel rock indian casino and the cities of gold indian casino reaching what had once been another eternal construction project the huge interchange that led west to los alamos but instead of heading toward the atomic city he continued north passing through espanola and now the landscape changed again the hills on each side coming closer the narrow highway passing between the ridges of the rio grande gorge watch out for falling rock a sign said yeah i intend to watch out he thought on his left partially screened by leafless trees was the legendary rio grande narrow taking its time in the fall gliding around curves bubbling over boulders on the far side of the river was embudo station an old stagecoach stop the historic buildings of which had been converted into a microbrewery and a restaurant he passed it heading farther north and now the gorge began to widen farms and vineyards appeared on both sides of the road where silt from melting during the ice age had made the soil rich he stopped in dillon took care that his handgun was concealed by his zippedup windbreaker and asked at the general store if anybody knew where he could find the parsons farm fifteen minutes later he had the directions he wanted but instead of going directly to the farm he drove to a scenic view outside town and waited for a state police car to pull up beside him during the mornings drive hed used his cellular phone to contact the state police barracks farther north in taos after explaining who he was hed persuaded the dispatcher to send a cruiser down to meet him i dont anticipate trouble romero told the burly trooper as they stood outside their cars and watched the rio grande flow through a chasm beneath them but you never know so what do you want me to do just park at the side of the highway make sure i come back out of the farm your department didnt send you up here selfinitiative ive got a hunch the trooper looked doubtful how long are you going to be in there considering how unfriendly they are not long fifteen minutes i just want to get a sense of the place if i get a call about an emergency down the road youll have to go but id appreciate it if you came back and made sure i left the property on my way to santa fe ill stop at the general store in dillon and leave word that im okay the state trooper still looked doubtful ive been working on this case a long time romero said please id really appreciate the help the dirt road was just after a sign that read taos miles it was on the left of the highway and led down a slope toward fertile bottom land to the north and west ridges bordered the valley wellmaintained rail fences enclosed rich black soil the parsons were certainly hard workers he had to admit with cold weather about to arrive the fields had been cleared everything ready for spring the road headed west toward a barn and outbuildings all of them neat looking their white appearing freshly painted a simple wood frame house it white too had a pitched metal roof that gleamed in the autumn sun beyond the house was the river about thirty feet wide with a raised foot bridge leading across to leafless aspen trees and scrub brush trailing up a slope as he drove closer romero saw movement at the barn someone getting off a ladder putting down a paint can someone else appeared at the barns open doors a third person came out of the house they were waiting in front of the house as romero pulled up and stopped this was the first time hed seen three of the brothers together their tall lean sandyhaired blueeyed similarities even more striking they wore the same denim coveralls with the same blue wool shirts underneath but romero was well enough acquainted with them that he could tell one from another the brother on the left about nineteen must be the one hed never met i assume youre matthew romero got out of the car and walked toward them extending his hand no one made a move to shake hands with him i dont see luke romero said he has things to do john said their features were pinched why did you come here mark asked i was driving up to taos while i was in the neighborhood i thought id drop by and see if you had any vegetables for sale youre not welcome what kind of attitude is that for somebody whos been as good a customer as i have i thought you might be pleased to see me leave but dont you want my business matthew go in the house and bring me the phone im going to call the state police the young man nodded and turned toward the house thats fine romero said ill be on my way the trooper was at the highway when romero drove out thanks for the backup youd better not thank me i just got a call about you whatever you did in there you really pissed them off the dispatcher says if you come back they want you arrested for trespassing the citys attorney the police chief said the mans handshake was unenthusiastic and this is mr daly the attorney for mr parsons the chief said an even colder handshake mr parsons youve definitely met the chief said romero nodded to john ill get right to the point daly said youve been harassing my client and we want it stopped harassing wait a minute i havent been harassing detaining the family vehicle without just cause intimidating my client and his brothers at their various places of business following my client confronting him in public places invading his property and refusing to leave when asked to you crowd him just about every where he goes and we want it stopped or well sue both you and the city juries dont like rogue cops rogue cop what are you talking about i didnt come here to debate this daly stood motioning for john to do the same my clients completely in the right this isnt a police state you your department and the city have been warned any more incidents and ill call a press conference to let every potential juror know why were filing the lawsuit with a final searing gaze daly left the room john followed almost immediately but not before he gave romero a victimized look that made romeros face turn warm with anger the office became silent the city attorney cleared his throat i dont suppose i have to tell you to stay away from him but i havent done anything wrong did you follow him did you go to his home did you ask the state police in taos for backup when you entered the property romero looked away you were out of your jurisdiction acting completely on your own these brothers have something to do with they were investigated and cleared i cant explain its a feeling that keeps nagging at me well i have a feeling the attorney said if you dont stop exceeding your authority youre going to be out of a job not to mention in court trying to explain to a jury why you harassed a group of brothers who look like advertisements for hard work and family values matthew mark luke and john for god sake if it wouldnt look like an admission of guilt id recommend your dismissal right now romero got the worst assignments if a snowstorm took out power at an intersection and traffic needed to be directed by hand he was at the top of the list to do it anything that involved the outdoors and bad weather he was the man obviously the police chief was inviting him to quit but romero had a secret defense the heat that had flooded his face when john gave him that victimized look hadnt gone away it had stayed and spread possessing his body directing traffic in a foot of snow with a raging storm and a wind chill near zero no problem anger made him as warm as could be john parsons had arrogantly assumed hed won romero was going to pay him back may that was about the time the shoes had appeared two years ago and the severed feet last year the chief was planning some surveillance on that section of old pecos trail but nobody believed that if the killer planned to act again hed be stupid enough to be that predictable for certain romero wasnt going to be predictable he wasnt going to play johns game and risk his job by hanging around old pecos trail so john could drive by and claim that the harassment had started again no old pecos trail didnt interest him anymore on may he was going to be somewhere else outside dillon in the rio grande gorge he planned it for quite a while first he had to explain his absence a vacation he hadnt taken one last year san francisco hed never been there it was supposed to be especially beautiful in the spring the chief looked pleased as if he hoped romero would look for a job there second his quarry knew the kind of car he drove he traded his green jeep for a blue ford explorer third he needed equipment the nightvision telescope hed used to watch old pecos trail from the top of the church had made darkness so vivid that he bought a similar model from a military surplus store he went to a camera store and bought a powerful zoom lens for the mm camera he had at home food and water for several days outdoor clothing something to carry everything in hiking shoes sturdy enough to support all the weight his vacation started on may when hed last driven to dillon autumn had made the rio grande calm but now the spring snowmelt widened and deepened it cresting it into a rage green trees and shrubs bordered the foaming water as whitewater rafters shot through roiling channels and jounced over hidden rocks as he drove past the entrance to the parsons farm he worried that one of the brothers might drive out and notice him but then he reminded himself that they didnt know this car he stared to his left at the rich black land the white buildings in the distance and the glinting metal roof of the house at the far edge of the farm the river raged high enough that it almost snagged the raised foot bridge he put a couple of miles between him and the farm before he stopped on his left a rest area underneath cottonwoods looked to be the perfect place a few other cars were there all of them empty whitewater rafters he assumed at the end of the day someone would drive them back to get their vehicles in all the coming and going his car would be just one of many that were parked there to guard against someone wondering why the car was there all night and worrying that hed drowned he left a note on his dashboard that read hiking and camping along the river back in a couple of days he opened the rear hatch put on the heavy backpack secured its straps locked the car and walked down a rocky slope disappearing among bushes he had spent several evenings at home practicing with the fully loaded knapsack but his brick floors hadnt prepared him for the uneven terrain that he now labored over rocks holes and fallen branches each jarring step seeming to add weight to his backpack more he had practiced in the cool of evening but now in the heat of the day with the temperature predicted to reach a high of eighty he sweated profusely his wet clothes clinging to him his pack weighed sixty pounds without it he was sure he could have reached the river in ten minutes under the circumstances he took twenty not bad he thought hearing the roar of the current emerging from the scrub brush he was startled by how fast and high the water was how humblingly powerful it was so swift that it created a breeze for which he was grateful as he set down his backpack and flexed his stiff shoulders he drank from his canteen the water had been cool when hed left the house but was now tepid with a vague metallic taste get to work he told himself without the backpack the return walk to the car was swift in a hurry he unlocked the explorer removed another sack relocked the car and carried his second burden down the slope into the bushes reaching the river five minutes sooner than he had earlier the sack contained a small rubber raft which after he used a pressurized cannister to inflate it had plenty of room for himself and his backpack making sure that the latter was securely attached he studied the heaving water took a deep breath exhaled and pushed it into the river icy water splashed across him if not for his daily workouts on exercise machines he never would have had the strength to paddle so hard and fast constantly switching sides keeping the raft from spinning but the river carried him downstream faster than hed anticipated he was in the middle but no matter how hard he fought he didnt seem to be getting closer to the other side he didnt know what scared him worse being overturned or not reaching the opposite bank before the current carried him to the farm jesus if they see mehe worked his arms to their maximum squinting to see through spray he saw that the river curved to the left the current on the far side wasnt as strong paddling in a frenzy he felt the raft shoot close to the bank ten feet five he braced himself the moment the raft jolted against the shore he scrambled over the front rim landed on the muddy bank almost fell into the water righted himself and dragged the raft onto the shore his backpack sat in water in the raft hurriedly he freed the straps that secured it then dragged it onto dry land water trickled out the bottom he could only hope that the waterproof bags into which hed sealed his food clothes and equipment had done their job had anyone seen him he scanned the ridge behind him and the shore across from him they seemed deserted he overturned the raft dumped the water out of it tugged the raft behind bushes and concealed it he set several large rocks in it to keep it from blowing away then returned to the shore and satisfied himself that the raft couldnt be seen but he couldnt linger he hoisted his pack onto his shoulders ignored the strain on his muscles and started inland three hours later after following a trail that led along the back of the ridge that bordered the river he finished the long slow difficult hike to the top the scrub brush was sparse the rocks unsteady under his wafflesoled boots fifteen yards from the summit he lowered his backpack and flexed his arms and shoulders to ease their cramps sweat dripped from his face he drank from his canteen the water even more tepid then sank to the rocks and crept upward cautiously he peered over the top below were the white barn and outbuildings sunlight gleamed off the white houses pitched metal roof portions of the land were green from early crops one of which romero recognized even from a distance lettuce no one was in view he found a hollow eased into it and dragged his backpack after him two rocks on the rim concealed the silhouette of his head when he peered down between them river field farmhouse barn more fields a perfect vantage point still no one was in view some of them are probably in santa fe he thought as long as nothings happening this is a good time to get settled he removed his nightvision telescope his camera and his zoom lens from the backpack the waterproof bags had worked the equipment was dry so were his food and his sleeping bag the only items that had gotten wet were a spare shirt and pair of jeans that ironically hed brought with him in case he needed a dry change of clothes he spread them out in the sun took another look at the farm no activity and ravenously reached for his food cheddar cheese wheat crackers sliced carrots and a dessert of dehydrated apricots made his mouth water as he chewed them five oclock one of the brothers crossed from the house to the barn hard to tell at a distance but through the cameras zoom lens romero thought he recognized mark sixthirty small down there the pickup truck arrived it got bigger as romero adjusted the zoom lens and recognized john getting out mark came out of the barn matthew came out of the house john looked displeased about something mark said something matthew stayed silent they entered the house romeros heart beat faster with the satisfaction that he was watching his quarry and they didnt know it but his exhilaration faded as dusk thickened lights came on in the house and nothing else happened without the sun the air cooled rapidly as frost came out of his mouth he put on gloves and a jacket maybe im wasting my time he thought like hell its not the fifteenth yet the temperature continued dropping his legs cold despite the jeans he wore he squirmed into the welcome warmth of his sleeping bag and chewed more cheese and crackers as he switched from the zoom lens to the nightvision telescope the scope brightened the darkness turning everything green the lights in the windows were radiant one of the brothers left the house but the scopes definition was a little grainy and romero couldnt tell who it was the person went into the barn and returned to the house ten minutes later one by one the lights went off the house was soon in darkness looks like the shows over for a while romero thought it gave him an opportunity to get out of his sleeping bag crawl back from the ridge and relieve himself behind a bush when he returned the house seemed as quiet as when hed gone away again he reminded himself todays not important tomorrow might not be either but the next days the fifteenth he checked that his handgun and his cellular phone were within easy reach all the comforts of home settled deeper into the sleeping bag and refocused the nightvision scope on the farm below nothing the cold made his eyes feel heavy a door slammed jerking his head up romero blinked to adjust his eyes to the bright morning light he squirmed from his sleeping bag and used the cameras zoom lens to peer down at the farm john mark and matthew had come out of the house they marched toward the nearest field the one that had lettuce in it the green shoots glistened from the reflection of sunlight off melted frost john looked as displeased as on the previous evening speaking irritably to his brothers mark said something in return matthew said nothing romero frowned this was one too many times that he hadnt seen luke what had happened to him adjusting the zoom lens he watched the group go into the barn another question nagged at him the police report had said that the brothers worked for their father that this was their fathers land but when romero had come to the farm the previous fall he hadnt seen the father or yesterday or this morning where the hell was he was the father somehow responsible for the shoes and were the father and luke not on the farm because they were somewhere else doing the more questions he had the more his mind spun he tensed seeing a glint of something reflect off melted frost on grass beside the barn door frowning harder he saw the glint dart back and forth as if alive oh my jesus he thought suddenly realizing what it was pulling his camera away from the rim he was on the western ridge staring east the sun above the opposite ridge had reflected off his zoom lens if the light had reflected while the brothers were outside the cold air felt even colder leaving the camera and its zoom lens well below the rim he warily eased his head up and studied the barn five minutes later the three brothers emerged and began to do chores watching romero opened a plastic bag of cheerios wheat chex raisins and nuts that hed combined munching the trail mix washing it down with water from the drop in temperature the previous night the water in his canteen was again cold but the canteen was almost empty he had brought two others and they would last him for a while eventually though he was going to have to return to the river and use a filtration pump to refill the canteens iodine tablets would kill the bacteria by midafternoon the brothers were all in one field matthew on a tractor tilling the soil while john and mark picked up large rocks that the winter had forced to the surface carrying them to the back of the pickup truck im wasting my time he thought theyre just farmers for gods sake then why did john try to get me fired he clenched his teeth with the sun behind his back it was safe to use the cameras zoom lens he scanned the farm staring furiously at the brothers the evening was a replay of the previous one by ten the house was in darkness just one more day romero thought tomorrows the fifteenth tomorrows what i came for pain jolted him into consciousness a walloping burst of agony made his mind spin a third cracking impact sent a flash of red behind his eyes stunned he fought to overcome the shock of the attack and thrashed to get out of his sleeping bag a blow across his shoulders knocked him sideways silhouetted against the starry sky three figures surrounded him their heavy breath frosty as they raised their clubs to strike him again he grabbed his pistol and tried to free it from the sleeping bag but a blow knocked it out of his numbed hand an instant before a club across his forehead made his ears ring and his eyes roll up he awoke slowly his senses in chaos throbbing in his head blood on his face the smell of it coppery the nostrilirritating smell of stale straw under his left cheek shadows sunlight through cracks in a wall the barn spinning his stomach heaved the sour smell of vomit matthew bring john mark said rumbling footsteps ran out of the barn romero passed out the next time he awoke he was slumped in a corner his back against a wall his knees up his head sagging blood dripping onto his chest we found your car john said i see you changed models the echoing voice seemed to come from a distance but when romero looked wearily up john was directly before him john read the note romero had left on the dashboard hiking and camping along the river back in a couple of days romero noticed that his pistol was tucked under johns belt what are we going to do mark asked the police will come looking for him so what john said were in the right we caught a man with a pistol who trespassed on our property at night we defended ourselves and subdued him john crumbled the note but the police wont come looking for him they dont know hes here you cant be sure mark said matthew stood silently by the closed barn door of course i can be sure john said if this was a police operation he wouldnt have needed this note he wouldnt have been worried that someone would wonder about the abandoned car in fact he wouldnt have needed his car at all the police would have driven him to the dropoff point hes on his own matthew fidgeted continuing to watch isnt that right officer romero john asked fighting to control the spinning in his mind romero managed to get his voice to work how did you know i was up there no one answered it was the reflection from the camera lens right romero sounded as if his throat had been stuffed with gravel like the holy spirit on pentecost john said romeros tongue was so thick he could barely speak i need water i dont like this mark said let him go john turned toward matthew you heard him he needs water matthew hesitated then opened the barn door and ran toward the house john returned his attention to romero why wouldnt you stop why did you have to be so persistent wheres luke see thats what i mean youre so damnably persistent we dont need to take this any further mark warned put him in his car let him go no harms been done hasnt there you just said we were in the right to attack a stranger with a gun after it was too late we found out who he is a judge would throw out an assault charge hed come back not necessarily i guarantee it wouldnt you officer romero youd come back romero wiped blood from his face and didnt respond of course you would john said its in your nature and one day youd see something you shouldnt it may be you already have dont say anything more mark warned you want to know what this is about john asked romero romero wiped more blood from his face i think you should get what you want john said no mark said this cant go on any more im still not convinced hes here by himself if the police are involvedits too risky it has to stop footsteps rushed toward the barn only romero looked as matthew hurried inside carrying a jug of water give it to him john said matthew warily approached like someone apprehensive about a wild animal he set the jug at romeros feet and darted back thank you romero said matthew didnt answer why dont you ever speak romero asked matthew didnt say anything romeros skin prickled you cant matthew looked away of course last fall when i was here john told you to bring him the phone so he could call the state police at the time i didnt think anything of it romero waited for the swirling in his mind to stop i figured he was sending the weakest one of the group so if i made trouble he and mark could take care of it romeros lungs felt empty he took several deep breaths but all the time ive been watching the house you havent said a word matthew kept looking away youre mute thats why john told you to bring the phone because you couldnt call the state police yourself stop taunting my brother and drink the water john said im not taunting him i just drink it romero fumbled for the jug raised it to his lips and swallowed not caring about the sour taste from having been sick wanting only to clear the mucus from his mouth and the gravel in his throat john pulled a clean handkerchief from his windbreaker pocket and threw it to him pour water on it wipe the blood from your face were not animals theres no need to be without dignity baffled by the courtesy romero did what he was told the more they treated him like a human being the more chance he had of getting away from here he tried desperately to think of a way to talk himself out of this youre wrong about the police not being involved oh john raised his eyebrows waiting for romero to continue this isnt official sure but i do have backup i told my sergeant what i planned to do the deal is if i dont use my cell phone to call him every six hours hell know somethings wrong he and a couple of friends on the force will come here looking for me my my is that a fact yes then why dont you call him and tell him youre all right because im not all right look i have no idea whats going on here and all of a sudden believe me its the last thing i want to find out i just want to get out of here the barn became terribly silent i made a mistake romero struggled to his feet i wont make it again ill leave this is the last time youll see me off balance he stepped out of the corner john studied him as far as im concerned this is the end of it romero took another step toward the door i dont believe you romero stepped past him youre lying about the cell phone and about your sergeant john said romero kept walking if i dont call him soon john blocked his way hell come looking for me and here hell find you being held against my will so well be charged with kidnapping john spread his hands fine well tell the jury we were only trying to scare you to keep you from continuing to stalk us im willing to take the chance they wont convict us what are you talking about mark said lets see if his friends really come to the rescue oh shit romero thought he took a further step toward the door john pulled out romeros pistol no mark said matthew help mark with the trapdoor this has to stop mark said wasnt what happened to matthew and luke enough like a tightly wound spring that was suddenly released john whirled and struck mark with such force that he knocked him to the floor since when do you run this family wiping blood from his mouth mark glared up at him i dont you do thats right im the oldest thats always been the rule if youd been meant to run this family youd have been the firstborn mark kept glaring do you want to turn against the rule john asked mark lowered his eyes no then help matthew with the trapdoor romeros stomach fluttered all the while john aimed the pistol at him he watched mark and matthew go to the far left corner where it took both of them to shift a barrel of grain out of the way they lifted a trapdoor and romero couldnt help bleakly thinking that someone pushing from below wouldnt have a chance of moving it when the barrel was in place get down there john said romero felt dizzier fighting to repress the sensation he knew that he had to do something before he felt any weaker if john wanted me dead hed have killed me by now romero bolted for the outside door mark something whacked against romeros legs tripping him slamming his face hard onto the floor mark had thrown a club the three brothers grabbed him dazed the most powerless hed ever felt he thrashed unable to pull away from their hands as they dragged him across the dusty floor and shoved him down the trapdoor if he hadnt grasped the ladder hed have fallen you dont want to be without water john handed the jug down to him a chill breeze drifted from below terrified romero watched the trapdoor being closed over him and heard the scrape of the barrel being shifted back into place god help me he thought but he wasnt in darkness peering down he saw a faint light and warily descended the ladder moving awkwardly because of the jug he held at the bottom he found a short tunnel and proceeded along it an earthy musty smell made his nostrils contract the light became brighter as he neared its source in a small plywoodwalled room that he saw had a wooden chair and table the floor was made from plywood also the light came from a bare bulb attached to one of the sturdy beams in the ceiling stepping all the way in he saw a cot on the left a clean pillow and blanket were on it to the right a toilet seat was attached to a wooden box positioned above a deep hole in the ground im going to lose my mind he thought the breeze weak now that the trapdoor was closed came from a vent in an upper part of the farthest wall romero guessed that the duct would be long and that there would be baffles at the end so that if romero screamed for help no one who happened to come onto the property would hear him the vent provided enough air that romero wasnt worried about suffocating there were plenty of other things to worry about but at least not that the plywood of the floor and walls was discolored with age nonetheless the pillow and the blanket had been stocked recently when romero raised them to his nose there was a fresh laundry smell beneath the loamy odor that it had started absorbing the brothers couldnt have known id be here they were expecting someone else who romero smelled something else he told himself that it was only his imagination but he couldnt help sensing that the walls were redolent with the sweaty stench of fear as if many others had been imprisoned here his own fear made his mouth so dry that he took several deep swallows of water setting the jug on the table he stared apprehensively at a door across from him it was just a simple old wooden door vertical planks held in place by horizontal boards nailed to the top middle and bottom but it filled him with apprehension he knew that he had to open it that he had to learn if it gave him a way to escape but he had a terrible premonition that something unspeakable waited on the other side he told his legs to move they refused he told his right arm to reach for the doorknob it too refused the spinning sensation in his mind was now aggravated by the short quick breaths he was taking im hyperventilating he realized and struggled to return his breath rate to normal despite the coolness of the chamber his face dripped sweat in contrast his mouth was drier than ever he gulped more water open the door his body reluctantly obeyed his shaky legs taking him across the chamber his trembling hand reaching for the doorknob he pulled nothing happened and for a moment he thought that the door was locked but when he pulled harder the door creaked slowly open the loamy odor from inside reaching his nostrils before his eyes adjusted to the shadows in there for a terrible instant he thought he was staring at bodies he almost stumbled back inwardly screaming until a remnant of his sanity insisted that he stare harder that what he was looking at were bulging burlap sacks and baskets and shelves of vegetables potatoes beets turnips onions jesus this was the root cellar under the barn repelled by the musty odor he searched for another door he tapped the walls hoping for a hollow sound that would tell him there was an open space perhaps another room or even the outside beyond it he found nothing to give him hope officer romero the faint voice came from the direction of the trapdoor romero stepped out of the root cellar and closed the door officer romero the voice sounded like johns romero left the chamber and stopped halfway along the corridor not wanting to show himself a beam of pale light came down through the open trapdoor what ive brought you something to eat a basket sat at the bottom of the ladder presumably john had lowered it by a rope and then pulled the rope back up before calling to romero im not hungry if i were you id eat after all you have no way of telling when i might bring you another meal romeros empty stomach cramped also youll find a book in the basket something for you to pass the time d h lawrence seems appropriate since he lived on a ranch a little to the north of us outside taos in fact hes buried there i dont give a shit what do you intend to do with me romero was startled by how shaky his voice sounded john didnt answer if you let me go right now ill forget this happened none of this has gone so far that it cant be undone the trapdoor was closed the pale beam of light disappeared above there were scraping sounds as the barrel was put back into place romero wanted to scream he picked up the basket and examined its contents bread cheese sliced carrots two apples and a book it was a tattered blue hardback without a dustcover the title on its spine read d h lawrence selected stories there was a bookmark at a story called the woman who rode away the pages in that section of the book had been so repeatedly turned that the upper corners were almost worn through the blows to romeros head made him feel as if a spike had been driven into it breathing more rapidly dizzier than ever he went back to the chamber he put the basket on the table then sat on the cot and felt so weak that he wanted to lie down but he told himself that he had to look at the story one thing you could say for certain about john he wasnt whimsical the story was important romero opened the book for a harrowing moment his vision doubled he strained to focus his eyes and as quickly as the problem had occurred it went away his vision again clear but he knew what was happening ive got a concussion i need to get to a hospital damn it concentrate the woman who rode away the story was set in mexico it was about a woman married to a wealthy industrialist who owned bountiful silver mines in the sierra madre she had a healthy son and daughter her husband adored her she had every comfort she could imagine but she couldnt stop feeling smothered as if she was another of her husbands possessions as if he and her children owned her each day she spent more and more time staring longingly at the mountains whats up there she wondered surely it must be something wonderful the secret villages one day she went out horseback riding and never came back romero stopped reading the shock of his injuries had drained him he had trouble holding his throbbing head up at the same time his empty stomach cramped again i have to keep up my strength he thought forcing himself to stand he went over to the basket of food chewed on a carrot and took a bite out of a freshly baked thickly crusted chunk of bread he swallowed more water and went back to the cot the break hadnt done any good as exhausted as ever he reopened the book the woman rode into the mountains she had brought enough food for several days and as she rode higher she let her horse choose whatever trails it wanted higher and higher past pines and aspens and cottonwoods until as the vegetation thinned and the altitude made her lightheaded indians greeted her on the trail and asked where she was going to the secret villages she told them to see their houses and to learn about their gods the indians escorted her into a lush valley that had trees a river and groups of low flat gleaming houses there the villagers welcomed her and promised to teach her romero saw double again frightened he struggled to control his vision the concussions getting worse he thought fear made him weaker he wanted to lie down but he knew that if he fell asleep he might never wake up shout for help he thought in a panic to whom nobody can hear me not even the brothers rousing himself he went over to the table bit off another chunk of bread ate a piece of apple and sat down to finish the story it was supposed to tell him something he was sure but so far he hadnt discovered what it was the woman had the sense of being in a dream the villagers treated her well bringing her flowers and clothes food and drinks made of honey she spent her days in a pleasant languor she had never slept so long and deeply each evening the pounding of drums was hypnotic the seasons turned fall became winter snow fell the sun was angry the villagers said on the shortest day of the year the moon must be given to the sun they carried the woman to an altar took off her clothes and plunged a knife into her chest the shocking last page made romero jerk his head up the womans death was all the more unnerving because she knew it was coming and she surrendered to it didnt try to fight it almost welcomed it she seemed apart from herself in a daze romero shivered as his eyelids drooped again he thought about the honey drinks that the villagers had kept bringing her they must have been drugged oh shit he thought it took all of his will power to raise his sagging head and peer toward the basket and the jug on the table the food and water are drugged a tingle of fear swept through him the only sensation he could still feel his head was so numb that it had stopped aching his hands and feet didnt seem to be a part of him im going to pass out he thought sickly he started to lie back no cant dont get your lazy ass off this cot if you fall asleep youll die mind spinning he wavered to his feet stumbled toward the table banged against it almost knocked it over straightened lurched toward the toilet seat bent over it stuck his finger down his throat vomited the food and water hed consumed he wavered into the corridor staggered to the ladder gripped it turned staggered back reached the door to the root cellar turned and stumbled back to the ladder he did it again you have to keep walking and again youve got to stay on your feet his knees buckled he forced them to straighten his vision turned gray he stumbled onward using his arms to guide him it was the hardest thing he had ever done it took more discipline and determination than he knew he possessed i wont give up he kept saying it became a mantra i wont give up time became a blur delirium a constant somewhere in his long ordeal his vision cleared his legs became stronger when his headache returned he allowed himself to hope the drug was wearing off instead of wavering he walked and kept walking pumping himself up i have to be ready he thought as his mind became more alert it was seized by confusion why had john wanted him to read the story wasnt it the same as a warning not to eat the food and drink the water or maybe it was an explanation of what was happening a choice that was offered spare yourself the agony of panic eat from the bounty of the earth and surrender as the woman had done like hell romero dumped most of the water into the latrine it helped to dissipate his vomit down there concealing what he had done he left a small piece of bread and a few carrot sticks he bit into the apples and spit out the pieces leaving cores he took everything else into the root cellar and hid it in the darkest corner behind baskets of potatoes he checked his watch it had been eleven in the morning when theyd forced him down here it was now almost midnight hearing the faint scrape of the barrel being moved he lay down on the cot closed his eyes dangled an arm onto the floor and tried to control his frantic breathing enough to look unconscious be careful he might be bluffing most of the foods gone stay out of my line of fire hands grabbed him lifting a dead weight he felt himself being carried along the corridor he murmured as if he didnt want to be wakened after securing a harness around him one brother went up the ladder and pulled on a rope while the other brothers lifted him in the barn as they took off the harness he moved his head and murmured again lets see if he can stand john said romero allowed his eyelids to flicker hes coming around mark said then he can help us they carried him into the open he moved his head from side to side as if aroused by the cold night air they put him in the back of the pickup truck two brothers stayed with him while the other drove the night was so cold that he allowed himself to shiver yeah definitely coming around john said the truck stopped he was lifted out and carried into a field allowing his eyelids to open a little farther romero was amazed at how bright the moon was he saw that the field was the same one that he had seen the brothers tilling and removing stones from the day before they set him on his feet he pretended to waver heart pounding he knew that he had to do something soon until now he had felt helpless against the three of them the barn had been too constricting a place in which to try to fight he needed somewhere in the open somewhere that allowed him to run this field was going to have to be it because he knew without a doubt that this was where they intended to kill him put him on his knees john said its still not too late to stop this mark said have you lost your faith i answer me have you lost your faith no then put him on his knees romero allowed himself to be lowered his heart was beating so frantically that he feared it would burst against his ribs a sharp stone hurt his knees he couldnt allow himself to react they leaned him forward on his hands like an animal his neck was exposed prove your faith mark something scraped a knife being pulled from a scabbard it glinted in the moonlight take it john said but prove your faith a long tense pause yes john said lord accept this sacrifice in thanks for the glory of your earth and the bounty that comes from it the blood of feeling another sharp rock this one beneath his palm romero gripped it spun and hurled it as strongly as he could at the head of the figure nearest him the rock made a crunching noise the figure groaning and dropping as romero charged to his feet and yanked the knife from marks hands he drove it into marks stomach and stormed toward the remaining brother whom he recognized as john because of the pistol in his hand but before romero could strike him with the knife john stumbled back aiming and romero had no choice except to hurl the knife it hit john but whether it injured him romero couldnt tell at least it made john stumble back farther his aim wide the shot ploughing into the earth and by then romero was racing past the pickup truck into the lane toward the house john fired again the bullet struck the pickup truck running faster propelled by fear romero saw the lights of the house ahead and veered to the left so he wouldnt be a silhouette a third shot a bullet buzzing past him shattered a window in the house he stretched his legs to the maximum his chest heaved as the house got larger before him he heard the roar of the pickup truck behind him i have to get off the lane he thought he veered farther to the left scrambled over a rail fence and raced across a field of chard his panicked footsteps mashing the tender shoots headlights gleamed behind him the truck stopped a fourth shot broke the silence john obviously assumed that in this isolated area there was a good chance a neighbor wouldnt hear or care trouble with coyotes a fifth shot stung romeros left shoulder breathing rapidly and hoarsely he zigzagged at the same time he bent forward running as fast as he could while staying low he came to another fence squirmed between its rails and rushed into a further field mashing further crops radishes he dimly thought the truck roared closer along the lane another roar matched it the roiling power of the rio grande as romero raced nearer the lights of the house were to his right now he passed them reaching the darkness at the back of the farm the river thundered more loudly almost there if i can headlights glaring the truck raced to intercept him another fence romero lunged between its rails so forcefully that he banged his injured shoulder but he didnt care moonlight showed him the path to the raised footbridge he rushed along it hearing the truck behind him the churning river reflected the headlights its fierce whitecaps beckoning with a shout of triumph he reached the footbridge his frantic footsteps rumbled across it spray from the river slicked the boards his feet slipped the bridge swayed water splashed over it he lost his balance nearly tumbled into the river but righted himself a gunshot whistled past abruptly he was off the bridge diving behind bushes scurrying through the darkness on his right john fired twice toward where romero had entered the bushes as romero dove to the ground farther to the right desperate not to make noise he fought to slow his frenzied breathing his throat was raw his chest ached he touched his left shoulder and felt cold liquid mixed with warm water and blood he shivered couldnt stop shivering the headlights of the truck showed john walking onto the footbridge the pistol was in his right hand something else was in his left it suddenly blazed a powerful flashlight it scanned the bushes romero pressed himself lower to the ground john proceeded across the bridge ive been counting the same as you have he shouted to be heard above the force of the current eight shots i checked the magazine before i got out of the truck six more rounds plus one in the firing chamber any moment the flashlights glare would reach where romero was hiding he grabbed a rock thanked god that it was his left shoulder that had been injured and used his right arm to hurl the rock it bounced off the bridge as romero scurried farther upriver john swung the flashlight toward where hed been hiding and fired this time romero didnt stop rocks against a pistol werent going to work he might get lucky but he doubted it john knew which direction he was taking and whenever romero risked showing himself to throw another rock john had a good chance of capturing him in the blaze of the flashlight and shooting him keep going upriver he told himself keep making john follow without aiming he threw a rock in a high arc toward john but didnt trick him into firing without a target fine romero thought scrambling through the murky bushes just as long as he keeps following the raft he kept thinking they found my campsite they found my car but did they find the raft in the darkness it was hard to get his bearings there had been a curve in the river he remembered yes and the ridge on this side angled down toward the water he scurried fiercely deliberately making so much noise that john was bound to hear and follow hell think im panicking romero thought to add to the illusion he threw another high arcing rock toward where john was stalking him a branch lanced his face he didnt pay attention he just rushed onward realized that the bank was curving saw the shadow of the ridge angling down to the shore and searched furiously through the bushes tripping over the raft nearly banging his head on one of the rocks that hed put in it to prevent a wind from blowing it away johns flashlight glinted behind him probing the bushes hurry breathless romero took off his jacket stuffed it with large rocks set it on the rocks that were already in the raft and dragged the raft toward the river downstream john heard him and redirected the flashlight but not before romero ducked back into the bushes watching the current suck the raft downstream in the moonlight and the glint of the flashlight the bulging jacket looked as if romero were hunkered down in the raft hoping not to be shot as the raft sped past john swung toward the river and fired he fired again the muzzle flash bright the shots barely audible in the roar of the current which also muted the noises that romero made as he charged from the bushes and slammed against john throwing his injured arm around johns throat while he used his other hand to grab johns gun arm the force of hitting john propelled them into the water instantly the current gripped them its violence as shocking as the cold johns face was sucked under clinging to him straining to keep him under romero also struggled with the river its power thrusting him through the darkness the current heaved him up then dropped him the cold was so fierce that already his body was becoming numb even so he kept squeezing johns throat and struggling to get the pistol away from him a huge tree limb scraped past the current upended him john broke the surface romero went under johns hands pressed him down frenzied romero kicked he thought he heard a scream as john let go of him and he broke to the surface five feet away john fought to stay above the water and aim the pistol romero dove under hearing the shot he used the force of the current to add to his effort as he thrust himself farther underwater and erupted from the surface to johns right grabbing johns gun arm twisting it you son of a bitch romero thought if im going to die youre going with me he dragged him under they slammed against a boulder the pain making romero cry out underwater gasping he broke to the surface saw john ahead of him aiming saw the headlights of the truck illuminating the foot bridge saw the huge tree limb caught in the narrow space between the river and the bridge before john could fire he slammed into the branch romero collided with it a moment later trapped in its arms squeezed by the current romero reached for the pistol as john aimed it pointblank then johns face twisted into surprised agony as a boulder crashed down on him from the bridge and split his skull open romero was barely aware of matthew above him on the foot bridge he was too paralyzed with horror watching blood stream down johns face an instant later a log hurtled along the river struck john and drove him harder against the tree branch in the glare of the headlights romero thought he saw wood protruding from johns chest as he the branch and the log broke free of the bridge and swirled away in the current thrust along with him romero stretched his arms up trying to claw at the bridge he failed speeding under it reaching the other side he tensed in apprehension of hitting a boulder and being knocked unconscious when something snagged him hands matthew was on his stomach on the bridge stretching as far down as he could clutching romeros shirt romero struggled to help him trying not to look at matthews crushed forehead and right eye from where romero had hit him with the rock gripping matthews arms pulling himself up romero felt debris crash past his legs and then he and matthew were flat on the foot bridge breathing hoarsely trying to stop trembling i hate him matthew said for a moment romero was certain that his ears were playing tricks on him that the shots and the roar of the water were making him hear sounds that werent there i hate him matthew repeated my god you can talk for the first time in twelve years he later found out i hate him matthew said hatehimhatehimhatehimhatehim relieving the pressure of silence that had built up for almost two thirds of his life matthew gibbered while they went to check mark and found him dead while they went to the house and romero phoned the state police while they put on warm clothes and romero did what he could for matthews injury and they waited for the police to arrive while the sun rose and the investigators swarmed throughout the farm matthews hysterical litany became ever more speedy and shrill until a physician finally had to sedate him and he was taken away in an ambulance the state trooper whom romero had asked for backup was part of the team when romeros police chief and sergeant heard what had happened they drove up from santa fe by then the excavations had started and the bodies were showing up what was left of them anyway after their blood had been drained into the fields and theyd been cut into pieces good god how many the state trooper exclaimed as more and more body parts most in extreme stages of decay were found under the fields as long as matthew can remember its been happening romero said his mother died giving birth to him shes under one of the fields the father died from a heart attack three years ago they never told anybody they just buried him out there someplace every year whats usually on the last frost date may theyve sacrificed someone most of the time it was a homeless person no one to be missed but last year it was susan crowell and her fiance they had the bad luck of getting a flat tire right outside the farm they walked down here and asked to use a phone when john realized they were from out of state but why the police chief asked in dismay as more body parts were discovered to give life to the earth thats what the d h lawrence story was about the fertility of the earth and the passage of the seasons i guess thats as close as john was able to come to explaining to his victims why they had to die what about the shoes the police chief asked i dont understand about the shoes luke dropped them the fourth brother thats right hes out there somewhere he committed suicide the police chief looked sick throughout the spring until the vegetables were ready for sale luke drove back and forth from the farm to santa fe to sell moss rocks each day he drove along old pecos trail twice a day he passed the baptist church he was as psychologically tortured as matthew but john never suspected how close he was to cracking that church became lukes attempt for absolution one day he saw old shoes on the road next to the church you mean he didnt drop the first ones no they were somebodys idea of a prank but they gave him an idea he saw them as a sign from god two years ago he started dropping the shoes of the victims theyd always been a problem clothes will decay readily enough but shoes take a lot longer john told him to throw them in the trash somewhere in santa fe luke couldnt bring himself to do that any more than he could bring himself to go into the church and pray for his soul but he could drop the shoes outside the church in the hopes that hed be forgiven and that the familys victims would be granted salvation and the next year he dropped shoes with feet in them the sergeant said john had no idea that hed taken them when he heard what had happened he kept luke a prisoner here one morning luke
