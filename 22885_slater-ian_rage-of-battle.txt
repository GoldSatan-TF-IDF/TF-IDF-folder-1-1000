ian slater rage of battle there are no guarantees that a stalinist will not succeed gorbachev andrei sakharov chapter one from the reddedout control room beneath the uss roosevelts sail capt robert brentwood reached the forward torpedo room in under ten seconds stepping into the compartment he saw evans previously one of the quietest and bestbehaved seamen aboard the sub backed into a corner near the number one torpedo tube slashing the air with a long thin screwdriver screaming fucking snakes get em away get em away the bosun and another crewman an electrician firstclass were moving in on evans the bosun trying to shush him for christs sake theyll hear you in moscow wheres the hospital corpsman robert brentwood asked quietly in sick bay the bosun told him down with the flu what i reckon evans has probably brentwood knew there was only one thing to do but felt queasy even as he gave the order get a syringe here fast valium twenty milligrams yes sir the bosun answered and was gone the electrician was so alarmed by evanss fit and screaming that he didnt notice the fine beads of sweat breaking out on brentwoods forehead as hed given the order for the hypodermic it was a secret fear one shared only by robert brentwoods two younger brothers and sister lana a navy nurse he hadnt even told rosemary spence his fianc√©e back in england for the quietly competent graduate of annapolis top of his class and commander of the most awesome weapons launcher in history a confession to rosemary or to his crew that the very thought of a hypodermic made him weak at the knees would have been nothing less than an abject humiliation whenever he had to have a blood test hed always looked away out the window at a painting a piece of fly dirt on the wall anything to avoid the sight of the cold steel puncturing taut skin sliding into the vein but now with the hospital corpsman out of it with the virulent influenza that had been rampant in the united kingdom and which brentwood believed might have temporarily unhinged evans it would be up to him as captain to remember his officer training in subcutaneous and intramuscular injections to push the needle into the wildeyed sailor who was still yelling the long thin screwdriver keeping brentwood and the electrician at bay the problem would be to talk evans down to get him calm or preoccupied enough to give him the shot whats all the racket the corpsman asked the bosun groggily his eyes all but closed in the grip of fever evans explained the bosun off his fucking head wake up the dead let alone the russians wheres the valium diazepam the corpsman corrected him full of selfimportance despite his malaise how much did you say ah twenty ccs who you want to kill drawled the corpsman shuffling toward the locked drug cabinet evans or the whole fucking crew what twenty milligrams you mean not ccs give me the fucking vial and a syringe when the bosun reentered the torpedo room there was a strong chemical smell everything in the rigged for red glow seemed pink evans was on the deck the foam from a carbon dioxide extinguisher brentwood had used so they could get near him stained with blood from a bad gash on the left side of evanss head the bosun almost slipped the deck slicked with foam what the he began quickly ordered brentwood give me the syringe he wished to god his sister lana were here slippery from the foam evanss arm kept eluding brentwoods grip goddamn it it was the first time the bosun had heard the skipper use any kind of profanity since hed taken command of the roosevelt two years before brentwood lowered evanss arm and stepped over him to his right side pull down his pants brentwood ordered gritting his teeth brentwood plunged the hypodermic into the torpedo mans buttocks and pushed the plunger in surprised by the resistance looking away focusing on the stainless steel prop of one of the thirtyfivehundredpound mk torpedoes until he felt the plunger wouldnt depress any farther all right he said his breathing short and hard as if hed just sprinted a hundred yards get him to sick bay restraining straps one of you stay with him what happens when he wakes up sir asked the electrician hes gonna start up again brentwood handed the emptied hypodermic to the bosun tell the corpsman if hes well enough to keep evans heavily sedated until further notice if the corpsmans not up to it come and tell me what you thinks wrong with him asked the electrician looking apprehensively from brentwood to the bosun darned if i know said the bosun bosun ordered brentwood youd better get a stretcher watch yourself on this deck ill send someone down to dry it off the hospital corpsman said he drought it must be the dts delirium tremens bullshit said the bosun he doesnt even smell of booze anyway we left holy loch over twenty hours ago worst time said the corpsman in a tone calculated to impress the electrician whod helped carry evans on the stretcher the corpsman tried to stifle a racking cough with one hand giving the restraining straps for the stretcher to the bosun with the other secret boozer maybe he continued so long as they get their daily dose theyre okay miss one and brother they see snakes elephants you name it the subs dry said the bosun impatiently right said the corpsman and im scarlett ohara engine room solvents cough medicine the corpsman stopped man theyll drink anything uhhuh said the bosun recalling the corpsmans smartass crack about twenty ccs instead of twenty milligrams the bosun tapped the antirollsecured drug cabinet above the corpsmans head better check your supplies doctor ill bet tits for bits youve got some water in your alcohol jars you being in sick bay yourself is probably what stopped him getting his daily shot of booze if youre right well responded the corpsman weighing the possibility of having to explain any alcohol missing from the sick bay maybe he has the flu right said the bosun and im scarlett ohara scarlett said the electrician will you marry me piss off said the bosun and get back to the fucking torpedo room after the racket evans made its a fucking wonder if their whole fucking northern fleet didnt hear as well as being profane the bosun was quite wrong the northern fleet hadnt heard them but with the sound waves from evanss commotion racing out through the underwater world at four times the speed of sound in the air a russian cruiser on silent station her orders to find and kill the roosevelt had heard them her sonar now locked on to the american sub chapter two like his crew ivan stasky captain of the russian cruiser admiral yumashev had never paid much attention to politics to the fact that the honeymoon between moscow and washington and gorbachevs nobel prize for peace were long past that the american government had been as naive about what would happen after gorbachev as it had been about dengs open door policy in china until the door slammed shut tiananmen square awash in blood the yumashev and her crew were nothing more and nothing less than instruments of soviet national policy one of the soviets ten seventysixhundredton kresta hclass cruisers under the command of capt ivan stasky her sole job was to hunt and kill american submarines that were escorting the critical nato resupply convoys from halifax and other north american east coast ports to beleaguered europe three months into the war and four hundred miles south of the gin greenlandicelandnorway gap the ice shelf enveloping her in dense autumn fog the yumashev had been devoting all her talents to stalking the roosevelt for this sub an upgunned sea wolf class ii which was reported to have departed holy loch on scotlands west coast twentyfour hours before was much more than a protector of nato convoys as one of the americans footlong ton dualrole hunterkillericbm subs the roosevelt was capable of acting not only as a fast hunterkiller of other subs but as a defensive retaliatory launch platform for the six eightwarheadapiece trident ii missiles stowed aft of its twentyfivefoot sail happily for ivan stasky and his crew aboard the yumashev a soviet rocket attack two days earlier had destroyed the lochs degaussing or magnetic signature erasure station this meant that yumashevs computer able to identify the sub through its noise signature as being that of the roosevelt could by drawing on its memory bank of enemy captain profiles also tell the cruisers captain that his counterpart aboard the us sub was either a robert brentwood age fortythree a graduate of annapolis or a harold brenner fortyfour also from annapolis the prestigious naval academy the fact that there were two captains involved was due to the american nuclear submarines being so selfsufficient in food reactor fuel and in producing so much fresh water a day that they had to pump out the excess that the sub needed two crews gold and blue because of such selfsufficiency it was the men not the sub who needed to be rested after a totally submerged fortyfive to seventyday war patrol this time however several hours after the roosevelt had left scotlands holy loch the yumashevs communication center was to find out who was skippering the roosevelt on this cruise by listening to the flippant chitchat of a glasgow rock station one of its disc jockeys a longtime soviet operative informed the yumashev by working an lfl letter for letter code into his nonstop patter that it was the blue crew which had been seen reporting to holy loch and so it was that ivan stasky knew capt robert brentwood was his opponent the yumashevs first mate reading the printouts description of brentwood six feet brown eyes brown hair made a joke about the blue eyes how the american captain would soon be singing the blues stasky took no notice for many russian commanders the computer profiles of their american counterparts the information about them assiduously gathered in the gorbachev era when americans and russians had actually invited one another to attend maneuverscould sometimes help a soviet captain formulate tactics stasky however a tough stocky azeri from kirovabad in azerbaijan believed the profiles were in the main a waste of rubles akademikihightech boys he would say watching the computer spewing out the information about the adversaries hed never seen playing games in moscow hed charge considering the money could have been better spent giving aid to his native nonrussian republic of azerbaijan had it not been for the war stasky believed the neverending and increasing dissent of minority groups in the ussr such as the armenians and the azerbaijanis would have posed a far greater danger to moscow than the americans on occasion however he had to admit albeit grudgingly the psychological profiles of enemy captains did pay off the most important information being whether the american captain like an ice hockey coach was offensively or defensively minded this was especially helpful given the dualrole capacity of the upgunned sea wolf in addition to its speed over forty knots and its silence stasky knew that the sea wolf had an unmatched ability to mow the lawnthat is its wide sidescan sonar was able to simultaneously and in great detail search both sides of the deep oceanic canyons that plummeted either side of the seventhousandfoothigh midatlantic ridge it was a question of who heard whom first neither americans nor russians wanting to use active radar preferring instead to run passive listening for the other sub instead of sending out echocreating pulses which could give away your own position and stasky knew that even if a sea wolf hadnt found out exactly where you were any one of its twentyeightmilerange mk homing torpedoes set loose could run a search pattern around you and then home in even if a surface vessel like the yumashev could cut engines enough to reduce its noise signature to a faint murmur in the sound channel as it had done on silent station listening for the roosevelt it was not safe for while this might deny any approaching torpedo an exact fix on the surface vessel a torpedo exploding anywhere nearby would implode the hulls of most ships except perhaps the doubletitanium alloy of the soviet alfa boats and if the americans torpedoes didnt get you they could use any of five forward tubes to launch one of the cruise missiles they carried these were able to hit either surface ships submarines or land targets fifteen hundred miles away with a cep or circular error of probability of only plus or minus three hundred feet in addition any one of its fortyeight independently targeted reentry nuclear warheads was capable of melting moscow into oblivion the subs total firepower over three thousand times greater than the hiroshima abomb even so yumashevs captain knew that for all the sea wolfs awesome power making it the primary target of the russian navy the american sub was only as good as its captain and crew besides yumashev had already sunk two allied submarines one a british oberonclass dieselelectric the other a trafalgar a seventyfivehundredton british nuclearpowered ballistic missile sub when stasky had used his helicopterborne dunking sonar mike to pick up the movement of the enemy submarines then launched his asrocs airborne antisubmarine rockets he had been struck once again by the paradox of the hunt whereas the obsessive silence of the subs was their greatest weapon it was a singular one for the moment they fired their silence was gone the advantage immediately shifted to the surface ship and its deadly array of asw weapons sometimes the sub didnt have to fire at all in order for your sonar to detect it if you had your helicopter out and its dunking sonar picked up the enemy subs noise signature you simply dumped a homing depth charge or two to finish it off what i want to know ilya the yumashevs captain asked his first officer is whether or not the roosevelt is heading out for convoy escort duty or is it hunting like we are it left holy loch alone captain yes but with forty to fortyfive knots submerged it could now be on the flank of a convoy that would put it in a defensive mode and that changes our mode of attack we havent received any information from glasgow on a convoy forming answered the lieutenant im not talking about a convoy leaving scotland said stasky with nothing but empty holds i mean a convoy approaching the uk even as we speak loaded to the gills for nato resupply the american sub could be coming out to take over escort duty at the halfway mark but the british navy have responsibility for this side of the atlantic captain yes said stasky but the british have only eight he remembered the trafalgar hed sunk seven nuclear submarines comrade they cant do it alone they need american help stasky requested a printout of roosevelts total complement officers and crew kgbs first directorate had assigned agents in britain and the united states to follow family members of some of the us submarine crews whenever one of the family went to a post office the kgb agent usually a woman waited patiently behind the person in line chatty and friendly the agent would accidentally bump the family member apologizing profusely quickly retrieve the dropped mail and in the process deftly affix a quickstick microdot chip transmitter to the targeted envelope the transmitter could then hopefully be traced through fleet mail the failure rate was high as most of the time the microdot chip would become mangled by the post office or its shape otherwise ruptured along the way but occasionally the concerted effort paid off the key to the kgbs success was their ability to keep track of the highly sophisticated japanese microdot tracer sets via krysat the intelligence satellite named after vladimir kryuchkov who had been personally appointed and ordered by gorbachev in to launch the biggest kgb espionage operation since world war ii to secure as many military and industrial secrets from the west as possible on several occasions krysat was able to keep an ellok or electronic lock on one of the microdot transmitters allowing it to be traced all the way to a fleet area once in the area proper the weak transmitter signal on the same frequency as a thousand other pieces of electronic equipment in the area was drowned in a sea of much stronger frequencies so that the exact position of the american sub that the targeted crew member was on was not known but the general area of the battle group to which sub armament resupply vessels were attached narrowed the search area considerably this made up for the fact which stasky and every other soviet captain was aware of that the russian tupolev reconnaissance aircraft nato designation bear with its thirtysixfootwide rotodome though good enough for general maritime patrols up to seven thousand miles away was not much help in hunting for enemy subs the bears four kuznetsov turboprop engines were capable of only miles per hour its armament in the otherwise impressive remotely controlled dorsal and ventral twin twentythreemillimeter gun barbettes no match against the dazzling virtuosity of the american fs unfortunately for stasky while the general fleet area of the roosevelt like that of the two subs hed already sunk had sometimes been known to him courtesy of the first directorates dogged electronic surveillance the american sub had always acted as a lone wolf he would have to find her by himself to this end stasky gave orders for the yumashevs hormone helicopter to be launched and reemphasized the need for full battle readiness to the men manning the torpedodepth charge tubes that festooned the cruisers sleek flanks as the cruiser increased speed both men and launchers were splattered by spray as the elegant curve of the long gray ships bow bucked and sliced its way through mounting seas next after checking the satnav satellite navigation printout something he could not always rely on during severe solar flare activity the russian captain ordered his chief engineer to be ready at a moments notice to ekhat polnym khodom pull out all the stops bringing the sub chaser to its maximum speed of fiftynine knots would give stasky an advantage of fifteen knots over the american binoculars slung about his neck stasky moved out to the windward side of the flying bridge the sudden rush of cold sea air at once invigorating and numbing he looked down at the foredeck of his long gray ship as it knifed through a heavy swell and knew he was ready confident of his command his crew and the ships impressive armament at the same time he was too old a captain not to realize that in addition to speed and asw weaponry which the technical experts ashore referred to rather grandly as the determining elementswhat you needed was udacha a bit of luck as the cruiser raced eastward hoping to close the gap between herself and her american quarry stasky found himself trying to imagine what the enemy captain brentwood and his crew were like was there anything in the profile printouts that he could pick up on turn to his advantage despite all the mumbojumbo and psychobabble of some of the printouts which had gotten worse during the liberalism of gorbachevs time stasky had to admit that sometimes a submarine had been found out and sunk because of a small inattention to detail by just one member of its crew he recalled the soviets loss of a stateoftheart alfaclass huk sub because a disgruntled crewman on garbage disposal detail had failed to make sure the compacted bale of trash had been properly weighted and bound loose foil from the frozen food wrappers bobbing up to the surface though invisible to the naked eye especially in fog had nevertheless been picked up by a us satellites infrared eye going back inside the bridge stasky ordered the officer of the deck to give him a printout of all the roosevelt crew member summaries on file glasgow had reported for example that robert brentwood was engaged to a schoolteacher in surrey but this information garnered from the london times announcements column didnt strike the russian captain as in any way significant that is until his first officer pointed out halfjokingly that at least brentwoods insurance rates would fall when stasky asked what he meant the officer explained that on one of the prewar programma voennogo obmena military exchange programshed been on in america he had discovered that in the united states and other capitalist countries when a man is married or has children his insurance rates fall because the insurance companies statistics showed that with increased responsibility for a wife andor children a man tended to be much more cautious to drive more carefully bolshe oboronitez nomore defensively stasky nodded thoughtfully looking down at brentwoods printout again more defensive it was the samy kraythe edgethat might make all the difference especially if the roosevelt was heading out for convoy patrol such escort duty was an added incentive for a sub captain not to fire the first shot not to do anything that might betray his position to play defensively rather than offensively oh certainly it might account for only a fraction of a second but in a fraction of a second another mans hesitation stasky knew he could fire everything he had chapter three oxshott surrey yes asked rosemary spence indicating the student at the back of her shakespeare class the boys eyeglasses opaque discs in the artificial light well miss it seems as if lear only makes sense when hes crazy i mean when hes sane he doesnt make any sense at all normally rosemary spence would have pressed the student on why he thought that about lear was it his own or had he lifted it from orwells essay lear tolstoy and the fool but this afternoon her heart wasnt in it her attention waning as she worried about robert on the night before hed left oxshott on his way back to scotland there had been antiaircraft missile fire all along englands southeast coast the soviet air forces pounding the ports all but destroying a convoy of forty ships that had made the long and dangerous threethousandmile voyage from newfoundland only to come under the fierce bombardment of over five squadrons of soviet fighterbombers as the weary convoy approached the southampton loran station as the stalks of searchlights clustered like enormous celery sticks separated and closed again trying to hold their soviet targets the explosions of iron bombs shattering the docksides of southern england and the yellow tails and scream of airtoair and groundtoair rockets ripping the night sky asunder she and robert had made love and now she held the memory close it helping her get through the daily anxiety of wondering where he was whether he was safe she also tried to escape from the worry by burying herself in her work but teaching shakespeare always brought her back to the multitudinous calamities that befall even the most innocent let alone those at war to make matters worse every day more and more countries were being drawn into the maelstrom all the experts proven disastrously wrong as the war leaders fearing a nuclear holocaust held back from pushing the button unleashing instead a conventional albeit hightech war that was now three months old and showed no signs of letup as country after country fearful of being caught alone in the storm threw in its lot with either the nato alliance or the soviet armies the bell rang at for the end of class but no one could leave the shelter because a salvo of intermediaterange rockets launched from hamburg batteries had penetrated the aa screen along the channel and the all clear had not yet sounded most of the students used the time to start their homework but the new boy wilkins who had guffawed at the other boys comment on lear and who was also the manic class clown began his repertoire of rude noises it took all rosemarys effort to check him a task that not only a week before she had felt herself more than equal to now she simply wished a bomb would fall on him her anxiety about robert about everything had grown much worse after their engagement had been officially announced a few days before he left till then she had never believed herself to be superstitious but now that their plan to marry was officially proclaimed she found herself performing small ceremonies of obeisance to some higher order god whomever whatever as apprehensive she realized as those students shed seen exhibiting obsessive behavior whenever exams were in the offing their ceremonies of repetition insurance against malevolent forces while she and robert had been together she hardly knew the war existed but with him gone to sea and people congratulating her on the engagement she suddenly felt more vulnerable as if both of them having publicly declared their love were tempting fate then again she wasnt sure it was that at all which had driven her into her present and for her strange mood of melancholy perhaps she thought it had more to do with the death of her younger brother william after the convoy he was in had been attacked by acoustically detonated mines in the midatlantic william had been taken to newfoundland where the brentwood connection had first been made with roberts sister lana and where despite an initial healthy prognosis william died from complications complications in rosemarys lexicon it was simply another word for the inexplicable her parents and her sister georgina now a student at lse had all been so hopeful that young william would come home the suddenness of his death had affected them in markedly different ways but it colored everything they did for rosemary the tragic passages of shakespeare she had to teach offered no catharsis but rather intensified her awareness of the arbitrariness of ones life the dark hand of chance made at once more tangible and terrible during robert brentwoods first visit he had brought them williams few trinkets id tags the wristwatch their father had given him together with a long touching letter from lana brentwood williams nurse it was a letter so devoid of maudlin sentiment yet so uninhibitedly personal so typical of americans robert excepted that the spence family felt that lana brentwood had known william as well as any of them it was shakespeare again rosemary thought for had it not been for the manmade tempest that had destroyed most of the convoy on which william had sailed she would probably not have met robert brentwood a stranger who with two weeks leave while the submarine he commanded was rearmed and her hull repainted in holy loch had taken it upon himself in a moment of boredom more than anything else as he later confessed to rosemary to personally deliver lanas letter and williams few remaining effects he had meant to stay only overnight caught out by the disrupted train schedule but had stayed in surrey with the spences for the remainder of his leave rosemarys father had been taken aback by the rapidity of the romance but her mother who rosemary knew would voice any parental objection if any were to be made had surprised everyone by instantly accepting the situation though griefstricken by her sons death anne spence encouraged them both taking it upon herself in another act that took her husband richard and two daughters by surprise to make all the arrangements for the wedding which would take place during roberts next leave it was in fact anne spences salvation there was so much to do so much initiative called for to overcome the scarcities of wartime rationing a lack of everything from sugar for a wedding cake to paper that the attention she had to give to all the details for the wedding filled her hours and kept a nervous breakdown at bay richard retired now and then to his study with the little available brandy he could afford to calm himself after seeing what she was doing to their savings account at one point he had seriously considered writing a letter to the local manager of barclays bank in oxshott to cancel their credit card but as fall ended the nato forces still reeling from the juggernaut and sheer brute strength of the soviet forces richard spence let his wife spend it was quite possible that within a year or two they would all be dead besides after williams death nothing was the same anymore even rosemary whom richard had thought the steadiest and most sensible of them all had confided to him that she too felt adrift all her own beliefs her once steady vision of the universe of cause and effect no longer held for her the mere thought that she and robert that all of them were no more than flotsam on the wild sea of the world was terrifying her once powerful sense of optimism seemed to have been swept away forever she was lost and only in roberts arms had she felt safe she wondered whether shed agreed to marry him too hastily more from the fear of a loveless world than the hope of a loving one the all clear began its wail as mournful as the earlier air raid warning had been and as she waited for the students to file out of the shelter she thought again of how easily she and her class the entire school for that matter could become entombed at any time it would take only one of the highexplosive iron bombs as deadly to a shelter as a depth charge to a submarine she said a prayer but was anyone listening she heard a tearing noise and laughter wilkins his eyes bright with mischief was making farting sounds she was sure that if the school received a direct hit everyone would die save wilkins what she couldnt stand was his stupid bovine optimism she doubted he even knew where most of europe was let alone the fact that except for western france and spain it had been all but overrun by the soviet armies at the beginning of the war before wilkins had shown up she had encouraged her pupils to keep an uptodate situation map on the shelter wall but as the enemy armies smashed through natos central front around fulda gap and to the south along the danube while simultaneously wheeling with thousands more tanks across the north german plain to hamburg and bremen on the way to secure the nato ports the students had finally given up on the map to make it even more discouraging the media coverage of the battles was confusing unlike the two previous world wars when newspapers could broadly indicate the ebb and flow of battle now the battles within the larger battlefields were impossible to follow at times in the course of a morning a nato counterattack with a thunderbolts the tankkilling american aircraft seemed to have the better of it then by midafternoon the dust was so thick that friend and foe were indistinguishable in satellite photos in one place it was a raging war of movement in other zones with combatants more quickly exhausted in the strain of hightech combat than in previous conventional wars whole companies especially those of nato were reported digging in either in an effort to catch their breath in the frenzy of retreat or to play for time against the attacking echelons here parts of the crooked front crisscrossed with barbed concertina wire resembled the moonscapes of world war i which the experts had predicted could never happen as beleaguered nato troops anxiously waited for urgently needed refit for thensavaged armored divisions and infantry reinforcements which despite being mobile had to renegotiate overextended supply lines under constant air attack and amid all this wilkins rosemary tried to imagine the parents of such a boy but she knew that one was inevitably wrong some of the most disruptive in class had iron discipline at home and at the other extreme well some of the parents were really worse than the students she thought his card had said his mother was an accountant in leatherhead his father something to do with insurance going up in the lift from the shelter one of the girls squealed and jumped as if stung everyone laughed afresh except the girl face red as beet root wilkins was grinning his callow expression infuriating rosemary wilkins yes me miss was that you me miss saturday morning for you three hours he was still grinning she had to stop herself from making it four hours and when she got home georgina who had come down for the weekend from lse was allknowing at dinner full as usual of sociological theory claiming that such a boy was societys fault the boys acting up she told rosemary was quite clearly a cry for attention well hell get it rosemary replied tartly ive given him a saturday morning you see responded georgina pausing as she reached over a textbook opened ostentatiously to the left of the bread rolls georginas new habit of reading at the table was rosemary had no doubt another of her younger sisters defiances of bourgeois manners besides reading while you were eating was something rosemary had never mastered for the moment their father was either keeping out of it behind his newspaper or simply wasnt paying attention see what demanded rosemary glaring across at georgina what on earth are you talking about this boy wilkins replied georgina breaking a stale ration roll buttering it with nonchalant grace i think he wants you all to himself dont be absurd georgina hes a recalcitrant yobbo i mean said georgina astonishing rosemary with her ability to have broken the roll without a fall of crumbs onto the pressed white linen tablecloth he probably has a thing for you rosemarys face turned beet red she glanced at their father but he was hidden behind the daily telegraph anne spence whod just entered the dining room from the kitchen as the exchange between her daughters was heating up looked wearily down at her younger daughter dont be ridiculous georgina rosemarys old enough to be his mother exactly countered georgina knowingly a rush of exasperation came from behind the telegraph richard spence lowering the newspaper breaking its back folding the broadsheet to a quarter its size that fool knowltons at it again who asked georgina her father peered over his reading glasses unsure of whether she knew or not knowlton guy knowlton that idiot professor who keeps taking out ridiculous advertisements oh said georgina the man who wants to collect all our hair dryers to save energy yes thats him he sounds like a harmless enough eccentric to me father thats not the point georgina i was telling your mother you were here werent you rosemary yes daddy here we are desperately short of all kinds of things paper not being the least of them and yet they persist in allowing this this madman to waste space in its a free country daddy said rosemary tired of his constant harping about the dotty professor for richard spence dr guy knowlton the author of a text on archaeology continued to represent all that was selfindulgent and wasteful in a country that was fighting for its life and yet in which old fools like knowlton were allowed to squander valuable resources do you really think so asked georgina looking at rosemary rosemary lifted the teapot lid seeing it pointless to try to squeeze any more out of the exhausted tea leaves think what that its a free country continued georgina taking the last of the milk for her tea anne spence pointedly left the room dont upset her like that said richard you know how quarrels upset her its not a quarrel daddy replied georgina im merely stating a fact just because were at war doesnt mean we cant question whether were really living in a free georgina in the strained silence that followed her fathers rebuke georgina returned to her book and rosemary could hear the steady heavy ticking of the grandfather clock in the living room recalling that the last time she had been so aware of its presence was after she and robert had made love when ironically at the height of the soviet rocket attack she had felt so safe in his arms georgina finished the bread roll and licking her fingers ran them around the breadandbutter plate to gather up the remaining crumbs my god georgina exclaimed richard is that what they teach you up there its very proletarian daddy said rosemary didnt you know georgina poured herself more tea as if squeezing the pot this is a bit weak isnt it we have to use the leaves over again said rosemary rationing or dont you have that in london i dont know why youre so shirty rose retorted georgina shes worried said her father we all are said georgina this wretched war has mucked everything up its the same old story big capital against not at the table said richard i would have thought put in rosemary that the war suited you very nicely liberating women from the bourgeois apron strings kitchen to factory manpower shortage and all georginas cup stopped in midair and she replaced it on the saucer without having sipped the tea why didnt i think of that rosey thats quite brilliant thank you said rosemary im glad we poor country folk occasionally think of still cut in georgina i bet im right about willie who asked richard looking up from his newspaper he had thought she said william that boywilliams wilkins rosemary corrected her hes got the hots for you rosey richard spences paper shot away from him what a vulgar expression insulting people is it is that what youre learning up there oh really daddy its just an expression yes and i dont care for it there was another long strained silence well said georgina finally and how about this robert brentwood bit sudden rosey you sly fox when do i get to meet him excuse me said rosemary pushing her chair back from the table brushing her lips quickly with the napkin i only wanted to began georgina richard spence folded the newspaper neatly ran his hand down the crease and taking his reading glasses off rubbed his eyes i thought you had grown out of it georgina out of what dont be obtuse your willful aggressiveness youre not happy until you push people to the edge god knows where you get it from he looked hard at her why do you do it georgina said nothing holding her teacup like a communicants chalice staring ahead is it because richard said you think we dont care for you care said georgina her tone defensively hostile as she turned on him you cant even say the word can you your mother and i have never made any distinction the words love daddy or was that just for william you astound me really what pray is that supposed to mean ive always known it of course she said bitterly putting the cup down hard known what oh for heavens sake father she said vigorously folding and refolding her napkin on the table roseys always had your heart do you think i know cut in georgina ever since we were children im not being churlish about it its merely an observation anyone could ive always cared for you your mother and if said georgina slowly a tension clearly crackling in her voice you say cared once more ill scream the phone was ringing and as richard spence got up to answer it georgina avoided his distracted gaze her eyes brimming with tears she heard her father only vaguely yet despite her hurt could tell that something was terribly wrong ill tell her she could hear him say yes yes thank you for calling he put down the receiver slowly and turning called for rosemary shes gone out said georgina holding her teacup in both hands elbows on the table something richard spence could not abide where he asked her ive no idea said georgina richard spence went to the hall and opened the closet taking out his mackintosh and gum boots if your mother asks tell her ive gone looking for her whats wrong her father scooped the keys from the hall stand put on his deerstalker and was gone chapter four aboard the roosevelt submariner evans had been silenced forever yet even in death he seemed to be screaming his face an agony frozen in time the cheek beneath his left eye swollen so that the eye was little more than a slit the left side of his face appearing longer than his right his mouth agape right eye open and staring his whole expression was one of terror paralyzed before the second of impact the bosun who had aided robert brentwood in giving the seaman the shot of valium to quieten him down was trying to make sure the hospital corpsman had given him the correct dosage maybe the corpsman unwell himself at the time had somehow given him a larger dose than he meant to give him but the corpsman shook his head his tone adamant no way jos√© i didnt give you an overdose dont pin it on me here he turned away trying to abort a sneezeunsuccessfully he took down the sick bay clipboard tapping the days entry with his vicks inhaler there it is chief twenty milligrams you signed for it then what the hell began the bosun the corpsman using the inhaler to dismiss the bosuns question who knows couldve had a stroke heart attack combination of factors skipper thinks he killed him despite his fever the corpsman though looking across at the bosun with rheumy eyes still managed an air of a professional clinician natural psychological reaction skippers not used to doing it yeah well anybody kick off after youve given them a shot no the corpsman stared at him then shifted his gaze to evans pulling back the sheet by the governmentissue tag by the look of him id say he died of fright pink elephants sure as hell didnt die of a cold what the hell you mean delirium tremens like i told you before thats where pink elephants come from stop jerking me around listen said the corpsman sticking the vicks inhaler into his nostril one finger flattening the other nostril as he took a deep breath im telling you chief alcoholics whore forced dry see more than pink elephants the bosun remembered evans screaming about snakes maybe the corpsman was right but i thought the valium was supposed to calm him take the edge off not enough said the corpsman once youve flipped out normal dose doesnt do much for you i couldve told the old man that why the hell didnt you i wasnt asked shit you werent there back here sittin on your ass listen man i was pushing a one oh five what temperature fever or hadnt you noticed with that the corpsman took a thermometer from its sheath glanced at it shook the mercury column down before slipping it under his tongue sides i thought it best to keep away from everyone its one mother of a virus the corpsman thermometer sticking out like a small cigarette from his mouth looked down at his watch then said the bosun pulling the sheet back over evanss face before they took him to a forward food freezer what the hell did kill evans the bosun has his thumb on the intercom button and asked someone to come up and help him with the corpse looking at evans still puzzled he told the hospital corpsman you know they say that flu in killed more guys than the war did he thought the hospital corpsman was going to bite the thermometer clean in half the bosun had merely meant it to take a little wind out of the corpsmans sails but later when he entered the roosevelts reddedout control room which smelled like an auto showroom unlike the disinfected sick bay he saw the officer of the deck first mate peter zeldman standing forward of brentwood directly behind the planesmans console and asked him if any of the crew on watch had gone off sick reported a fever but he didnt get his answer the sonar operator cutting in we have an unclassified surface vesselfive thousand yards closing signature check zeldman asked sonar conscious of brentwood moving over from the periscope island watching the shattered ring pulse on the pale green screen no known signature replied sonar moving his head closer to the console working the constant compromise between volume and tone needed to discriminate one noise from another in what nearly everyone but a sailor assumed to be a quiet domain in reality the sea was a neverending frying pan of energy a night jungle of noise countless billions of shrimp microscopic organisms clicking and sizzling amid the eerie haunting trumpets of the giant mammals in constant search for food could it be using baffles put in brentwood signature pattern congruent with full hull sir he meant that there was no sign of the kind of blistering effect on the outer ring of the echo pulse that might indicate symmetrical baffles put it on the pa zeldman ordered sonar squelch button the next second all the crewmen in the control room could hear the muted engine sounds of the unknown surface vessel zeldman was ambivalent about the procedure sometimes he thought it only made everyone more edgy but hed been told by brentwood how putting incoming noise on the pa provided it wasnt loud enough to send out its own pulse reverberating through the hull could sometimes help the sonar operator those enlisted men who had been sailors in civilian life could not only help identify the vessel type but sometimes even luck out on its probable nationality this could save a captain or his executive officer from ordering a preemptive launch of a torpedo or tomahawk cruise missile which while it would almost certainly take out the oncoming vessel would also end the submarines greatest weapon its silence revealing its exact location the ucv speed was now showing twenty knots on the digital readout too fast for most noncombat vessels but brentwood knew that in trying to maintain the us navys rollover strategy rolling over all obstacles including russian sub packs in order to get vital resupply to nato and europe the united states had made up for lost time with an industrial miracle that even dwarfed previous japanese achievements the industrial miracle spurred on by uncertainty about the level of japans commitment to the war effort beyond her helping to ferry american troops across to korea was that the us east coast shipyards and those in san diego were producing prefab thirtythousandton merchantmen called leggo ships by the submarine crews at the rate of one every seven days it wasnt as fast as the one liberty ship every four days achieved by the american kaiser shipyards in world war ii but for a computer age it was impressive the leggo ships stronger because of the laser spot welding and faster brentwood put it to zeldman and the ro that it was quite possible the noise they were hearing was that of a leggo with the merchantmen rolling off the slipways at more than three a week there was no way he pointed out that roosevelts computer could have all leggo noise signatures in its memory each time the subs returned from patrol they were routinely issued the top secret taped signatures of the thirtyfive leggos built in the yards during the patrol besides the moment the merchantmen were completed they were pressed into service without the normal time set aside for sea trials during which the noise signatures of ships were normally taped and refined to register any changes made by the yardbirds could be one of ours conceded zeldman watching brentwoods expression trying to anticipate which course of action he would take fortythree hundred and closing came sonars coolly modulated tone the ship was coming right for them in just over seven minutes it would be directly over the roosevelt now lying still on listening mode only brentwood ordered everything closed down except the coffee grinder the reactor at the very heart of the sub that not only powered the sea wolf but which would take hours to fire up zeldman was worried that brentwood was placing too much faith in the anechoic paint layer on the hull which absorbed sonar pulses from another source thus minimizing sometimes eliminating echo ping and so denying a hunter any noise scent at all suddenly with each man silent rigid as if welded to his post the submarine seemed to shrink inside it was true that for the men who had experienced life in the old dieselelectric subs and for one or two who had served when very young in the last boats of world war ii the sea wolf was infinitely more spacious curtained for privacy individual bunks in nineman dormitories goodsized lockers beneath rack space large enough to hang a full dress uniform a soundproofed audio booth and video room for two movies a week the modern sea wolf was a limousine compared to a standard sedan still for most of the crew who didnt know the old pigboats who hadnt experienced what it was like at the end of your watch to have to roll into the sweatsoaked bunk of your replacement and except for the cook and the oiler to be allowed only one threeminute shower a week the roosevelt was still crowded every now and then even a fully trained crewman would crack from what was euphemistically called dcs developed claustrophobia syndrome as he listened to the heavy gutpunching throb of the approaching vessel it occurred to the hospital corpsman that perhaps evans hadnt had the dts after all maybe hed cracked under the strain of such claustrophobia no matter how much bigger the roosevelt was compared to the old pigboats it was still a submarine with every available space jammed with equipment including lead shot which could be jettisoned to accommodate new equipment so as not to alter the subs buoyancy the corpsman knew that by any landlubbers reckoning the sub was still a long steel coffin and every man aboard knew that below her crush depth of three thousand feet the enormous pressure driving her toward the bottom at over a hundred miles an hour the sub would implode flattened like a beer can beneath a boot two thousand and closing reported sonar his voice not so steady now and hoarse the sound of the ucvs props increasing having changed from a deep rhythmic pulse to a churning noise that now seemed to be coming at them from every direction torpedoes ready asked brentwood ready sir confirmed zeldman brentwood glanced up at the fathometer they were in shallower water it made him more vulnerable to shock waves from any explosion set forward one and two for si stern five and six for si ordered brentwood quietly and distinctly his command heard clearly in both forward and aft torpedo rooms the fish being set for si or sensor impact the unknown surface vessel now so close that the trailing wires which normally ran back from the torpedoes to the sub need not be used the close proximity of the oncoming ship in effect a pointblank target for the twentyeightmile marks fifteen hundred closing came sonars voice speed increasing to twentyseven knots most likely a cruiser captain friendly or not i cant tell the choice for brentwood was clear and stark under the authority of chief of naval operations he could risk attacking any ucv if the ucv had not been identified by signature in the cruel equation of war the risk of sinking a friendly did not come near to the cost of losing a sea wolf with its capacity as platform of last resort to take out a minimum of twentyfour major soviet cities andor icbm farms from over two and a half thousand miles away yet brentwood knew that even if the ship wasnt using a chopperdangled sonar mike because of the vicinity of its mother ships noise if he fired the ucvs onboard sonar would instantly have his precise position he could then expect to be dumped on by a cluster of screamers as the us sailors called the soviet rburaketnaya bombometnaya ustanovkaantisubmarine rockets fired in paired sequence from twelvebarrel horseshoeconfiguration launchers the fivefootlong fortytwopound warheads would rip the roosevelt apart the later models being fitted by the soviets with world war iitype stuka divebomb whistles were given the name screamers and their noise traveling much faster underwater than in air struck deep into the collective psyche of all nato submariners thirteen hundred yards and closing the signature computer was still running maddeningly indecisive flashing orange bars across its green screen indicating possible enemy matchups with a plus or minus ten percent error in noise signatures but only if the orange stripes went to kitkats solid brown stripes would it mean an enemy vessel for sure light blue bars representing possible friendlies solid blue for confirmed one thousand and closing still stripe orange zeldman said nothing jaw clenched his reflection staring back at him in the computers screen guessing that if brentwood had decided to risk the roosevelts silence he would have fired already instead it seemed he was gambling that the surface vessel a cruiser by the multiple echoes coming in via roosevelts towed sensor array was now having its active sonar blanketed in the shallower water by the thrashing of its own props if so the cruiser might pass over them waiting for a clearer echo but on the yumashev captain stasky could still pick up enough echo from the submarines bulk if it was the american sub from holy loch he knew that the whooshing sound of one of its milerange tomahawk missiles capable of being fired from the torpedo tube eighty feet beneath the surface would alert not only the yumashev but every soviet hunterkiller south of the greenlandicelandnorway gap also knowing the primary mission of the sea wolfs was to wait to keep the united states last weapons platform intact should the soviet icbms be unleashed and that roosevelts captain was engaged to be married stasky believed that it was all the more likely that the american somewhere beneath the yumashev had deliberately held his fire the american might also be confused by the new refit baffles welded on the yumashev at the tallinn yards whatever the reason the fact was that the american had held his fire and stasky believed that despite the chrezmerny zvuk machiny override clutterthe yumashev was getting from its own sonar echoes in the shallower water the sub that his cruiser had picked up earlier must be in the near vicinity gotontes vesti ogon gruppoy rbu roll drums fire rbu all clusters drums rolling confirmed the first mate who then flipped up the perspex protector pushing the fire button for both twelvebarrel rocket launchers on either side of the stern helicopter hangar and the other two twelvebarrel launchers in the focsle from the starboard wing the cruisers third mate and a midshipman collars buffeted by the cold wind watched the oildrumsized depth charges plopping unceremoniously over the stern quickly disappearing in the ships boiling wake the scream of the first salvo of antisub rockets filling the air along with the thudding noise from gray bunches of malletshaped depth charges fired high in a scatter pattern leaping into the air like grotesque quail the officer of the deck already having started the clock was counting one two three the drums timed to go off at greater depths than the rbus stasky saw the first blip on the screen the sonar alarm dipping frantically like a smoke detector torpeda v nashem napravlenii napravo homing torpedoes hard right the yumashev heeled to starboard discharging a cascade of khlam chaff aluminum strips and wafers designed to addle american torpedo sensors as the rbu rockets were influencefused for magnetic signature the yumashevs skipper knew the chaff might prematurely trigger them but the oldfashioned drum charges set only for depth might still do the trick though with the americans titaniumreinforced hull a drum charge would have to strike the hull itself to implode the sub dive two thousand ordered brentwood it meant approaching crush point but the stern planesman to his left didnt hesitate and there was the surge of water pouring into the tanks during the hard steepangled dive brentwood braced himself against the girth rail that ran around the raised periscope island as to his right the bow planesman watched depth gauge and trim as the roosevelt already having fired four mks sank like a stone nose first six seven eight seconds and aboard the yumashev stasky knew something had gone wrong the sea astern off his port quarter should be erupting in towering greenishwhite mushrooms streaked with black oil from the subs raptured hydraulic systems instead the yumashevs captain looked out on a sea that was exploding only here and there he estimated that less titan twenty percent of the rbus and depth charges were detonating bozhe moy mendevmy god mendev he said turning to his first mate chto zhe tut takogo whats wrong on roosevelt the depth gauges needle was passing the twothousandfeet mark and quivering there was a hiss then a jet of water thinner than a needle coming in at over a thousand psi it created a stinging aerosol a car wash mist in the control room temporarily blinding the planesman and the chief petty officer watching the ballast tank monitors in six seconds the roosevelt had reached twentyone hundred feet there was a dull thump then another the sound punching brentwood so hard in the stomach he could tell the depth charge was even closer than the sound indicated the sub leveled out at twentythree fifty its pressure hull starting to groan three minutes passed and nothing then another explosion so close that it threw him back against the periscope rail the roosevelt shuddering so violently it blurred the redeyed squares of the monitors more jets of water shooting into the control room creating an even denser aerosol up angle shouted zeldman in the forward torpedo room rivets began popping one ricocheting about the titanium casing until it lodged in a crewmans brain splattering the pinkishgray mass over the bulkhead another smashing a perspex fire button protector sending off a torpedo the torpedo was not yet armed but its impact inside the tube was like that of a bullet in a closed barrel its flameburst concussing several crewmen in the torpedo room the fire in the tube quickly died through lack of oxygen but not before the meticulously tooled lining of the tube had been badly scoured the first torpedo that roosevelt had fired from the forward section and the two fired from the stern had gone haywire heading into the fallen chaff but these torpedoes premature explosion sent shrapnel whistling high into the air inadvertently clearing a path for the lone sternfired mark that was still running it glanced the yumashevs starboard bow beneath the waterline not enough to sink her but the shock wave of methane and carbon dioxide from the explosive gases was enough to buckle the cruisers outer plating imploding it with an elliptical gash twelve feet long and three feet wide the russians were quick to the pumps however and with watertight compartments sealed the cruiser was able to limp away at five knots her two twin goblet antiaircraft missiles which could also be used in an antiship role intact as well as her kamov overthehorizon missiletargeting helicopter the kamov was already airborne its contrarotating rotors catching afternoon sunlight its bugeyed face remarkably like that of a blowfly hovering off the ships port quarter its chinmounted bulgeb surfacesearch radar already scanning the horizon for any nato ships that might be diverted to the area by the british commander of the western approaches the helicopters radar and its height allowed it to pick up hostile targets well beyond the seventynauticalmile limit of the yumashevs head netc air search radar the allied ships the yumashev expected didnt materialize most of them within steaming distance committed to the vital convoy duty farther south where the gulf stream curves into the north atlantic drift but allied aircraft did come the russian sub chaser detected by another sub chaser a dassaultbreguet atlantic patrol aircraft which too slow low on fuel and not equipped to attack the seventhousandton cruiser relayed the information to st mawgan the usaf communication center in cornwall within five minutes south of st mawgan in the lush and windswept countryside the orange jet of flame from a sepecat jaguar could be seen as the aircraft taxied out of its hardened splashedgreens camouflaged shelter onto a short stretch of highway the blacktop marked off by detour signs the planes high wing would enable it to take off from half the tarmac length usually used in its close support and reconnaissance role normally a lightstrike aircraft kept for coastal defenses and photographic overflights of the battlefields across the channel the francobritish jet had been scrambled because raf fighter squadrons were in the process of intercepting large incoming soviet formations over the north sea the jaguar its dark greengray shape fleetingly veiled in fog began its short run the two eightthousandpound adour turbofans on afterburner thrust into the mottled sky over englands lands end taking it to mach in less than a minute the pilot roger fernshaw kept the plane low where its small wing and flybywire touch controls enabled the jaguar to skim over the ruffled cobaltcolored sea without emitting telltale radar signals its fin digital inertial navigation and weapon aiming system going through its paces fernshaw checking his hud or headup display and the ferranti laser range and markedtarget seeker the late sun glinted momentarily off the metallic sea as fernshaw punched in the coordinates for the yumashevs last reported position as relayed via st mawgan by the dassaultbreguet patrol aircraft he saw a fleeting shadow below him began evasive action then realized it was the shadow of the external fuel pod needed to give the jaguar an extended range of twentyone hundred miles as it streaked west souwest armed on all five hard points including two fifteenhundredpound exocet missiles inside the roosevelt everything was shaking violently as if in an earthquake both the deep rumble and highpitched screeching of her bent prop reverberating throughout suddenly the sub jerked hard right sending brentwood and zeldman crashing into the scope island brentwood striking his head on the girth rail a crewman grabbed for one of his sneakers floating in the ankledeep pool now sloshing between the control rooms sill and the forward electronics room what the hell brentwood began but now the noise had suddenly decreased the chief engineer apparently having dropped the subs speed to five knots on his own initiative as the sub leveled out fifty feet above her crush depth yet brentwood knew that despite the reduction in the noise level and the fact that most of the leaks had been sealed his sub was in serious trouble the noise was still a problem a giveaway to an enemy sub anywhere within fifty miles or so and now a bank of square red eyes circuit monitors grew bright the control rooms light dimming with the drop in current in the gloomy light the sound of the sloshing water created an ominous overtone amid the crunching noise of the props warp and above the rhythmic pulse of the pumps he gave the order to reduce speed still further but the vibration unexpectedly grew worse and for a second all monitors faded fucking great someone said hold your tongue snapped brentwood mr zeldman sir shut down the prop yes sir for a moment all was quiet the sub in neutral buoyancy no longer diving or rising then they could hear a choking gurgling noise the only sound above the rapid purr of the pumps that were sucking up the water transferring it to number one ballast tank brentwood ordered the other tank vented to keep the sub in neutral trim and listened to the damage reports coming in someone had thrown up and the stench was overpowering telling brentwood that the airconditioning was out of action in an effort to get the crews full attention back on their job he chewed out a forward torpedo room bosun for not responding earlier but was chagrined to discover the bosun had already done so that what he was now receiving was a followup report you were out for a bit sir explained zeldman brentwood apologized to the bosun over the intercom then turned to zeldman wheres the russian three miles off sir and limping looked like we banged him up pretty damn it give me a bearing yes sir zero three seven sir very well he called the reactor room you all right back there chief yes sir stern room asked brentwood man missing sir who were not sure captain we had a rover working the watch overlap well find out yes sir probably in the can said zeldman risking a note of levity after the tension of the russian attack the sonar operator gave a forced laugh brentwood saw the square red eyes of the circuit monitors lighting up full power restored he shook his head it was an infuriating dilemma enough to elicit a record three damns from him in as many seconds here was the pride of the us navy americas vessel of last resort with power to burn its reactordriven steam turbines back to generating enough power to light a city of over a hundred thousand but to what effect with a damaged prop the sub even if it used its auxiliary diesel hookup or failing that the bring it home capability of the smaller dolphin dickthe emergency screw slotted in the stern ballast could only make a maximum of three to five knots it meant that for combat purposes selfdefense included the roosevelt was virtually dead in the water a sick whale in a sea full of sharks on top of this zeldman informed him that the hydraulic line for the sails starboard diving plane was losing pressure a possible perforation it couldnt be repaired theyd have to go to manual override a slow business at the best of times another report came in from the forward torpedo room using a chain pulley to recradle one of the threeandahalfthousandpound mark torpedoes which had shaken loose in the pitch darkness that had followed the final salvo of rbu rockets the torpedo crew found the missing seaman an electricians mate they were unable to identify him for five minutes or so his dog tags embedded in the bloody mash that had been his head brentwood issued orders for the emergency prop to be extended from its ballast sheath and engaged its fanlike whir was quiet enough picked up by the subs implant hull mikes the tactas or towed array mikes having been knocked out by two of the russian drum charges brentwood tapped on the navcomp keys the computer screens warm amber readout informing him that at its maximum speed of five knots it would take roosevelt twelve days at least through enemysubinfested waters to reach lands end at the southwestern tip of england if they turned about and headed south against the stream to newfoundland it would take them much longer either way they would be in constant danger of being discovered through the noise of the emergency prop if this happened the roosevelt would have only five knots against a hunterkillers forty brentwood ordered the emergency prop resheathed they would wait for the next scheduled rendezvous with the tacamo take charge and move out aircraft due in seventythree hours time he would take her up out of the sea noise give a signal requesting emergency assistance then go down and wait rather than move and risk noise shortsany noise from inside the sub that could resonate loudly enough from the hull to give away its presence but robert brentwood knew that the waiting was by far the hardest thing for a submariner to do dont sweat it the quartermaster told one of the fire control technicians in the forward compartment with the freshwater converter and our freezers weve got enough food and fresh water down here to last us a year hell we convert so much fresh water we have to dump half of it it was meant to be a reassuring thought until an electricians mate pointed out that by now the noise of their engagement with the cruiser must have been picked up by both sides oceanbottom arrays scattered at various points throughout the north atlantic further reducing their chance for a pickup tow by a fast navy tug to one of the big sub tenderfloating docks was the gale warning from the last tacamo contact on top of that there was the problem of whether the tacamo aircraft would arrive on schedule if at all given the increasing russian air cover of soviet hunterkiller packs which had broken out south of the greenlandiceland gap and the icelandfaroes gap brentwood knew the only other choice he had was to take the sub to the surface just minutes before the next scheduled tacamo contact and risk popup popdownputting up the vertical vhf very high frequency aerial with which roosevelt could send a highintensity burst message more quickly than from the slower fishline trailing vlf aerial he would expose the hf aerial for no more than thirty seconds then retract and submerge even so the danger was that any penetration of the seas surface could be picked up by soviet satellite not so much by the protrusion of the aerial itself but rather from discoloration or ruffle caused by the warm water envelope around the sub entering the surface temperature zone nothing could be done to prevent this warm envelope the result of pumps having to continually cool the coffeepot or nuclear reactor from rising to the surface with the sub brentwood knew that a soviet satellite spotting the td or temperate differential patch would give the soviet hunterkillers the roosevelts exact position rather than that reported by the russian surface vessel that had attacked him he could keep the roosevelt deep to eliminate the thermal patching but this would make him unable to use the vhf to ask for help any way he moved it was risky in the meantime he decided to take her up halfway toward vlf depth where any thermal patching would not be as recognizable via satellite and could be interpreted as local upwelling from one of the millions of oceanic springs venting from the sea floor in the quiet reddedout control room the bulkhead was now beaded in flamingocolored droplets of condensation he called for the chief electricians mate in charge of the stern torpedo room and also for the next shifts sonar operator chief i want you to get a moss here brentwood showed him the drawing of the mobile submarine simulator here ive drawn a sketch of what i want you sir it was the hospital corpsman looking worried were going to have to deal with evans for a second brentwood thought evans must be alive after all awakening from a deep coma that theyd mistaken for death lord knows it had happened before in the old days navy regulations held that before placing a body in a canvas shroud a stitch of catgut had to be made passing the needle through the skin fold between the nose and lips one of the most sensitive areas to make sure the man was really dead dealing with evanss corpse was the last thing brentwood wanted to think about but he knew the corpsman was correct modernday regulations made it mandatory that a body which may be harboring infectious disease must be frozen as soon as possible and while in this condition must be dispatched no matter what the state of sea very well brentwood answered ten minutes flag party astern but he wanted no part of it all he knew for certain was that evans had died shortly after hed given him the shot of diazepam worst of all quietening him had done no good the russian ship having zeroed in on the roosevelt anyway evanss death had achieved nothing but cast a pall of pessimism about the boat roosevelt was the worlds most modern vessel but a death aboard was as bad an omen to its crew as it had been for the sailors of vasco de gama and columbus for many aboard the sub who did not have the religious faith of their seagoing forebears it was worse not a warning but a prophecy for brentwood evanss death wasnt the first hed witnessed at sea but it was the first in his command the first he was directly responsible for during the russians attack hed forgotten about it but now it returned with the corpsman and he felt it start to gnaw at him like an old childhood shame a terrible thing said to ones parents an act of deliberate cruelty to a family pet like something one conceals for years now rising up from a hidden deep it was not evanss death alone that began eating away at robert brentwood but the sudden and totally unexpected loss of control hed seen in the man the putrid stench of the seamans body the unmistakable sign of a body having lost all selfcontrol brentwood was determined he would put it out of his mind but as with so many things hidden under great pressure the childhood fear of losing control wormed its way back to consciousness brentwood kept talking about the moss to dwell on death his father had told him was a surefire way to selfpity and then you didnt belong on a sub you belonged on a couch couches said the admiral were places for people to escape from facing things headon the way some men went to sea to get away from their wives for a second robert brentwood thought of his brother ray captain of a guided missile frigate who had been horribly burned after a swarm of north korean missile boats had attacked his ship the uss blaine off south korea ray it was said by some had lost control giving the order to abandon ship when it was still salvageable others said he hadnt given any such order that one of the ships mates had mistaken a hand signal from ray in the inferno that engulfed the blaines bridge movements after impact whatever had happened ray no longer had a command and only now three months and eight operations later did the tightly polished skin grafted from thigh and buttocks even begin to make his face look anywhere near human as the chief electricians mate and the next watchs sonar operator turned and walked away with his sketch robert brentwood got tough with himself he didnt agree with his father about a lot of things including his view of psychiatrists but he knew his father was right about the captain of a ship he robert jackson brentwood was supposed to be one of the navys best and brightest commander of the most powerful warship in history and his countrys last line of defense if he couldnt handle it he should hand it over to zeldman right now it was time to bury evans excuse me he said briskly as he passed the electricians mate and the sonar operator who were also headed for the stern section with the sketch of the moss without turning to them brentwood ordered dont wait until we finish with evans get started on that right away be a bit crowded sir i know but it cant be helped theyre still mopping up the forward torpedo room i want it done in ten hours well before the next scheduled tacamo station the mate frowned the red glow accentuating his baldness as his hand swept from eyebrows to the back of his head sir i dont know if we i mean well have to use a torch and ten hours said brentwood sonar turned to the mate hes a hard bastard doesnt give a shit about evans yeah well said the chief nothing we can do for evans now is there the skipper neednt have given him that shot old mans call sonar thats what i mean come on said the chief cant do the fucker by ourselves for a moment sonar thought the chief meant evans when they got to the machine shop and showed him the sketch the machinist shook his head pointing at the skippers arrowed instructions with an oil rag no way chiefie not in ten hours why asked the chief surprising sonar that shank said the machinist is titaniumreinforced isnt a fucking wiener whats the matter i thought you were mr fucking cando said the mate cando a big gangly man from west virginia fixed sonar in his stare what do you think sonar made a face bordering on neutrality one of the ros came over asking where the captain was aft torpedo room i guess answered the virginian the ro who came from utah and had only been aboard for one other patrol was already known as mr clean because of his pink babyface complexion despite him being in his early forties he didnt like candos tone and bawled out the virginian for wearing booties the yellow rubber shoe covers worn by men as they entered the reactor room so as to prevent transporting any radioactive dust throughout the sub take those back to the reactor room said the ro sorry sir i forgot said cando giving the ro an up yours sign as the officer walked out into the ruby sheen of the passageway crack in the coffeepot said cando reaching down for the yellow booties thats why hes so goddamned testy bullshit said the electricians mate if the reactor had a fissure in it wed have a bright patch on our chest sonar craned his neck looking down for any color change in his dosimeter i dont mean the outer casing continued cando the inner wall christ its the strongest thing on the boat said the mate you telling me its impossible asked cando unfucking likely said the mate anyway keep it to yourself youll frighten young sonar here sonar was keeping right out of it giving all his attention to the skippers diagram knowing hed have to test it when cando was finished if he was finished in time as it turned out the virginian was wrong there wasnt a fissure in the reactor the officer was upset because hed just heard evans was about to be deepsixed the ro was a mustang a man whod come up through the ranks and he identified more than most officers with the enlisted men he was also a practicing mormon and though he hadnt known evans personally he offered to help the burial party shroud has to be weighted heavily at this depth brentwood told him dont want anything floating topside giving us away those russians probably got a new noise signature from us after those depth charges no good helping them to pinpoint our ill look after it sir said the ro very well the officer thought brentwood could have shown a little more sensitivity about evans rather than simply treating the corpse as a nuisance to get rid of it didnt jibe with what hed heard about the skipper who among roosevelts crew was affectionately known as bing something to do with bing crosby was it maybe the skipper sang in the shower or something but apparently the nickname had nothing to do with his love of oldfashioned music bing deriving more from his oldfashioned nature rumor had it that knowledgeable as he was about the world of the submarine he was despite his engagement to some englishwoman extraordinarily naive when it came to the opposite sex mr clean had never discovered precisely why the crew was convinced of this other than it had something to do with what the english called a trollop a woman of easy virtue approaching him at some party in scotland and brentwood ever so polite trying to gracefully decline her advances whereupon the woman started screaming at him calling him a straitlaced old bastarda bing crosby had the revered crooner from the s held rigid views about premarital sex anyway the ro didnt care whether the skipper was considered unpracticed in matters of sex maybe in a world of aids he was merely being careful all the ro wanted to know was how good a sub captain the fortythreeyearold skipper was maybe his apparent lack of sensitivity as far as evans was concerned might in fact be his preoccupation with the array of hard choices that confronted him if roosevelt was to have any hope of survival he saw the hospital corpsman walking down the passageway with what looked like two plastic garbage bags except for the glistening of the zippers on the body bags two of the men wounded in the depth charge attack had died aboard the yumashev captain stasky was breaking radio silence he knew that slowed down as he was and with his general position probably known because of the explosions of the few depth charges that had worked there wasnt much chance of the enemy not knowing where he was but even if this were not so stasky knew it was his duty regardless of his own safety and that of his crew to inform northern fleet headquarters immediately that more than half the depth charges hed dropped had been duds it was not merely for the sake of the safety of the other ships in the baltic mediterranean and pacific fleets however that stasky ordered the coded message be sent without delay but because of his own status as commander of a cruiser bearing the coveted whitebacked red star with four black circles the highest antisubmarine warfare efficiency rating awarded by the fleet commander his own career was at stake aboard the uss roosevelt six men crammed in around the torpedoes their caps off as robert brentwood began the service the mens faces showing the strain of the yumashevs depth attack on them lines of tension etched deeply in their faces in the red battle light several of the men gripping their blue baseballstyle caps only the reactor room officer appeared calm a serenity about him that brentwood found more disconcerting man helpful especially when as captain he was trying to present the coolest demeanor he could while reciting the ageold prayer for those killed at sea at such moments brentwood though he was the one speaking often felt outside himself more an observer he thought than a participant in the proceedings as he closed the prayer book brentwood nodded to the torpedomans mate the mate palmed the clearing control for tubes seven and eight there was a dull thud a gush of water like a toilet flushing then a hiss of compressed air as the shrouds were shot out the mate immediately venting the tubes readying them to receive mark torpedoes there were tears in brentwoods eyes he turned away and cleared his throat then turned to the small clump of men before he left for the eightytwoyard walk back to control thank you for being here there was an awkward murmured response one of the men a yeoman watching intently as brentwood stepped over the sill of the watertight door past the reactor room heading into sherwood forest where the six trident c missiles stood their silos dwarfing their human controllers thanks for being here said the yeoman where the hell else would we be on coney island he glanced across at a young quartermaster to get his reaction the quartermaster gave a noncommittal shrug he was enjoying the show he meant thanks for coming you asshole chimed in an offduty planesman i fucking know that said the yeoman then what are you bitching about the yeoman didnt know specifically only that brentwoods tears disturbed him perhaps brentwood reminded him too much of his old man a typewriter salesman whod always cut an imposing figure most of the time a nononsense strong type a heap of quiet selfconfidence before computers too old to change and sometimes hed start thanking you for doing the simplest thing when it was your job got all weepy and scared the hell out of you whole world seemed it would come apart and just swallow you up it meant he was against the ropes about something couldnt handle it himself anymore little things are important the yeoman answered the planesman obliquely with his old man it hadnt been anything spectacular at first nothing youd really notice just a few drinks to begin with then a few pills to calm my nerves then he couldnt get up mornings pretty soon he was incapable of making any important decision see your mom became the cry the yeoman told the planesman the scuttlebutt from the hospital corpsman was that captain bing had been white as a toilet hand shaking as hed given evans the shot what the yeoman didnt tell the planesman was that his rather had been scared shitless of needles too and so was he thats what was wrong pretty soon his old man had started freaking him out too the planesman dismissed the scuttlebutt aw shit corpsmen always like to make things bigger than they are makes em feel important hell i know plenty of guys who dont like getting shots go weak at the knees so what what do you want joe montana fucking right said the yeoman then buddy put in a torpedoman youre on the wrong friggin boat thats what im thinkin well what are you planning to do about it the planesman said swim nothing you can do is there replied the yeoman for christs sake youre making a big thing out of squat all listen man its the little things that count right isnt that how they weed everyone out at the school guy panics for a second in the dive tank and hes out balls said the torpedoman dont know anyone who liked being in the tank yeah but you didnt show it right pressed the yeoman hey said the torpedoman id rather the guy running this boat show a little compassion than have some hardass quigg whos quigg asked the yeoman the torpedoman looked across at the planesman disbelievingly he doesnt know who quigg was so said the yeoman you gonna tell me you dont have to worry cut in the planesman bingll get us out of this hell get us home yeah added the torpedoman well be in faslane before you know it faslane was the village for holy loch at five knots said the yeoman itll take a fucking year not to worry yeo weve got enough food to fuck you told us that before were crawlin along like some fucking turtle and youre worried about goddamned chow you cant eat yourself out of a huk pack their goddamned alfas are faster than we are the planesman slapped on his submariners cap and without another word left the torpedo room making his way forward the torpedoman following time he had furlough said the planesman halfjokingly hes more goddamned worried than the old man not surprised said a voice behind them the planesman saw it was a twostriper the young quartermaster whod been draped against the torpedo his neat dark beard matching the dark shortsleeved uniform that distinguished him from the rest of the roosevelts crew hed been so quiet theyd almost forgotten he was there what do you mean the torpedoman asked he had a girl in glasgow explained the quartermaster killed in one of the rocket attacks better keep an eye on him then said the planesman who said the quartermaster me you seem to know all about him hell i hardly know him it was one of the problems on the big pigboats on any large vessel even though the seventyday assignments meant they were together on the sub for forty days straight with twentyfive days tied up alongside holy loch some of the ships company working eight hours on twelve off never met often all there was to know about a man apart from his technical qualification was whatever the scuttlebutt happened to pass on and that was notoriously unreliable hell said the quartermaster i dont even know myself the other two laughed they thought it was a joke come on said the torpedoman ive got to report to the chief up in the machine room bings got him working on some special rig what kind of rig inquired the planesman i dont know all i do know is the old man wants it ready before the next tacamo rendezvous therell be no rendezvous said the planesman any of our eas come this way the russiansll blow em out of the sky i think maybe the old man knows that said the quartermaster then how we going to confirm our position argued the planesman either way well have to go up with an aerial if the tacamo comes we can use the floater proffered the quartermaster he meant the floating lowfrequency wire still have to go up a ways said the planesman takes too friggin long for data transmission russkiesll be waiting for that we need a burst message a lot of data quickly tell us where the fuck we are and whats going on up there for my money that means sticking our uhf out of the water thats no friggin good said the torpedoman they could spot that on satcon our warm waved be too close to the surface anyway theyd pick us up on the satellites infrared satellite cant cover the whole ocean said the quartermaster they dont have to with us doin three and a half knots put in the planesman shit said the quartermaster i thought that yeo was a rain face ah said the torpedoman what the hell were probably worrying about nothinright no one answered walking into his cabin robert brentwood drew the green curtains shut tossed his cap onto its hook and stood for a minute studying the map of the north atlantic taped to the bulkhead above the safe three things worried him first the navigation computer was malfunctioning as a result of the last depth charge so that unless he had a clear sky for a star fix it was imperative the tacamo aircraft make its rendezvous to give them their exact position even as the sub rose via slow and quiet release of ballast feeling its way toward the surface to wait for the tacamo it was already drifting off position second once roosevelt began to move under power of the switchblade prop now sheathed in the forward ballast tank the resistance caused by the towed array normally of no consequence when the sub was at full speed would decrease its five knots to three he was bothered too by a seemingly unimportant incident the fact that the hospital corpsman had interrupted him about evans when he was giving his instructions about the moss to the electronics mate and sonar operator it wasnt the corpsmans cutting into the conversation that bothered robert brentwood but the anxiety behind it that could spread faster than the flu that had killed evans or had it and could the orders he had given the mate and sonar be carried out before the scheduled tacamo rendezvous he depressed the intercom button for control and told zeldman to wake him two hours before the eta of the tacamo aircraft will do came zeldmans breezy reply before he lay down on the bunk brentwood took off his rubber sneakers the reason for them no noise shorts bringing back evanss terrified face he tried to think of something else but it wasnt easy civilians he mused always thought you got used to seeing death maybe you did on the battlefield maybe his youngest david who had fought in korea shortly after the beginning of the war was used to it and ray well no one could hope to know what ray thought anymore the photos of david and ray were on his desk in the antiroll gimbals mounting as were those of his mom and dad and lana lana was really the loner in the family but he felt closer to her than any of them maybe it was because she was the second oldest of the four what had happened to her since the spate shed gotten into in halifax what had happened to all of them it would be months before he would know if he ever did his ship crippled somewhere west of the midatlantic ridge and soviet hunterkillers breaking out through the greenlandicelandnorway gap if he was a betting man he thought he would sit this one out but fate had thrown the dice and he had no choice he lay back and pulled out rosemarys picture from his shirt pocket he had had it laminated with plastic in london it was crazy he knew but if he went down forever if he was to die in the rooseveltthe thought of her photo eaten away by the salt devoured by some shark or other bloodcrazed denizen bothered him if anyone else saw it they would just assume hed laminated it for normal wear and tear true too he kissed her popped the photo in his pocket and reached up for his walkman earphones they were cold and he held them in his hands to warm them a dank sour smell assailed his nostrils he sat up peeled off a sock and sniffedholytook the other one off and balling them prepared to pop them in the laundry hamper at the foot of the bunk the first one was a perfect basket the next shot was to be the winning goal in sudden death overtime seattle and the celtics eightyfour apiece it missed an omen dont be damn silly he told himself and plugged in the earphones rewinding the tape he heard the high screechlike a torpedo closing he stopped it pushed play and lay back there were a lot of ifs hanging about but one certainty hed been taught at annapolis was that when youre the commanding officer there is no possibility of assist you had to be alert and that meant you had to get sleep remember montgomery one of his instructors had been fond of saying delegate authority until youre needed you simply had to wait he closed his eyes and listened to the timbre of johnny cash and sunday morning coming down problem was would they finish the moss in time for the tacamo rendezvous he was wide awake chapter five as a squally rain swept down from the north sea over surrey and oxshott heath richard spence in search of rosemary pulled up the collar of his mackintosh and berating himself for not having brought an umbrella made his way uneasily along the sodden slippery path having to stop every fifty yards or so to wipe the condensation from his bifocals in the fading light the shapes of the trees in the distance momentarily took on the shape of people of what he wanted to see rather than what was there yet despite the foul weather the pelting of the rain and the wind roaring through the big oaks spence found the ferocity of the storm strangely comforting compared to the quieter but tensionfilled atmosphere of his house the often brisling animosity between rosemary and georgina and the silent but painfilled determination of his wife trying her best to cope with the death of their son the vicissitudes of nature seemed to him if not more manageable then the least of his worries he felt bad for feeling like this realizing that for the men at sea like rosemarys robert and those on natos lifeblood convoys en route from canada and the united states the arcticbred storms would be met with less equanimity but at least nature didnt come with a net of complexes woven about it its moods were direct and unequivocal with his daughters who knew georginas smile could mean the very opposite of her intent rosemarys bad temper with georgina the very antithesis of her normal disposition he saw a figure on the path about a hundred yards away coming toward him but whether or not it was rosemary he couldnt be sure from the walk it seemed to be a woman all right but she was wearing a scarf about her head the wind taking the cloth to a sharp point like one of the sleek bicycle race helmets that had been so popular following the tour de france in july the tour de france he wondered if he or the world would ever see one again whoever it was had her head bent down against the rain facial features hidden by the collar of a dark coat dark brown like rosemarys or black he couldnt tell through the smear of the rain on his bifocals the sweeping curtains of rain increasing in their intensity he heard a dog barking somewhere nearby but how close it was whether it was anywhere near the figure he couldnt tell his hearing these days not what it used to be the main reason they had rejected him even for the armys administrative reserve relegating him instead to the home guard auxiliary not even the proper home guard he thought wryly in a way it was worse than being rejected outright a kind of waiting list of old crocks yet inside he felt the same as when he was fifty and at times stood staring at the mirror in the morning finding it difficult except for the few streaks of gray in his hair to believe he was in his late sixties that the reflection looking back was him sometimes he felt like two different people it was rosemary approaching hands thrust deep in her brown jacket pocket scarf whipping hard in the wind like the defiant flag of a surrounded army reminding richard of the trapped british army of the rhine which with the americans ninth corps was still reeling trying to catch its breath in the dortmundbielefeld pocket daddy what are you that boy williams he said his face scrunching under the impact of freezing rain wilkins she said hes tried to kill himself her head shot up rainstreaked cheeks making it impossible to see whether shed been crying after the row back at the house but she began and stopped realizing it must have something to do with her or did it perhaps the school had wanted to notify her because she was the boys teacher rose now richard spence faltered throat constricting the sound of his voice swallowed by the frenzied sound of the wind in the big dark oaks instead of finishing what he had intended to say he put his hand on his daughters arm turned her toward home and began anew his voice rising through the howl of the storm he left some kind of note apparently the headmaster said the boy wants to have a word with you richard stumbled and had to stop again to wipe his glasses i didnt get any more details he lied we were rather flustered im afraid and mother was worried about you being out in this why on earth would he began rosemary but her words either trailed off or were inaudible to her father as they passed through a new onslaught of rain she was already beginning to feel responsible for wilkins just as her father knew she would i think said richard his eyes fixed on a branch bending dangerously cmon he shouted indicating the branch thats near breaking point as they passed through the thick copse of alder before crossing the road rosemary felt his grip tighten on her arm i think the headmaster would like a chat she pulled her coat higher against the storms rage the winds rushing now like an angry sea and for a moment she was assailed by fear for robert and the realization that the real reason behind her row with georgina was her growing conviction that she was pregnant suddenly she felt guilty about everything about what she now judged to be her unwarranted retorts to georgina she should have dealt with it with grace she felt guilty about giving wilkins a saturday morning and for what she knew was an unreasonable anger toward the boy wishing for a dark second that he had finished the job her shakespeare class would be much easier to teach as they emerged from the wooded area onto the grassy knoll she was thinking how shakespeare wasnt necessarily a civilizing influence what he did was to tear the wrappings of civility aside you must understand richard was saying the boy was i should say is she didnt get the rest of it and had to ask him to repeat it clearly said spence the boys very disturbed and i dont want you blaming yourself oh my god thought rosemary it is something to do with me he must have written something in the suicide note saying shed driven him to it she didnt feel she could face georgina when they reached the house she saw georgina at the window as they started up the crazy stone path richard saw her too as she left the window to open the front door now richard cautioned rosemary dont you two start for goodness sake georgina was the picture of sisterly concern it was genuine which made rosemary feel worse if she was pregnant the thought of telling her parents mortified her besides with a world at war she wasnt sure anyone should have a child but then she didnt see how she could ever bring herself to rose it was her mother holding one hand over the phone looking frightened from the kitchen a mrs wilkins wants to talk with you she sounds terribly upset oh lord said georgina sympathetically tell her shes not here mother well i am here arent i snapped rosemary instantly regretting her riposte and then something else flew into her consciousness like a bat suddenly exploding out of a deep dark cave in a storm it was the realization that georginas beauty would unquestionably overwhelm robert americans she knew were obsessed about large breasts and georgina was far better endowed than she like a jersey cow hello she said unknotting the head scarf as she took the phone mrs wilkins georgina saw her sister pale chapter six in leningrads immaculate and creamcolored nakhimov secondary naval academy whence he could smell the cold freshness of the harbor and see the historic cruiser aurora tied up nearby admiral brodsky watched the ruffles of wind racing over the surface of the neva river a burst of sunlight changing it from slate gray to prussian blue as chief liaison officer between the northern fleet based in severomorsk just north of murmansk on the kola peninsula and the baltic fleet brodsky seized any opportunity to visit the city its czarist beauty so stunning that he had long ago decided that upon his retirement in another three years he and his wife would move here when the soviet forces were victorious sitting by the secondstory window facing the neva brodsky had taken a break from signing the latest authorizations for meritearned transfer for ablebodied soldiers and sailors who after distinguishing themselves at the front had been recommended for entry into the elite fleet air arm one such applicant was sergei marchenko a tank battalion commander whose leadership in the surprise and massive soviet breakthrough at the fulda gap on natos central front had earned him high marks as did his later performance when the river of soviet ts as the western press had called it split into two one stream heading south toward munich to link up with the armored spearheads rumbling west from czechoslovakia along the fertile danube valley the other stream wheeling to the right of fulda racing toward germanys northern plain here the soviet divisions had smashed through to schleswigholstein capturing the vital nato ports of bremen hamburg and antwerp and were presently closing the pincers about the trapped british army of the rhine and elements of the us german and dutch armies to brodskys displeasure sergei marchenkos name had been submitted to brodsky by his father kiril marchenko a senior advisor to the politburo and there was no doubt that on the surface the applicant clearly deserved the chance to join the air arm but brodsky had refused there had been the problem of a slight deficiency in the vision of his left eye despite the fact that he wore corrective contact lenses which had obviously been more than adequate for duty in the tanks corps the fleet air arm demanded twentytwenty vision kiril marchenko had appealed the decision using politburo letterhead brusquely pointing out that if adolf galland nazi germanys top air ace could fly with only one eye surely the fleet air arm could accept a man with two brodsky refused now marchenkos father had written brodsky again a little more contrite saying that the operation to correct his condition was available in moscows famous vertyashcheesya kreslorevolving chairclinic recognized before the war even by the americans as one of the best in the world brodsky moved away from the window and returned to his desk he paused gold parker in hand his aide a captain entering the office impatiently but stopping abruptly when he saw the pen wavering above the authorization form kiril marchenko was a powerful main twice denied then again the captain knew the admiral was right not to sign anything without ruminating on it you could end up as latrine inspector in mongolia signing things in too much of a hurry a general or rather exgeneral whom both of them knew had lost his dacha in the forest of nikolina gora outside moscow because hed hastily signed requisitions for three large american freezers and four hundred pairs of imported british shoes for a unit that didnt exist when brodsky did sign the authorization he added a rider that as per regulations his permission for sergeis transfer to fleet air arm school was conditional upon written confirmation from the eye clinic that not only had the operation been performed but it was satisfactory brodsky wrote slowly as if the captain mused he were creating a work of art for the leningrad museum the admiral sat back admiring his work and recapping the pen no more transfer requests i hope someone has to get nato dirt in their contacts the captain smiled dutifully though he didnt get the connection nor did he care the message just decoded from the yumashev was alarming no more than percent of depth charges rbu rockets and drum charges alike had detonated during an attack on what was believed to be a us nuclear submarine what class asked brodsky sea wolf two i think admiral were not positive but timespeed calculations make it possible it is an american submarine out of holy loch brodsky pressed him on this for while the yumashev was important the location of fortyeight independently targeted reentry warheads was infinitely more pressing the aide unrolled the chart of the north atlantic weve dispatched three hunterkillers to the area he assured brodsky in two hours it can be a hundred miles away in either direction said brodsky waving his arm the weak afternoon sun reflecting off his sleeves four gold rings the yumashev thinks it inflicted damage on the sub admiral there was a dramatic change in the subs noise signature following the attack the admiral grumbled grateful for small mercies if the yumashev was correct this information would at least narrow the search area have we aerial reconnaissance on this a longrange badger with fighter cover sir the only plane available at the moment later today we might be able to request no we cant wait said the admiral putting out his hand for the yumashevs message if they think it is a sea wolf i dont want any time wasted order inflight refueling for the fighters yes sir the captain had already done this knowing he could always rescind the order if the admiral hadnt agreed brodskys heavily lined face beneath the thick black hair that belied his age became a scowl as he read the message jaw clenched where were the aide handed him a sheet of the buffcolored top secret forms listing all rbu antisubmarine warfare rockets and drum charges as a batch originating from one of the armament factories in tallinn the estonian capital brodsky was sitting back as if to get away from the information snaking his head he blamed gorbachev as so many other senior officers had glasnost and perestroika were responsible gorbachev had given the upstarts in the baltic states economic independence when any fool could have told him this would soon amount to de facto political independence and give encouragement to the baltic resistance groups especially those in estonia find them the admiral ordered handing the captain back the papers the captain was pleased estonians had always considered themselves a cut above everyone else it came from being too close to the capitalist nations which exported disorder along with their technology to the ussrs baltic states time the balts were taught a lesson how many other ships are affected asked brodsky we dont know yet admiral at least another cruiser and a squadron of destroyers out of tallinn and riga brodsky looked out at the neva now it looked as cold as he felt bystro quickly he instructed the captain we must root out this nest of jews immediately whenever there was trouble it was always nests of jews with brodsky of jewish extraction himself the admiral considered it necessary to be harder on such rebellious elements than any other russian would have been five minutes later the captain handed brodsky the order for military intelligence assist brodsky intended to keep the kgb out of the investigation if he could the gru glavnoye razvedyvatelnoye upravleniethe main intelligence directorate of the soviet general staff was more like family and would give him more control he signed the order immediately get to it at once he told the aide again this could be a disaster he paused for us as well as those other ships the captain knew he meant both of them ill see to it right away admiral and keep me posted on that sea wolf he paused it has to be destroyed within the half hour a coded for your eyes only fivegroup numberforletter transmission was being relayed to baltic fleet headquarters at baltiysk near the lithuanian port of kaliningrad which was also the headquarters for the baltic fleets intelligence unit which reported directly to the gru chapter seven it was am on the graveyard midnighttodawn shift in la jollas veterans administration medical center where two nurses on the burn ward were trying to decide whether the information phoned in from new york by capt ray brentwoods father should be communicated to his son who was on their ward the older nurse in her mid forties busy checking the medication trays was for withholding the news until later in the day after the daily assessments including that of ray brentwood had been made by the doctors on their rounds the young nurse on the other hand not long out of college argued that bad news should be communicated as soon as possible to a patient quicker they know the sooner theyll have to confront it and overcome it she said confidently but the older woman who had worked as a nurses aide long before shed become qualified as a fully trained nurse regarded the younger womans approach as typical of the collegetrained nurses they were all full of confrontation tell it like it is encounter groupsmistaking forthrightness for professionalism after many years on the job the older nurse had come to believe that sometimes you had to keep the truth at bay for a while anyhow a lie if necessary with all the daunting confidence of youth the younger nurse stood her ground sorry i still think we should tell him be upfront about everything oh said the older nurse then whyd you tell him he looked just great the other day the younger nurse thought for a moment i didnt you did honey i heard you say it you told him that the last plastic surgery was a terrific improvement i cant see any improvement at all well thats thats a subjective thing i guess exactly i still dont think you should keep something about his family from him hell probably get official notification from the pentagon that his kid brothers missing anyway not for a week or so believe me washington doesnt move that fast all right you tell me whats he going to think when he finds out we knew all along we dont have to tell him we knew cmon sue by then hell have read about it in the papers about what you know hand me that temperature chart will you about how bad things are in europe about this dortmund pocket or whatever they call it honey theres nearly a million of our boys fighting over there ray brentwood wont know where his kid brother was until the war department tells him even then theyre pretty vague about the area they usually give the country thats all the young nurse was flicking over the temperature charts entering the readings into the computer and wondered aloud what brentwoods sister would do in the circumstances honey shes back of beyond up there in the aleutians were here and were the ones making the decision regulations say you should tell them said the young nurse regulations tell you you should use your discretion best judgment thats what im doing the young nurse paused at the computer for a second did i really say that that he looked better gods my witness well i dont believe in god ill have to take your word for it she paused i guess we can hold off for a while ill tell him the other one volunteered the younger one returned to tapping the temperatures into the computer files sue is that true about his sister about when she was in canada did she really gossip no im not judging her i think she was right if thats what she did it for doesnt matter what she did it for and if you dont want to end up back of beyond like her dont you ever do it its easy i know you feel sorry for them nothing wrong with that but were professionals i thought professionals were supposed to care the other nurse said nothing the younger one pressed you do believe it then the older woman pulled over three medication trays took a tongue depressor and began counting off painkillers to put in the array of paper portion cups all i know is lana brentwood was little miss shy shoes pretty brunette the original miss america figure not too tall not too short just right like they say in the nursery rhymes then who knows she married some bigwig went to china came back and left her husband or he kicked her out tried to hide away from the front pages then decided to be florence nightingale next thing theres this rumpus over the young brit spencer spence whatever anyway she was lucky she wasnt courtmartialed the young nurse saw one of the call lights go on for a moment she thought it was ray brentwood and was much relieved when she realized it was the patient in the next bed over you sure know a lot about her wheredo you pick up all that juicy stuff sounds to me like youve got her file gossip well she was in all the papers over the marriage breakup what papers i never read anything in the papers about it the older nurse was blushing i dont know maybe the national enquirer or something look youd better hop on down and see what jensen they heard a torrent of abuse erupting from five rooms down on the west wing when she entered the room the young nurse saw ray brentwood was awake reading he looked hideous the nightlight reflecting off the tight skin stretched like pink plastic blotchy here and there with dead spots the eyes having escaped the burn appeared strange fixed and protruding like those of a fish but she realized it wasnt that anything was wrong with the eyes so much as the rest of his face especially the nose so horribly disfigured off center and pushed to one side so that the eyes looked grotesque in their normalcy she avoided their stare as she checked the frame that had been built over jensens bed jensens burns being on the lower part of his body and like brentwoods caused by the extraordinarily high temperatures from a ships aluminum superstructure while the light weight gave the modern ships more speed the aluminum alloys were unable to sustain high temperatures in the case of brentwoods ship the guided missile frigate uss blaine the whitehot superstructure collapsing under the stress tumbled into the fire of other explosions below taking men down with it into the inferno of the ships twisted entrails brentwood was making a terrible piglike snorting noise as he breathed in the young nurse pitied his wife and wondered how a woman even with the best will in the world could ever make love to a man after something like that for christs sake jensen cried gimme a shot im sorry mr jensen it isnt time jensen was sobbing and she wanted to tell him to stop it it couldnt be that bad she told herself youll be fine she told him and knew she was lying he would be lucky to survive and if he did it would be a torture he no longer had any genitals and had to be constantly catheterized brentwoods breathing was getting heavier she hated it asking herself why on earth shed become a nurse in the first place it had been a terrible mistake but then when she had been writing her finals only months before the world had been at peace and nursing a guarantee of a job now everything had changed it was another world one in which death and suffering on such a scale had been unimaginable to the young the types of wounds she was seeing in this hospital simply hadnt been covered even automobile accidents paled by comparison she remembered some professor in college assuring them that nuclear weapons had made world war obsolete she wished the fool could have been on the ward with her now hearing smelling the death that hung about the night wards giving her the creeps like some obscene voyeur whose presence though invisible was palpable in the dark corners of the room chapter eight the sharp black peaks and volcanic sores of the windswept islands that stretched in a scythelike arc for over three thousand miles between alaska and russia first appeared to the astronauts like the emerald spine of some enormous exotic sea creature there was nothing exotic about them for lana brentwood from the moment she landed at dutch harbor on the northeastern end of tomahawkshaped unalaska island she thought there must be no lonelier place on earth no wonder they called it americas siberia beneath the enormous steelgray clouds of cumulonimbus that constantly rolled in over makushin volcano toward the narrow neck of the harbor lana saw a white dot bursting out from the fibrous sky that was mixed with steam coming off the sulfurous fumaroles of mount vsevidof on umnak island to the west with unerring grace the dot swooped down over the polished black clumps of kelp that washed in from the cold bering sea immediately to the north and from the pacific to the south she pulled the string of her parka hood tight against the boneaching chill of late october and stepping to the side of the road that skirted the forlorn haven of dutch harbor fixed her binoculars on the bird it was a glaucouswinged gull two months before the woman whose beauty had once gained her offers to model in new york and delivered her to a disastrous marriage with the tall lean and eminently successful jay la roche couldnt have told the difference between a glaucouswinged gull and any other of the hundreds of species of birds but two months ago she had been a nurse quietly nursing her psyche back to health after the trauma of her having left jay he was one of the highflying conglomerate stars and chairman of the la roche pharmaceutical and cosmetic empire and his job had necessitated frequent business trips abroad at first shed been allowed to accompany him on his globetrotting hops from new york to london shanghai to paris and london to melbourne and at first she had enjoyed them but then it soon became clear to her that jay was combining business with a seemingly endless string of onenight stands lana looked back now with a mixture of incredulity and selfloathing at how hard shed tried to accommodate him as he urbanely put it to her in tones that made her feel nothing less than a country hick in the fast social world where the mores of an admirals daughter seemed quaintly even ludicrously out of place at first shed blamed herself for her na√Øvet√© for what jay repeatedly reminded her was her lack of experience and she had blamed her parents for not having prepared her it had taken her more than a year to realize that no one but a masochist could have prepared her for jay la roche for whom a menageatrois which lana would not participate in was viewed as the least kinky of sexual preferences then one night in his apartment in shanghai just after his mother whom lana liked had flown home from staying with them and the servants were on their night off she was trapped she had seen how his mothers visit had put enormous pressure on him instead of being able to spend his days and nights whoring he was always very careful to have the boys as well as the girls examined by his bevy of highly paid physicians hed been forced to show himself at home in the evenings his stable of sexual partners quarantined in the luxurious surroundings of the jinjiang hotel he told lana he wanted her she asked him why he didnt go to the jinjiang no hed replied first i want you twisting her hand till she was on her knees he told her smiling his gray eyes glistening you dont understand do you no she said i dont when she wouldnt let him urinate on her as part of his latest complex ritual he tried what he screamed at her was the slut stuff beating her so badly it had nearly killed her she vowed it would never happen again thinking that now there was more than infidelity as a reason for leaving him she was finally free that no court in the land would refuse a divorce but jays money and influence she discovered could fix that too he told her hed contest any divorce why she had cried or rather mumbled through her swollen lips sobbing you hate me i hate you no you dont he told her arrogantly no matter how much you think you hate me i was the first baby that counts for something forever she managed a contemptuous smile not normally part of her repartee the taste of blood metallic in her mouth youre not the first you lying bitch he had her by the throat screaming that hed kill her but now she didnt care it was too indescribably awful to go on who was it he demanded shaking her throwing her to the floor im not telling you she gasped was it that fucking pilot he shouted shaking her so violently her head felt like a rag dolls it was the bravest thing shed ever said to him and she believed later that the only reason he hadnt killed her was that he was making so much noise about it screaming and smashing everything in sight that one of the wealthier chinese playing at mahjongg and losing badly in one of the other penthouse suites complained to the police by the time the chinese police arrived two men in a motorcycle and sidecar jay had the minister for trade on the line and the two policeman left with a dozen cans of cocacola each eight days wages lana still had enough courage to be scornful you think you can buy off a divorce with coke with coke he said turning the pun back at her i could buy jesus christ youre sick he unzipped his fly and pouring scotch on it walked toward her listen you little daddys whore i could buy your chickenshit daddy the admiral if i wanted dont you push me i could have a dozen chinks up here in a flashall testifying youd sucked them off in tiananmen square i can buy anything in this country and dont you forget it his voice rose as he kept coming toward her waving the scotch for effect i can buy anything in any fucking country cunttree get it lana had sat cowering from him but now she merely looked away in her revulsion he was mad and she knew if she looked at him now he would kill her he pushed it into her face slapping her with it you try to divorce me pussy willow and ill drag so much shit in the papers that your mommy and daddy wont show their faces outside their little fucking house understand she didnt answer understand he bellowed and your fucking brothersll be the fucking joke from here to peoria got it she was terrified i cant hear you he taunted in a singsong voice yes she said very quietly all right you bitch now open your mouth she wouldnt you want daddy and mommy in trouble and how about you you want to end up a friggin monster like that brother of yours her gut turned she knew he was right he could buy anything it was childish to imagine anything else he had bought half of shanghai and party officials from the bund to beijing they were all in his pocket hey he grabbed her hair shaking her violently i own half the tabloids sweetheart and i can buy the rest just like that he tried to snap his fingers but failed against all caution in spite of her terror or perhaps because of it she laughed he had his hands around her throat again pushing the thumbs hard up into her as she gasped for air he jammed it into her mouth thumping her head against the wall screaming again how he could ruin her her family how he could do anything he wanted she thought of frank shirer the pilot who had taken her out in washington before shed ever met jay la roche theyd made love but it hadnt been good her first time and painful beyond belief but shirer had been kind the moment he realized he was hurting her she could see him now the pale blue eyes quick yet serene the eyes of one of the navys top guns of a man who wouldnt blink at danger shed thought but a man who was warm and loving and funny hed put on the nuclear eye patch that hed kept since his stint as one of the pilots of air force one it had frightened her at the time but now she clung to the memory of it so different it was from the horror of jay in her mouth frank shirer wherever he was was as different from jay la roches type as you could imagine suddenly la roches whole body shuddered violently smacking her head hard against the wall and then breathing laboriously satiated he stumbled back from her turning his back to the wall sliding down eyes closed i love you he said the terrible thing was she knew he meant it she ran to the bathroom and vomited early in the morning his eyes bleary from drink he staggered from the bedroom picking up a spilled bottle of scotch on the way she could tell from the way he paused to pick it up rather than kicking it out of the way as he normally would have that he was entering his magnanimous lets be reasonable phase his must as he called it now expended still halfdrunk standing unsteadily in the bathroom doorway his shirt out his reflection reeling disappearing from view in the mirror his body reeking of deodorant sweat and booze so powerful it seemed to engulf her he told her his tone of magnanimity as revolting to her as the sight of his spent body if you dont want to stay with me okay but he used the bottle as a pointer dont you ever try for a divorce youre mine no matter how much she had rinsed and washed her face she still felt dirty so you want a respectable front she said bitterly holding an ice pack to her jaw he nodded so thats what we all want isnt it a front you dont know who the hell you are lana wanted to say something about his mother of what she would think if she knew the real jay la roche but instinctively she refrained it was too dangerous he was offering a deal best to take it while she could all right she said but im going back to the states he walked slowly away from the door stopped and came back bottle of scotch still in hand lana she cringed her flesh turning cold and clammy with the sensation of something reptilian crawling over it she knew what he was going to say she could tell him not to say it but to do that would only drag the whole thing out it was easier to go along let him play it out then hed leave her alone for a few days if past performance was anything to go by enough time to pack and make the arrangements what she asked sternly love you babe it was a different man speaking but she despised the supine ingratiating tone as much as she hated the psychopath whod attacked her like an animal hear me he pressed his voice even modulated as forgiving as a father making up with a child after a bad day i hear you she said without turning around from the sink look at me babe she stared up at him lost in the mystery of how it was that she had ever been attracted to him but of course then he had been someone else he met her stare and did not avert his eyes from the burning hatred he saw in them how could she ever begin to explain to anyone about the disaster that had been her marriage she had told no one not even her friends among the nurses shed worked with in halifax before her exile to the aleutians and certainly not her parents all they knew was that things hadnt worked out certainly she had never gone into any of the sordid details with anyone and only in her letters to her older brother robert somewhere on duty in the north atlantic had she hinted at anything like the full horror of it all cant you work things out her father had asked your mother and i well weve had our tiffs now and then but you dont just get up and no she had told him they couldnt work things out and that was that there was no one at dutch harbor she could talk to no one in whom she could confide there was the padre of course but she was only a nominal churchgoer and at least for now couldnt bring herself to resurrect the things she wished exorcised she began walking back to the base at dutch harbor the lights were twinkling brightly against the cold blue twilight and beyond the cloud cover was lifting the isolation and boredom of the place would have been more bearable if the weather were not so foul so unpredictable it wasnt unusual for rain and snow driven by galeforce winds to sweep down from the arctic and then the next minute to see clouds rent by the sun her job so far had been to assist in making an inventory of medical supplies throughout the aleutian chain and had it not been for the unalaskaalaska flights the boredom would have been overpowering keeping to herself she had not made any really close friends either here or in halifax except william spence the young british sailor when turmoil had enveloped her again or had it really was her life more the consequence of her own actions than she was willing to admit was she what her father so disparagingly called one of the worlds willing victims was there something deep in her psyche that sought to purge itself by seeking out the worst as a form of punishment did she enjoy the heroic pain of the victim as an athlete takes secret pride in the pain of the effort how else could she have possibly become embroiled with the young englishman a boy really who was to die before his twentieth birthday his loneliness she had thought was there for anyone to see and surely it had only been fate that had put her on the ward aboard the hospital ship when the big chinook choppers brought young spence in hands bloody stubs which had to be amputated following a savage russian hunterkiller attack on the british and american convoy hundreds of miles north of newfoundland when he was first transferred from the chopper to the hospital ship as one of the most seriously injured from hms peregrine and one of the first casualties of the atlantic war he was simply that another casualty and one who despite the double amputation was given a fair chance of survival because of his youth then the oilcaused pneumonia which so often lay undetected in a mans lungs for several days before it was discovered when it was too late began racking spences body depleting his strength so quickly that the earlier prognosis for recovery suddenly changed in those last desperate days thousands of miles from home lana knew it was not at all unusual for a patient especially a young man to transfer to her all the adoration he might have given the woman he would have loved had he lived like so many before him in war or not the intensity of william spences feeling for his nurse could be understood only by those who like him had lain in the morning hours in that death watch between two and four who had known the chilling fear that soon they would be no more and who wanted nothing more than a human touch to reassure them there was hope when there was none when the morphine ceased to work the pain so intolerable that it shamed his manhood and he wept like a child she drew the sheet down below his waist unpinned her hair letting it fall down on him lips closing about him her tongue enveloping and drawing him into her own ecstasy until it was his in the way she had learned from jay in his gentler honeymoon incarnation period was it possible that out of jays evil came good and for that she was banished to devils island as dutch harbor was called by the waves she told herself she no longer cared she had helped a young man confront death given him pleasure before the ultimate obscenity claimed him and no matter how sordid a thing they would make of it behind her back she knew she had been right and that they would not break her on this island or any other as lana turned around heading back to the thirtybed hospital the blue light changed dramatically invading masses of bruised cumulonimbus cloud swept in from the western sea where the warm kuroshio current and the bering sea collided to produce the towering thunderhead storm clouds it was the unmistakable signal that the islands strung along the mile arc were about to be hit by yet another millimaw the name given to the wind storms by the aleuts who had lived on the sparsely vegetated and forlorn islands even before the promyshlermiki the russian fur traders who had settled the barren but searich volcanic outcrops over two hundred years before lana watched the seabirds driven landward by the approaching storm yellowtufted puffins their bright white faces and rustred beaks atop the black bodies irrepressibly happylooking and always bringing a smile to her no matter how depressed she felt but even in the abundant bird life from cormorants and fulmars to kittiwakes she saw pain and battle where others reveled in the wildness of the place she yearned for the quiet life not boring but the kind of life she had experienced in nova scotia while based in halifax doing what now she felt she did best looking after others hoping not only to help them bear their pain but to escape from her own the truth on unalaska however was that to date there had not been much work to do the islands main function was twofold to provide safe anchorage in dutch harbor for the us japanese and korean factory ships from the storms that plagued the nutrientrich fishing ground off the aleutian trench and more important to serve as a depot between the handful of american bases as depot its primary responsibility was to adak island naval station and tiny shemya island which few americans had ever heard of and which being the most western extension of the united states possessed an air force station and was as all the interceptor and transport pilots knew the most heavily armed piece of real estate in the western world if ever the russians moved against the united states western flank shemya island and adak the big submarine base miles eastward would be more strategically important than midway island over five hundred miles south had been in world war ii the island which like england in the atlantic was in effect a united states forward aircraft carrier to the soviet union was not something lana brentwood had given much thought to for ones own world had a way of dwarfing world conflicts that were supposed to dwarf ones own besides neither she nor anyone else believed the russians would be so foolish as to head eastward and try to use the island arc as a stepping stone to americas back door through the alaskan and the canadian west coast the millimaw was moving in fast and by the time lana reached the hospital snow flurries mixed with rain were swept in by the millimaw at over ninety miles an hour the rain and snow striking the quonset huts horizontally the only place in the world the transport pilots told lana where such a phenomenon occurred all around she could hear the beginning of the aleutian wail which some bureaucrats in washington over four thousand miles away thought was aleutian whale but which was the peculiar beating and howling sound of the millimaw on the sheer basaltic cliffs and treeless slopes of the islands she could see the doubleglazed windows in the quonset huts as square orange eyes staring out from the bleakness unlike the native aleuts some of whom still lived in their underground sod houses or barabaras and who eked out a living subsisting on reindeer and seafood lana knew she would never get used to the place were it not for the vcr and the big highdefinition tv screen they had at the recreation center for the three thousand inhabitants of dutch harbor she believed there would be many more cases of severe depression to date the most common complaint at the base hospital some of the men most of them pilots had attempted to alleviate their boredom by trying to date her but she had refused most despite the gentleness shed experienced with william spence after her experience with jay la roche she was still leery of men especially when she discovered that the confidentiality of her naval file which had spelled out the reason for her banishment had been breached they obviously thought she was an easy lay the only exception she had even thought of making was a pilot lieutenant alen who regularly flew the resupply route to the big antisubmarine base on adak halfway along the chain and on to shemya and attu loran station over miles farther west near the international date line between the united states and ussr he had asked her if she had wanted to go along for a ride to see attu shed said no but he wasnt one to be deterred and this night as she walked into the officers club she saw his boyish grin can i buy you a drink he asked brushing the snow off her collar she felt awkward yes she said hot chocolate if thats all right one hot chocolate coming up alen ignored the guffaws of several pilots farther down the bar handing her the steaming mug he asked her if shed changed her mind about a flight this time to adak not particularly she answered not wishing to be rude but having already seen as many of the fortysix active volcanoes in the chain as she intended whats the matter you havent got a sense of history big battle there in fortythree banzai attack by the japanese just kept coming against our boys now theyre our boys she said well sort of last i heard theyre supposed to be on our side she answered support capability escorted our troop ships to korea but theyre crafty tokyo hasnt actually declared war on the soviets or china if theyre supporting us arent they on our side what im saying is they havent pulled out the stops not even with the north koreans hitting a few of their west coast ports economically theyre more powerful than most but they need oil raw materials if that stops japan stops they want to alienate as few countries as possible sounds like a bit of a highwire act to me said lana it is come on come see adak your brothers on a pigboat isnt he she didnt know whether he meant ray or robert sub he explained oh yes he is then its your patriotic duty to see adak cheer the boys up big sub base there i was going to watch the new movie tonight alen shook his head there isnt any lieutenant replied lana i heard it announced this morning some new jane fonda movie it got lost she glanced across at him shaking her head you guys you never forget she apologized you know to the vietnam vets no she didnt she said she was sorry if she upset any of them she didnt apologize for what she said still hanoi jane that was a long time ago lieutenant anyway i heard vietnam might come in on our side if china goes up against us no one knows what chinall do said alen they dont like the russians any more than we do anyway to hell with it let me take you to adak he lowered his voice and smiled maybe we can stop along the way she hesitated im still married lieutenant why dont you use your married name because i dont like it and its none of your damned business she realized for a second that she would never have talked like that before shed known jay hed taken some of her civility along with her innocence and she hated him as much for that as for anything else and shed been taught not to hate anyone sorry said the lieutenant youre right its none of my business what name you she didnt want to say any more but something bottled up inside her kept rising you think im an easy mark alens eyes avoided hers his gaze now shifting out looking at the swirling snow yeah i did he conceded he looked back at her i was out of line he walked away and opened the door to a howl of protest from the bar greeting the icy wind lieutenant she called he turned shut the door hand still on the handle flecks of snow in his sheepskin collar yes maybe some other time she said sure when he left the quonset hut lana felt drained a conversation like that with a man these days was harder on her than the hospitals night shift she always thought shed be able to handle it better after knowing jay but her confidence had been so badly shaken by him it penetrated any brave front she presented arriving on the ward she was told the head nurse wanted to see her a rush of apprehension took hold of her the last time a head nurse the matron in halifax had wanted to see her it had been the disciplinary hearing about spence followed by exile to the godforsaken islands lana already felt guilty as she made her way around the potholed blacktop of the quad to the head nurses station on the first floor snow melting the moment it landed on her cape the thought that each snowflake in the world was different comforting her to date the head nurse at dutch harbor had given no sign that she was a dragon like matron a prunefaced portly woman who acted quickly to dampen high spirits the moment anyone looked like they might possibly be enjoying themselves if such a thing was possible on the aleutian bases still lana knew that all head nurses by bent of their responsibilities were usually sticklers for rules and regulations and as she entered the quonset hut she was trying to think of which one shed violated the clock above the reception desk showed she was five minutes late for her shift im sorry she said but the snow the head nurse waved her apology aside and gave her the notification from the department of the army that her kid brother david a member of a rapid deployment force was missing in actionsomewhere on natos central front they all thought she took it very well the truth was however that as much as lana wanted to cry crying for her having always acted as a tranquilizer she couldnt for the simple fact was that she and david werent that close at twentyfour being the youngest of the family david hadnt seen much of lana who though she hadnt finished college because of jay was in her third year when he was still in high school there was simply too big a gap between them so much so that they hardly ever wrote to one another the only news between them passed on by her mother and father in his letters home before hed been wounded yet in other families different ages didnt seem to make a difference why was it she wondered was it because of her father a kind enough man but of the old when the going gets tough the tough get going school the boys had always been dissuaded from wearing their emotions on their sleeve or had it to do with their expectations the difference of what they each wanted in life so disparate david in political science before he joined the marines she in the jet set world of jay la roche perhaps the lack of communication on davids part had more to do with his disapproval of jay la roche he had said nothing about her leaving la roche whether it was desertion or disapproval she didnt know as she walked back from the head nurses station and into the ward she felt as if she were suddenly in a goldfish bowl everyone clearly knew about her brother missing how did news travel so fast expecting the gung ho i can take it exterior it was a strain accepting the condolences she felt smothered by everyones sympathy wishing they would just go away she wanted to be alone away from the island a chance simply to sit think for herself she dialed the pilots quarters lieutenant alen please she heard whistling at the other end of the line and ribald laughter she almost hung up but he was on the line his voice reminded her a little of frank shirer from the noises she could hear in the background he was taking a ribbing about talking to her but he was polite clearly refusing to be suborned by the grunts of the macho pack in the background she paused for a few seconds i dont know your first name she said with some amazement thats all right its rick when are you scheduled to go to adak in the morning oh five hundred kind of early therell be a break in the weather then or so they say okay but if i come along ill have to be back for the dog watch you think thatll be a problem no problem at all ah lana it was the first time hed called her by her first name yes sorry about your brother thanks when he got off the phone alen stiffened his right arm from the elbow up slapping his left hand hard down on the bicep driving the rigid forearm into the air in like flint there was a chorus of encouragement way to go and someone yelling rick the dick he grinned boyishly and immediately felt ashamed better strap her down rick could be a rough ride everyone wanted to be copilot but the assignments hadnt changed nor had the forecast for a break in the cloud cover around five in the morning gobble gobble shouted a navigator that night alen slept fitfully but he didnt worry sometimes when he was boneweary against all common sense he got so hard it felt like steel the only thing that worried him was that if she touched him he mightnt be able to wait the closer it got to the preflight call the more relaxed and sleepy he became when he did doze off he was in a dream the plane on automatic pilot the commanding officer of adak now bawling alen out for his violation of orders bringing a wave on a goddamned joyride in the middle of a combat zone and alen with no pants on telling the co that lana was merely fulfilling the requirements of her posting putting in at least thirty hours as required by waves for the purposes of atf air time familiarization which the pilots called airtime fucking alen also pointed out washingtons rationale that in the event of the aleutians being attacked the waves would have to help the pilots ferry back the most seriously wounded to either dutch harbor or beyond to anchorage in alaska and yet the only flight time most of them had was on the civilian flight from the lower fortyeight states at on the morning of october alen was feeling so thick from lack of sleep it took three cups of coffee to pump him awake the weather report was holding though in the caldron of storms as the volcanic aleutians were called the projected rise in barometric pressure could very quickly disappear when he got to the fogbound airstrip the latest weather posting only an hour old still called for clearing but lana was nowhere in sight come on said the copilot lets go alen looked plain miserable as the ac e hercules four turboprops sputtered to life throwing off curls of exhaust into the peasoup morning he glanced anxiously at his watch the most he could delay on preflight recheck was ten minutes and the weather was getting worse goddamnit said alen looking past the copilot at the fogshrouded runway cmon cmon what the hells she doing checking her diaphragm shouted the copilot chapter nine coming in at eight hundred miles an hour on the vector given him when he left cornwall the sea a wrinkled bluish slate racing backward beneath him roger fernshaw altered trim heard the jaguars targetlockon tone and fired one of his two exocets the yumashevs radar saw the blip of the jaguars exocet but lost it thereafter in sea clutter echo fernshaw monitoring the headup display itself monitoring the sidescan and umbrella radar feed glanced at the sky above white cumulus and breaking a russian pilots radar that technically speaking might pick him up wasnt fernshaws major concern however for he was flying so low trained in the dangerous twisting and turning lowlevel runs through the glens of scotland that he was initially on the deck forty feet above the waves where the jaguars image would hopefully be lost in the sea clutter blanketing any active radar signals beamed his way firing the second missile fifteen seconds and forty miles after the first fernshaw was still safely beyond the russian cruisers best thirtymilerange goblet surfacetoair missiles as he began his turn doing visual as well as instrument checks needing height to complete the maneuver he momentarily took himself out of the clutter he saw a wink of red against the cobaltblue sea most likely the first goblet leaving the cruiser for a moment he was struck by the perverse fact that if the twentyfootlong russian missile had been upgraded with boosters for a fifty or even fortyfivemile range he would be as his american colleagues in cornwall were fond of saying up shit creek without a paddle the count for the exocet missile was now down to thirtyone seconds and while his radar lit up with goblet and other aa ordnance opening up at him the exocet feed stayed live at seven seconds fernshaw saw an orange wink on the horizon blossom then fade and on his channel scanner he was picking up excited russian chatter presumably radio traffic emanating from the cruiser itself he didnt see his second missile hit the cruiser and scribbled pd on his knee pad indicating a probable or dud he also noted that the sevensecond gap between the time the exocet should have impacted the cruiser and the time it actually did suggested the jaguars ground crew should do a computer overhaul of the fire control system as soon as he returned the exocet hit the yumashev abaft the starboard beam and below the headnet c radar aerial the second missiles explosion gulped by the inferno of the first though striking farther back in the deck housing below the headlights radar which only minutes earlier had been tracking the incoming jaguar the damage to the cruisers superstructure would have been much worse had the missiles been better spaced for much of the second missiles impact was in an area already hit even so the exocets explosion on the waterline well below the headnet aerial effectively gutted the cruiser sailors suddenly sucked out from what only moments before had been warm watertight compartments their bodies like so much flotsam pouring like stunned fish into the icecold atlantic only a few of those in the water showed any signs of life as their comrades in the rescue squads threw out the tethered malvinsky raftdrums the halves of each container opening in the shape of an ugly mouth into tent rafts whose blossoming was like enormous orange flowers on the heaving surface of the sea forty miles to the northeast the two soviet sukhoi flagonfs accompanying the longrange badger dispatched by admiral brodsky had seen the blue line of the jaguars exocet as it streaked at deck level toward the subchaser yumashev but the sukhois did not leave the badger although capable of a dual role as a medium bomber and maritime reconnaissance aircraft the tupolev badger with a maximum speed of miles per hour was ill suited to go it alone in any seekanddestroy mission against the reported american sea wolf it badly needed the inflight refueled sukhois to guard its flanks and its captain knew that whether or not the two escorting russian fighters would be called upon to fire their weapons would depend entirely on the pilot of the jaguar with the nato fighter almost certainly approaching the end of its fuelpodextended radius of one thousand miles the badgers sixman crew were making wagers as to whether the allied pilot would engage them in an effort to take out the badgers twentythousandpound load of subdetecting airlaunched sonobuoys madmagnetic anomaly detection gear and its freefall ordnance of airlaunched depth charges and torpedoes for pilot officer fernshaw however seeing three russian aircraft on his radar screen a decision about whether or not he would attack them was more difficult than they could imagine the problem was the fighting in europe it was going badly for the western allies the half million british american and german troops trapped in the dortmundbielefeld pocket surrounded by a steel ring of six hundred ts pounding away at them with laserguided millimeter armorpiercing and highexplosive shells in the air of sustained crisis in the allied camp the decisions being forced upon whitehall for all british combatants as far down the chain as individual pilots like fernshaw were often as confused as they were urgent saceur supreme allied commander in europe headquarters brussels was now reporting to england that if all available nato air cover was not marshaled in defense of the dortmundbielefeld pocket then natos shriveling central front would cease to be and trip off fullscale collapse all along the german front from the north sea to switzerland accordingly in whitehall the minister of war bearing what washington called the big picture in mind advised the headquarters of all united kingdom air forces in wycombe and royal navy commander western approaches that if a pilot was confronted with the choice of running low on fuel in pressing an attack thereby risking the loss of his aircraft he was to exercise discretion what this meant to fernshaw and others like him in the highways department as the stol short takeoff and landing jaguar arm was referred to was that if whitehall the admiralty or the royal air force didnt like the decision you made you would be up another creek and smartly at that at the same time the admiralty was arguing wherever possible attacks to protect the ssbnsns must be pressed home at all costs and fernshaw knew their reasoning was sound for if germany was lost france would fall and with it the vitally needed ports for nato making resupply from america impossible then the ssbnsns and the relatively few stealth bombers would be left as a mobile deterrent on the other hand a single jaguar its superb flybywire avionics making it one of natos best groundhugging closesupport fighters could knock out ten times its number in tanks normally fernshaw his plane entering thick stratus wouldnt have found the decision a difficult one to make but like so many of the other outnumbered allied pilots called upon day after day night after rainsodden night to rise from carrier england and stem the surge tactics of the russian air forces fernshaw was exhausted fatigued from having lost twelve pounds in a week due to the wrenching g forces he wasnt sure that the decision whether or not to engage the badger and its outriders was a case of weighing military priorities or a plain oldfashioned matter of funk versus guts he headed for cloud both the russian leader front right of the badger and the second sukhoi to the badgers left rear and higher covering his leaders konus ranimosticone of vulnerability spotted the jaguar climbing fast fortythree miles ahead the russians confidence with the twotoone advantage was further boosted by the fact that their sukhoi flagonfs speed up to mach should they go as high as thirtysix thousand feet was much faster than the jaguars mach the sun was also behind them and no matter how sophisticated the electronics of the anglofrench planes fire control and weaponaiming computer were the sun in your visor was still a distinct disadvantage in the millisecond world of fighters so fast they could outstrip some of their missiles direct sunlight polaroid visors notwithstanding could produce oslepitel nost glareouton the dials the jaguar was climbing hard and fast into highpiled cumulus the russian leader glimpsing the jaguars roundchiselshaped nose telling him he was up against a stateoftheart britishferranti weaponaiming system but he had no clue as to whether the british pilot was going for high ground in cloud cover to attack or to escape the russian pilot knowing that radio silence had been broken earlier by the cruisers transmission to soviet northern fleet headquarters switched on instructing his wingman stay with mother ill sbiyuknock offour friend in heaven with the wingman acknowledging the leaders flagon now approaching the same height as the jaguar miles away hit the turmansky afterburner in straight vertical climb the wings flash in sunlight gave the fighter beauty as well as the aspect of pure power as it rocketed five thousand feet in less than ninety seconds giving the russian a ceiling of eleven thousand should the jaguar be contemplating an attack after all if the nato fighter was carrying a second exocet on one of its hard points then the badger and the two sukhois would now be within range everyone except pilots the russian pilot knew thought electronic warfare had made modern aerial combat little more than a superfast computer game the fact however was that there were so many variables from sunlight and weight of ordnance to a bird looking like a fighter for a fraction of a second that machines couldnt do it all now the jaguar fortysix miles away invisible in cloud but a clear blip on the flagons skip spin intercept longrange radar screen was heading nornoreast toward southwestern england but this could well be a feint leveling out the russian pilot saw a faint orange ball in the cloud he banked fast left until he realized the orange ball and the others like it were decoy flares the jaguar was jettisoning as protection from heat seekers the russian pushed the select button for one of his two airtoair amos actives flicked the cover and fired watching the missile streaking at over a thousand meters a second toward the jaguar over thirty miles away its radarseeking head programmed to ignore infrared signatures going instead for the enemys own radar pulse then the russian pilot saw his own warning radar screen go to fuzz the jaguar obviously dropping chaff to jam the amoss radar guidance the russian fired both of his heatseeking aas fernshaw saw his warning lights flashing frantically and heard the bogey tone his jaguar perilously low on fuel the sukhoi engaging him with a threehundredmilesperhour speed advantage fernshaw knew that unless he dropped his extra fuel pod to gain more speed he would not escape he released the external pod and shut off all radar heading higher into cloud noting his fuel consumption rapidly increasing in the thinner air and the three russian missiles closing seeing the jaguars drop tank tumbling reflecting like foil in the sun the russian leader shut off his active radar in case the british pilot had tried to be clever going high to fire off a radar seeker of his own the russian banked sharply to his left ordering his wingman to stay with the badger and both of them to go as low as possible to evade the western approaches longrange overthehorizon radar he then went to radio silence leaving only his channel scanner turned on within a second his radio surged the panicstricken voice of the badgers observer and in a flash he knew what had happened the jaguar had outfoxed him shutting off its radar doubling back in the cloud rather than running while he the russian had been looking for the jaguar up ahead immediately the russian went into a tight turn and dove his nose starting to bleed profusely in the g force the badger already under attack the jaguar passing on its forward right side four miles away and firing its remaining exocet at the big droning maritime reconnaissance plane with the extra speed afforded by the release of the fifteenhundredpound exocet the british fighter its twentyeightfoot sixinch wingspan six feet shorter than the sukhois was in its classic tight turn coming in fast behind the second sukhoi whose pilot was now breaking right and in an effort to beat the jaguar at its own game fired a cluster of six pound aphid passive heat seekers which would ignore all radar signals homing in only on exhaust at eight hundred miles per hour the aphids were twice as fast as the oncoming exocet but their best mode of attack because they were heat seekers was rear entry they needed to do a uturn but it was too tight they missed the exocet but two of them had now locked on to the exhaust of the jaguar itself as the british fighter completing a turn in a sound barrel of rolling thunder passed behind the badger the tracer from the badgers top turret ceasing for a split second as the jaguar flashed past the airplanes threestoryhigh tail the millimeter cannon in the badgers radarguided rear turret however was still firing even as the exocet slammed into the planes starboard exhaust flange the explosion blowing the plane in two the tail assembly tumbling more slowly than the forward section whose engines or rather the redhot mass that had been the twin mikulin turbojets plummeted like a rock the entire section upside down cockpit intact as it slammed into the sea disintegrating in spumes of steam and spray yet before it had gone down the halfsecond burst from its radar control rear turret had strafed the jaguar the fighters cockpit now whistling the splintered perspex and metal fragments from the demolished hud screen disintegrating in the hail of the badgers millimeter cannon the jaguar was shuddering violently yawing to the left fernshaw thought he must be hit but wasnt his doubleply flying suit and visor protecting him from the peppering of the instrument panels debris but he couldnt see for several seconds at first he thought it must be his visor scratched to a fog but then he could smell electrical fire realizing that the fog was smoke he fought for control but too many of the flybywire microcircuits were blown he felt the planes nose drop suddenly glanced at the altimeter but couldnt see it through the smoke guessing it had been shot out anyway elbows tucked in he took hold of the yellow and black zebrastriped hand grips the bolt release fired icy air was roaring about his helmet he prayed he was at least five hundred feet above the ocean smoke gone he could now see he was at least a thousand feet above a sharply inclined slab of whiteveined blue that was the sea he could spot only one of the sukhois a silver dot miles to the east then he thought he saw the second one but it was only the hapless hormone chopper several miles away hovering helplessly above the wreckage of the yumashev rescue harness extended picking up survivors as fernshaw struggled to crawl into the orange oneman tent raft chapter ten half a world away in unalaskas dutch harbor the woman in the jeep coming out of the mist toward the howl of lieutenant alens hercules was not the wave alen was expecting wheres lana he asked the wave sergeant lieutenant brentwood cant make it sir she sick no sir shes sorry but voice of america is doing a special report on the nato front shes hoping to pick up some more news about where her brothers division might be oh said alen trying not to show his disappointment well thanks for coming out and telling me the wave appeared not to hear him or was she asking another question one hand holding down her cap the other cupped about her mouth against the howl of the hercules four props so yelled the copilot to alen what dyou say alen was looking blankly at him in his disappointment he hadnt been paying much attention to the wave sergeant and there was an awkward moment before he realized that she was asking if she could take the flight to adak unconsciously alen was letting his eye rove over her body the wave outfit was just about the sexiest uniform hed seen on a woman the snappy navy cap and the tunic that whether or not the designer had intended it had easily sailed through the sea changes of fashion emphasizing the bust by trying to camouflage it sure said alen osullivan isnt it reilley she corrected him sergeant mary reilley its irish anyhow alen grinned welcome aboard the tall gangly engineer in his midtwenties from texas whom they called the turk for a reason no one could figure out was asked to make sure that sergeant reilley was strapped in tight the twohourly weather adjustment was for millimaws and more of the fog that one minute would obliterate the brutal majesty of the farflung volcanic islands and the next be blown asunder by a millimaw replaced by driving rain snow and hail all at once as the hercules took off all by instruments because of the fog alen banked quickly taking the c e with twentyone tons of food and electronic supplies for adak well away from the hidden and towering mass of makushin volcano the sixtysevenhundredfoothigh mountain rising immediately west of dutch harbor on the northern end of unalaska was now visible only on his radar mary reilly was asking the engineer on her helmets flip mike whether or not it would be possible for them to hop across from adak to attu island she had been told a horror story she said of how in world war ii over fifteen thousand poorly equipped american soldiers trained for desert warfare had been sent in against a smaller but much bettertrained and dugin garrison of three thousand japanese troops turk said he didnt know much about that war all i know maam is that the japanese are our allies in this one reilley voice straining against the background noise of the hercules was asking him another question but she kept forgetting to depress the talk button she couldnt believe how much noise military planes made compared to civil aircraft the turk was just sitting there watching her lips move which would have suited him nicely but he didnt want to be rude and pointed again to the talk button oh yes sorry said reilley i heard they i mean we thought the japanese would use the aleutians as kind of you know stepping stones to the united states they did cut in alen they attacked dutch harbor middle of fortytwo wanted to sucker our pacific fleet up here what was left of it after pearl harbor course they thought we d use attu and the other islands as stepping stones to them youre in a very strategic area sergeant call me mary okeydoke mary im surprised that the russians havent tried something up here she said they will alen answered when theyre ready those sons of he paused bitches she said yes maam well theyve got their hands full right now i dunno countered the copilot what i hear is theyre doin pretty good in europe maybe so said alen but ivans tricky man they could still decide to go for it up here try our back door sure as hell take the nato heat off their western front russkies dont like two fronts said the copilot thats what i heard thats it said alen derisively fight the last friggin war sure way to lose this one that where lanas kid brother is asked turk christ thought alen glancing over at the copilot the turk could always be depended on to open his mouth and screw everything up just when they were impressing bigchested mary turk had to shift the conversation to another woman yeah said alen quickly hes somewhere over there hes trapped in the dortmundbielefeld pocket said mary you sure know a lot about this war said turk ingratiatingly alen didnt mind at least they were back talking about her not really said mary shit it was the copilot his exclamation followed by a dull thump on the fuselage instinctively mary pulled her head back there was another fuck sorry miss damn seabirds their dark blood and gizzards splattered on the hercules windscreen went into long spidery scarlet webs under the pressure of the head wind the hercules air speed now at four hundred miles per hour despite the increasing turbulence driving the birds into the aircraft the big transport with its twentyone tons of cargo and a maximum fuel load of thirty tons loaded at dutch harbor to save refueling from adaks precious store was heavy enough to minimize the rough ride even so the impact of the birds had given the wave a bad fright and alen quickly and adroitly steered the conversation back to her knowledge of the war in europe nothing like praise to calm the nerves heck said reilley bashfully i dont know that much about it its just that lana and i work the same shift and well when she talks about her brothers she keeps me uptodate i guess how old is he asked turk oh christ thought alen there he goes again oh said the wave davids in his early twenties i think hes been around though he was in korea first with freeman turk let out a low respectful whistle well interjected alen impatiently if hes fought with freeman hes a survivor i wouldnt worry about him mary reilley was nonplussed by alens remark a tone of condescension in it but for whom david brentwood because he alen hadnt yet seen combat or was it disdain for freeman freeman was one of mary reilleys heroes in a world where it was no longer fashionable to have heroes especially not military ones to his troops the general was known as george c scott for like patton freeman had proved himself daring and to many insufferably brave convinced of his mission to drive back the mongols as he put it by which his critics charged the general meant anyone not born in either the old british empire or the new american onefreeman had given america its first and so far only good news in the war as now aboard the hercules whenever his name was mentioned it evoked powerful emotions and left no middle ground the media especially was divided into those who hated to say anything good about him and those who loved saying anything bad about him but on one point as mary reilley pointed out there was unanimity he had turned things around in korea yeah agreed turk we were damned near in the drink over there alen interjected that it was kind of strange for a nurse to like a combat general adding i heard freeman was the first general on our side to use women in combat that right mary said nothing the lieutenant was starting to get on her nerves his comments less questions than taunts against what he obviously thought were her butch sensibilities hell thought mary it wasnt her fault lana couldnt make it that right pressed alen chopper one in the pyongyang raid was flown by a skirt you want to be in combat miss asked turk looking puzzled i dont want to be in combat but heck if you can do the job what difference does it make whether youre the next two thuds on the fuselage interrupted her but i mean if were outnumbered by the russians and we are then the next instant she was flattened out arms pinned hard back against the fuselage her mouth gasping like a stunned fish turk was gone out of the flapping gaping hole where his monitor console had been and there was a long bluish light in front of her fluttering like a silk scarf a tongue of highoctane flame and above it a roaring then all about crashing sounds as the crated cargo shifted and came adrift crashing through its webbing straps the hercules now in a spin the suction tearing at her ripping open her tunic the icy blasts so powerful she felt as if her nostrils were burning alen slumped in his seat the copilot shouting mayday mayday wreckage from the hercules was found sliding up and down the swells about fifteen miles north of the smoking okmok caldera a volcanic cone on the eastern end of umnak island miles west of dutch harbor in a feat of oceanographic skill unmatched since the howard hughescia glomar challenger retrieval of a sunken soviet golfclass submarine in the s a us navy twoman submersible flown in from valdez over nine hundred miles away located the black box from the hercules as well as the hard disk recording of the chitchat between cockpit and the unauthorized wave passenger the usaf investigators flown in from anchorage were able to agree that the transport had been operating under normal procedure the radar the black box showed had been on but the investigators noted that in the heavy fog no doubt exacerbated by wind shear conditions from the approaching millimaw an error could have been made by either lieutenant alen or his copilot in interpreting the blips occurring on the radar most of the blips recorded on the radar strip were confirmed by thumps faintly discernible on the sound disk thus it appeared that whatever it was that had struck the hercules passing through the engineers position could have been mistaken for yet another seabird approaching possibly a royal albatross these big birds had a sevenfoot wingspan and were easily capable of giving a very distinct blip on the planes highdefinition radar this explanation by the usaf investigators was accepted by the dutch harbor board of inquiry particularly as meteorological reports from the small settlement of nikolski on the western end of umnak island confirmed that quake tremors registering on the richter scale and intermittent volcanic activity from the seventhousandfoothigh mount vsevidof on the western end of the island had been recorded volcanic activity in and about the okmok caldera at the eastern end of the island was suspected as bouldersized rocks thrown up even at subsonic speed by either volcano could have easily doomed the aircraft an act of god even so the commanding officer of dutch harbor was severely reprimanded for having allowed the unauthorized flight of sgt mary eileen reilley and the officer commanding the wave detachment maj brenda sharp was named in the issuances of an upcoming naval inquiry as an interested party in navy parlance this meant that because major sharp had not signed a piece of paper her career was effectively finished for this as well as for sergeant reilleys death the major in her turn held lana brentwood directly responsible the scuttlebutt and now the gossip was much cruder and harsher than before was that brentwood had jerked off some limey back east had been sent to siberia and had now screwed up the wave co and done in an nco while she was at it the advice given every new arrival to dutch harbor was stay away from lana she was unlucky the bodies from the hercules were never found no surprise to the fishermen who worked nets from dutch harbor to amchitka or anywhere else around the seventhousandfootdeep aleutian trench the bering sea was a protein soup from the tiny plankton whose diurnal migrations cluttered your sonar to the big killer whales if you were dead or couldnt move you were feed and quickly in any event unalaska coast guard requested that any fishermen working the waters off the steaming black sands of okmok caldera should immediately report any debris they found the coast guard was upbraided by sowac the local status of women action committee for using the word fishermen and it issued the request for fisherpersons to assist as it turned out one fisherman pete bering who was erroneously claimed by the locals to be a direct descendant of explorer vitus bering and his crew were working the waters off umnak but had been well off the southwestern tip of the island the day of the crash as it might be a week before bering had his boats hold full of pollack and he could head back toward dutch harbor a hundred miles east of him bering radioed the coast guard to say that while he and his crew of three had heard a plane overhead theyd been in heavy fog and so hadnt seen it go down chapter eleven when the brooding gray mountains of cumulus shifted above unalaska there were moments of stunning wild beauty the united states windriven bases in the aleutians changing suddenly from fogshrouded bleakness to a cold but clear sky an expanse of arctic turquoise that in a moment seemed to clear the mind of island fever at nightfall the lights of dutch harbor would take on a sparkling quality in the pristine arctic air reminding lana brentwood of the summer nights as a child in the sierra nevada of the days before the war when the whole family would go camping the days had been hot and dry the nights getting colder just before labor day and the start of the new school year those nights came back to her now as she went for her evening stroll on the road leading from the bluish cold of dutch harbor she could smell the coming of winter in the air and instinctively pulled her waves parka about her the quallofil lining sighing as it collapsed a sound that brought back memories of a favorite red down jacket her father had given her things had been so predictable then the sad end of summer the anxietyveined anticipation of the new school year and a new jacket from her parents most kids took jackets as standard fare but her father wasnt an admiral then and on a captains pay with the three boys and her to put through school a new jacket was something to celebrate later when she married jay la roche a think coat was no big deal but now at least she didnt have to fear jay anymore the world might be at war but she wasnt at least not with him and save for her brief encounter with the horror of battle wounds she had seen when caring for young william spence aboard the hospital ship on the east coast the war was a long way away from unalaska she knew that with the western tip of the aleutian chain pointing toward russias kamchatka peninsula her feeling of isolation from the war was in fact very much an illusion the big soviet missiles on kamchatka pointing toward the united states were countered by the united states missiles on shemya which despite its small size was the most heavily armed place on earth its missiles were only minutes from the russian mainland lana offered up a silent prayer to any power that might exist that so long as the war remained conhttech in the jargon of the strategist conventional hightech war a war in where there might still be a chance that all would not disintegrate killing millions suffocating the earth reason might yet prevail in the madness she pulled the jacket more tightly about her the very chill of the thought of nuclear holocaust adding to the chill of the arctic front if the war did go nuclear then pray shed go in the fireball and not suffer the horrible lingering death of radiation the thought of her hair falling out in clumps was more terrifying to lana than all the other horrible possibilities like those that had afflicted ray the burn on his face making him a walking nightmare so that even his children could not find it in them yet to look straight at him according to the last letter her mom had sent her rays appearance was changed again whether it was the eighth of ninth operation lana no longer knew and despite their moms assertion that ray was looking better and better lana saw no change in the photograph an awful polished plastic sheen instead of a face of real skin that made it look like a tight mask its stretchedskinlike quality not diminished by the prints which were not glossy but mattefinished lanas use of mattes instead of glossies was a deliberate attempt to delude herself of the reality that with all the magic of laser and plastic surgery and it was magic in what it could sometimes do ray would never look normal again she was surprised that beth and ray were still together with him a virtual prisoner in la jollas veterans burn unit outside san diego and beth up in seattle with the two children for a moment lana was jealous at least they were together in the way it mattered an old line from her favorite movie came to her and she could see katharine hepburn alone and lonely in venice and counseling a beautiful blonde who was complaining about her husband dont knock it cookie twos the most beautiful number in the world well it was if the other one wasnt jay la roche because she hadnt confided in anyone especially her parents she sometimes felt that her mother thought she expected too much but all she wanted was a marriage like beth and rays not perfect by any means but built on bedrock not on shifting sand or was it bedrock could it ever be perhaps beth wasnt confiding in anyone either keeping it bottled up inside and caged by pride at least beth would have the children jay had wanted them a son especially but his violence took care of that too and induced a miscarriage in lana hed got mad about that as usual that was her fault too but god forgive her she had seen it then and saw it now as a blessing not to herself but for the child who would have grown up with jay a nightmare that beth with all her troubles didnt have to contend with perhaps jay would change no she thought he wouldnt the humvees horn startled her and she stepped smartly to the shoulder of the road and turned to see the driver lieutenant brentwood it was a sergeant from dutch harbor hq youre wanted back at the base maam commander morins request requested or ordered lana asked though she didnt really care her sharp tone merely one of fright he didnt say maam its all right sergeant said lana moving around to the passenger side im not going anywhere just out for my daily constitutional yes maam pretty soon youre gonna need more than that anorak jay la roche still on her mind lana read more into the sergeants comment than he meant they didnt call the aleutians americas siberia for nothing it felt like exile the need for companionship for women ever greater than was usual for a military base and for some like lana whod committed an infraction against the rules the aleutians posting was meant to be an exile a punishment and with your punishment came your file severely reprimanded for conduct unbecoming an officer in lanas case would it have been unbecoming she thought wryly for a noncom nurse to have given young spence the comfort of sexual release there had been a lot of jokes in her wake about the unbecoming bit but by now she was used to it at least shed developed an armor against the more vulgar suggestions and leers of men who had been given the choice of unalaska or permanent latrine duty at parris island or camp lejeune after what her brother david had gone through in marine boot camp at parris island lana could well understand why some chose the blustery isolation of the aleutians and now david was god knew she turned on the driver is it about my brother the sergeant was pumping the brakes on a patch of black ice and shifting down so the truck roared whats that maam he shouted colonel morin has he got news of my brother david no idea maam all i was told was to come and get you she felt cold now in the pit of her stomach what was so urgent that on this godforsaken island in this godforsaken chain the base commander had sent out a humvee for her it was either david or robert or was it their parents perhaps all of them it couldnt possibly be maam yes can i ask you something off the record she nodded not sure whether she should have you ever go out with enlisted men asked the sergeant no just thought id ask iim sorry i didnt mean for it to sound like that its not i dont go out with anyone sergeant oh lord she thought now they d say she was a lesbian no they wouldnt not after young spence and her conduct unbecoming an officer or maybe that wouldnt make any difference from the mens point of view up here any woman would do even so she hadnt meant to offend the sergeant i didnt mean to sound sall right maam i understand no you dont thought lana now she was confused in her anxiety over why shed been sent for she desperately wanted reassurance her old fears suddenly resurfacing a feeling of vulnerability and fright combined overwhelmed her she wished shirer were here what she wouldnt give for a man to hold her to love her not sex not to start with anyway just to be held as she watched the light fading from dutch harbor the hills around the base took on a chilling blue aura at once beautiful ethereal almost and threatening you wanted to see me commander asked lana trying to read in his face what it was all about before he spoke yes answered commander morin close the door will you lieutenant there was another man in the quonset hut a fisherman by the look of his rough white cowichan knit sweater its bald eagle wings in full span across the mans barrelshaped chest at first glance he gave the impression of being overweight but lana realized it was probably the oilskins covering his considerable frame that gave her the impression lieutenant brentwood said morin a small stocky man his height in marked contrast to the considerably bigger man whom he introduced as mr bering berings wild saltandpepper beard framing a time and windravaged face bering reminded lana of the prewar magazine alaska menmaybe it was still being published in alaska men outnumbering eligible females three to one now five to one with the troops stationed there had advertised in the magazine in the lower fortyeight states for prospective mates bering had a burly honest look about him clearly undaunted by the unfamiliar military surroundings though it wasnt the kind of location she would expect to find him in he looked born to the sea lana wondered why the man in his late thirties perhaps early forties and fitlooking now that she saw him closer wasnt in uniform until morin introduced him as a crabber shellfish meat from the aleutians was now in everhigher demand in japan and the united states with japans fleet of shellfish trawlers unable to break out north of hokkaido island into the fishing grounds of the vast north pacific because of the soviet sub blockade that extended from vladivostok to kamchatka peninsula without the american fish supply to japan via hawaii and the long southern route around the sub packs japan would soon be in the same position as britain had been when hitlers uboat blockade threatened to bring that country to its knees all the soviets had to do was delay the food supplies to japan as effectively as they had interfered with the nato reinforcements across the atlantic close the ring for another twelve weeks and the equation of men and materiel would shift decidedly to the soviets favor then there would be no way out except nuclear and that was no way at all morin was asking lana how well she knew captain alen she was sitting feeling too bulky and hot in the overheated room and asked for permission to remove her parka bering who had taken a seat to the right of the commanders desk sat with his arms draped nonchalantly about the back of the plastic molded chair blue eyes unapologetically xraying her newly revealed shape i want you to understand lieutenant began commander morin shifting his gaze to bering both of you that this meeting is strictly off the record it struck lana then that bering was really a regular naval officer the unkempt beard and ruddy cheeks a front along with the easy affability and apparently unconcerned air but for what drugs on the base mr bering explained morin is a longtime resident of unalaska oh said lana smiling waiting morin looked down at a threering binder paused for a moment how long did you know him lieutenant bering was making her feel undressed the pilot pressed morin irritated that he hadnt the effect on her that bering obviously did the hercules that crashed morin was looking up at her not long at all said lana hed invited you to fly to adak with him is that correct yes sir you didnt go what was morin on about lana wondered it was a dumb question of course she didnt go otherwise shed be dead why was that records show you were off duty you didnt report in sick did you no sir but id just received a wire from the war department about my brother the night before the flight hed been reported missing in action on the morning i was to go with lieutenant alen i picked up a voa broadcast about the situation in europe and i decided to stay and listen morin nodded his eyes back on the file then up at her again the sound of the electric clock on the wall behind him was a taint buzz which lana could now hear quite distinctly in the silence of the room yes said morin im sorry he paused you ever see him drunk lana was nonplussed no not that i i dont mean in duty said the commander socially no replied lana i hardly knew him he invited me up for the run to adak thats all how about his copilot then i didnt know him at all commander morin was tapping a pencil on the desk letting it slip through his fingers reversing it obviously in a quandary i dont think proffered lana that he was the type to get drunk before a flight sir if thats what youre concerned about anyway as far as i remember the plane was hit by volcanic debris when mount vsevidof blew yes said morin rolling the pencil back and forward between his hands thats what we thought we did have a four point six on the richter but thats not unusual for this part of the world anyway it doesnt usually accompany an eruption weather boys tell me theyd expect something around seven point one for the volcanoes to blow their tops he paused leveling the pencil at bering this gentleman says he was in the area off vsevidof that morning how far out did you say lana liked bering so laidback his thumbs hooked in the pockets of his coveralls legs outstretched as if he might be getting ready to take a nap bout seven ten miles he told the commander halfway between mount vsevidof and okmok caldera he was smiling at lana next island west of us miss calderas the ash lip of the old volcanostill steams a lot adds to the fog but i never heard the noise you see i mean the noise of anything being thrown upvolcanic rocks they go through the air with a kind of hissing noise lava starts to cool as it flies through the air and when it hits the sea once youve heard it you never forget but cut in morin pressing into his left palm hard with the pencils eraser and looking straight at lana he thinks he heard know i heard colonel said bering though he was still watching lana all right morin corrected himself he heard another sound well said bering like i said i saw the flash first then a booming sound a few seconds later he thinks said morin that it was a missile now she told the commander she realized why he was so concerned it looked as if one of their own aircraft in the fighter umbrella that constantly patrolled the aleutian arc had accidentally shot down the hercules killing alen the copilot engineer and nurse mary reilley the military called it friendly fire but you ended up just as dead no the commander corrected her ive done a thorough check of that possibility no fighter cover over the area at that time he glanced up at the map of the aleutian arc where hed ringed the wild grasstopped basalt group generally known as the islands of four mountains which thrust out of the sea three hundred miles west of unalaskas dutch harbor a bogey suggested lana surprised at her ready use of the preflight lingo shed picked up at the base the commander shook his head nothing on our radar nothing at all but interjected lana our radar at shemya island and adak should have picked up anything coming our way i mean exactly said morin mildly irritated that she knew enough to ask the question shemyas phased radar and adak naval station should have seen anything coming our way at least half an hour warning even if they were flying at mach the commander paused which is why the russians would like to take those two stations out reduce our warning time then how pressed lana would a missile thats why ive asked you here said morin to check out alen if theyd goofed up accidentally fired off a flare or whatever it might have been what mr bering believes it wasnt a flare colonel id bet old sea goose on that he smiled at lana my trawler oh it was going way too fast for a flare commander continued bering ive seen enough of those from search and rescue to know the difference without taking his hands out of his pockets bering indicated the map looked to be coming up from the vicinity of four islands now lana realized precisely what it was that the commander was worried about if a missile had been fired at the hercules from a submarine then it most likely had advance notice of the aircrafts destination and so its probable flight path lana was about to assure the commander that she certainly hadnt told anyone butii did mention it to nurse reilley when i found out i couldnt go for the ride the nurse who went instead of you asked morin yes she took my place but she would hardly have had time to tell anyone im not saying she did responded the commander but all it takes is for someone to send a millisecond burst signal to the sub at least a dozen or so people on the base knew the plane was doing a supply run to adak but wouldnt we pick up a signal like that asked lana yes and ive checked all signals as well as fighter patrol times and ive had the reports from adak and shemya crossreferenced on that day nothing they dont show any sub intercept lana thought hed snap the pencil in half as he sought an explanation i dont think youve got a security leak said bering plane just happened to be there too much damn coincidence otherwise the pencil was still morin clearly relieved by berings implied conclusion that no one in morins command was an agent that it was simply coincidence that the downing of the hercules had occurred in dutch harbors area of responsibility but the commanders satisfaction was shortlived as he reminded himself how the military was loath to believe in coincidence it was too often a coverup for incompetence and god knew there were enough dissatisfied people posted to the aleutians that he couldnt dismiss the possibility his command had a leak in any event it was a case of cover your ass which meant checking out the four mountains as well as requesting a security sweep of any civilians on the island many of them of aleutrussian heritage from the days when dutch harbor was used as the main base for russian fur sealers the aleuts had been poorly treated during world war ii many interned in rundown fish canneries on the alaskan mainland it was quite possible the russians had infiltrated at least a few of them on the one hand if he sent any of his men to do a search of the four small islands it would raise the question of a possible spy or spies and it wasnt a smart move careerwise to stir anything up if you couldnt deliver on the other hand if an aircraft could be brought down anywhere over the thousandmile arc americas back door was open perhaps it had nothing to do with anyone on the islandperhaps a missile was fired from a sub after all in the second world war japanese subs the big i boats had shelled oregon and california but then how could morin explain how the noise of an enemy sub had gone undetected given the extensive network of sonar arrays around the aleutians a sub story just wouldnt stand up but if bering was right if a missile had been fired from one of the islands it was unlikely that out of the ten types of soviet airtosurface missiles they would use anything as big as an ss with its range of fortyeight hundred miles it was much more likely they would use something like the shorterrange shouldermounted grails which could have been fired low and fast enough to evade dutch harbors radar miles to the east it would have taken only a few seconds from a base somewhere on the four small islands to bring down the big hercules morin asked bering if seeing he knew the island so well he would be prepared to act as scout for a searchanddestroy mission to the four islands bering thought about it and said he would on one condition which is pressed the commander anxiously bering replied that as an independent fisherman he didnt have the benefits of any group medical insurance especially as he was separated from his wife and that now his two teenagers were in braces the cost of dental treatment was keeping him broke leave it to me said morin from here on in youre covered ill get the paperwork done this afternoon dont worry about it the commanders gaze shifted to lana then back to bering ill organize a platoon and transport but i want this whole operation kept under wraps then we should use my trawler put in bering if there is anyone on the islands up to no good theres no point in advertising were coming but youll have to land somewhere theyll see your trawler coming whether they suspect anything or not not if i go in fog they wont and thats the forecast for the next week all right said morin smiling appreciatively sounds good to me okay said bering enthusiastically would you like to come along miss brentwood she blushed despite herself was he serious ill stay here with the commander lucky commander said bering mischievously morin was decidedly embarrassed as she and bering left the quonset hut the sky above them was studded with stars but even now wisps of fog could be seen sneaking into the harbor and for want of anything better to say lana noted the obvious think weve seen the end of the good weather for a while ill be back said bering id like to take you out when i get back okay with you why yes i suppose great the next minute he was gone into the night heading back toward the docks of dutch harbor his fishermans wetweather coat draped over his arm like a helpless slave lana thought and she felt a stirring in her heard the scuttlebutt asked her roommate almost the moment she returned to barracks what asked lana they think theres some commie missile base down on one of those islands were probably going to see some action around here shortly lana didnt know what shocked her most news of the searchanddestroy mission having already leaked or that her roommate seemed so eager to see actionwhich meant broken bodies for the waves after this gig the girl told lana in civvy street theyll be begging us to work in or if said lana therell be any ors left ah well win honey like we did in vietnam said lana youre a gloom cloud all of a sudden morin chew your ass out no cheer up then nobodys going to push the big button theyre not crazy lady if theyre not crazy said lana they wouldnt have started a war in the first place i dont know said the bubbling roommate sometimes theres no other way sometimes you have to fight what depressed lana more was that her fellow wave was right sometimes there was no other way either that or you simply walked away in defeat as she had with jay her roommate running late for her shift grabbed her cape you know anything about this bering no said lana oh come on lana you were with him in morins office yes but i mean i dont know anything about him some kind of fisherman i dont know some kind of fisherman id like to go fishing with him id like to get him under the sheets in between them or on top of them and all right said lana though he had just sunk the yumashev robert fernshaws initial rush of victory as he ditched gave way to empathy for the hundreds of russian sailors miles away who like him were at the mercy of the atlantic now and then he could glimpse patches of them through the crazily tilting rectangle of his life rafts flap as the raft slid up and down the walls of everdeepening troughs the exocet fernshaw had fired had been so devastating that he knew many of the russian crew wouldnt have had time to make for the life rafts caught for a moment atop a huge sweeping swell he saw the dot of the russian chopper hovering over the stricken sailors winching a dozen or so aboard and it looked like ferrying others from the oilstreaked water to the few lifeboats but how far could the chopper go even on a full tank the hormones range wasnt much more than four hundred miles fernshaw stopped thinking about the russians any sympathy he may have had for them as fellow human beings being quickly dissipated by the reality of the war it wasnt natos divisions that had breached the fulda gap and started the war anyway they certainly werent going to worry about him he checked that his rafts sars saltactivated radiotosatellite beacon was working and was struck by the irony that if an allied ship was over the horizon it would probably see via satellite relay photos the scores of russian sailors in the water first and would miss him altogether if the beacon packed it in after the first few hours of fullpower transmission the swells that had been mere scratches on a blue slate from the air were now growing alarmingly the high white cumulus bruising and the ocean no longer deep blue but a relentless and endless gray but perhaps he told himself the swells that seemed to have grown more precipitous in the last five minutes were not harbingers of worsening weather but merely appeared more ominous beneath the leaden sky then he saw the hormone its coaxial rotors a black blur and for a moment or two fernshaw was convinced he was about to die his heart pounding thinking of his wife and fouryearold boy the cloying smell of the claustrophobic rubber raft closing in on him making him nauseated all his training against g forces was of no avail in the heaving chaos of the sea where one second he felt his whole body grow lighter as the raft swept up the side of a fifteenfoot swell before plummeting his stomach churning into the next trough not a religious man fernshaw nevertheless said a prayer for deliverance and it was only when he glimpsed the russian chopper suspended above him a buoyancy bag inflated around each of its four wheels a rescue cable and harness still dangling from its side door that he dared hope fate was finally lending him a hand that the old law of the sea of enemies helping one another when they were in peril might yet prevail one of the russians in the hormone immediately behind the copilot was dimly visible through the saltspeckled perspex of the chopper on impulse fernshaw waved the man waved back and the chopper rose in the chopper several of the yumashevs rescued crew members made to cross the hormones cabin to look out but the pilot alarmed by their abruptly shifting the choppers center of gravity brusquely ordered them to saditsya sit down a young cook still shivering ignored the order and remained standing one hand on the cabin rail the other clutching a rough woolen navy blanket about his shoulders his wet hair and beard matted with oil sludge as he watched the silvered barrel toppling from beneath the chopper the bright orange raft slid bumpily down a swells steep incline as the chopper banked the sea erupted seconds later the depth charges fuse set for poverknostny kontakt surface contactits shock wave visible a huge ring shuddering and racing out from its epicenter the tentshaped raft miraculously still inflated but tumbling down the outside of a high foaming column of water as if caught in a mossy green waterfall the enemy pilots body limp and lifeless hitting the water before the raft chapter twelve the explosion its range put at three miles by the roosevelts sonar conversion computer was heard aboard the sub as no more than a muffled cough but it was loud enough to startle robert brentwood out of his light sleep his photo of rosemary sliding from his chest as his hand darted out to stop the walkman from falling as he turned glancing up at the control relay in his cabin he saw the sub was maintaining the anticipated tacamo rendezvous by crawling along at less than knots on the emergency bring it home shaft against a crosscurrent the current surprisingly strong and not marked on the chart was disconcertingly mixed in temperature and salinity as officer of the deck peter zeldman lost no time in alerting everyone in control to a possible inversion layer coming up soon every man aboard knew the sub might be approaching a plume a less dense area of water caused by either fresh or hot water springs from the earths crust streaming through the colder more dense sea around them and everyone knew how many subs before them had suddenly plunged in a less dense column hitting the bottom at over miles an hour before tanks could be vented to regain neutral buoyancy the explosion albeit muted in the distance was at once an added strain and a possible relief for those in control as it could mean that another allied submarine was in the area unknowingly taking the heat off them on the other hand as zeldman pointed out to brentwood if it had been an enemy asw aircraft or surface vessel searching for the roosevelt then the explosion some way off indicated that the subs pursuers were way off course and had merely been attacking blind looking for the sub around the last reported position of the yumashev but whatever was going on about him robert brentwood was certain of one thing after his sinking the cruiser the russians would gather their forces and he like the convoys could expect more determined and pervasive attacks en route to the haven of scotlands holy loch still over a thousand miles to the northeast brentwood also knew that now there was no way they could risk going up for a tacamo rendezvous they were on their own chapter thirteen in baltic fleet headquarters at baltiysk near the lithuanian port of kaliningrad a bad mood permeated the hallways especially in the office of the baltic fleets naval intelligence unit which reported directly to the glavnoye razvedyvatelnoye upravieniethe gru main intelligence directorate of the soviet general staff no one among the estonian workers was cooperating including those of russian background the large minority of russians in estonia as well as native estonians had been approached to see if they had heard anything about who was sabotaging munitions in the factories in and around tallinn the estonian capital they said they had not the gru general had no doubt they were lying their silence taken by the gru as yet another legacy of what was contemptuously referred to as gorbachevs glorious reign the estonians had been permitted to pass laws forbidding russian workers from voting unless theyd lived in estonia for several years the estonian russians had suddenly found themselves secondclass citizens within the soviet union and now they were in no mood to risk the wrath of the lesnye bortsy za svobodu forest freedom fighters the estonian underground by helping military intelligence to make matters worse for the gru there had been an astonishing display of solidarity among workers of all backgrounds outside the estonian capital as well not only were the shipyard and factory hands not saying anything but russian immigrant workers as far east as kohtlaj√§rve where most of them worked the oil shale deposits were also proving to be uncooperative toward the gru at first the gru chief thought he could run the saboteurs to ground simply by tracing the serial numbers of the munitions that had been assigned to the yumashev most specifically the rbu rockets which had failed so miserably in the yumashevs attack upon the american submarine but as his men fanned out amid the giant gantries of tallinns shipyards and to the various munitions assembly and distribution centers along the thousand miles of baltic coastline from virborg in the northern sector of the gulf of finland east to leningrad then west again to tallinn and riga and as far south as kaliningrad in lithuania they made a troubling discovery that many serial numbers had been duplicated in some cases triplicated in different ports and the same port this was bad enough but as they tried to narrow the problem down to what specific shift what factory or yard had installed the fuses they found themselves in a quagmire of administrative chaos one of the clockin cards being signed mm mouse and responsibility for the mess being passed around like a game of musical chairs back in leningrad naval base it wasnt a game admiral brodsky enjoyed playing below his office window the neva river looked leaden the cloven sky morose and in the autumn air he could smell the heavy mustiness of fallen leaves an early winter predicted this meant the gulf of finland could be iced over by christmas only five weeks off even with the few icebreakers he had available brodsky knew that early ice would spell disaster resupply of the baltic fleet impossible the thought of the fleet that had broken out into the atlantic after the joint soviet forces assault on the denmark straits and the nato danish base of bornholm island being left without vital food and munitions unable to press its attack against the us submarines was anathema to brodsky i cannot believe brodsky told his aide that in the more than fifty thousand shipyard and dockworkers we have for the baltic fleet there is no one willing to talk they were ready for us comrade admiral his aide explained they knew wed discover the sabotage sooner or later if i might make a suggestion yes with due respect to our naval intelligence we should hand this over from gru to the mpo he meant the morskaya pogranichnaya okhrama the maritime border troops of the kgb what can their frigates and gunboats do that naval intelligence cant i wasnt thinking of that aspect sir i had their shore people in mind undercover antiespionage division why would they know any more than our gru asked the admiral turning farther around in his chair in british military intelligence department six were running an operation jungle in the three baltic states kgb had it pinned from the very beginning admiral brodsky nodded but it was only a dim memory he was searching for a name that would have been luki lukasevics put in his aide yes sir his control was carr well lukasevics singlehandedly invented a partisan baltic army which mi was desperate to keep alive when the postwar was becoming the cold war washington was just as desperate for information moscow center obliged they had lukasevics feeding carrs mi disinformation and carr in turn fed the cia carr kept recruiting and sending agents to the baltic six networks in all and we knew that is the kgb knew who they were the moment they landed the admiral shifted impatiently where are you taking me captain just this sir the kgb has kept a much closer watch on the baltic than we have especially in latvia and estoniamost of all in tallinn but eventually the british did find out replied the admiral their networks blown blown yes admiral but networks dont simply close down some of those recruited by lukasevics were genuine partisans they didnt know they were being run by kgb they reformed waited for another chance waiting for a gorbachev for anything to give them a chance but lukasevics waited also he still had his informers and kept them in place within the new networks they still believed he was londons man you see youre telling me said brodsky grimacing massaging the swollen joints of his left hand we should turn the entire investigation over to kgbs maritime division either that admiral or they could let us have some of their files brodsky shook his head he wasnt that naive about intelligence matters no you were right the first time if we must do it comrade we will have to relinquish control of the investigation as it is theyll probably be surly that we left it so long further delay will only make matters worse perhaps i should put it in the form of a request lets see to assist us in a case of national emergency he turned to the captain that should break the ice it is also true though how their mpo troops can identify the source of the sabotage from the same serial numbers we have is beyond me sometimes admiral brodsky struck his aide as being bonethick between the ears a cautious naval tactician and ploddingly able liaison officer between the northern and baltic fleets he did not possess the subtlety of mind necessary for intelligence work nor the necessary toughness though a stern disciplinarian he was nevertheless known to exhibit bourgeois sentimentality when it came to running personnel matters to ground particularly in cases involving threeyear conscripts who went awol early in their shipboard assignments his detractors said he was weak on such matters because as a young conscript in the michmanwarrant officerprogram he had fallen in love with one of the women conscripts who like most women between nineteen and forty at that time were being trained as radio officers she was an estonian from tallinn brodskys parents had objected strongly and it was said that only the urging of more sensible heads among his comrades had prevented brodsky from going awol from his unit in mv frunze the soviet unions annapolis where he was in training as a surface vessel line officer the wouldbe marriage never happened and a young mans passion became sublimated through the rigorous requirements of the frunze academy and sea duty as a midshipman in the baltic fleet where hed learned the cold necessity of subjugating individual desires in duty to the state in the western navies they called it setting your sights on your career and women were supposed to follow not impede still the gruff sixtysevenyearold had never forgotten malle vesiland the picture of her long blond hair done up in a severe bun as per regulations making her twice as attractive to him his youthful dreams of seeing it fall free in the flush of passion as fresh in his old mans heart as it had been a thousand years ago when they were young malles features had blurred in the memory and brodsky had no doubt that she like most women in the republics would wear her age badly but no matter the unfulfilled dream hed held as a young midshipman was as new in him now as the day he had first met her in leningrad the closest they had got to the dream was to hold hands during their walks by the neva until sunset touched the river with gold and to go to one of the small coffee shops by the river where he would buy her a cup of real chocolateflavored coffee which she loved so much and which on occasion mysteriously found its way in from the west he regretted not having a picture of her but in those days even the simplest and cheapest east german camera was beyond his means perhaps it was better not to have a photo he sometimes thought better to hold the ideal in the mind where the ravages of time and the vicissitudes of war couldnt sully the dream he became aware of the captain standing beside him placing the green form on his desk the authorization admiral as brodsky unclipped his gold parker pen he pushed the smiling happy image of malle from his mind for all he knew she might be dead but despite his effort to forget he found himself remembering momentarily the color of her eyes ice blue and yet nothing cold about them rather something eternal and her joyous smile even for one of them the russians who had invaded and colonized the baltic states on the heels of the stalinhitler pact it was one of the things he remembered best about her that she didnt care about politics and took each person she met on his or her merits brodsky read over the authorization understanding that handing over the investigation to the mpo would effectively mean handing over any credit for the investigation to them as well fifteen minutes later the captain in charge of mpos border troops estonia arrived at brodskys headquarters though he was dressed in full naval uniform the gate guards immediately recognized him as mpo from his green shoulder boards and gave him a snappy salute the colonel assured the admiral that mpo would get to the bottom of it using the admirals phone without asking the captain vladimir malkov a kapitan pervogo ranga naval captain first classin charge of mpotallinn in turn called the mpos plainclothes section in tallinn which was responsible for protecting the borders against penetration by foreign agents and for preventing unauthorized boat departure by soviet citizens within a half hour captain malkov had a printout of all known informers and suspected counterrevolutionaries dating as far back as those involved in british intelligences operation jungle the list of potential troublemakers in the baltic states was long enough from the years of the cold war but after gorbachev there had been an exponential leap the list quadrupling as the zhdavshikh wait and seeshad become more militant and sure of themselves in their demands for autonomy from the soviet union given the urgency of the task malkov knew there was no possible way of working methodically through the list almost a thousand russian sailors had been killed in the sinking of the yumashev and who knew how many more would die on other ships because they were firing dud instead of live ammunition it called for drastic measures just before dawn twenty greencanvastopped trucks spewing smoky exhaust rumbled into tallinns big mustam√§e apartment complex the polluted yellowing concrete slabs of the tenstory apartment blocks were pricked here and there by dim lights as workers from the night shifts in the shipyards and factories arrived home eager for breakfast after the grueling twelvehour shifts other workers many of them clerical leaving the apartment block for work were stopped by the ring of mpo troops and asked for their work permit as well as their resident identification cards after this they were told to form four ranks stretching from the wide grassy strips between the apartment buildings to the curbside where the drivers of the yellow buses were told to keep going past the stops more mpo navaluniformed troops fanned out quickly into the apartment buildings stationing themselves by elevators and fire escape stairs forbidding any movement from floor to floor as well as from the buildings themselves malkov explained to his subordinates that he had chosen the mustam√§e because the high density was much more manageable from a military and psychological point of view than the sprawling shipyards even so malkov stressed that it was important that the inhabitants of the complex be unable to communicate among themselves within the apartments in apartment in number one complex closest to the road a middleaged and attractive grandmother malle jaakson her only concession to age a pair of glasses looked down at more troops arriving her fifteenyearold grandson edouard jaakson excited by the sight of the troops pouring out of the trucks around the buildings asked nana what are they doing when the youth turned and saw his grandmothers face his boyish thrill gave way to a more mature realization that the troops could only mean trouble he had grown up being taught about the russians their language their history but as well as the official syllabus he had also heard the underground story of the betrayal of and the purges in after more than nine thousand teachers intellectuals journalists and other counterrevolutionaries had been rounded up on the terrible night of june family members literally torn from each other dragged from city and farm alike to the railheads and then to the soviet oblivion east of the urals then the nazis had taken their share of the stalinhitler pact with more than forty thousand estonians forced to join the wermacht by the time the two totalitarians had finished their titanic war a third of all estonians were dead now seeing more trucks arriving the fifteenyearold was reminded of something else passed down from generation to generation of estonians that as terrible as the nazis had been it was the kgb who had inspired the most fear who had been the most barbaric for malle jaakson clutching the boy tightly to her side it was as if estonias nightmarish history had suddenly leapt from the past to terrify the children of those who had already suffered so abominably edouards mother and father had not yet returned home from the shipyards the first thing she must do was to warn them she went to the phone to dial the tallinn docks she would keep calm tell the floor foreman that it was urgent family business a sudden illness the phone was dead perhaps she thought it was only their phone malfunctioning or cut off edouard wait here im going next door she started to turn the handle vernutsya v kvartiru back in your apartment the soldiers voice made her jump in fright and she quickly obeyed inside she closed the door leaning back on it one hand beneath her throat as if she had trouble breathing its a conscript roundup she told edouard her voice shaking i wont leave you nana ill look after no you must hide she held him close to her again and could feel his heart beating but he was still a boy despite his bravery ill be all right he tried to assure her im too young for the no ones too young for them she said no one you must she heard a metallic tapping noise and guessed it must be the sound of the troops metaltipped boots as they ran into the building she could see them disappearing into the various buildings of the complex like ants sucked up by some great anthill edouard broke from her tight embrace looking down at her its the heating vent nana somebodys tapping what the heating vent yes said malle how often her son had complained about a late party from the floor below its sounds vibrating up the shaft yes malle said hopefully quickly go and listen ill watch the door on all fours edouard put his ear close to the vent and waited the tapping began again who is it he asked careful not to give his own name first friida came the tinny reply friida magi the apartment above you friida you remember yes of course replied edouard only now giving his name recognizing her voice though now it was little more man a hoarse whisper they are arresting people who asked malle who had come in quickly from the kitchen nervously casting one eye toward the door its safety chain on the kgb came the incredulous reply no said malle who are they arresting what for god knows but you must try there were echoes of loud knocking coming down the shaft the warning voice ended abruptly the heating vent clanging shut edouard began malle in a panic but not knowing what to tell him nana the cover in the bedroom the plumbers crawl space yes she said hurriedly good boy quickly edouard quickly he turned his excitement vanished now her panic his she saw it in his face and forced herself to calm down steering him to the bathroom go to the toilet first suddenly he had a vision of him being hidden away for days weeks and became even more frightened so that for a few seconds he just stood there over the toilet bowl unable to do anything hurry she urged as he flushed and hurried to his parents bedroom she thrust a small jam jar of apple juice and a wedge of cheese into his hands he was crying they could hear the sound of heavy boots thumping along the hallway quickly she whispered kissing him in one sweeping movement surprising in its litheness for a woman in her fifties she snatched a small vase of dried flowers and its crocheted doily from the main bedrooms low night table next she took from it an ashtray full of coins a comb the family bible belonging to her daughterinlaw and a pair of whitish rubber earplugs sometimes used by her son at the docks in another second edouard was stepping on the night table malle steadying it on the bed trying to push up at the plumbers trap door he couldnt reach it malle quickly handed him one of her slippers this gave edouard the extra reach to shift the trapdoor just enough for a hand hold she gave him a leg up and he was up inside replacing the square plasterboard tile the sound of boots outside ceased but now the voices of soldiers moving from door to door could be heard and voices coming up the heating vent from the apartment below terrifyingly close so that to malle the very air seemed drenched with the stench of fear she relaid the night table careful not to make it too neat then suddenly saw the dusty imprints of the tables legs on the bed cover where she had lifted it for edouard to stand on she brushed it with her hand but the dirt from one of the legs was too ingrained she stripped the bed of the cover threw it in the wicker laundry basket in the corner of the bedroom and rummaged frantically in the bottom drawer of the wardrobe for the stillunused cover shed given her daughterinlaw as a wedding present a colorful patchwork quilt made by relatives of her father in america there was an argument going on next door malle felt weak in the knees exhausted she brought the new cover up over the pillows smacking a crease beneath them falling on the bed pushing herself back up next she walked back to the kitchen and slumped down at the table pushing back a wisp of hair still blond despite her years and her brain racing tried desperately to think what she should do next to protect edouard maybe they werent after conscripts at all perhaps she saw two cups and two plates in the sink she jumped up washed one of each and put them away if they asked if anyone else lived in no they would know who lived in each apartment but one dish and cup might convince them she was alone today she chastised herself told herself to calm down get her story straight shed tell them edouard had left for school but it was too early his bicycle yes his bicycle would have a flat and hed had to leave early to walk to school no he could fix that it had been stolen but shed have to give them its permit number and when they checked downstairs in the racks and found it what about the mustam√§es being surrounded he would have been stopped had he tried to leave no no her grandson was she would use the russian word for conscientioussovestlivy her grandson was conscientious and had left for school earlier than usual she would have to stick with that and not mention the bike she repeated sovestlivy after that she wouldnt know what happened to him perhaps she could suggest he had become frightened hearing police were at his parents apartment that would explain him not arriving at school but thenshe stopped she was galloping too far ahead she told herself one step at a time malle she turned the radio on put the kettle on to boil and scrounged through the pile of newspapers in the kitchen corner pulling out a copy of pravda hesitated replaced it and instead pulled down a worn jaan kross novel kross had been a proud estonian a nationalist the communist party newspaper would be too obvious a ploy to curry favor people subscribed but they didnt read it no proud but not obstructionist grandmother would be her best bet she looked about the apartment again her heart thumping so hard she instinctively put her hand on her bosom to catch her breath she rearranged the old photo of herself as a young conscript graduateradio operator in the baltic fleet in russian uniform that might help she sat down again biting her lip looking about the apartment once more trying to imagine herself as a newcomer there for any possible sign of edouard hiding she heard a police klaxon in the distance the troops were still about the housing complex and she could see several armored cars shed missed before parked under the linden trees ideal camouflage she thought but what of her own camouflage against inquiries about edouard looking beyond the complex she could see the medieval spires of the old town piercing the peaceful autumn air she could smell the odor of herring wafting up through the vent and now she realized no one was talking next door for a moment it was possible to believe that there was no war had they left had the neighbors been taken away she waited there was no sound suddenly she rushed toward the master bedroom and looked up at the trapdoor remembering she had given edouard one of her slippers to push up the cover there might be a smudge of dirt on the plaster cover there was no sign of disturbance as she lowered herself to the kitchen table again the kettle began to whistle it had the force of an informer screaming so heavy was her relief that for a moment she felt drowsy seeing the needle spire of st olavs in the distance steam rising in sharply defined clouds above the dome malle wished for a moment that like her daughterinlaw she could believe in god in the blessed virgin her hands were trembling still she could hear no new noise in the building perhaps it wasnt a conscript raid after all and they had come looking for deserters or to arrest only one family pray it was someone else from somewhere below she could smell cabbage being cooked it surprised her not that someone was cooking vegetables so early but that the smell was so powerful she had long thought her sense of smell was diminishing with age soon she became aware of noises all over the apartment the hum of the small refrigerator and above it a high almost inaudible whine that she did not recall having ever heard before tikhobe still she whispered to herself but she was praying for edouard chapter fourteen rosemarys growing anxiety about visiting young wilkins increased as she entered the antiseptic and musty foyer of the schools old hospital resentful of young wilkins yet obviously expected by the headmaster to be concerned as well as discreet she had found the drive from oxshott through the usually tranquil wooded countryside to be one of mounting tension as if she didnt have enough to worry about with her exhausting daytoday chores of teaching a coed class of adolescents and her mother who not surprisingly was given to bouts of blackest depression over young williams death on top of this there was her own constant and growing anxiety about robert who had departed for holy loch in a rainstorm not unlike this richard spence though fully occupied driving through the torrential rain on the winding narrow road was making reassuring fatherly noises about how the weather was bound to improve seizing upon the weather as a metaphor for general improvement even as the audi was forced to slow more than usual around the curves because of the pelting rain he swerved sharply to avoid a threeton army lorry the first of a long convoy en route to the south coast reminds me of fortyfour d day he said looking across at rosemary hardly said rosemary in an uncharacteristically contentious tone you couldnt have been more than five he would have been old enough said georgina from the backseat having invited herself along for the ride declaring she adored driving in bad weather children remember more than you think freud quite right georgina said richard i was six to be exact but i remember it very well lorries from here to london well i daresay this isnt for d day said rosemary its more like dunkirk there was silence in the car rosemary was sure georgina had merely come along to get a look at wilkins no doubt hed be a wonderful conversation piece another bourgeois victim for a seminar at lse richard said nothing to counter her uncharacteristically badtempered retort about dunkirk besides her gloomy assessment in his view was probably an understatement of the true military situation a military disaster seemed imminent even the most conservative papers including the telegraph not usually given to hyperbole were conceding that the dortmundbielefeld pocket was on the verge of collapse despite what seemed to be a pause in the progress of the soviet divisions it was as if they were gathering their collective breath before launching the death blow to the already badly savaged british army of the rhine the american fifth army and the decimated remnants of the german armored and motorized divisions who had fought a tenacious but losing rearguard action following the communist breakthrough at fulda gap in the strained silence of the car the steady drumming of the rain began to make richard sleepy he turned the radio on to bbc and picked up part of the prime ministers speech at first they thought it was coming direct from downing street but from the desk thumping and hear hears it was obviously being reported directly from the house there were angry questions about failure of intelligence services at home and abroad to predict the communist breakthrough and the extent of communist subversion in both nato and the european common market long before the war had broken out against this labour parry backbenchers and liberals were asking for assurances of individual rights stating that they did not want to see the kind of racialistmotivated internments that had taken place in the dominions during the second world war most noticeably on the canadian west coast once again the prime minister continued in the long but i might add often tenuous history of the democracies democracys fatal flaw in times of war is revealed by the opposition members wellintentioned but i daresay militarily unsound concern there was hooting but the prime minister ignored it to be sure our rights precious to us are the foundation stones upon which all our freedoms reside but now now it is high time for the honorable member to voice as much concern for national security as for individual rights far better there was more jeering in the background far better we err on the side of national security than to lose the fight for our very survival a survival without which individual freedoms cannot flourish a survival which if not secured in the face of the dark and titanic forces ranged against us will plunge all europe and the united states into a totalitarianism a totalitarianism so bereft of all the good we have known so dreadful in its every manifestation that i submit we have no choice but to marshal all the strength we have to suspend some of those rights we normally enjoy to bury all differences we have within the european community to forget all else but our duty to stand fast to resist with every fiber in our being there was a thundering of desks being pounded windbag said rosemary hes getting us ready for a new purge of habeas corpus really rose objected richard wiping condensation from the windshield i hardly think purge is the appropriate word i think it is put in georgina roseys quite right the windbags getting ready for another dunkirk only this time therell be no miracle the russians wont hold back their tanks like hitler did he was too stupid to the americans the americans cut in richard spence with some heat do remember you two this time weve the americans with us this time theyve been in it from the very beginning americans really daddy georgina leaned forward from the backseat with all due respect to your robert rosey who im sure is very capable and daddy rosemarys tone was so imperious he started in fright and almost lost control of the audi as it turned sharply down the hill past a copse of ancient oaks roaring in the tempest about them for gods sake rosey began richard whats the stop the car please she had her hand on the door handle he pumped the brake bringing the car to a standstill on the narrow shoulder of the road through the noise of wind and rain he thought he could hear another convoy approaching alarmed at the prospect of the lefthanddrive american trucks bearing down on him hugging the center line in the storm rosemary had twisted herself around from the left front passengers seat hand clutching the diagonal seat strap face flushed bright with rage as she ordered georgina out of the car what said georgina in astonishment go on yelled rosemary get out richard spence reached over rosey here hang on old girl get out screamed rosemary you sod rose said richard utter disbelief on his face what on earth has gotten into me snapped rosemary turning on him she has this she was sneering at her younger sister in a way the latter had never seen her do this inflated leftsucking bitch shes so consumed by her smart chitchat from lse her obligatory antiamericanism so caring arent you georgina what was your ridiculous thesis on london poor as victims of bourgeois values or some such rubbish rosemary turned back to her father do you realize what your bourgeois money has got you father a nineteenthirties fellow traveler shes so desperate to be in with that brittle intellectual crowd up there shell even insult the man i chose to marry now she was turning on georgina again your type are all the same georgina you love humanity but you hate people the tears were rolling down rosemarys cheeks who are you to she yelled at georgina a man who might not come backthe only man ive ever she stopped scrabbling in her purse for a tissue richard spence was so stunned by her outburst that all he could do was look aghast at his two daughters he didnt know them im sorry rosey said georgina quietly ii shouldnt have said that about the americans i thought you of all people could face facts head on i merely said were being walloped which we are i didnt mean to cast aspersions oh spare me said rosemary her face splotchy from crying trying to unravel tissues from their tight insufferable little balls which werent in her purse after all but hiding as usual in the very depths of her overcoat do spare me the pained reason bit georgina you and your precious feeing facts it might work in most of the provinces but not down here i know you too well when you want to be offensive which is most of the time you sheath your venom in facts youre a bundle of facts rosemary blew her nose hard dimly richard could see a figure running toward them from the direction of st anselms gate which he guessed must be still a few hundred yards off hidden an onslaught of yellowed maple leaves swirling about the figure approaching the car your facts rosemary kept on are gradgrind facts youre full of smart leftist theory while your countrys fighting for its life i suppose you think youre being all very individualistic youre a child you parrot your holy trinity thesis antithesis and synthesis but you wouldnt know a decent human being if you saw one if we lose this war well be invaded and youll get a chance to compare see your rotten little theories in practice i thought you would have seen enough after they tore down the berlin wall oh it was all going to be sweetness and light and look whats happened georgina sat back arms folded defiantly her smile contemptuous why rosemary i always thought you were proud of your selfcontrol you undo me georgina obviously retorted georgina undeterred rosemary shot back tell me why do you hate your country so much does that come with the government scholarship dont be preposterous well you do dont you you despise england i dont know what youre no georgina on second thought i dont think you do the boy a prefect was tapping politely on richard spences window richard wound the window down but rosemary was either oblivious to the feet or didnt care tell me georgina do you love anything richard spence was trying to listen to the boy nodding politely embarrassed beyond measure can you say you love your country georgina georgina was looking out the window now watching the boy walking away well pressed rosemary suddenly georgina turned on her sister are you mad youre raving georgina looked at her father shes insane do you georgina asked rosemary her voice quieter now not england right or wrong or right or left but england georgina sat as far back in her seat as possible finding rosemarys attack of patriotism so sickly sentimental she felt herself blushing with embarrassment it was all so utterly ridiculous yet she felt as if she was about to cry and kept looking outside the car only slightly aware of it moving the prefect running ahead and pointing to the left of the commissary where to park my god ive never been so richard began but was unable to finish so flustered he forgot to depress the hand brake button and pulled the ratchet right through damn he turned angrily to rosemary i dont pretend to know whats going on between you and your sister but if youre not up to it i strongly suggest we turn around right this minute and im all right said rosemary evenly ill talk to him but she didnt move richard glanced at georgina in the rearview mirror i think perhaps you ought to stay with she can come in said rosemary im sure young wilkins could do with some marx i imagine attempted suicides another bourgeois tool to oppress the masses look here said richard firmly georgina sat still refusing to move he opened his door and pushed up the umbrella are you coming georgina the rain was drumming on the umbrella his brogues straddling a puddle as she got out of the car georgina still visibly shaken by rosemarys attack forgot to lock the door rosemary was already shaking her umbrella the headmaster a small stocky man in his late sixties approaching her from the entrance hall i think richard told georgina as rosemary walked ahead shes been under an awful lot of strain shes terrified said georgina i think shes pregnant richard spence stopped abruptly shes with child father and the father is gone like our william has gone and now this williams wilkins corrected richard though still in shock at what she had said his umbrella still up though they were inside the prefect politely offered to take it for him er what oh yes yes of course said richard he felt utterly lost the twentieth century and its sexual revolutions and all its other revolutions had passed him by in surrey it had taken him twenty years to use the word period instead of that time in front of his wife anne everything was falling down about him ms spence it was the headmaster greeting rosemary but in a second making it clear that her father and sister were not exactly welcome how long wondered georgina how long to wait until she was needed if only rosemary knew how much she wanted her love how much she needed love and here was rosemary needed called for the war was a bitter disappointment for georgina it had failed her utterly so far with the entire planet in conflict one was supposed to see the relativity of ones own unimportance to lose oneself and ergo ones problems ones loneliness absorbed by the larger struggle in fact georgina discovered that ones problems were only exacerbated from rationing to unquestioned patriotism like rosemarys the commonality of everyones shared experience only made ones unorthodox views more private making one feel even more of an outsider from ones own family rosemary had touched a raw nerve suggesting georgina couldnt give herself to love only to the love of an idea now georgina herself wondered if her flirtation with marxism was in reality nothing more than an act of sublimation on her part an avoidance of the real problem that she was afraid of men so long as her undergraduate enthusiasm had to wrestle with the pressing attack of hitherto totally alien ideas she didnt have the time to wrestle figuratively or otherwise with sex with her failure to find a man who would fit her ideal someone whose wit was matched by his sexual presence at once alluring yet not chauvinist considerate yet not effeminate an english and american literature graduate down from oxford had almost made the grade in a rare moment as unexpected as rosemarys outburst georgina had let her passion override reason but her tentative nervous foreplay ceased when flustered by not knowing some of the terms he was using but clearly understanding his intent she panicked becoming all superior demanding all but a declaration of her rights from him to which he not yet successful in getting her pants off replied and now the words rang in her ears that what she needed was a feminist with a big cock well youre neither she had shouted back slamming the door despite her parting shot which she harbored as one of her snappier ripostes to male chauvinist vulgarity the adolescence of it all appalled her only reminding her once again that age was no gauge of maturity look at rosemarys outburst but rosemary was engaged it had been the final blow rosemary who had always been thought of as the one least likely to marry lost to a world of shakespeares love sonnets so shy she might have been permanently lost in the forest of arden would you and mr spence like to wait here it was the headmaster diplomatic but making it quite clear that only rosemary had been requested to come and talk some sense into the boy when she entered the commissary room on the second floor the first tiling rosemary saw was a lemoncolored screen for what purpose seeing there was no one else in the room rosemary didnt know inside the screen his mother a pretty darkhaired woman short in her mid forties perhaps mumbled a greeting that expressed both gratitude and resentment then left rosemary alone to talk with the boy the boy rosemary looked down on was not the callow youth of her shakespeare class gone was the smartalecky sneer of the sixth form clown it might have been another boy altogether for though he answered to the physical description the ambulance had given a youth six feet in height black curly hair dark brown eyes the eyes that were once full of rebellion and trouble were now doelike in their shame he had looked at rosemary only once the moment she had opened the door but then had turned away rosemary almost wished for a return of his callow bonhomie of the past months at least there had been some semblance of courage still standing by the bed she was about to soften her rather formal stance and forced smile in order to ask him why he did it and whether or not she could be of help but against this was her impulse to tell him off to scold him for not being brave whatever his problem was pray god he wouldnt tell her to tell him that other young men like her brother like her dead young brother with god knew what fear all around them had shown better mettle than he but either tack seemed pompous and absurd what did she know of the causes behind his attempted suicide what did anyone know of anyone elses inner life anyway the hidden and secret places at once banal and terrorridden so often given in their public semblance to mistaking magnetic north for true and what was true anyhow even the beginnings of such a concrete event as the war now seemed obscure even historians if they survived if anyone survived would only do more to obscure it why did you want to see me she asked wilkins for a second try as she might she could not think of his christian name or as georgina would insist his first name he had only ever been wilkins g she thought gerald he was still staring ahead his eyes avoiding hers his voice that of a whipped puppy i dont know miss he replied she didnt know what to say other than to tell him the headmaster gave her the impression he wanted to see her he sneezed and when he reached from under the sheet for a tissue she saw his bandaged wrists it surprised her for some reason she had expected him to have tried it with pills that was usually the way these days might well have been pills that caused it in the first place her anger with the boy was difficult for her to contain she knew it unworthy of her but here was this callow youth slashing his wrists for attention when young men like william had willingly suffered the slings and arrows of the worst fortune there was yet was it their worst or their best he looked a bit like william she wondered how roberts sister lana had talked to william had she been so cold of course not but then william had fought bravely though even that she didnt know for certain it struck her with some force that she knew very little in feet about how william had been wounded and even less about the circumstances of his time aboard the hospital shiponly that roberts sister had somehow given him the gift of love god forgive me thought rosemary but she wasnt up to gods love for wilkins i wanted to he began then stopped yes she encouraged him its my father yes quickly rosemary tried to recall the student record sheet she remembered two parents were listed father had something to do with marine insurance lloyds no st anselms though respectable enough was a little too middlemiddleclass for lloyds wilkins pulled another tissue from the box wincing as he did so then another and another waste not want not she said parroting one of the department of supply posters paper was especially scarce england no longer having any timber for felling good lord she was as bad as that poor old professor whatsit and his going on about not wasting electric current hand in your hair dryers what about him she asked wilkins then added more gravely your father i mean though already lying practically flat in the bed wilkins pushed his head back farther against the bedstead his feet sliding down under the sheet eyes staring up at the ancient stone ceiling as if his spirit was willing but the body weak rosemary sat awkwardly impatiently and glanced at her watch adjusted it like a bracelet trying not to be rude besides she wasnt going out anywhere that evening and had intended to sit up as late as possible in an effort not to think of her appointment with the family doctor in oxshott in the morning she was pretty sure shed missed her period but couldnt remember exactly when her previous one had begun usually punctual about marking it in her diary she had simply forgotten to note it the last time even so it seemed that it certainly should have begun by now i could come another time when youre feeling better graham the name had suddenly come to her once she realized she was in control of the situation hes not my real dad you see oh i didnt realize is that well of course i know these things do matter but is it enough to what i mean georgina should be here after all thought rosemary it was a job for the psychologists and freudians or jungians or shakespeare i mean does that upset you that he isnt your real natural father no he plucked another tissue and looked up at the ceiling again graham i think youre probably very distressed now please dont misunderstand if youd like another that is i mean if you would like to talk something over with me ill be only too happy to come some other time just tell the headmaster i saw him you see rosemarys stomach turned an extramarital affair she didnt want to hear any sordid details was that why wilkins hadnt wanted his mother there graham im your teacher i think any family affair any family matter is best discussed with the school chaplain if you like id be quite happy to call the boy looked at her now your old mans in the navy isnt he she utterly failed to see the relevance of the question but bristled at old man that was callow wilkins no she said outwardly unfazed my father isnt in the navy no i mean your boyfriend oh she still didnt like the familiarity but now his question at least made more sense wilkins was turning gingerly onto his right side facing her grimacing trying not to put pressure on his right elbow i was wrong he said she noticed he was perspiring about the throat i mean i shouldnt have he continued i got drunk miss and i was well you know under a lot of stress exams and well you know he was under stress it was another modern diseasestudents under stress what he needed was a good swift kick in the backside sometimes when i get drunk i get well a lot of people get depressed graham drink or not she hesitated but then decided it was better she said it but they dont try to kill themselves theres no answer in that it was sherry he said it as if that were explanation enough rosemary said nothing was this the answer hamlet had drunk sherry she was sure now that either the boy was somewhat demented probably as a result of the suicide attempt either that or did you take anything else she asked him well some tablets what kind of tablets i dont know did you tell the doctor this he said they found the bottle hal hal something you mean you just swallow any kind of tablets he looked straight at her his face suffused with anger what would you do he charged if if what she cut in impatiently your old mans a spy intuitively she looked about her graham what are you she caught her breath of course he understood how serious it was then you should tell someone about it i am he was staring wildly at her im telling you she heard voices nearby me but you should tell the police or my mum he said i couldnt its he turned onto his back and slid down farther into the bed all the color seemed to be draining from his face graham this is a very serious accusation youre telling me he said and in a hoarse voice which had been caused by the stomach pump tube he spoke to her and seemed older wearier than she i want you to tell them he said she rose holding her head with one hand vaguely aware of clutching her purse with the other i she stopped drinking at first the voices were next door but then seeing it was near pm she realized it was time for prep in the classrooms below where is your father now stepfather he reminded her hes in southampton today a wicked cynical grin the kind shed seen in class before twisted the curve of his mouth port comings and goings you see rosemary lowered her voice graham ive seen the brown envelopes he said you know ohms on his majestys service nicked from some government offices i expect makes it look all official like if they were dropped and somebody picked them up accidentally full of cash theyre in a box at home i know where he hides it all she was staring down at him aghast at the enormity of what he was telling her a man selling port schedules tonnages departures of the nato convoys to enemy agents it was unthinkable that an englishman and now everything came into focus the newspapers reporting as much as they were able the in camera trials of four spies caught in the past month some even said the surprise breaching of the fulda gap had been aided and abetted by wellorganized and pervasive sabotage behind the nato lines the spetsnaz russian commandos which the americans called special forceshaving been sold defense plans by east german spies who had come through to the west in the flood following the opening of the berlin wall i thought continued wilkins his throat so dry he could barely talk that with your old man miss being in the navy and all and well i wanted to tell someone in turmoil but not wanting to panic the boy she marshaled all the calm that was her teachers stock in trade not letting the class the world see inside unflappable rosemary in georginas absence keeping the sheer terror of what such betrayal could mean to thousands of british and american seamen on the convoys bottled up inside her she touched wilkins gently on the shoulder i think its pointless of me to say dont worry of course i know how you must feel but graham you mustnt mention this to anyone until ive talked to the authorities dont tell anyone until ive come back youll come tomorrow he asked please he was like a child again yes ill come back tomorrow before she left she asked him about his mother about how it was possible that mum never asks where money comes from wilkins cut in she thinks i hate him anyway do you he was reaching toward the mobile tray across the bed for the paper cup of water rosemary passed it to him hes not my dad he said not really rosemary looked back at him her hand on the door are you sure of what youve told me that its not simply your dislike of your hes not my father i can show them the money everything but youll have to hurry miss he could be home by morning rosemary felt her stomach tightening again all right ill ill attend to it immediately i promise ill come back tomorrow miss yes his eyes met hers in a look that was unmistakably sexual she was shocked and flattered by the time rosemary rejoined georgina her father and the headmaster it was still raining the wind continuing its mournful wail in the sodden oaks that surrounded the school with the blackout curtains drawn the schools lights seemed strangely dimmer and more depressing than usual graciously brushing the headmasters apology aside rosemary told him she was glad he had called their feet crunching on the wet gravel as they walked toward the wolsley she apologized to georgina and her father for her thoroughly foul mood all right rose said richard were all under stress these days im afraid yes said rosemary we are georgina said she didnt want to intrude but did rosemary think the wilkins boy would try it again i dont think so said rosemary it was she turned around in the darkness the dim reflections of the slit headlights not enough to illuminate their faces for which rosemary was glad it made her confession easier you were right georgina i think he does have what i suppose you would call a crush on me though i blush to admit it what asked richard spence at his age hes almost seventeen daddy said rosemary richard mumbled his disapproval but rosemary barely heard him she had far more to worry about than dealing with a schoolboys infatuation in the backseat so dark that the lights of the audis dash seemed faroff pinpricks of light georgina tried to imagine what had transpired in the boys room slipping her shoes off crossing one foot over the other and stretching so that her stocking feet were pressing hard on the padded foot bar she laid her head back on the soft imitation learner reveling in its smell depressing the door lock her left hand gripping the strap she slipped her right hand beneath her black pleated skirt and with the steady hum of the windshield wipers rhythm in the background closed her eyes in the darkness dreamily she heard rosemary asking their father how late the oxshott police station stayed open at night robert brentwood knew something the navy never mentioned to the public not even to the enlisted submariners that the incidence of men going insane because of depth charge attack was the highest of any group in the armed services the crackup following depth charge attacks was not always a sudden madness a single snapping of nerve but more a gradual unraveling like a tight ball of gut slowly but irrevocably undone strung out until its ability to spring back was permanently impaired it made him grateful for though puzzled by the number of depth charges that the roosevelts sensors had picked up splashing off the cruiser but which had failed to explode had the russians military passion for quantity overwhelming quality meant that much of their ordnance was highly unreliable if so brentwood knew he should get the information to washington as soon as possible but the roosevelt could not send a message if it was sunk he would have to get to holy loch or had there simply been a miscalculation in the setting of the fuses which would testify to the efficacy of roosevelts silent running confusing the cruisers sonar chapter fifteen although he was no longer in the navy or even on the reserve list adm john brentwood retired felt that his job as one of the managing directors of the new york port authority inextricably linked him with two of his three sons and his daughter the connection with his son robert on the roosevelt was obvious to anyone familiar with the us navys rollover policy this sea lift of men and materiel to reinforce western europe depended heavily on both the daytoday administration of the us home ports as well as on the protection afforded the convoys by submarines like the roosevelt it was not a glamorous job at the port authority not much media coverage it was visual all right with the scores of ships passing through but once youd shot that the real bureaucratic work of the port authority disappeared into overcrowded offices and banks of computers spewing out availability of loading cranes tonnage union liaison status boards availability of docks tide changes and the other thousands of seagoing craft that had to be kept clear of the convoymarshaling areas where everything from condoms and microchips to yeast sugar and howitzer shells had to be crated stored counted loaded and transported as fast and efficiently as possible while at the same time taking care to vary the departure times and convoy routes as much as possible to confuse any enemy sub packs lying in wait in the deep atlantic trenches off the eastern seaboard it wasnt glamorous work for john brentwood and his staff their responsibilities disproportionate to the pay and the virtual lack of recognition yet for every dozen ships they managed to load and send off without a hitch one mistake could make the news and if the navy censor cut the story it would quickly get around the docks anyway making the port authority a butt of more jokes about bureaucratic inefficiency one ship the mv nagata a fiftythousandton combo or multipurpose oilbulk cargocontainer vessel its bridge and stack in a stern housing and coowned by a japaneseus conglomerate was a case in point the ship left new york harbor as part of convoy on the night of october bound for antwerp thirtytwo hours and miles later the nagata was off new england while maintaining radio transmission silence she received word from aclant allied command atlantic that russian and east german divisions thrusting west from hanover and wheeling on osnabruck had driven a wedge between the westernmost perimeter of the dortmundbielefeld pocket and the ports of amsterdam rotterdam and antwerp while the ports had not yet surrendered it was believed this would only be a matter of time so that now the convoys would have to head to ostend seventy miles farmer west on the belgian coast to dunkirk twentyseven miles farther south just over the belgianfrench border or to calais another thirtyodd miles southwest of dunkirk by this time the mv nagata was no longer over the relatively shallow georges bank but had passed over the divide between the continental shelf and the continental slope and was now over the continental rise in two hours she had passed from water no more than five hundred feet deep to the ninethousandfoot depths of heezen canyon while their sudden passage from shallow to deep water beneath them was unknown to most of the crew on the bridge the watch knew their silence palpable as they waited anxiously to reach the more powerful current of the gulf stream this would aid the thirtyship convoy as it passed over the undersea mountains that lay before the sohm abyssal plain where the greatest danger was a submarine that could be lying undetected for weeks even since before the war started sonar pulses from any convoy escort vessel looking for subs scattered by the natural obstruction of the undersea mountains before joining convoy the nagata had hauled electronics and assorted containerized cargo from japan to the united states but on this trip it was carrying replacement ninethousandpoundthrust ge turbofan engines and other spare parts for the closesupport a thunderbolt antitank aircraft together with a million rounds of thirtymillimeter ammunition for the thunderbolts multibarrel gau cannon in addition its cargo consisted of five hundred mk electrooptically guided bombs and in several drymaintained holds bulk goods and foodstuffs from condoms and toilet paper to bread mix flour yeast sugar and freezedried combat rations as well as dispersing such cargo throughout the entire convoy so that if one ship was hit the entire stock of any one item would not be lost great care had been taken by john brentwood and his staff with the loading of the bombs and ammunition on each ship wherever possible the bymeter containers of bombs and ammunition had been placed either side of the nagatas center line the containers sides almost flush with her gunwales some lowflashpoint bunker c oil as well as highly flammable jet fuel was being carried in wing tanks and tanks at both ends of the segmented cargo space oil tanks nearest the stern were well insulated by cofferdams or doublewatertight bulkheads against the possibility of fire spreading from engine and pump rooms the nagatas problems began as convoy began encountering increasingly rough seas off newfoundland a small fissure had developed at the bottom of the nagatas five and six bulk cargo tanks on the starboard side abaft the starboard beam though seawater was coming through and none of the crew could see how long it had been flowing in it wasnt viewed by the captain as a major problem as the pumps were easily handling it however because of the warm dry air being continuously circulated throughout the dry bulk cargo tanks and other storage areas to keep dry everything from electronics and ammunition to yeast a massive oven effect had been created part of the fissure in the hull having penetrated the starboard walls as well as the bottom of tanks five and six containing sugar and yeast it was a disaster that any housewife might have predicted but which the new york port authority beset by a multitude of other problems had not surprisingly overlooked by am enough of the huge tanks of damp sugar and yeast had combined in the dry warm air to create enormous pressures and by the time the bridge sensed the buckling of the plates under the pressure within the tightly sealed tanks it was too late the longitudinal steel stiffeners reinforcing both the inside and outside plates retained their integrity but the seams were stressed beyond their limit soon highpressure pipes burst and there was a low whoomp from down below in the engine room the needles of the explosimeters or gaspressure gauges for tanks five six and now tank four buckling under the abnormally high back pressure of tanks five and six moved into the red then in the pitch darkness there was a sound like a rocket taking off but no flame as one of the butterworth fuel tank covers whistled high into the night and everything began shuddering the nagata listing hard astarboard its four tank developing a deck blister on the starboard side of the ship shes about to blow the starboard lookout informed the master her weights shifting like a beanbag the fuel tank didnt blow but its seams gave way the high octane spewing into the sea the captain could do little for like most of the big combo carriers which relied on shorebased suction pipes for loading and unloading bulk cargo the nagata had derricks only midships and at the forecastle and these were surrounded by stacked and lashed containers helpless to do anything about the mountain of yeast and sugar now growing like some enormous amoeba or vast cake overspilling its pan shifting the ships center of gravity dangerously all he could do was try to vent some of the bunker c and more of the octane to compensate for the starboard list twenty minutes later at the nagatas master gave orders for his crew of thirty to abandon ship and refusing to break radio silence alerted the convoy leader by signal lamp allowing only one repeat of his sos and then opening all cocks he scuttled his ship rather than run the risk of leaving her afloat as a halfsunken hazard to the other convoys en route to and from fortress europe in obeisance to the ancient and unwritten law of the sea and the traditional precepts of the japanese code of honor he remained aboard after seeing all his men safely off in the beaufort rafts and went down with his ship the loss in equipment was enormous for while there were other spare parts for the a thunderbolts in the convoy the nagata had been carrying the lions share of a replacements engines ammunition bombs and electronic boards enough to have reequipped seventy of the tankkilling thunderbolts which coming in low at four hundred miles an hour often no more than two hundred feet above the ground and loaded with six and a half tons of bombs with threesecond bpsm best possible safety margin had proven critical in slowing the soviet surge through the fulda gap although they had managed to take out only two thousand russian tanks a third of the soviet force the thunderbolts held a special place in the affections of the half million men in the british army of the rhine the american fifth and the german twelfth though the nato soldiers had been pushed back almost a hundred miles from the prewar nato soviet line and though they were fighting for their lives in one of the fiercest combats ever recorded in modern history they owed what life they had to the bravery of the thunderbolt pilots and the astonishing maneuverability of an aircraft which swooping down with its two highmounted rear engines could absorb the kind of punishment that would have downed the supersonics on the first pass the loss of the nagata was a hard lesson for everyone from john brentwood at the new york port authority to the naval planners in norfolk virginia reams of new instructions regarding the loading of mixed cargo were issued along with an order to all nato and associated merchant marine ships that ships masters were not required to die with their ship captains like pilots were in short supply the consequence of this order would be a spread of what ironically became known as the nagata defense in courtsmartial where it was charged ships could have been saved had the captain and crew remained it was an argument the counsel for the defense planned to use in the ongoing inquiry into the sinking of the fast guidedmissile frigate uss blaine off korea ray brentwood however refused to consider it arguing that this defense would require him admitting that he gave the order to abandon ship when in fact he said that to his recollection he had not the defense counsel once again had to resume the task of trying to find a witness who would corroborate ray brentwoods stand it was thought at least six other men including the ood who thought hed been given the order were on the bridge when the north korean missile had hit but three of them had been killed outright two dying later of burns to percent of their bodies the remaining sailor and ensign mahler was still fighting for his life in honolulus veterans hospital having been judged too ill to be flown on to la jollas veterans burn unit another outcome of the nagata incident was that despite the heroic efforts of the convoys the frontline soldiers though representing only onetenth of the total force nine out of ten men required to support one soldier at the front could no longer be guaranteed the regulation six pounds of food per man per day and much of the bread the western armies would be eating from now on would be flat the loss of the nagata also meant that the dortmundbielefeld pocket would shrink further without the vital resupply for the tankkilling as the other lesson from convoy was a reminder to all nato commanders that any man guilty of selfinflicted wounds would not only be courtmartialed but his next of kin would forfeit receipt of all military pensions the rule of course was already on the books of natos armies but it was the most diplomatic way that aclant could think of conveying to their japanese allies that choosing death rather than withdrawal or a surrender was not in the defensive interest of the allied cause the more enemy troops that the allies could tie up with either delaying tactics or surrender the better the difficulty of getting this message across however was compounded by the fact that following a failed counterattack by the german second army and the american first against the soviets southern flank ninety miles west of prague american and west german prisoners of war had been summarily executed by the stasithe supposedly disbanded secret police of what was formerly east germany many of its members still working for moscow chapter sixteen in the darkness of the drop all david brentwood remembered was lining up when the green go light came on the steady shuffle to the hercules rear the dark incline of the rampdoor disappearing into the vast blackness of the night the master sergeant smacked him on the shoulder then the jump tearing air so cold he couldnt breathe and coming up toward them graceful arcs of red and green tracer crisscrossing with unhurried fluidity the surrounding darkness was so black that though he knew his five hundred comrades must be all around him they were invisible for the first thirty seconds then he spotted several figures momentarily silhouetted in flashes of antiaircraft fire some slumped like small toy soldiers dead in their harness the air was rocking violently with aa shells exploding the acrid smell of the cordite reminding david not so much of war as of the fourth of july the fumes of the antiaircraft explosions together with the pungency of burning rubber tires from several of the airbornes humvee trucks threatened to overcome brentwood as he neared the ground his legs flailing the air in panic lest he hit stifflimbed with his eightypound pack before he could take the roll suddenly flares illuminated a field below the burntout hulk of a barn dead horses strewn about the dark plum gash of a cow ripped open its head missing and off to the left short sharp stabs of bluishwhite machinegun fire the sound of the battle increased to a crescendo at times then fell off smallarms fire heard in the pauses between the screams and crash of artillery and heavy millimeter mortars coming in from the outer fringes of the dortmundbielefeld pocket here the american airborne instead of having landed within the designated drop zone in the northeastern sector of the pocket were caught by a sudden shift in the crosswind which swept most of them beyond the perimeter into the very barrage of the british and german batteries that were supposed to have given them covering fire though david brentwood didnt know it then over men had been lost in the first three minutes of landing caught in the deadly cross fire of a polish motorized company the irony was too grim to bear the drop zone having been selected because intelligence overflights had confirmed that this sector in the northeasternmost bulge of the pocket no more than five miles across was up against the polish sixth motorized rifle division the intelligence experts pointed out that the poles though supposedly once loyal members of the old warsaw pact were in the main staunchly catholic detested the russians and would either desert en masse or at the very worst offer only token resistance and quickly surrender to allied forces such intelligence estimates proved disastrously wrong on two counts no matter what the poles thought no matter how catholic they were how much they liked america and americans they and their cities were being pounded by the nato bombers that had managed to penetrate the soviet defense line which now ran like a jagged cut bisecting western germany swinging off to the southwest where the soviet advance along the danube and north to munich had been the deepest and no one had to tell david brentwood after his stint in general freemans celebrated raid on the capital of north korea barely two months before that when you are being bombed and strafed you make no distinction between friendly and hostile fire in addition to this western intelligence did not know that the sixth polish mr division quite apart from wanting to protect its own skin from the allied bombers counterattacks had another much stronger incentive the soviet military police who shot deserters or malingerers on the spot it was a policy that the russians had prepared years ago during the gody prostakov sucker yearsof the gorbachev revolution which had swept the dizzy west off its feet there was another inducement for the poles to fight well this was called semeynoe pobuzhdeniefamily persuasion inspired in part by beijings successful policy of through which people were encouraged to turn in counterrevolutionaries in their own family the soviet refinement was to take a family member usually the very young or the elderly for antifascist war work in eastern poland this way the russians had it both ways the relatives would work in the factories producing everything from electronic print boards for the flybywire soviet jets to biologicalchemical weapons including the manufacture of tabun and the other vx gasses a drop of vx paralyzed in seconds producing involuntary defecation and vomiting the polish workers also served another function if any of the polish armed forces lost ground relatives would be hanged shooting was too expensive wasting precious rounds that could be put to better use on the front if the polish and other eastern european civilian workers the hungarians were the worst in moscows viewsabotaged anything then the gru simply reversed the policy and shot their kin who were serving in the armed forces on the advice of brig kiril marchenko adviser to the stavka general headquarters of the vgk the soviet supreme high command as well as to the politburo the next of kin in the armed forces selected to be punished were taken from administrative divisions wherever possible and not from the frontline spearheads it was a policy however that was not working well in lithuania latvia or estonia the three baltic states where the populations were so small that hostages could not be sent back to russia proper without severely weakening the already overextended civilian labor force most of whom were forced to work in the shipyards and munitions factories of riga and tallinn but david brentwood knew none of the politics behind the polish motorized division and indeed had never heard of general kiril marchenko or his tactics all he knew and was grateful for was a soft landing in what felt like a marsh his knees and right thigh sodden as he rose quickly unclicking the harness and going into the prone position he tucked his chin in close to the v of his kevlar flak jacket beneath the kevlar helmet his web harness distributing the weight about his torso unlike his world war ii forebears who had so often found themselves weighed down below the waist by their packs of ammunition grenades canteen entrenching tool and sidearm pulling the squad automatic weapon or saw back along his right side he felt for the plastic protector at the end of the barrel and instinctively checked with his right elbow whether his sidearm was in position it was a ritual he had followed ever since korea when he had seen one mans mudimpacted weapon blow up in his face inflicting wounds that were worse than those suffered by his brother ray during the north korean missile boats attack on the blaine david a veteran after his drop and fighting withdrawal in the hitandrun raid on pyongyang also carried an unofficial sidearm a sawnoff fivecartridge pumpaction shotgun in a closed swivelmounted canvas holster on his left side waiting for the next flare to get his bearings he tried to listen through the crescendo of noise for the clinking sound of any of his buddies landing nearby there was a burst of fire off somewhere to his right sounding like the tearing of linoleum a light machine gun but allied or soviet there was no way of telling it was all so ufu unbelievably fucked up then he heard the pop like a champagne cork a flare climbing unhurriedly to its apogee its harsh metallic glare casting a ghostly flickering light a hundred yards across from experience he avoided watching the dark serrated perimeter where the flickering light could resemble the shapes of everything from a tank to a charging platoon to a machinegun nest when there wasnt anything there instead careful not to move he froze in the prone position watching the center of the everdecreasing circle of light now that the flare was falling and saw with fright a patch of greasy brown only six feet from him a wriggle of barbed wire across it a body american or russian perhaps british the rolling thunder of approaching artillery shells told him that he was in the line of a creeping barrage his throat was bonedry and hed already urinated from fear now he quickly looked about for any sign of his company and friend thelman who had gone through parris island and camp lejeune with him there was no sign of them only the dark mush hed seen seconds earlier and which he now knew had been a mans face the uniform that of a russian spets commando the outfit that had already been in place throughout western europe and had played havoc with the nato depots the moment war had broken out he saw what looked like the mans finger a couple of feet away but the hands seemed intact all the fingers still there then he realized what the finger was jesus jesus he thought he saw something move between the mans legs or what was left of them where an ooze of intestine had spread over where the mans testicles had been the movement brentwood had seen was a cluster of leeches so fat they seemed like slugs in the flares dying light yank he swung the squad weapon around to his right could see nothing and then could feel the rain of hot earth coming down on him as the american millimeter highexplosive barrage kept coming he heard a man scream nearby but was too busy huddling beside the corpse using it as protection to know where the voice had come from aware only that if someone didnt quickly stop the american shelling hed be as dead as the maggotinfested corpse filling his nostrils with the putrefaction of death the scream hed heard seemed not far away but it was impossible to tell in the barrage and david drew himself up into the fetal position not wishing to see anything the next barrage so close he could feel the earth leaping about him and he wondered if both he and the voice he had heard would be killed or if they survived who would kill whom the falling dirt was so thick now it drummed down on his helmet and cascaded like hot sand over his bronze goggles which were designed to protect him from harmful ultraviolet rays like were going for a fucking suntan his buddy thelman had said when they had been in training at parris island and then at jump school at camp lejeune where the hell was thelman anyhow david was getting mad at him thelman had only been two in front of him oh melissa he murmured clutching the squad weapon calling to his girl back home wondering if hed ever see her again despite the rubberized earplugs his ears were ringing so loudly from the shelling he couldnt tell whether it had ceased or not but no earth was falling thank god someone had gotten through to the us artillery unit firing the howitzers then the star shells started flares with parachutes lit up an area a quarter mile wide but all david could see was the pockmarked field as desolate as the moons surface he couldnt tell from which direction the star shells had been fired from polish or american artillery he thought he heard something scrabbling behind him it slowed to a crawl david swung quietly away from the corpse but found hed slithered down a slight depression slippery with the dead mans blood there was a tremendous explosion in the air one of the drop transports a fighter he didnt know he couldnt stop thinking about the russians pecker being blown off like that now in the star shells light he could see that beyond the pockmarked field by the edge of a wood inert bodies some of them still strapped to their chutes lay strewn about one with only one arm and one leg the wind was shifting again the dead mans chute ballooning dragging his remains across the battlefield behind david about a hundred yards away there was a shout he knew only that it wasnt english the next sound was unmistakable bayonets being clipped on christ theyd told him the bayonet was used nowadays only for opening cans and for ceremonial parades still holding his saw in his left hand he felt down for the parachute knife hail mary he whispered but couldnt think of the rest of it thelman knew the rest of it he was catholic he knew it where the hell was he david heard the slushing sound of boots about sixty maybe seventy yards behind him advancing poles he was sure theyd be poles they knew the hail mary too thelman you bastard whispered david whatever happened the man whod called out to him earlier would have to show his colors there might be some joy in that sweet jesus it sounded like a whole company was moving chapter seventeen mpo captain malkov had ordered a roundup of all informers including those listed in the gru files he was surprised the informers were not helpful it wasnt that they didnt want to be but apparently they knew nothing they could be forced to talk of course but then all you got was rubbish an informer would tell you it was the bishop or his grandmother behind the munitions sabotage in order to save his own skin whoever was behind the nerazorvavshiesya dudrockets and shells being sent to the yumashevand who knew how many other ships had planned it very carefully as the duplicated serial numbers attested to malkov also suspected that several heretofore helpful informants had gone mute after being bitten by the bug of baltic nationalism that had broken out ever since baba gorbachevauntie gorbachevand his stupid liberalization policy watching the swarm of gulls over tallinns number three dock the birds diving and rising above the giant gray gantries screeching so loudly that his driver did not hear him telling him to stop malkov marveled at the principle of internal organization that must be in operation to prevent the birds from colliding with one another malkovs small twocylinder car was flanked by four armored personnel carriers this much force he knew might not be necessary but better to arrive with too much man too little nothing focused the mind more effectively than a machine gun for some the stocky brutish build of the captain and his rough informality were enough to make them feel intimidated the joke on the docks being that malkov had been chosen for his looks more than for his brains others said that becoming an mop chief made you look like that anyway the simple fact that malkovs car stopped ten yards farther on than he had intended meant that a dirtyboilersuited riveter his huge riveting gun slung over his shoulder like a small silver lamb as he headed toward the tool shed and his apprentice who walked with him were selected as hostages rather than two other men farther back who were just coming on shift the captains maritime troops had already sealed off the docks and he had ordered two paukclass patrol corvettes to pry the harbor fifty meters offshore in the event that anyone trying to evade questioning might attempt to swim farther down the docks when the workers all but of them men had been assembled the captain mounted a weatherworn dais used for new launches from the tallinn yard the gulls were increasing in number as more fish boats came in from the gulf the birds screeching now so loud the captain was obliged to ask an nco to fetch a megaphone from one of the armored personnel carriers forming themselves in a semicircle around the workers a row of troops from the apcs flanked the dais near the edge of the wharf where crates of ordnance were awaiting shipment i will be brief said the captain sabotage has been committed against the soviet navy the navy which protects your children from imperialist aggression he heard someone in the crowd making a guttural coughing noise getting ready to spit i want information malkov told them switching from russian to fluent estonian now i should tell you we have mustam√§e apartments surrounded there was a murmur a sudden shift in the crowd the captains inference was clear come here the captain ordered the riveter and his apprentice reluctantly a marine trooper pushing them with his rifle the two men walked up the four steps to the dais the apprentice stepping over a puddle from the rainfall dumped by an early morning shower that had washed the air so clean that for a while the rusting polluted aspect of the docks had taken on a clean sparkly look it was all illusion the riveter looked at the captain defiantly the apprentice tried to do likewise but was clearly afraid that if he did so he would be shot on the spot the first choice of hostages said malkov indicating the two men has been from the docks future hostages will be taken from mustam√§e he looked at the sullen crowd of workers his eyes seeming to take in every stare and turn it back on itself i will be in the dockyard office with that he walked down the four steps of the dais and passing through the flank of troopers nodded to the nco handing him back the megaphone his car started up and a volley of shots rang out blowing the riveter and apprentice off the dais the crowd of workers were stunned surged angrily then under a long burst of machinegun fire from the armored personnel carriers stopped yelling and screaming at the russian troops their voices mingling with the screeching of the gulls several of which had also been hit by the machinegun bursts their lifeless bodies tumbling down through the gantries here and there feathers fluttered like bloodied snow eventually to fall softly on the windruffled harbor at mustam√§e they were already loading the trucks now that the lists of whose family lived where had arrived from the docks priority in the roundup was being given to teenagers as malkov knew from his experience as an mop officer in riga that the elderly were not worth the trouble they were easier to round up at the beginning but prone to die on you in the cells which only stiffened resistance among the workers rather than weakened it younger hostages were by far the best bet an mpo corporal returned to apartment on his copy of the list it said family jaakson when she opened the door the woman malle jaakson remarkably well preserved for her age he thought was wearing spectacles and had a book in her hand you told us the corporal said glancing down at his clipboard that edouard jaakson was at school he isnt the mpo corporal said either the woman had been telling the truth and the boy had left for school early then hopped it or he was in the apartment the corporal brushed past her through to the small ninebynine living room his head turning his concentration absolute as he checked the four small rooms of the apartment another hitler malle thought she had been gripping the book so tightly she could feel her fingers going numb from the lack of circulation the corporal stopped and looked back long and hard at her she blushed the mans eyes were not accusing but rather roving over her trim figure ill defined beneath a loosefitting rustred cardigan but obviously more alluring to him for that instinctively she pulled the cardigan closed about her as if to shut out his view immediately she realized it had been the wrong thing to do as if she were in fact showing herself off even worse it might occur to him that she was trying to divert his attention but then if she could divert his attention would you like some coffee real coffee the corporal asked his surprise total like most of the troops he was clearly fed up with drinking the bitter ersatz stuff made from barley and chicory no she said im sorry i dont care for the artificial kind either but i have some tea i imagine you must be tired you could do with a cup i expect yes he said thank you mrs jaakson she smiled nervously as she picked up the kettle is that a ukrainian accent i detect she asked as if she liked it you can tell though she had not turned around from the gas stove she sensed from his tone that he was pleased she could feel him relax as if the very air had changed and heard him unbuckle his webbed belt as he sat down at the table filling the kettle she could see outside that the troopers were still surrounding the building some trucks packed with civilians leaving and others empty arriving but even the line of soldiers seemed more relaxed their circle around the apartments sagging in places confident now that no one had gotten out who shouldnt have you been posted in tallinn for long she said lightly turning up the gas the stoves yellowishblue circle of fire hissing softly comfortingly in tallinn he said a year i like it you can buy more things here not so good now of course no she said reaching for the tea and spooning it out carefully into the pot she thought she heard a noise possibly from the bedroom and feeling herself stiffen with alarm rather than let him see her reaction took her time replacing the lid on the tea jar and putting it back on the shelf above the gas ring she heard the noise again and quickly turned the tap full on topping up the kettle though it was already halffull not daring to look at him for fear he might see the alarm in her eyes you have a family she asked concentrating on the kettle yes said the corporal ive been married now for three four years my wifes name is raza the noise sounded again like the rustle of a curtain you must miss your family i have no children but yes i miss my wife yes when she turned to face him she gasped almost dropping the kettle his erection purple swollen and rising like some huge fat earthworm the most disgusting thing she had ever seen he nodded toward the bedroom with a crooked grin ill take the boy off the list he said she was transfixed i dont care if hes joined the lesnye bortsy za svobodu he said meaning the forest freedom fighters or with relatives whatever ill take him off the list he paused but you must be nice like you enjoy it yes stunned malle lifted the kettle which was so heavy it splashed almost extinguishing the gas ring making a loud steaming noise i cant hear you he said chapter eighteen through the mist the silence after the shelling screamed its presence the pounding of the heavy guns having pummeled eardrums so badly that only the high tones were left their ringing so intense that the sound of the dawn birds song was lost to david brentwood as he lay muscles aching his whole body tense hands still gripping the squad automatic weapon his eyes adjusting to the bronze dawn of his goggles until he took them off the glare of the suninfused mist was hurtful to his eyes but now at least brentwood had a wider field of vision across the cratered landscape which he remembered from the aerial reconnaissance photos had once been a meadow backed by a wood of lombardy poplar the wood was now gutted the few remaining poplars blackened and splintered leaning at impossible angles looking like burned christmas trees leaves that had no doubt once flickered gold in the autumn sun now gone one of the starkly naked trees that remained reminding him of the gaunt lynching trees hed seen in old movies stripped of foliage charred only one leaf still defiantly attached a hundred yards from him it was on this leaf that he focused at once amazed and buoyed by its resilience against all odds or was it less resilience and more sheer luck there was a flash to his right sun on steel he swung the saw up and around its burst driving the butt hard into his thigh the gun now silenced squashed into the mud and guts of the corpse next to him the long razorsharp blade of a knife at his throat motioning him up the russian if he was russian in a long black zippedup jumpsuit and black balaclava frightening the hell out of him the mans eyes almost impossible to see and his hot sour breath on brentwoods face up he told brentwood cmon quickly the ease of the mans english its purely american sound devoid of any foreign accent was the next thing david noticed the craters were now alive with the black figures moving forward he counted at least fifty of them as he was hurriedly taken back toward russian lines escorted by relay stumbling dizzily at first his muscles still tight from the trauma of the shelling a quarter mile farther on he passed over more heavily cratered ground littered with the rotting corpses of what had been the american airborne whole bodies the exception limbs savagely amputated by the millimeter shrapnel from friendly fire stomachs literally blown apart unrecognizable organs and intestines were scattered all over the battlefield in various hues of decomposition some invisible in the mud except when revealed as a moving mound of maggots others surrounded by crows pecking almost disinterestedly waddling like ducks so gorged they were too heavy to fly and over it all the revolting burntchicken smell of death but for all the horror worse than anything hed seen during freemans raid on pyongyang in korea the thing that struck david most was the catlike grace with which the blacksuited russian commandos moved up and over the deep craters taking no notice of the human detritus about them or if they did not showing the slightest sign pausing only at the butchered chunks that still had heads attached or stopping where a severed head lay encrusted with mud bending down removing the airbornes dog tags which were sometimes still attached to the neck or pressed into the mush that had been a face now and then he saw one of the black jumpsuits pause raising his hand moments later with a clutch of id tags a runner one of the poles brought up from the support battalions would dash up grab the tags from the russian and then head back to the russian battalions headquarters in a thick stand of pine where david now sat silent with the other twohundredodd prisoners a few british but most of them forlorn remnants of the disastrous airborne drop it was only after they took his own dog tags that he realized why he hadnt been killed on the spot a very fit nononsense englishspeaking russian nco in army greatcoat ordered them to remove their uniforms walking behind him was a private his arms festooned with wire coat hangers one for every prisoner and a small plastic garbage bag for personal effects a british private peeling off his brownandgreensplash combat tunic with the british army of the rhine shoulder patch offered david a cigarette david normally didnt smoke but he took it the englishman a cockney brushed a sprig of sticky pine from his sleeve dont want em all messy do we david looked puzzled when they cut your throat said the cockney makes a mess of the uniform david nodded his ears were still ringing so that the englishmans voice seemed to come from a long way off and as if he were talking underwater putting the cigarette in his mouth still dry from fear he reached over to steady the cockneys hand as the englishman flicked his lighter but david found his hand was no steadier both of them trembling david was surprised how good the tobacco tasted he took a piece of the loose weed from the tip of his tongue and flicked it to the ground couldve he began but his throat was so parched he had to begin again and only now as he took off his trousers to put on the hanger did he realize his thigh was wet not so much from the blood of the corpse against which hed cringed during the barrage but also from water that had leaked from his punctured canteen the bullet had penetrated halfway up the canteen he took a sip from what was left offering the rest to the englishman could have strangled us though said david taken our uniforms there and then why march us back nah mate you shit yourself then see if they strangle you have to wash your duds out no they want em persil white the englishman paused reminds me of when i was a kid im no fool i use persil on my tool he shook his head forcing a grin and put out his hand to the american fred waites the name david brentwood schweig doch shut up shouted one of the guards a stasi from his redgoldblack shoulder patch walking toward them on the soft brown needles of dead pine and coming from a command truck that was only now visible to david through the camouflage netting schweig dock the german repeated and david saw the shadows of others guards in the nearby pines looking over at them bit late now fritz said waite it was clear that it wasnt only their talking but the apparent friendship between the american and englishman which annoyed the guard it was as he had been told the british and americans had no respect for authority from waites response he appeared to think the two prisoners hadnt understood his order and so switched to english and gesticulations his english broken and not at all like that of the sleek fluent jumpsuits the first of whom were now returning after their quick foray into the crater zone where polish contingents were taking up positions digging in there is to be no talking already said the guard david saw the guard was about his age maybe a few years older midtwenties his eyes tired but awake with suspicion waite sitting on his haunches leaned forward arms protruding from the poncho that apart from their regulation khaki underwear was all the halfnaked prisoners had to keep them warm he held up his hand like a schoolboy asking permission ja said the guard listen fritz whats going on my name is not this fritz what is it then your name asshole called out someone from the twenty or so pows in a clump that was being guarded near one of the elevenman russian armored personnel carriers who said this demanded the stasi swinging about what is this name its an expression of endearment said one of the british army of the rhine shivering in the cold under his poncho yeah put in one of the americans next to him especially in san francisco there was a round of laughter some of the british in another group opposite david and the cockney clapping their appreciation the young guard redfaced unslung his akm right hand snapping back the sidewaysfolding metal butt and stepped to within a foot of the twenty or so prisoners it is strictly forbidden to to be abusing socialist soldiers already stop fucking around it was one of the black jumpsuits a bunch of dog tags in his hands in german he curtly told the guard to check if any of the prisoners still had their id tags no one said anything the jumpsuit officer a man of at least six feet lean and wirylooking was one of the toughest men david had ever seen as the guard snapped to attention and immediately began checking everyones neck for dog tags the officer unzipped and removed his boiler suit folding it with such dexterity it was clear to the nato prisoners of war that it wasnt the first time hed done it someone murmured something about a strip tease but the weak ripple of laughter quickly died he was standing in a wellworn uniform of an american airborne lieutenant complete with dog tags they get caught doing that murmured waite theyll be shot as spies maybe agreed david but ill tell you something ted fred well fred would you think of pulling up a lieutenant for his id the cockney finishing his cigarette pulled out another and lit it from the first suppose not old cock jesus theyre gonna cause one hell of a lot of confusion if they get inside the pocket nothing to getting inside it said david everythings screwed up inside there anyway units split up some of our guys inside most of us dropped outside they wont be checking id these bastardsll get through all right waite nodded afraid youre right mate he paused cigarette held meditatively down in front of his knees theyre after bloody munster he turned to brentwood his tone infused with the urgency of delayed revelation thats it yank david theyre after bloody munster our prepo site christ mate waite was feeling beneath his poncho for his cigarettes forgetting he had one on the go they blow that depot itll be a fucking slaughter unless our guys can get out first said david evacuate where to asked waite fidgeting with his lighter no fucking dunkirk this time matey boats waiting last i heard was they got fucking armored all round us getting ready for a big push they are west of hannover right down to the fucking rhine and on to bumsum he meant brunssun south in belgium where the german operating out of headquarters dug deep in the coal mines and once we start crossing the rhine waite added itll be absolute tucking chaos sitting ducks thats what our lot will be maybe not if the evacuations orderly said david waite turned to brentwood his movement revealing white bony legs like those of some overgrown chicken orderly no such fucking thing davey boy itll be a ballsup they could hear artillery rumbling like thunder southwest of them from about twenty miles inside the pocket doesnt have to be a mess said david adding ive been in a pullout where asked waite his tone that of an incredulous senior talking to a freshman pyongyang waite raised an eyebrow you were with freeman yeah freeman well me old son hats off you should know what was it like getting out then david didnt answer the remembrance of the bloody retreat so vivid in his memory that for the last twentyfour hours from the moment hed hit the hercules slipstream it had overwhelmed him the reason he hadnt moved from beyond the crater curled up against the protective carcass of the dead man waite was probably right when they had got out of pyongyang there had been only fifteen hundred men to think of and while it had gone much better than expected theyd lost a lot going in trying to get out a quarter million men trapped in the pocket by a ring of steel would be a different proposition altogether what had his father always told the three of them lana too when the going gets tough it was old hat but it made him feel ashamed of his recent loss of nerve least it wont be an air withdrawal he told waite well have the bridges what asked waite and david brentwood knew instantly from the cockneys tone that some of the bridges must be blown how many he asked waite who was now watching the stasi guard shouting at a man in another group of prisoners for his dog tags what how many bridges blown it was another mans voice also a cockney sitting behind them an eye partially covered with a bloodcongealed bandage the compress having slipped down on the mans cheek revealing a pusfilled gash beneath the blackred swelling all of em mate right waite the whole fucking lot marvelous int said waite as they watched the other russians coming in taking off their jumpsuits and looping the appropriate british or american dog tags about their necks the stasi guard was handing one of the russians who was wearing a us army corporals uniform with a machine gunners flash patch a st christopher medal which the guard apparently thought was part of the americans id there were guffaws from the prisoners and barely suppressed laughter from some of the russians then the tall russian wearing the american airborne lieutenants uniform quietly walked over to the young guard took the st christopher medal and put it on then concluded david were going to have to swim across if all the damn bridges are blown they could hear the artillery soviet or american they couldnt tell increasing wake indicated the stasi guards stationed around the edges of the pine wood dont know whether youve noticed me old dallin but those kraut goons ave got a nasty habit of shooting people my advice old cock is to sit tight for the duration youve done your bit sides this lots only going to last a couple more months then someones gonna threaten to push the big one and thats going to get em to the table waite glanced back at his wounded comrade that right bill ope so said bill his pallor like chalk his arm which he could hardly lift making an unsuccessful attempt to keep the bloated flies away from his eye i dont think so said david slowly his gaze held captive by the curling twist of cigarette smoke disappearing into the mist that now shrouded the pines about the russians mobile headquarters no one wants to use nuclear weapons theyll use up everything else first he flicked the cigarette away the tiny red ember dying in the mud anyway no wars finished when it was supposed to experts always get it wrong after the second war everyone said the next would be so hightech so mobile itd be over in no time hell were bogged down in that pocket worse than he glanced across at waite you know world war two wasnt anything like as mobile as all the films make out soldiers dig in soon as they can then others try to root them out same old story look at our fighters they cant break through to russia and the russians cant break through to england were in the middle i heard bayonets last night yeah said the englishman with the bloodied eye patch so did i the poles said waite ivans put in someone else shit our sergeant told us bayonets were for museums and can openers no one would ever use them again to will you guys knock it off came a voice from the back talking about the friggin war talk about women or something for christs sake what id like now is a good lay the russians were ready to go in all sixtytwo had captured allied uniforms the one in the american airborne lieutenants uniform was doing a lastminute check to see that none of the uniforms was too illfitting making several men swap because sleeves were too short pants too tight anything about the uniform that might draw undue attention was being weeded out next he passed an american airborne kevlar helmet along the line to collect their watches followed by another in which prisoners watches had been collected each man doublechecking that there was nothing engraved on the watches that might arouse suspicion if they were questioned after being infiltrated behind enemy lines we have to escape said brentwood quietly soon you daft asked waite youve got no chance besides why bust your gut mate youve done your bit no i havent thought brentwood if hed done his bit he wouldnt have lain petrified most of the night he would have moved down the lines risking the deadly albeit friendly fire trying to get through to the pocket or had it been just common sense to stay put till the shelling was over after all no one would blame him for what hed done no one that is except himself the man whod won the silver star for bravery at pyongyang his father certainly wouldnt forgive him something had happened since pyongyang strange hed always thought you could divide people into the brave and the not so brave but an awful possibility began gnawing away at him that it might just be how you felt on any given day but there was another reason beyond honor beyond regaining his sense of selfesteem that impelled him to think of escape weve all seen it he told waite hes right said the man behind them who having lain down was now propping himself up trying to keep the head bandage on grimacing in pain as the effects of the last morphine jab wore off now we know what theyre up to theyre not going to let us he didnt have to finish it christ said someone else brentwood looked behind him it was a british lance corporal terrified hey wait a minute i mean they could have done us already right david shook his head not before they got our uniforms waites right that would have got our uniforms all messy aw bullshit said another cockney they arent going to shoot us why asked waite well too too fucking close to the front mate might draw a chopper strike the young german guard and the other guards began to raus them getting everyone ready to move out where are we going demanded a british officer from a group on the other side of the clearing charing cross came a scottish voice one of the stasi guards an older man waved them to their feet with his hand the german had a weary look about him that worried david more than it might have comforted him it was the look of a man whod seen it all before a man for whom nothing would be a surprise a man who would follow orders to the letter not because he hated americans or british but because it was the easiest thing to do you will be taken back the german said in passable english for the interrogation see whispered a cockney triumphantly were going to be interrogated thats all oh lovely responded waite thats just ducky that is i love being interrogated my favorite fucking pastime that is eh brentwood i can think of better things to do answered david so can i said the soldier with the bloodied eye his voice tremulous with fear jesus i cant see where the hell im here said david getting up hold on to my arm as the bedraggled column of ponchoclad prisoners started off through the gloomy wood the wounded cockney asked his american friend what he thought their chances were watch it said david steering him around a jagged stump that was almost invisible in the mistshrouded pines what do you think waitey the man asked waitey pressed the soldier david steering him about a long ghostlike branch that stripped of its bark had served as a toilet seat for the cesspool trench i think said waite were in for the high jump what the hells that mean asked one of the americans it means said a scottish voice he thinks theyre going to hang us laddie or shoot us jesus jesus thats against the geneva convention the scot finished for him aye anybody got a mars bar asked an english sapper whod been captured two nights earlier by a stasi patrol sweeping the pockets perimeter och said the scot rot your teeth laddie and thas a fact youre mad said the american youre all goddam mad it helps answered waite wryly adding be careful now he nodded toward the young guard theyd dubbed asshole but for now the guard wasnt saying anything looking as miserable as the prisoners even so david was surprised they had let the prisoners talk at all not when they were all supposed to be going to be interrogated he remembered his di at parris island screaming at them never fucking let your prisoners talk why marine because the fuckersll make up the same fucking story are you listening brenda brentwood yes sir you listening thelma david smiled at the memory of the di yelling at him and thelman something david had once thought it would be impossible to smile about besides he told himself the russians had probably already collected fairly reliable intelligence about the american british and german armies bottled up in the pocket hell they were right there to pick up the airborne or had they just been in the area anyway try as he might however david could not help thinking of one of the great secrets of world war ii the massacre of thousands of polish prisoners of war slaughtered by the russians deep in katyn forest leave it on the corporal told malle she reclipped her brassiere the way hed said it only added to her sense of shame as if shed been caught wanting to exhibit herself and he doing her a favor a small mercy telling her to cover herself up but now she guessed his real reason was the thick raised scar of the mastectomy where they had taken off her left breast at once she feared for edouard hoping in spite of the revulsion she felt for the russian that the scar hadnt turned him off tossing his cap onto the bedside table obscuring the photo of malle and her late husband and pulling off his shining black boots dropping them with a thud motioning for her to come closer and smiling as one would coax a shy frightened puppy he patted the bed dragging the two pillows down so they lay flat on the multicolored quilt come on malle youve done this before eh she was shocked at his use of her first name and for a moment stood holding her black slip protectively in front of her suddenly frozen as she smelled the strong odor of camphor no she decided of course he wouldnt wonder about the new quilt lots of people used camphor to protect their clothing you should call me mitya he told her reaching out hooking the slips spaghetti shoulder straps taking it away from her its short for dimitri she forced a smile walking haltingly toward him her left hand in his it was sweaty and warm cloying her other hand fidgeting at her throat his grip became stronger as he pulled her closer she fixed her eyes on the crazy pattern of the quilt vibrant reds flowing into deep blues men orange and speckled brown swirls that made no sense and which normally pleasing to the eye now panicked her everything swirling out of control she braced herself he became suddenly angry releasing her whats the matter with you you want me to pick up the boy i can you know all i have to no no she said no im im sorry you forgot something he said his tone surly i she began hands on her forehead her head shaking trying to think of what it was im sorry i all right he said sitting up from his slouch grabbing for a boot obviously about to stalk out in a mad huff quickly she sat down on the bed beside him her hand touching his shoulder what did i forget please the corporal stared hard at her his tone still angry undershot with petulance my name oh mitya yes of course im sorry i forgot he hesitated for a moment the muscles in his face and neck so taut that his face took on a knotted yet strangely adolescent expression its very important you call me mitya she understood now her saying mitya would make it all right she could feel his whole body relax except his member which now looked so big she knew it would split her make her bleed its a nice name malle said kiss me first he said then pushed her away as her face neared his no he instructed her there she hesitated felt him tensing angrily again and so quickly closing her eyes she bent her head between his legs he fell back onto the bed bumping the headboard but of this he was oblivious his groan of pleasure filling the room she almost gagged mokree wetter he ordered her much wetter now his arms folded from him like wings his hands grasping both sides of the bed the quilt sliding beneath him above them somewhere there was a noise a rustling sound what his eyes opened they were glassy he looked idiotlike whats that he began malle lifted her head brushing her hair away nastily the heating vent she gasped do you want me to stop mitya what no no swonderful her lips encased him again her tongue pressing curling and darting her saliva in danger of drying up driving herself on frantically to keep him under the spell i love you he said his breath panting i love you raza raza then just when she thought it would be over he told her to stop kneel astride him pushing her shifting her as one would a piece of furniture for the best effect telling her to sit on him pulling her forward until her brassiere was so close he could smell the perfume of violets mixing with the musky cinnamon odor of herself his eyes were closed raza she heard another noise like a scrabbling above her and she rose then drove herself down upon him harder and harder until he was in a reverie his head lolling then whipping from side to side his tobaccostained teeth plainly visible his mouth open like an ugly fish eyes halfclosed the idiot expression becoming more pronounced so that it seemed his eyes were going to roll back into his head his grip on the crazy quilt so powerful he was now holding it up either side of them like the sides of a canoe his wrist veins bluish in sharp contrast to his pale white skin he was trying to talk but it only came out as a series of short gurgling noises and grunts then the quilt sides fell from his hands his body arched arms locked about her pulling her down hard against him his body smacking her hard as spasm after spasm racked him his crying like a child running terrified from some huge beast but the cries of ecstasy eager to get off malle felt him pulling her back and he kissed her tenderly on the earlobes stroked her hair whispering how wonderful she was how beautiful his voice cracked and dry did you come of course not she wanted to scream yes she said he knew she was lying but it didnt matter his breathing slower now he pushed her away gently asking her to bring him a towel when she returned she had a housecoat on and he avoided looking at her as wrapping the towel about him he walked unsteadily toward the bathroom put on some coffee he said closing the door as malle turned on the gas the blue ring became a blurred circle and she used her sleeve to wipe away the tears she must get control of herself mustnt make him feel as if hed forced her for he could still turn on her but what choice had she had she asked herself turning the hot water tap full on it was only lukewarm she rinsed her mouth out again and again for a moment in the bedroom when she had felt she couldnt bear doing it she had thought of her husband as the only way of getting through it now the guilt of sordid betrayal weighed so heavily on her she felt she could never look anyone in the face again she heard a surge of radio static it so alarmed her she swallowed and swung about realizing it was only the corporals walkietalkie unhurriedly he pulled on his boots turned down the squelch button on the walkietalkie and rising from the edge of the bed picked up his cap from the bedside table she thought she heard some mention of the tallinn docks the corporal glanced at his watch as he slipped it on his wrist then clipped the walkietalkie onto his belt the apartments are to be kept under surveillance he said adding apologetically i cant stay for coffee we have to go to the docks oh she tried to sound convincing thats too bad he was out in the kitchen now pulling on his tunic looking smart repositioning his cap in front of the small hall stand mirror the green caps green ribbon in gold lettering reading infantry of the border troops never mind he said opening the front door and smiling back at her ill come by tomorrow in moscow there had been snow flurries all morning giving the air a bluishwhite tinge with a wind coming down from the lenin hills making eyes water and noses run inside the politburo chamber all fourteen members and their aides present the air was warm it was too much so for premier suzlov as he found not yet halfway through the meeting that his sinuses were plugging up the minister of war was in favor of releasing twentyfive far eastern divisions to be entrained at once from all points west of ulanude near the mongolian border two thousand miles away and if japan enters asked kiril marchenko japan is already in it said the minister of war suspecting though not saying it that because one of marchenkos sons sergei had now qualified for fighter service and was based in ulanude in the transbaikal his father wanted to keep him out of it the minister rejected the suspicion however as quickly as it had come in a moment of pique whatever else the marchenkos were they were not cowards sergeis gallantry during the bloody breakout at fulda was evidence of that for this he had been awarded the order of lenin the soviets highest award for bravery nevertheless the minister was confused by marchenkos comment about the japanese it was as if they still had something up their sleeve yes they do answered marchenko they are throwing in their lot with america but are not yet fully committed their defense forces are at americas disposal but only in a support role so far and in defense of our bombing attacks on their ports i assure you gentlemen said marchenko looking down the long green baize table toward suzlov that tokyo is nowhere near fully committed my estimate and it is supported i should add by the commander in chief eastern tvd is that they might yet throw in all their ground naval and air forces if they see the gate to their north unguarded that is why i will vote against the motion rubbish retorted the minister of war beijing wouldnt let the japanese walk into manchuria the chinese navy would sink them before they got across the straits it wasnt manchuria i was thinking of said marchenko pointedly i am talking of our raw materials ore oilour far eastern holdings oh replied the minister of war and what do you think our pacific fleet will be doing nothing kiril marchenko pulled another marlboro from his pack taking his time to light it premier suzlov appeared to be doodling not paying attention but marchenko believed he was listening intently the far eastern fleet will be attacking the japanese said marchenko shifting the gold dunhill lighter close to the packet of cigarettes exactly comrade said the minister of war sitting back relieved exactly so therefore why do we need so many divisions on the and the taiwanese put in marchenko our fleet will have to deal with the taiwanese the minister of war shook his head no my friend taipei hates the japanese as much as the mainland chinese do and not just because japan and taiwan have been competitors in the capitalist system no it goes back much farther than that i know said marchenko the minister of war was enveloped by the cloud of smoke from the american cigarette kiril he said slowly leaning forward short stubby fingers clasped on the baize my good friend tokyo will never team up with taipei to try for manchuria or for our raw materials in the east it would be the guarantee of a future war between them splitting the spoils you know how these capitalists are i disagree responded marchenko tokyo will team up with the devil to get more materials war or no war together with germany she is the powerhouse of the west but her stockpiles for all her cunning are limited minister oil from the middle east cheap coal from canada bauxite from australia it must all come by sea and marchenko looked about quickly but intensely at everyone at the table making sure the premier was alert to his point and all of it must come a long way thousands of miles by sea he shook his head knowingly and blew out a long stream of grayish smoke she is overextended my friends i agree that for the moment at least a taiwanese attack on manchuria is not likely our intelligence confirms that us president mayne has warned taiwan not to do anything against china as long as china doesnt attack the us attack the us asked the minister for war where china is five thousand miles from by sending chinese troops across the yalu put in marchenko into korea korea is stabilized now after the freeman airborne attack opened it up for the americans to counterattack the americans dont want any escalation of war in asia then you are arguing against yourself charged the minister of war there is no danger of taiwan attacking and if japan makes a move against our far east flank first they will have to contend with our fleet of submarines and surface warships out of vladivostok very good answered marchenko but i think they might try for sakhalin island its rich in raw materials you will recall that the japanese called it karafuto until we took it away from them at the end of world war two it is less than a hundred miles from hokkaido they could be there before our fleet way down in vladivostok knew about it and even if vladivostok did find out our fleet could never catch them in time i cant think of a more opportune time for them to move while we are preoccupied in europe suzlov stopped doodling looking up to see whether kiril marchenkos thesis had surprised the rest of the stavka as much as it had him it had we would annihilate them said the minister of war confidently marchenko leaned forward from across the table and offered the minister a marlboro the minister accepted it smiling but nonplussed all the same then said marchenko lighting the cigarette for him you will need soldiers there was a silence invaded only by the intermittent clanking noise somewhere in the air ventilation system marchenko holding his cigarette in the western manner unlike the minister for war indicated the strategic map of the ussr across from them it covered the entire wall eleven time zones its sheer vastness impressive even on paper the war minister and everyone else at the table knew full well that once the far eastern divisions were raided for manpower and entrained westward itself a logistical nightmare the far eastern borders would be irrevocably weakened apart from japan there were the chinese there were always the chinese one point two billion of them at your back door remember cautioned marchenko when chairman khrushchev threatened mao over damansky island he told mao we could invade china at a moments notice a press of the button and you will have a million dead to which the great helmsman replied a million less to feed you would drown in our blood then what are we to do the war minister asked marchenko irritably about the nato front we are sending in spets now put in the minister responsible for special forces comrade marchenko suggested we try further attacks behind their lines to take pressure off marshal kirovs forces while they are being regrouped and refitted for the final attack on the dortmundbielefeld pocket and how do the spets get there asked the general for logistics and supply they will walk in said marchenko shifting his gaze west from siberia to western europe in british and american uniforms the allies arent fools said the minister of war theyll catch on to that soon enough of course conceded marchenko but how long do you think it will take them minister hannover is sending in spets even as we talk where the american airborne were dropped asked a brigadier general marchenko turned making sure he would remember the face the man was quick yes said marchenko exactly i expect said the minister of war his tone tinged with sarcasm nato will get onto it within a week and then theyll refuse to take any of our forces prisoner in retaliation a week said kiril smiling broadly his cigarette jutting out from both hands which were clasped in front of him as he smiled positively buoyed by the ministers assessment a week we estimate only three days minister we only need one decent raid on the monster depot at munster and the whole pocket will be down to eating rats and using slingshots within a week if put in the admiral for the northern fleet the convoys resupply them will they kirils speed in turning the admirals question into a demand almost an accusation against the admiral took everyone by surprise suzlov was watching the admiral intently ii dont think so replied the navy chief clearly rattled but trying to rise quickly to the occasion we have a new strategy also we have been ah gathering much better reports on shipping movements in and out of the english ports our intelligence agent networks in england are working extremely well the more accurate the departure and arrival times what ships are due where the better chance we will have of sending in low air strikes across the english channel to specific targets chop them up before they can even scramble their fighters good said kiril its imperative that we strike at both ends of the problem at the convoys and at the pocket in a month predicted the admiral their rollover convoys will have rolled flat and sunk there was hearty laughter much of it released from the tension between marchenko and the minister for war nevertheless suzlov wanted to know what made the admiral so confident such promises he knew were not made idly the man who said no one could reach red square without him knowing it was quickly replaced after the young west german rust had landed on red square in a light aircraft the plan for the convoys is classified for your eyes only mr premier it was the only answer the admiral could have given but it aroused the curiosity of the other armed services so much that suzlov decided to hear it along with the others if he could not trust the stavka members he could trust no one besides he was first and foremost a politician he knew that a plan shared was responsibility shared but when the admiral bared the plan from naval intelligence before them suzlov dearly wished he had kept his mouth shut he would have preferred all the glory himself it was a plan so stunning in its simplicity so terrible for the americans if it succeeded that suzlov knew it would win the war why have we not implemented this sooner he demanded timing mr premier all the instruments were there but the players must perform under a single baton orchestrated otherwise we lose the initiative suzlov nodded his assent yes of course you are right when may i expect results marchenko was struck by suzlovs use of i instead of we a politician to his boot nails thought marchenko suzlov in an instant could take credit for something that others had been planning for so long and it occurred to marchenko that the admiral was almost as ambitious as he as marchenko walked out to his black zil limousine after the meeting one of suzlovs other aides caught up with marchenko his questioning about japan so transparently having come from suzlov that marchenko could not stop smiling what do you think japan will do comrade marchenko continue to play a passive role theres hardly anything passive in japanese antiaircraft fire captain no no of course not comrade i merely meant do you think she will commit herself more deeply its a world war comrade said marchenko his smile vanished you are either in it or you will soon be gobbled up some are suggesting that japan has lost her aggressiveness not in commerce of course but militarily why are you so worried about japan asked marchenko looking up at the dull autumn sky do you have stocks on the tokyo exchange the aide was genuinely shocked certainly not but what the aide decided not to pussyfoot any longer and let marchenko be so rude as to suggest that he an aide to the supreme soviet would be so guilty as to hold stocks in the what the premier wishes to know said the aide tartly is whether you think japan wants war or will simply sit it out as best she can as an ally of the americans marchenko made a face that said who can tell yet he felt sorry for the aide besides there was no sense in making enemies in a war that would see many dead and many promoted had he himself not risen meteorically since the outbreak of the war marchenko put his arm around the aides shoulders comrade i was only joking of course about the tokyo exchange but to answer your question seriously i would have to say that after hiroshima and nagasaki the japanese people will be reluctant to commit themselves to anything like war on this scale they will prefer to leave it to the americans who after all began it with their aggression in south korea and wait for us to finish it ultimately we must win you see for all their gadgetry here marchenko wiggled his fingers in caution and mind i do not underestimate their technology it is quite frankly the best but the americans do not have the staying power they have not lost twenty million dead as we did in the great patriotic war this puts iron in the blood he offered the aide a marlboro it was eagerly accepted the aide putting it in his pocket for future use then said the aide although you wish us to be on the safe side to keep our far eastern forces on alert you do not think japan will go much beyond her supporting role no said marchenko i dont think she will before his chauffeur closed the door marchenko handed the aide the packet of cigarettes in case he was wrong like marchenko many other strategic experts throughout the world had pondered the matter believing themselves to have thought of every conceivable scenario and coming to much the same conclusion that japan would be americas handmaiden but not much more another expert though completely unknown at this time was tadanabu ito a graduate student recently arrived at washington state university as part of the exchange plan from wasada university in japan he held two japanese baccalaureate degrees one in the field of macro or largescale economics the other in plate tectonics or the study of the shifting of the suboceanic plates upon which the continents rest ito had submitted the first draft of a phd thesis on the subject at washington state university but was told by his adviser that his english while it might have squeaked through the bsc and msc level was simply not up to par for the phd ito was so despondent discovering how when you cant speak or use the language fluently people automatically assume youre not as smart as they are that he didnt realize he was the only person in the world who in his thesis was predicting exactly what would happen vis√°vis japan it was only a short chapter in his thesis almost a footnote and like a dream one has forgotten and only remembers later he wasnt yet aware that he was in possession of one of the most important hypotheses in history one that would directly affect the lives of david brentwood trapped in the dortmundbielefeld pocket his sister in the faroff aleutian islands and robert brentwood and his crew in many of the same ways that it would affect the more than thirty million men and women in arms in the worst war in history in northwest germany miles north of the squaremile dortmundbielefeld pocket a crack regiment of soviet spets commandos began to advance under the protective barrage that had kept the illdropped american airborne pinned down in the northern sector of the pocket in the early morning mist that clung to the waterways of lower saxony and in particular along the mittelell canal held by the soviet th motorized division and th armored the spets were being sent in to take advantage of the earlier gains made by the th motorized and elements of the soviets th and ui armored divisions the soviet tanks though they had punched a ninetymile corridor northwest toward the pocket through the american ms and the german leopards were now due for refit and resupply before the massive and what moscow hoped would be the final assault by fifty divisions in all it would pit a million russian troops against the twohundredthousandodd beleaguered nato troops in the pocket who would first be pounded by simultaneous soviet artillery and rocket barrages all along the now choppedup snake line that had formerly been natos central and southern fronts the hundreds of spets and other underground cells that had infiltrated the west during the east german rush through the wire or rather through the gaps in the wire that had been cut by the hungarians in had already carried out highly successful sabotage raids on the railway marshaling yards throughout western germany as well as hitting four of the huge prepo storage sites dotted about the central region including two outside gottingen and fulda which had contained many of the central fronts military vehicles and nuclear warheads for millimeter and millimeter artillery but not all of natos depots had been gutted in the early hours and weeks of the war and the troops in the dortmundbielefeld pocket were drawing on the deep underground reserve dumps of ammunition from around munster situated more or less in the middle of the kidneyshaped squaremile pocket soviet and east german bombers could not penetrate the nato air screen thrown up around avianosets angliya carrier englandwhere though exhausted by sometimes more than seven sorties a day pilots of the raf usaf and german luftwaffe forming natos second allied tactical air force continued to go up against the swarms of migescorted backfire and badgerc bombers the soviet fighters carrying kitchen and kingfish airtosurface missiles despite their pilots fatigue and a crash rate of percent which didnt sound like much to the layman at home but which meant that after just ten sorties you had only a fiftyfifty chance of coming back alive the nato air force commanders deep in the b√∂rfink bunker before it was overrun had kept the soviets at bay in the air what the hq of second tactical air force now in the south at ramstein wanted and what the uk royal air force command in high wycombe prayed for was foul weather while this would complicate the already insufficient supply lines across the english channel including the floating oil pipeline nato preferred it because of the experience of the american pilots who had fought off soviet interceptors in the night skies and bad weather during general freemans raid on pyongyang the american pilots including frank shirer had confirmed a longheld nato article of faith when it came to instrument flying with all visuals ruled out american british and german fighters could outstrip their russian counterparts even during the daytime dogfights over northwestern germany and over the area still held by nato in the south around mannheim and heidelberg the nato fighters particularly british and german tornadoes and american fs and falcons were outclassing the opposition the problem was that the opposition had more planes and more pilots an advantage of three to one in aircraft two to one in pilots it was a situation worsened by the spectacular success of the soviet divisions in southern germany which had so badly mauled the fourth allied tactical air force spets attacks having penetrated as far as bitburg where fortyseven of the seventytwo fs based there were destroyed on the ground by activated spets groups who had easily infiltrated the sea of refugees fleeing westward from the soviet juggernaut in hannover northeast of the dortmundbielefeld pocket the concern of the sovietwarsaw pact was how to crush the pocket before nato convoys could hope to replace what had been lost on the battlefields of germany for the soviet military accountants and logistical wizards in berlins subterranean headquarters the problem was never calculated in terms of pain of lives lost because already the human face had become obscured beneath the wrap of high technology modern technology contrary to public opinion had not made killing any less barbaric the twisted metal of modern munitions wreaking as much hacking and butchering as any of the barbaric wars of old one of the advances in technology was bullets so heavy yet so small made of depleted uranium and of such velocity that upon impact they could vaporize a mans head in the way a piece of shell might have in the great artillery barrages of the first and second world wars for the hq computer staffs however divisions were rectangles moved about on the computer screens not a torso torn asunder where arms and legs or stomachs simply disappeared and where carrion crows grew fat on the spilt innards of soldiers nor did the statisticians deal with the effect on morale of supersonic fighter attacks or laserguided antitank rockets of the unimaginable nightmare of a cluster bomb bursting bombs within bombs within bombs releasing needlesharp shrapnel nor did the statisticians deal with the overwhelming sweet stench of dead flesh that greased the treads of the tanks and apcs as men drove until they were exhausted or their fuel had been expended many of them becoming nothing more than whimpering shadows of their former selves their eyes bright with madness from hightech stress levels beyond bearing in the berlin bunkers where the state had long held precedence over the individual the soviet military statisticians many of them women saw none of this their job to coldly dispassionately estimate allied losses and a timetable for allied resupply bad weather to them was neutral perhaps it would make the convoy safer harder to find by visual means on the other hand the low mist and rolling fog banks of late fall could impede attack and aid defense on the land for now it was the matter of the convoys that supreme soviet commander marshal leonid kroptkin was concentrating upon so long as the nato fighter screen held over western europe nato supply lines through france and through austria if vienna threw in its lot with the nato forces would sustain the dortmundbielefeld pocket and if supplies kept coming the pocket could expand into counterattack and so the top priority for moscow and berlin was to stop the convoys now heading for the french ports from dunkirk to calais in the north to as far southwest as dieppe saintmalo and cherbourg as long as this situation holds the soviet western theater of operations c in c reported we have not won the war it was not only the allied submarineescorted convoys that the marshal worried about but the allied capacity to airdrop supplies into the pocket if the nato convoys succeeded in bringing in enough men and materiel to the ports what the russian commander wanted was massive reinforcements from the east preceded by an awesome artillery barrage of a thousand guns of the kind that had finally destroyed the wermacht and swallowed up berlin over fifty years ago his losses had been staggering the allies exacting a terrible price over russians killed while punching the hole through the fulda gap and almost soviet troops wounded there is talk of reserves coming up from yugoslavia marshal his aide a colonel reminded him pointing on the wall to the alpine border between northern yugoslavia and southern austria through the ljubljana gap and yes there is talk said the marshal there is always a lot of talk colonel and what if austria does not come over to us and permit the yugoslavs to pass through i think they will yes now said the marshal if it looks as if we are winning he turned to the huge threedimensional contour table map his hand sweeping down over southern germany to austria no my friend the austrians are stuffing themselves full of pastries eyes darting like parrots west to east waiting their friends are whoever wins no one can wait for the austrians the yugoslavs could simply push their way through whether austria liked it or not proffered the aide the marshal was bending over the contour map his finger tracing the long fold of the danube valley eastward to the conjunction of czechoslovakia and austria i thought you went to officers school you should know better than to indulge in such speculation if the yugoslavs come in they will first have to get through the ljubljana gap if they are to be any use to us a dispatch rider goggles and uniform splattered in mud came in saluted and handed the marshal a list of the latest positions of the retreating dutch forces in westphalia north of the ruhr the marshal nodded and told the rider to give the report to his logistics aide the colonel though distracted for a moment by the sight of the dispatch rider in a room buzzing and crackling with stateoftheart electronic communications returned to the subject of possible reinforcements confronting natos southern flank even if the italians attacked on our southern flank i doubt whether they could stop the yugoslavs marshal the ambitious colonel pressed on perhaps not replied the marshal his right hand alternately opening and closing to a fist leaving a finger pointing at the ljubljana pass but the yugoslavs might stop themselves with serbs versus croats in any case colonel by the time the yugoslavs reach southern germany the dortmundbielefeld pocket could have expanded no what we need are more troops and quickly so that we can annihilate nato his arms swept across the dortmundbielefeld pocket before they can catch their breath we need to destroy their convoys and we need more men youre thinking proffered the colonel of the far east divisions the marshall nodded in the far eastern military theater the soviet union ever wary of the longstanding and often bitter border disputes with chinas one point four billion and indias eight hundred million maintained over fifty divisions almost a million men fifteen thousand tanks sixteen thousand artillery and mortar pieces and more than fifteen hundred tactical aircraft i have already requested them said the marshal whether i get them is another matter im sure youll get what you need marshal said the colonel optimistically why is it the marshal asked no one in particular running thick stubby hands through thinning white hair as he looked at the redflagged bulge on the wall map that marked the disposition of the soviet armies deep penetration of germany that the young are so incurably optimistic a soldier brought the marshals tea is it continued the marshal picking up the hard cube of sugar because they have no history or is it because they have not seen the defeats he raised the glass of tea sucking the hot steaming liquid through the cube of sugar until it disintegrated in a crunch of tobaccostained teeth i think it is because they have not smelled war the marshal answered himself until this moment the colonel had thought he had very much been in the war but the marshals voice utterly devoid of sentimentality hard in its every estimate conveyed to him the sudden truth that up till now what he had thought was war had only been war behind the front lines in the relative comfort of albeit makeshift headquarters in the ancient german capitals suddenly the colonel felt he needed the comfort of knowing that more men were coming that thousands would come to aid them so as to crush the british american and germans in one decisive stroke to bury all uncertainty marshal yes sir this is meant as no criticism but i was wondering if it might not be more efficient if we carried out all dispositionofforces information by radio phone rather than by dispatch rider youre worried about our gasoline supply for the armor eh well so am i our supply line is overextended and i realized that every drop no sir i meant wouldnt it be faster better to rely on our electronics rather than faster said the marshal of course but better he grimaced but there was also the hint of a smile i dont think so the colonel was flabbergasted had the marshal not attended officers school but the colonel would later remember the incident as the turning point of his military career the point at which the marshal had dragged him out of the twentieth century into the new age chapter nineteen four thousand miles away it was late afternoon a stiff easterly clearing new york of its pollution haze the twin towers of the world trade center reflecting the turquoise sky like two enormous slabs of green ice towering above the skyline but the high wisps of cirrus cloud and the vibrant color of the sky went unnoticed by adm john brentwood the only reason he noticed the high winds was because of their baleful howling by his new york port authority office on the seventieth floor the retired admiral had resisted the move to the trade center as long as he could citing truthfully that even the confusion of the short move from the port authority offices around battery park would cause delay in the crucial matter at hand his offices overseeing the loading and departure of the vital atlantic convoys no problem admiral his secretary had concluded everythings on disk in the old days wed need fifty trucks and a month of overtime now well have everything up here three days maximum three days we can well use here brentwood had grumbled his pen skimming over the latest cargo manifest nearly all ammunition and aircraft parts they had tried flying several replacement squadrons of thunderbolts and fs over the atlantic with extra fuel in drop tanks and midair refueling but the russians could see them coming across the atlantic and though the weather was worsening over the midatlantic ridge the russian pilots had managed to intercept for a while the americans and canadians were losing more pilots at sea than over european soil pilots downed in europe stood a reasonable chance of chopper pickup providing they didnt come down in enemy territory but for those who were shot down over the atlantic the rescue rate was less than percent for even though the pilots radio beacons had a minuscule failure rate the atlantic was simply too vast to patrol for lost pilots when every spare available aircraft was being used to help ferry materiel or conscripted for antisub patrols because of the high losses of combat pilots over the atlantic sixtyeight in the first two months of the war women pilots whom the army air corps had used in peacetime to ferry the vitally needed planes to europe were now albeit reluctantly being considered as combat pilots an editorial in the new york times a usually harsh critic of army general freemans cowboy tactics now brought his name back to national prominence by praising him for having had the foresight to use women chopper pilots in the daring and successful raid in and out of pyongyang the editorial going on to severely criticize the pentagons failure to have trained women as combat pilots the times also criticized the slow rate of convoy departures so that while john brentwood was happy that freeman his youngest sons commander and someone brentwood senior greatly admired was being mentioned again sending signals to washington that more aggressively innovative thinking was needed the retired admiral bridled at the implicit criticism of the port authority and it didnt help john brentwood or any of his colleagues when the nagata joke had reached the tonight show the port authority becoming the butt of one of lenos comedy routines leno suggested that maybe what the new york port authority should do is put a congressman on every ship with that much hot air aboard no way it would sink now high in his new office brentwood his offices computer notwithstanding was confronted by hills of files piled upon and about his desk no matter how many computers you had to punch in all the variables from not stowing yeast sugar or rice cargos together to the myriad problems about where and how to get enough ships in the final analysis the decisions often had to be made on an old sailors gut instinct the major problem was that the deficiencies of the united states aging mercantile marine were now starkly evident after having been virtually ignored by every administration since reagan despite persistent predictions by the pentagon that the ten thousand merchant sailors in the united states were far short of the twentytwo thousand required in war for brentwood it meant requisitioning cajoling recommissioning anything that would float and help bolster the old fleet most of which had been taken out of mothballs to be used for the dangerous threethousandmile journey from north america to the ports of france and britain but while many ships were called and many willingly lent to the government for cash equity later on only percent of these craft were approved as seaworthy the others to the chagrin of many a proud yachtsman or sailor not qualifying because they could not maintain the required seventeenknot convoy speed there had been the public hue and cry for the admiral and his staff to get off their butts as the new york post put it and to use whatever was possible for the convoys many of his critics pointed out that some of the thousands of big yachts for example could do well in excess of seventeen knots but brentwood stood firm pointing out in turn that it wasnt the yachts speed that worried him so much as their ability to keep in convoy pattern while heading full into a forceten gale amid radio silence and sailing under strict convoy orders whereby neither naval escort nor other merchantmen could alter course to assist thus giving a marauding sub a slow target even so brentwood insisted on considering all comers the computer telling him in cold hard numbers that not enough of the tonnage nato so desperately needed was getting through rollover was railing the deadly equations tipping decidedly in the soviets favor six cups of coffee since lunch his diet having held firm against the creamer until the last cup brentwood was surprised when he looked up and saw it was dark the old familiar manhattan skyline now drastically altered due to wartime fuel and energy conservation including a blackout on all nonessential illumination it had been suggested at first that the city go into full blackout condition as in england and europe but this was ruled out on the assumption that if the russians were going to attack new york it would be with icbms or sea and airlaunched cruise missiles they would have no need to see where the city was the coordinates for such an attack already having been programmed into the terrain contourmatching nose radar of the icbms aboard their boomers as the giant soviet typhoon ssbns were called besides as the major pointed out and few challenged him if the city was blacked out the crime rate would soar even from the admirals commanding view on the seventieth floor whole sections of manhattan were missing only the blipping of the red aircraft warning light atop the trump building affording the admiral a sense of his old familiarity with the city skyline far below the yellow ribbons of traffic kept flowing red taillights shimmering in the warm air of car exhausts that rose from the skyscrapers canyons the admiral was so exhausted that at times hed nod off upon waking the red light on the trump building would cause him to start taking him back to the other war long ago during which his father had told him many an exhausted american driver in the endless threetontruck convoys would suddenly jerk awake momentarily panicking that he was driving on the wrong side of the road before realizing he was in england more coffee admiral asked his secretary no thanks janice feel like i could run a mile we have anything back from san diego on those three japanese tankers i dont think so sir ill check the fax as she walked away brentwood watched her with a mixture of affection and lust she was half his age in her mid thirties a single parent with two children yet the strains and stresses of working as well as raising children hadnt given her the battleworn face of many mothers her age and her trim bottom fitted his category of grabbable the admiral had never made a pass at her telling himself he never would but she was divorced and now and then as he glanced up from the neverending pile of files or in reaction to the weather pattern information changing on the tv monitor in front of him he had caught her looking at him with what he believed was a mixture of admiration and warmth but he reminded himself she was half his age lanas age and besides there was no way he would cheat on his wife catherine not only would it be dishonorable but downright cruel she was still trying to come to terms with rays condition already there had been ten operations the last three purely for cosmetic reasons to try to reconstruct his face as something else than a horror mask that even ray and berns children had found difficult to deal with and now david was missing god knew where in what the pentagon was vaguely referring to as the northern german sector the admiral was tempted to pull a few strings in washington dc to try to get details of exactly where the american airbornes rapid deployment force was but that wouldnt help david if he had already been killed besides the admiral detested that sort of backdoor specialfavor nonsense thered never been favoritism on his ships and be damned if hed start asking for it now and how the hell he could even think of monkeying around with some gal half his age while his family was in such turmoil was beyond him though some navy shrink he recalled had once told him the sex drive knew neither the proper time nor the place that often it hit you precisely when you thought it shouldnt when you were exhausted at a funeral and certainly after combat which was why the admiral had to make sure without mentioning it to janice that as important as penicillin and all the other medical supplies were to the wellbeing of the men condoms were an essential part of the cargo usually cut sick bay lines by percent he told janice as hed told his sons lana too that more people had died in of the flu than all those killed in the bloodbath of world war i these days it wasnt flu but the ageold venereal diseases that stalked the battlefields of every war to avoid public disclosure that would only increase the anxiety of the womenfolk left behind the condoms werent listed as such but as sterile surgical gloves on the tv monitor admiral brentwood saw that the red skulllike pictures of the storm system over the atlantic were changing again red patches invaded green the storm having moved from force six to eight since midafternoon he wondered if robert was out there now in the middle of it maybe the roosevelt was farther north in the irish sea part of the nato force protecting englands western approaches or rather trying to admiral he looked up at his secretary janice had the lips of a raquel welch and a body to boot her curves flattered by a formclinging emerald knit dress the air around her redolent with the perfume of roses his favorite flower it struck him that she might know this but he quickly dismissed the thought as mere conceit she handed him a fax admiral san diego regrets but they want the oil tankers for themselves he interjected taking a file of letters she had ready for his signature afraid so admiral i dont blame them he sighed taking off his reading glasses sitting back pinching the bridge of his nose the only oil japan and the sixth fleets going to get is from our west coast at least until iran and iraq stop shooting at anything that moves in the gulf we could fax valdez suggested janice if theres a lineup there we could ask washington to intervene and release yes said brentwood leaning forward now hands locked together shoulders hunched from the long hours and stress of the job but if we fax valdez to release a tanker for the atlantic ops without going through san diego thatll only get san diegos back up not to mention the sixth fleet and tokyo she added youve got it no were all running on a scarcity of ships janice everyone thinks their operational theater problem is the most important their problems the most serious but if anything happens to those tankers we have on he put his reading glasses on peering through the dimmed light of the overhead neon at the transparent green ops board convoys eightythree and eightyfour were in big trouble janice said nothing and all he could hear for a moment was the soft sound of her breathing look lets request one tanker from san diego theyll look piggy if they insist on keeping all three ones a compromise situation and we can start moving it as a reserve but doublecheck the draft on all three tankers janicebefore we make the request we dont want to do a levins janice laughed yes admiral levins was one of brentwoods colleagues in the new york port authoritynavy logistics liaison office who had demanded a tanker from san diego and had then become a laughingstock in the pentagon and all up and down the west coast after it was discovered the tanker hed been thumping the desk for was two meters too wide for the panama canal unless a tongueincheek advisory had come back from san diego you intend sailing it round cape horn missing page navy but that was always the weaknesses of other men just as his son robert carried the responsibility of killing seaman evans aboard the roosevelt so his father labored under guilt a guilt that to other men would have seemed disproportionate to say the least though intellectually the admiral could see how it would be seen as nothing to other men he could not shake the feeling of unworthiness and it would become an even heavier burden as the war kept on the admiral hoping that one day somehow somewhere he could redeem himself atop hawaiis island of maui it was afternoon the azure expanse of sea now darkening with no distinguishable horizon in sight blue upon blue upon blue silver winking of whitecaps soon indistinguishable swallowed by the glare of the late suns light the uninterrupted aspect of the pacific all about the hawaiian islands was a sight meteorologist sam ronson never tired of watching as his fourwheeldrive toyota took the last of the bending zigzag road up to the observatory he flipped down the visor and wound down the drivers window relishing the cold icy blast of air his union had fought vociferously against the us weather service scheduling only one meteorological officer for the sixtomidnight watch arguing that six hours in the high thin pristine air was too hard on a single observer the truth for sam bronson however and one he was careful not to reveal to the union bosses in honolulu was that for his part he wouldnt have minded staying up at the observatory all night he liked the solitude granted him by the astronomer who was usually too busy to talk for sam the spill of stars in the autumn sky was a sight that never ceased to awe he wasnt sure whether there was a god or not but if there was then this night sky was more evidence of a supreme being than all the holy books night after night he had gazed toward the heavens transporting himself to worlds beyond the belief that there were no other beings in the universe seemed to him as silly as the belief that there was an up and down an idea manufactured by men merely to comfort them in the huge uncertainty of infinity but even if he had not enjoyed the nocturnal star gazing as the astronomer on duty called it sam treasured this time away from his wife she was his second and after his first his second biggest mistake sam didnt like partying or even talking much after two wives and four children what he wanted was to be left alone to monitor the anemometer for wind speed the seismograph and rainfall now called precipitation by the tv forecasters and to marvel at the fact that within a few thousand feet mauis tropical rain forests were washed by rain that had been snow at the height of the observatory when he saw the stylus on the brown recorder jerk to five registering a quake several hundred miles northwest of the outer island of kauai he didnt bother putting in a call to honolulu as the information would automatically have gone through from the observatory via the satbounce feed but when the stylus went to he initiated a manual as well as the automatic alarm which was just as well for though he didnt know it at the time the automatic sensors on japans west coast were being fuzzed over by an electrical storm sweeping down from japans northern island of hokkaido it meant that sam ronsons warning via honolulu relay and australias tidbinbilla was the first tokyo center had of the quake and of ensuing tsunamis the latter so often mistakenly called tidal waves which were heading toward japan the height and frequency of the tsunamis were being excited by a hurricane moving northwest from the marianas with winds in excess of miles an hour when the stylus jumped from to every digit on the richter scale representing a tenfold increase in force sam ronson again rang through the alarm but by now tokyo was being hit and though no one realized it at the time the thesis of tadanabu ito joint degree holder and phd candidate on tectonics and economics was about to become a reality it would make ito famous and explain the death of over three hundred thousand japanese as the quake the worst in japan for a hundred years reduced the financial center of tokyo despite all the floating base design of its skyscrapers to a rubble of concrete and glass shot through with enormous naturalgasfueled fires from ruptured mains to rebuild meant calling in at the very least the interest owing on the massive loans japan had made to the west in particular this meant calling in loans made to brazil argentina and chile not yet combatants themselves these countries and others like them who were required to repay japanese loans in terms of raw materials could not repay even if they had wanted to which they didnt because of the soviet sub packs roaming the south atlantic and the pacific their prime purpose to play havoc along usaustralasian japanese sea routes the horrendous implications of such a situation had been unforeseen except for the obscure graduate student tadanabu ito his doctoral thesis on the economic and social implications of a japan suddenly depleted of a steady supply of raw materials by natural disaster had predicted that a japan starved for raw materials after her threemonth reserves of iron ore coal and bauxite had run out would be a japan open to the temptations of military adventure and that tokyo after her experiences in the thirties and forties would not want another war with china the only remaining source of such materials was the soviet far east at the end of november tokyos full cabinet with the emperors approval announced simultaneously to washington and beijing that in retaliation for increasing soviet bombing of her western ports and the unlawful occupation of the northern islands its defense forces would henceforth launch surgical strikes against soviet bases this meant vladivostok farther inland at ulanude and cam rahn bay in vietnam the pilots of the japanese defense force which had more fs than any country except the united states were instructed however that under no circumstances must they enter north korean air space for this might be interpreted by beijing as the prelude to a japanese attack across the yalu river into china chapter twenty the storm that had swept in over the wash and down through englands southeast creating the torrential rain that richard spence and his daughters had driven through on their way back from st anselms had increased in ferocity saturday night kicking up so much debris that it had activated the ifra incoming fighter radar alarms throughout the south of england but early next morning it was difficult for inspector logan of the oxshott constabulary to believe thered ever been a storm all surrey seemed to be basking in sunlight mists rising like steam from orchards and stubble fields walking with a brisk pace inspector logan relished the sudden rise in temperature that had alleviated his chronic arthritis he could not remember the last time at least not so late in autumn when his tweed jacket and corduroy hat had actually made him feel so warm that he wanted to take them off not that he would logan was an oldfashioned policeman and wouldnt have been seen dead without a jacket tie and hat besides although he was perspiring he was determined today to make no complaint about the weather for while the pain in his hands and knees was still there it had abated so much that he felt ten years younger promising himself that he wouldnt be as irritable as usual the war had also helped logan pulling him like so many others out of early retirement to replace the younger men whod been conscripted he enjoyed the chance to shift his attention away from himself for a change so that now as he walked toward the treewreathed culdesac on the outskirts of oxshott there was more vigor in his step and the smell of his pipe tobacco had seldom seemed so pleasant he could see the two uniformed constables he had requested from the division over in leatherhead waiting in an unmarked car parked beneath a large bare sugar maple on the road leading to the culdesac of seven twostory houses the wilkins house was the one farthest away in the culdesac backed by a small meadow and then a dense line of oaks very quiet said police constable perkins one of the two policemen in the unmarked car aye replied his partner pg melrose who was on the passenger side and who would rather have been home up north in the dales and the rugged wild country of yorkshire investigating livestock rustling by black marketeers than down here in the lush genteel green belt of stockbrokers and professionals he didnt mind the natural surroundings so much but the upper middle class were a bit too snooty for his liking and inspector logan whom melrose now spotted in the rearview mirror was an unknown quantity a little rusty theyd said at the station dont know why he didnt come in the car said melrose likes walking replied perkins without taking his eyes off the wilkins house i hope the other two are behind the house they will be melrose assured him but im just thinking that the bastard might get away on us because logan likes his sunday morning stroll see im coming a bloody mile i could no said perkins wheres wilkins to go then out the window last thing youd want to do if you were him is try to scarper if he runs hell only confirm our suspicions no mate i think well find mr wilkins noshing tea and toast reading the telegraph the yorkshireman made a face twont be the telegraph more likely be the sunday bloody observer no said pc perkins with an air of unassailable selfconfidence in these matters if you were a commie spy what would you be reading then the very opposite thats what itll be the telegraph you wouldnt like to put a wager on that would you challenged pc melrose all right then ten p oh grinned the yorkshireman in mock alarm now dont you go mad lad come on then lets put a quid on it and another quid logan calls me bloody melroad he never did get it right the truth was that melrose thought logan was over the hill oxshott should have waited until the stormdowned lines and battered microwave repeater antennae had been repaired and called london to send someone down not enough time was there countered perkins cmon said melrose you put a quid on the telegraph ill put one on logan calling me melroad perkins was about to answer but now inspector logan had drawn level with the car ruddy face early sixties puffing clouds of erinmore navy cut into the car all quiet boys yes sir said perkins milkmans been and gone apparently he nodded toward the house about two hundred yards away bottles are still there logan glanced at his watch it was just after seven you sure wilkins is home no sir but it being sunday and all night shift said they saw the tv on late last night till around eleven then bed how do they know that said logan blackout curtains would have been drawn aye said melrose in his dry yorkshire accent apparently they were but our lads could still pick up the tv winking on and off at least it was a bluish light they assumed it was the tv didnt want to complain about not having the blackout curtains drawn properly tip him off logan grunted his assent you have the printout from motor vehicles melrose on the passenger side tore off the white slip and handed it to perkins who handed it out the window to the inspector speeding ticket on the ml a few months ago said perkins apart from that a perfect record phone tap asked logan his pipe gripped between worndown teeth the air rattling around the pipes dottle melrose punched in the tap code to see if anything had come through since the last computer checkin the small laser printer slurred melrose glanced at it before passing it to logan the inspector squinted at it patting his pocket to melrose it looked as if logan couldnt decipher the printout one call in on the last shift melrose told logan after the lines were fixed a trunk call reverse charges hmm murmured the inspector the gurgling sound of the spittle in the pipe growing louder he was frowning trying to remember what part of the south coast was designated by area code number southampton melrose told him i know that laddie where in southampton the docks sir digest melrose took the clipboard from his passenger door latch man called ron left a message on the answering machine telling wilkins a convoy had just come in a container freighter badly bashed in on the starboard side lots of cargo lost here melrose had difficulty himself interpreting the transcript sounded like humv anyway humv spare parts it was typical thought melrose the kind of unknown detail that gets even the most ordinary investigation off to a confused start never like it was in the cinema whats a humv asked logan melrose looked across at perkins for help perkins shrugged well find out said logan impatiently taking what looked like a spiked thimble attached to a turnkey from his jacket pocket he pushed it hard into the briar pipe turning it making a crunchingbone sound while pc melrose called in asking about a humv no one at the station seemed to know probably a yank fighter said perkins sounds american doesnt it maybe its hummer sir logan had his pipe cleaned now and was scooping the bowl deep into the tobacco pouch the dark navy cut smelling like figs well we can sort that out later probably not important any calls out one answered melrose this time reading from his notebook mrs wilkins called the school hospital to ask about the boy didnt want to talk to her who asked logan the boy or the headmaster the boy sir the inspector knew that by now if wilkins was watching from the house hed be worried which is just what he intended let wilkins see them and the unmarked car all right the inspector said leisurely sucking hard on the pipe getting a good fire going you stay with the car perkins moment you see wilkinss garage door open you block the road and get out of the car the pipe was going fiercely now tiny sparks hitting as logan continued talking the stem between his teeth you have a shooter he asked the two constables nothing about shooters was there perkins no duty sheet just said surveillance to assist inspector logan nothing about being armed sir a stream of pipe smoke rushed up toward the bare maple damn it i distinctly told leatherhead to issue sidearms if this jokers a spy hell likely have one stashed in there somewhere melrose suddenly saw a gap in the inspectors assumption and moved to close it to protect himself and perkins from the wrath of leatherheads chief constable pardon sir but if this wilkins chap is a spy hes hardly going to carry a shooter dead giveaway if hes ever picked i m not talking about a pistol man cut in logan how about a bloody shotgun birdhunting license eh that wouldnt be unusual around here lot of retired army chaps as well no sir said melrose deflated logan looked again at the house a magpie squawking somewhere nearby the inspector didnt particularly like magpies he felt the vest of his tweed jacket for his own standard issue a parabellum ninemillimeter the holster was ill fitting last time hed signed out a sidearm had been in the late eighties a mental patient from nearby holly road asylum or holly road mental rehabilitation center as they called it these days all right he sighed taking melroses point but not entirely satisfied and keyedup well we might as well go in he hesitated i presume you did remember to bring handcuffs melroad yes sir said melrose whats up with you logan asked turning to perkins who sounded as if he was choking you all right ah yessir something caught in my throat thats all leaving perkins at the car melrose and logan started walking toward the house shoes crunching on the steamy gravel stay on your toes logan told melrose my guess is our mr wilkins is still in the land of nod but if not its conceivable he might try to run for it dont want to use the shooter if i dont have to so be ready for one of your rugby tackles melroad melrose was surprised how did logan remember he played rugby but couldnt get his name right breakaway wasnt it asked logan yes sir bit big for that arent you must have speed that it yes sir well lets hope we dont need it this morning no sir answered melrose his sidelong glance at the inspector one infused with newfound respect play yourself did you sir yes century ago on the wing faster than me then sir not now said logan bending down in front of the house to pick up the morning paper telegraph melrose noted logan pressed the doorbell you hear it he asked after about ten seconds half the damn things dont work logan continued this time reaching for the brass knocker it was a coiled snake must be a bloody lawyer said logan before melrose could comment he saw the change in light on the peephole heard the rattle of the chain the door opening to a slit and behind it he saw an elegant powderblue housecoat a middleaged woman brown hair and eyes about five four melrose guessed a little on the plump side though that was probably the housecoat not at all badlooking really melrose tapped his police cap as logan doffed his hat morning mrs wilkins is it she took the chain off her hands quickly moving to her throat holding the satin lapels of her coat close together its graham no no the inspector assured her your sons quite all right mrs wilkins school hospitals taking good care of him no its another matter actually is mr wilkins home yesii think so logan nodded but managed to convey polite surprise i mean sometimes he comes home rather late and embarrassed she turned and called out james there was no answer she called again he must be in the shower she apologized to the inspector moving a wisp of hair back away from her face logan smiled it was an awkward moment her eyes shifting to the constable i wonder began logan wont you come in she said quickly ill go and fetch him thank you maam said logan taking off his hat melrose doing likewise and both of them following her into the spacious deepcarpeted living room a large blue persian rug at one end edwardian furniture immaculate some photos on the mantelpiece everything in its place the smell of wax polish predominant the kind of house thought melrose youre afraid to sit in might disturb something logans eyes lighted on a print that looked vaguely familiar and on a small round cedar table dustcolored but clean figurines of the chinese warriors dug up in xian ill just be a moment she said starting up the long curving stairway logans smile was fixed in a practiced graciousness thank you maam what you think said logan without looking back at melrose he might be going out the back no no said logan weve got the house covered no i mean the house marine insurance agent didnt know it paid this well maybe mortgaged proffered melrose possibly logan nodded unconsciously patting the pipe in his left top pocket or rented little too neat for renters id say sir logan frowned disapprovingly you own your own place do you no sir but i meant this is a turner said logan hands behind his back looking closer at the painting thought i recognized it rain steam speed his attention wandered back up to the mantelpiece a wedding photo mrs wilkins was a lot thinner in the photograph but it was her all right mr wilkins in a tuxedo a sharp dresser mustache and or so it seemed in the photo straining to appear as tall as his wife shifty thought logan he was going on gut instinct his voice low and unhurried go and ask perkins if theres been an out call since weve been here right you are sir said melrose taking a last glance up the stairs expecting the woman to reappear at any moment shed sounded pleasant enough and totally surprised logan pulled back from the print confounded by its lack of definite line moving left of the fireplace if wilkins was at home and if he did have a gun logan was making sure his field of fire was much more advantageous than that of anyone who was coming down the stairs the front door clicked softly as melrose left then logan checked to see whether there was another entrance to the living room behind him there wasnt and silently the sound of an ornate cuckoo clock ticking woodenly behind him he slid the highbacked edwardian chair closer to the fireplace and in front of him it would afford damn all protection but was the right height to steady arthritic hands he clenched and flexed his right hand several times to pump up the blood supply into his fingers he was amazed there was no pain in his knuckles the rear of the twostory house sloped down to a greenhouse the blurred blobs of several enormous pumpkins and a run of what looked like cucumber barely visible through the steamy greenhouse glass the two bored constables watching from the base of the big oak trees seventy yards or so behind the house saw melrose off to their left heading back toward the car then returned to their surveillance of the amphitheater of lawn and faded rhododendron bushes behind the house well well said one of them whats going on here then a man in white shirt and gray trousers was crawling out of one of the upstairs windows and then began to slide down the main drainpipe to the guttering of the first floor looking alarmed as he shimmied along the guttering just above the greenhouse roof his left foot leading in a hurried short shuffling movement to see if the guttering would hold before following with his right wont he be surprised to see us said one of the constables didnt even take time to put on his coat would you asked the other constable but his partner didnt answer noticing the big aluminum tv dish which mounted on the west end of the house and not visible from the front had several guy wires down to the guttering be careful michael he told his colleague this bugger might be carryin yes wish melrose was round here with us could do one of his flying tackles not to worry old son hes coming right for us all we have to do is step back and wait ill give him one of my half nelsons thatll quieten there was a yell a tremendous crash of glass and before the two constables had time to break cover running for the house melrose was coming around the western corner of the house seeing one of the constables slowing unable to go farther melrose assumed hed been wounded but then realized the constable couldnt run for laughing you see this he called out to melrose our boys fallen into his ruddy pumpkins by the time the three of them reached the greenhouse the jagged edge of the broken glass panel was etched in blood the mans face badly lacerated and bleeding as he tried unsuccessfully to extract himself from the pumpkins and kept falling back each tumble making a bigger and bigger mess exhausted by the shock he finally sat still gazing up helplessly at the three policemen as logan arrived on the scene the constable who had been unable to run for laughing used his handcuffs to smack away a shard of glass that was dangerously close to the mans throat fancy a little pumpkin pie then said the constable be enough of that said logan sternly go on help him out of it melrose go back in the house call an ambulance it struck logan as odd that mrs wilkins hadnt appeared staring down at the dejected pile of humanity before him the inspector felt his pockets for his rights card fifty years on the force and he still hadnt memorized it exactly the fact was that since his retirement hed found himself remembering less and less still logan doubted theyd throw out a spy case because your advisory to the defendant hadnt been wordperfect you are under arrest i must warn you that anything bloody ell the mans eyes were closed as he winced from pain his left thigh bleeding badly logan saw melrose coming down the half dozen steps at the rear of the house after checking inside stepping over the broken glass and the remains of several cucumbers did you call an ambulance asked logan on its way sir melrose looked down at the mans bloody race dont try to move mr wilkins youd better stay put until im not wilkins said the man angrily bloody ell he grimaced fink my knees busted there was an amazed silence the three constables looking at one another but carefully avoiding logans startled expression the man was moaning oh ell me bloody legs broken who are you then asked logan fiercely corbett of course said logan sarcastically thinking of the famous comedy team and im ronnie barker yeah i get that all the time moaned the injured man very funny im sure all right then said logan harshly show me your drivers license avent got it didnt ave time did i where is it in my coat he paused in ouse he looked up in agony at melrose i told you names corbett im the he hesitated eyes moving from one constable to another then wincing im the bloody milkman all right ask mary mrs wilkins logan nodded at one of the constables ask mrs wilkins to come out the moment the ambulance arrived and began the tricky business of first getting all the shards of glass out of the way logan heard one of the constables still chuckling about the squashed pumpkins its no bloody joke said logan upbraiding him now weve tipped our hand god knows where wilkinsll be yes sir the offending constable said and fell silent you think it amusing logan kept on filling his pipe from the pouch tamping the tobacco in so tightly with his thumb that melrose knew it would never burn logan waved vaguely south with the stem of the briar people are dying at sea because bastards like wilkins are telling the russians what ships are carrying what departure times how many escorts the bloody lot sorry sir the constable apologized i didnt mean to make light of it melrose seeing the constable was about to burst out laughing again quickly interjected inspector yes growled logan well sir i doubt if mrs wilkinsll tip him off i mean shed have to tell him about corbett logan was thinking about it too maybe not but theres this bloody great shambles said logan waving back toward the greenhouse debris with his pipe the storm sir suggested melrose we did have a spot of hail anyway with the greenhouse behind the house i doubt if its the first thing hell look at when he comes in cant see it from the culdesac and if she tries to phone out to tip him off well know logan seized on the idea stopped for a moment to light his pipe waving the matchs flame back and forward over the bowl his teeth sucking furiously making a whistling noise we could cut service suggested one of the other constables lots of lines went down in the storm station couldnt reach london thats why we had to call on you sir logan ignored the unintentional implication that he had been oxshotts last choice no said logan we cut the line and he tries to ring in suspect something straight off the boy one of the other constables put in we could move her out leave a message on the answering machine saying shed gone to be with the boy only natural the boys mum would go to see him does he know yet about the boy trying to do himself in asked the policeman who had been laughing before and was now trying for redress dont know said logan sucking thoughtfully on his pipe i dont think so shed hardly risk having him barge in while she was entertaining our flying milkman would she he turned toward melrose melroad inspector tell that ambulance crew i dont want that bloody milkman talking to anyone at the hospital call oxshott and have them send one of our lads over there to stay with him very good sir logan saw the policeman hed sent to the house coming down the back stairs shes in a right state said the young constable says she doesnt want to come out sight of blood upsets her i should bloody well think so said logan we could tell her exactly what to say when he calls suggested melrose make everything sound normal im sure shell be willing to go along with us i mean she wont want it getting out that she was having this corbett character on the side no said logan the tone of his rejection of the idea absolute they only do that on the stage laddie telling em exactly what to say doesnt work in real life man and wife have a hundred ways to convey to one another that somethings up no well have to take her in slip a note through the mail slot saying shes at the hospital and then wait constable melrose nodded his agreement yes but its a sure bet he calls ahead when hes coming home otherwise she wouldnt have had corbett in shes a smart one then said one of the other two constables they might have arranged some external sign in the driveway or at the entrance to the culdesac of course its possible said logan that she doesnt know what her husband does i mean what he does in addition to being a claims agent melrose looked doubtful im not sure about that sir not much is kept secret between a man and wife is it speak for yourself said logan the comment slipping out before he had a chance to rein it in he was sending dense clouds of sweetsmelling erinmore into the still morning air which was now heavy and pungent with the smell of fresh earth venting the rain some of these jokers never tell their wives part of the cover ysee dont think philbys wife ever knew i mean not until his voice trailed off melroad ask the duty sergeant in oxshott to draw up fouron fouroff watches here around the clock no cars visible dont use the house phone have perkins call it through yes sir cmon you two the inspector instructed the other two constables lets have a look in the house when melrose reached the car he shook his head at perkins telling him the newspaper theyd seen on the porch was the telegraph so that melrose now owed him another twenty p rubbish said melrose genially hes called me melroad about six times you owe me a quid not likely mate i never took the bet welcher said melrose well anyway you can chalk one up to our wilkins wherever he is logans in a right pickle wasnt his fault said perkins balls shouldve let london in on this first up special branch cloakanddagger boys but he wanted glory local lad lands big fish well he couldnt call early last night could he said perkins lines were down besides perkins added philosophically if wilkins shows up logan could still come out smelling like roses and if he doesnt asked melrose the cidll eat old logan alive pipe an all perkins made a pouty face conceding melroses point course the wilkins kid might be making it all up you think so melroad it was logan calling from the house when they got there the first thing they saw was mrs wilkins sitting boldly in the lounge chair by the fireplace looking very pale logan beckoned them to follow him into the dining room feast your eyes on this said logan he opened up a marks and spencer shopping bag there were neat bundles of onehundredpound notes must be twenty thousand at least said logan all used looks like nonsequential from the bedroom just where the lad told us melrose glanced over at mrs wilkins still in her housecoat eyes downcast fidgeting with the ribboned edge of her robe no way she didnt know said logan quietly course she says she knows nothing about it course she doesnt said melrose the uncharacteristic informality between inspector and constable a product of their mounting excitement everyone leaves twenty grand hanging around the bedroom he said pay the milkman the inspector chuckled good very good melroad well lads all we have to do now is sit tight and wait ive got a call in to leatherhead for a turnoff check nothings come through yet but as soon as his car turns off the m well have a halfhour warning how about our friend mr corbett did he leave his coat like he says yes said logan he was telling them the truth after all here he is in glorious technicolor melrose saw from corbetts national health plan card that he worked for southern dairy melrose couldnt help feeling sorry for mrs wilkins two men in her life and neither of them any good and she just didnt seem the type the kind of person to betray her country but then none of them ever did he reminded himself that was the whole point he saw her get up and one of the two constables blocking her way she stopped cleared her throat her tone braver than he would have expected under the circumstances am i allowed to go to my own bathroom logan didnt bat an eyelid of course mrs wilkins as soon as the constable checks it out what on earth for razor blades that sort of thing said logan unfazed by the rising contempt in her voice we wouldnt want any other member of the family trying to do an injury to themselves would we she said nothing but folded her arms defiantly turning her back on logan waiting going into the bathroom firmly shutting the door after the policeman had emerged holding a shower cap with several bic safety razors and three bottles of pills inside it logan read the labels one was for blood pressure the other two tranquilizers as needed logan read from the tranquilizer vial before dumping it back into the shower cap i should think she needs them every time she lies to her husband not that i feel sorry for the swine mind but i cant abide a woman who cuckolds a man it was such an oldfashioned expression that it took melrose by surprise and for a moment he wondered if logans methods were just as oldfashioned especially when logan a moment later told him to take the pills out to the unmarked car as possible evidence how tranquilizers might help the crowns case melrose didnt know and as he made his way to the car it occurred to him that now theyd found a swag of money something concrete they should be calling in special branch if the lines were up if logan didnt maybe he should do it himself it might save him some grief put him and the others in the clear in the event that logan botched up and missed nabbing wilkins on the other hand melrose knew going over your superiors head wasnt exactly cricket and no matter how grateful special branch might be for the information the word would be out melrose rejected the idea and decided to wait to do it logans way if they were lucky wilkins would walk smack into the trap it was only then that melrose remembered the two bottles of milk he and perkins had noticed outside the house when theyd first arrived the two bottles were still there if the milkman was her lover surely he would have taken them inside with him bit of a puzzle perkins conceded but added maybe he couldnt wait to dip his wick maybe said melrose looking uneasily across at perkins he isnt the milkman bloody hell said perkins his head jerking around then he was wilkins what no said melrose christ he couldnt be why not pressed perkins the tone of alarm growing he didnt have id on him said it was inside the house anyone find it yet yes calm down thats right we did find his id but we didnt have any mug shots of wilkins though did we continued perkins all we were given squire was a man and his address no priors melrose tried to think hard what corbetts face was like was it the face in the photo of the married couple on the mantelpiece he tried visualizing the man in the greenhouse but all he could see were shards of bloodied glass forged id he said i think said perkins wed better tell the inspector you tell him said melrose not me protested perkins you thought of the milk bottles mate bloody ell said melrose you think it was forged id right dont ask me i never saw it suddenly melrose relaxed slumping into the passenger seat it would be easy enough to check the man would be in hospital where was he going to go with a broken leg and oh christ all they had seen was a lot of blood and the man moaning a mustache meant nothing shave the damn thing off in two minutes flat even less melrose tried to get through to the ambulance but he couldnt the waves fryingsizzling with the static of jammed frequencies a russian bomber raid under way from the unmarked car melrose watched the neighbors in the culdesac peering from behind their curtains at the collapsed greenhouse and he felt irrationally angry at them as if it shouldnt be any of their business when in fact he knew it was everyones business chapter twentyone captain malkov was not getting the cooperation hed expected at the docks so now a different tack was called for the border troops in dark winter uniform with matching fur caps that made them appear more menacing than usual selected two hundred civilians off the streets of tallinn as witnesses and marched the two hundred four abreast through the winding streets of the citys old town toward the viru gate the column slowed when those at the front saw a roadblock of army trucks up ahead beyond the gates of twin towers but the ukrainian guards kept them moving the burntbrown cone tops of the twin towers were shiny polished by the earlier rain myriad raindrops on the evergreens like tiny diamonds as the foliage shimmered in the baltic breeze the fall air too washed by the rain was cleaner more invigorating than paul and katrin valk could remember two of the witnesses a young couple in from the country for market day they were afraid that a terrible mistake had been made and that like the two men whom malkov had murdered the day before they were going to be shot traffic had stopped and beyond the shuffling sound of one anothers feet on the blacktop over the ancient cobblestones a silence was growing katrin her dark blue head scarf dark as her eyes catching the breeze turned to the guard nearest her we have children the guard a ukrainian said nothing but merely looked back over his shoulder for stragglers we are from a kolkhozy collective she pleaded paul tugging her back wanting her to say anything to set them free but fearful that too much pleading would have the opposite effect that if they were in fact being herded as witnesses any more pleading by katrin would put them in with the victims whoever they were paul was ashamed too that they were trying to curry favor while the rest of the two hundred had said nothing trudging toward the gate with the grim resignation of beasts being led to slaughter there was a sound like the rustle of paper a muffled thud a few rows back the crowd had come to a stop before the guards waved them on again around the fallen man an elderly woman perhaps the mans wife was helping him to his feet a guard motioning them to hurry up it could have been paul katrin thought or her in a rising panic she seemed to recognize everyone run for it shouted a young boy from somewhere farther back down the street paul could hear the clicks of the safety catches coming off the aks the boy who had called had now taken flight chased by four of the ukrainian guards one yelling for him to stop there was a burst of automatic fire some of the two hundred in the column didnt even bother turning around and paul valk felt sure he and katrin were doomed as sure as the estonian republic which for so long had been under the russian heel sure as his resignation of defeat had been bred in the bone during the long years of the russian conquest he thought of his tenyearold boy juhan and his little songbird ellen who had just turned six both of whom thank god had stayed at home on the collective this day with their grandparents there was a scuffle only this time ahead of them an elderly woman having fainted walking stick clattering on the roadway the mpo guards would not let her be carried out they knew that old trick the ukrainian guard a sergeant whom katrin had been talking to was now watching her intently trying to keep her lips from quivering she nevertheless looked plaintively at him and opened her arms as her mother a staunch believer had once done beneath the great spire of st olavs please she implored we have children she fell to her knees katrin said paul his head bowed lips a tight line as he bent down to help her up come katrin we all have children said the guard katrin slipped on the road as paul hauled her forward we have cognac she said armenian cognac the guard looked down at her my brother was on the yumashev he said bitterly get back into line anyway its up to him the guard indicated a speckled green and brown halftrack truck its horn bipping loudly people moving sullenly out of the way to the narrow sidewalks where they were now roped off and prevented from spilling back onto the road malkov was sitting next to the driver his left hand gripping the windshield the other lifting the megaphone his voice however came across as a hollow scratching sound as the megaphone went dead malkov looked at the megaphone and shook it vene vark russian shit shouted someone malkov took no notice he tried the megaphone again and when it didnt work had the driver stop and stepped up on the front seat with one foot on the track we want information on the saboteurs and any other persons involved in antisoviet activities twenty thousand rubles for any information leading to the arrest of these criminal elements captain a middleaged man stepped forward his face as hard as rock like one of the fifty thousand other small farmers who had defied stalins order to collectivize and been deported to die in the siberian camps you have information asked malkov no captain but i beg of you let the women go where do you work malkov asked the man nodded his head eastward rakvere he answered nonplussed oil shale factory asked malkov yes the man answered looking at those nearest trying to figure out the relevance of the question then youre lucky said malkov like the shipyard workers not bothering to keep the contempt out of his voice oil workers had the green card essential to the war effort before the man could answer malkov gave the order and an explosive roar of machine guns followed by screaming filled the air acrid blue smoke going this way and that choking the narrow street not all of the two hundred were dead some still lying in blooddrenched heaps breathing their last a few malkov saw not even hit struggling against the weight of the dead malkov and three noncommissioned officers made their way stepping carefully over pools of blood to finish the job with pistols soon only the woman malkov had seen badgering his ukrainian sergeant remained he moved toward her her eyes looking up at him doelike her lips moving but no sound coming from them he shot her the stink of urine was so acidic that several of the guards were complaining it made their eyes water the posters most of them defaced within half an hour that malkov and his mpo troops distributed throughout the city proclaimed that two hundred a week selected at random would be shot until the saboteurs were delivered up to the authorities there was also a reward of twenty thousand rubles malkov was convinced that it was the only way a thousand or so balts were small change compared to the life of the entire northern fleet and whoever else had been supplied with estonian munitions that night malkov signed the chit for extra vodka rations this was always necessary he found to calm some of the men down besides they needed all the sleep they could get for until someone informed thered be much more work to do it was not until three days later that malkov realized his mistake telling the inhabitants of tallinn and the other two baltic capitals that hostages would be taken randomly only encouraged them to remain silent the odds against any particular individual being picked up quite high now he had lists of two hundred names posted except for a few the well connected escape from the city would be impossible the pressure on those remaining enormous chapter twentytwo in the first five days of the war back in august in the rapidly converging pincers of russian armor that encircled berlin over two hundred thousand fleeing west germans had been trapped then ignored of no great strategic interest to the invading russian generals the fall of postgorbachev berlin or rather its instant collapse as kiril marchenko knew was of enormous psychological and political importance to moscow the holy words of john f kennedy though ridiculously ungrammatical as marchenko happily pointed out the phrase meaning i am a beer the way the us president had used the words had once electrified the west it had been a statement of unrelenting determination by the west before and after gorbachev to maintain its presence in germany in the hope that one day the two germanys would be united now playing on kennedys misuse of the phrase the russian political officers were reaping a propaganda windfall one of the refugees was leonhard meir he had been in west berlin only a few hours when war broke out the fiftysevenyearold shoe salesman from frankfurt had been sitting at a sidewalk cafe off the kurf√ºrstendamm sipping a berliner motte savoring the taste of the cool frothy beer when the first shots of the war in europe were fired an hour later in a rented golf and with two elderly couples whod waved him down leonhard meir was on the autobahn fleeing the city the famed air of berlin said one of his four passengers was a trifle unhealthy this evening they were all silent for a second but the famed berlin wit never far from the surface suddenly exploded and the car was rocked with laughter tinged with hysteria as they headed west with the thousands of other cars having no option but to go as fast as possible along the mile autobahn through what in the old days west berliners called the ozean the ocean of what used to be east germany one of the women kept talking about the wonderful follies she had been watching at the europacenter ice rink and how just as a beautiful butterfly number suspended in the air was about to begin all the lights had gone out she told the story three times in as many minutes and in the darkness of the car her husband finally took her hand pointing out at the ethereal moonlit countryside deep in my heart he said there has always been only one germany he turned to the others is that not so of course they all agreed though meir didnt quite know what the hell he meant some of the fools have turned off their lights meir said they think the russian pilots dont know where the road is he told them he was worried too about his son in the army where is he stationed one of the older men asked at fulda mulda said the mans wife oh i have a friend nein said her husband he said fulda oh it was the furthest extension of what had been east germany into the west no one spoke until leonhard himself broke the silence theyll probably leave the autobahn alone they have other roads said one of the women but leonhard didnt know what she meant did she mean that because there were other roads westwards the russians wouldnt bother bombing the autobahn or did she mean that because there were other roads to carry the soviet supplies to the west they could afford to bomb the autobahn and cut off the main escape route from berlin to western germany it really was a wonderful show the other woman started up again so fluid so graceful when all of a sudden ja ja cut in her husband shh said the other woman looking out the window into the moonlit sky aircraft tempelhof is closed said her husband irritably thats what i mean the traffic began to slow despite the strictly enforced german law enacted after several shootings years ago on the autobahn that forbade anyone to stop or get out of a vehicle finally all traffic stopped and drivers were getting out doors slamming horns beeping such language the ice rink lady said the havel said the other man mein gott they have bombed the havel crossing we dont know that yet said his wife then you tell me said the man why do they stop us over sixty years ago when he was just a boy hed been in berlin when the russians had entered and he had seen his mother and sisters raped my god they have broken the havel bridge he repeated of course they havent said his wife sternly there have been no bombs zur√ºckgehen go back ordered the motorcycle police their blue and white pinion lights illuminating their crash helmets as their motorcycles came up the line one by one the cars were pulling out and making their uturns and when meirs turn came he could hear people calling out theyve closed the corridor who had wondered meir the german police or soviet bombers one by one please said the policeman no rush orderly now go back i told you said the man in the backseat its just like them you see first they give you hope then they close the road the bastards im not going stop mister im not going back fritz dont please they had difficulty holding him back from opening the door and as meir swung the wheel about his headlights picking up the high wire fences either side of the road he could hear the old man weeping his wife making clucking sounds like a grandmother comforting a baby shush now everything will be all right she said of course it wont be shouted the old man we are finished the dortmundbielefeld pocket was faced with either surrender or elimination as spelled out in the propaganda sheets dropped all along the fortymile front the french are not coming englanders proclaimed the pamphlets you have now been fighting for two weeks and they are not here there will be no convoys they were telling the americans the messages printed on poorquality unpolished paper which the gis and tommies found useful as toilet paper having been out of it for a week already it had gone up in flames with other nato supplies in one of the explosions that destroyed over ten thousand tons in prepo sites all over germany so many of the supply depots had been hit by the spets teams that their smoke together with the smoke of the battlefields turned sunsets into the most beautiful reds and oranges over western europe some of the palls so dense however that at times it seemed like an eclipse had it not been for the american thunderbolts the wunderzeug wonder planesas the germans were calling the remarkably maneuverable planes the situation would have been hopeless time and again the thunderbolts tankkilling nose cannon and antitank bombs had been thrown into the breach where the soviet armor found holes in the precarious dyke of the allied defense there was another cause seen by most nato commanders as fortuitously accidental that might yet help the allies to stiffen their resistance enough to slow the russian colossus as well as blowing bridges and rail crossings on the borders between france the low countries and germany to further impede any british reinforcements that might get across the channel the spets teams unintentionally or otherwise had cut off the evacuation of several hundred thousand american and british dependents this meant that the british and american troops fighting in western germany knew they were not fighting just to defend europe but for their loved ones some french intelligence sources hinted that a ranking officer in the bundeswehr long unhappy about the fact that american and british civilians even their pets were to be given priority on preordained evacuation routes had purposely dispatched a battalion of einzel ka mpf west germanys ranger troops to blow the bridges but as in all wars rumors abounded and whether the french were correct it was impossible to say rumor or not the predicament of the british and american dependents was certainly stiffening their resistance the question was however would beleaguered american and british divisions fighting side by side with the bundeswehr dutch and belgian troops be sufficient to turn the tide the rapidly changing fronts over the entire length of germany were new in the annals of war for while fastmoving armor and motorized infantry had been the most marked feature of modern wars to date especially the arabisraeli wars never had armor or infantry moved so quickly on such a vast scale and never had men had to endure such sustained and furious attack on a battlefield bristling with such a range of terrible weapons the old definitions of battle fatigue were no longer useful the stress levels were so intense yet so fluid that save for the battle of britain and the lot of german pilots attacking the aerial armadas of american superfortresses in the final days of world war ii this kind of stress was hitherto unknown in the history of battle it meant that whereas in the s men could in a pinch be left on the battlefield for weeks even months now endurance was measured only in days often as with the tank crews in hours chapter twentythree for over two months leonhard meir and the two elderly couples he had tried to take out with him had lived in a roller coaster of uncertainty as the normally wellordered stasi police did not seem to know what to do with them at first they were told they must stay inside a twentyfourhour curfew in effect but then they had been issued brown passbooks allowing them to go outside but no farther man two kilometers at allied headquarters in brussels the punishing cost in pilots trying to keep the sovietsupply lines through eastern germany closed could no longer be justified it was clear that if nato kept losing pilots at this rate the equation would turn especially with the enormous stockpiling of arms and materiel satint showed was going on in berlin the russians in effect holding the berliners as hostages in as coldblooded a calculation as the nkas general kim had made in his advance down the beleaguered korean peninsula from southern germany second german corps consisting of a badly mauled armored division and mountain brigade fighting next to seventh and fifth american corps were requesting wfs weaponsfree status for the mobile nucleartipped lance missile batteries which other than chemical weapons were considered natos land weapon of last resort permission was denied though the lances were authorized to fire as many conventional warheads as deemed necessary natos way of signaling its commanders that stockpiles were rapidly diminishing ironically miles behind the western front berlin had been one of the safest places in the opening stages of the war the soviet divisions and fighter squadrons situated between the city and western germany protected the inhabitants from nato bombing the area so heavily armed that as well as the central front being festooned with sam sites some farmers members of stasi reserves had been issued with the deadly handheld soviet samds so that lowlevel attacks had become increasingly dangerous and yet nato hq knew the buildup of supplies in berlin must somehow be checked battling his boredom leonhard meir had started to take much more notice of his surroundings and discovered that the northern suburb of l√ºbars where he was being kept along with his elderly acquaintances could actually take on the air of a rural village its crossed wooden gateposts and ornamental fences reminding meir of his country childhood perhaps it was the air the pervasive smell of stored hay in the farms all about the city with the soft tones of autumn that reminded him of another age if you ignored the jets the two elderly couples seemed to have no trouble doing this you could even delude yourself at times that you were on a farm at first leonhard felt ashamed because the older people seemed more able to stand the strain of not knowing what was going to happen even the old man who had panicked in the car and had not wanted to return to the city now seemed calmer than he but what leonhard meir didnt realize was that the old peoples hearing had deteriorated to the point that they simply didnt hear many of the jets even so meir saw things were changing morale began slipping rapidly in proportion to the depletion of their canned food stocks and the introduction of severe rationing all farms produce being claimed by the russian authorities for a while supplies of canned goods had held out and the fall having been reasonably mild to this point meant that some of the late vegetables were also available though these too very quickly ran out still for a time the berliners renowned sense of humor never entirely understood by most other germans who had never lived surrounded in a communist sea had held then when all reserves were gone shops looted the sense of humor began to wane even around the outer suburbs such as l√ºbars closer to farms than the inner suburbs it became evident that old berliners especially those who had lived in what had once been the old western sector were expendable it was on a friday morning one of the old men complaining again about how they had become prisoners in their own apartment that leonhard first sensed a resentment of his presence once grateful to him for trying to get them out of berlin the two couples now saw him as merely another mouth to feed going for a walk to let things cool off a little meir pondered how long it would be if ever before hed have any knowledge of his wife daughter and grandchildren let alone his son who had been stationed at fulda but he was determined not to let the depression overwhelm him always telling himself that tomorrow would see some small improvement surely the war couldnt last much longer all the experts had said that another war couldnt last very long just as they had told the world adolf schicklgruber wouldnt last long meir heard the village clock strike noon and set his watch ten minutes ahead an old habit hed developed on his shoe salesmans route to make sure he was never late for appointments at that moment a squadron of twentyfour british canberra mk bombers were taking off from greenham common in southern england their yellow lightning flash insignias either side of the rafs bluecircled red bullseye streaked with water from a passing shower their target was berlin mig fighters scrambled in northern holland flying out over the hook high above the north sea seeing the blips of ten migs fifty miles east of him the squadron leader of the twentysix canberra bombers crossing the north sea called for interceptor assist this wasnt necessary however as raf ground radar on englands south coast had already dispatched six aquamarine bulletnosed tigers out over east anglia into a fishscaled sky to do battle with the migs the canberras commander looked out across his bombers wide stubbylooking wings and seeing heavy cloud cover over holland instructed his pilots that the squadron would detour farther south below the hook of holland which arced like a lefthanded scythe toward germany then go in for the attack south of hannover the canberras navigators recalculated under instructions from the wing commander to use magdeburg twentythree miles east of the old westeast german line as the iap initial aiming point for the bombing run on berlin of the nine remaining canberra bombers that had survived the german roland missiles three were hit by sams the advance handheld soviet surfacetoair missiles in plentiful supply along the berlin corridor one canberra crew managed to bail out over the havel river in grunewald forest in what used to be the american sector of west berlin he pulled the cord for his inflatable vest well before he hit the water but the carbon dioxide cartridge was a dud one of the coolest of the cool in aerial combat the pilot kevin murphy an australian born and raised in the outback had a dread of water and was now desperately telling himself to calm down which he did after a few anxious moments unhitching the chute harness and breaking free before beginning to blow into the mouthpiece of the mae west now his uniform particularly the elastic g suit was beginning to soak up water at an alarming rate his finger slipped from where he was holding the mouthpiece he grabbed for it and resumed blowing as he heard a power boat start out from the shore he was going under the stasi peoples patrol boat dragged the river for two hours slow monotonous work a crowd gathering on the eastern shore by the picnic tables to see whether they would find the terror bomber why bother said one of the three men aboard the patrol boat because you dummkopf said the oldest comrade in charge of the boat it is important why because you dummkopf headquarters wishes to know what squadron he is from this is vital intelligence the crew member a youth in his midtwenties made a rude noise at the acnefaced teenage boy who was the third member of the crew intelligence nonsense said the crewman we know what squadron they came from three of them crashed out near l√ºbars cant you see he was pointing north the older man in charge knew he was correct but the thick coalbrown smoke that was rising and flattening over berlin was coming not from the allied bombers that had crashed but from farther in than l√ºbars from tegel airport and from around sch√∂nefeld airport to the east where storage sheds hit during the raid were burning out of control so pressed the crewman why do we waste our time dragging the river let the fishes have him ja the peoples captain a thickset man with a game leg was kneeling awkwardly on the deck face showing the strain untwisting one of the lines on the chainweighted drag when he looked up his face was beet red from the effort if you dont wish to be sent to the fulda gap my young friend youll help me and stop your complaining ja they cannot send me answered the crewman insolently i have medical exemption ah said the peoples captain pushing himself up from the gunwale and if the americans counterattack if thenships do come what then eh before the crewman could answer the peoples captain spat into the lake that is what your exemption will be worth comrade nothing their ships will not come answered the other boy sharply and even if they do where will they land them we have all the ports bremen will fall in a few days youll see they will use la rochelle and saint nazaire said the captain they will not need bremen or hamburg if they land there it will also save them two hundred kilometers this gave the two boys food for thought but the one who had started the argument was not deterred paris will not permit them to use the french ports the captain had straightened out the drag line if one of our bombs lands on french soil france could be at war with us overnight he said turning suddenly hearing the drag tackle go taut but it was only one line the others still loose he sat back on the seat behind the steering wheel of the plywood boat and put it on idle letting the current push them the way it would push anything else you think the french capitalists are that stupid challenged the youth to let a stray bomb bring them to war no comrade the french are not idiots if you bombed a whole french city they would not come in they would say it was a mistake they are waiting like the giraffes the french giraffes yes scavengers you know you mean hyenas laughed the old man giraffes whatever you call them the youth replied angrily and what if we bombed paris asked the old man he saw the lines go taut hey then comrade what if paris was bombed paris is different conceded the younger man thats quite another matter when they finally found the dead pilot and pulled him aboard they discovered the air bag what the terrorist fliers called a mae west had a small tear in it they delivered the australians body to headquarters in the old karl marx allee and were cheered by some former east berliners including several of the turkish migrant workers unable to go back home but enraged nevertheless by the nato bombing the military commander flanked by volkspolizei personally came out to congratulate the peoples patrol as they were leaving the crewman who had been arguing with the peoples captain noticed a police corporal handing the older man what looked like a voucher of some kind now he understood why the peoples captain had been so determined to find the flier marx was right he said to the boy money is a corrupting force nevertheless if the party had offered a reward he went up to the captain and demanded his share right there and then and got it in l√ºbars on the citys northern outskirts a gaping bomb crater thirty yards wide was still steaming with burning debris near the remains of the two fourstory apartment blocks the two elderly couples befriended by leonhard meir who was out at the time had been in one of the apartments when the six canberra bombers struck with an efficiency they were famous for the berliners immediately began to clear the rubble looking for survivors moving as quickly as caution would allow around the debris especially a staircase teetering near the edge of the crater though it was quite clear they did not expect to find anyone who would be easily identifiable the strangled horn siren of the volkspolizei put an end to the clearance however as police arrived quickly cordoned off the area for investigation investigation of what asked an elderly berliner his wife still shaking but with presence of mind enough to pull him away investigation of crimes against the state answered the policeman the old man berliner threw his hands up in disgust crimes against the state against those russian pigs you mean dont forget moscow in your investigations kamerad silence shouted the policeman and despite the death and destruction that had come upon them like a cyclone several people began laughing others joining in mocking the officials officiousness several small boys were playing war running around the crater and the cordonedoff debris one with a plane in his hand it was an american f ghost gray with us air force insignia whose child is that demanded the policeman mine said a woman rather timidly stop him it is not permitted what isnt cut in the old man again antisocial behavior answered the volkspolizei the old man spread his hands again staring at the sky his faded coat ballooning about him like a clown you talk of antisocial behavior he pointed angrily at the crater you are the cause of this you you fascist the volkspolizei took him away his wife screaming as he was hustled inside the small volga sedan in the second apartment that had been split open as if struck by an enormous ax several suites were open to the air like a dolls house a body visible and still near the lip of the third floor and astonishingly to most of the onlookers a radio was blaring with news reports of the br√ºderlicher hilfskriegthe fraternal war of assistancethe boys around the crater fighting now over who would be bombermannschaft bomber crew and who aaflak aa battery commander after a while another volkspolizei returned and checked off names against those on record as having lived in the two apartment blocks they managed to identify some by wedding rings medical bands odd podiatric shoes and so forth there were still eleven people unaccounted for among them the temporary permit holder leonhard meir by nightfall meir had decided to try again to escape from berlin at first he felt somehow responsible for the old couples death for not having been there with them for having left all of them in a bad temper but soon guilt gave way to his determination to reach the west he had hatched the plan on the way back from his work after having seen several dead stasiled aa battery crews near tegel forest all that remained of one battery after a direct hit from one of the canberras iron bombs was strips of flesh dangling from tree branches like sodden toilet paper but nearby the headless corpse of one man was still sitting upright in the sidecar of an army motorcycle the dark blue boiler suit and aa armband the man had been wearing bloodied and lacerated by shrapnel meir also noticed that several other corpses nearby which were not burned and were dressed in the boiler suits looked as if they were in their fifties about his age racing against what he knew would be the imminent arrival of the ambulances their klaxons wailing in the distance meir quickly stripped a boiler suit from one of the corpses snatched up one of the helmets strewn about the edge of the wood and made his way over to the motorcycle he kicked the starter pedal nothing he kicked again and again until he was exhausted then gave it what he told himself would be his last try the bike coughed and promptly died shit now he could hear a car perhaps a hundred yards or so away down by the lake and voices coming toward him he ran back to the gutted battery and into the wood the voices receded going farther down the lake back at the bike meir kicked the starter again it spluttered coughed and rattled to life he unscrewed the petrol cap and stuck his finger in it it felt icecold full tank he had no excuse it was either now or never a dash for freedom down the corridor or wait would the allies come or would it be slow starvation in the occupied sector no one knew he let the engine die if stopped by the gdr polizei or the stasiwith nothing but his enemy alien card it would mean torture and interrogation he hesitated got off the bike moved around looking for a piece of id finding an identification card on one of the dead the cards photo even in the pale shimmering moonlight over the lake looked nothing like him entscheide doch meir make up your mind meirhe told himself brio do it with brio he kicked the starter pedal again and as it gained power with a throaty roar switched on the sliteye headlamp and tightened the chin strap of the aa helmet slipping the bike into gear easing out the clutch he sped over the grass down toward the lakeside road and from there headed out for the autobahn singing his voice rising though drowned by the noise of the bike and sidecar la donna e mobile louder and louder trying to drown the fear that kept telling him to turn back a heavy drone of russian bombers overhead he had strapped on a holstered gun but had absolutely no idea how to use it wondering if it had a safety catch or not chapter twentyfour on the other side of the world a flooded green rice paddy below outside munsan heading north though still five miles south of what used to be the milelong dmz between north and south korea the loud rotor slap of the seventh us army cavalry choppers could be heard above eight escorting cobras the latters chin turrets whose chain machine guns were slaved to the pilots helmet eyepiece kept moving side to side up and down like a mosquitos proboscis the usual thin headon silhouettes of the cobras were fattened this day by the thirtyeight rockets on each side of the stubby wings giving the eight choppers a bugeyed appearance their tails higher than their bodies each of the rockets was armed with a fragmentation head to provide covering scatteringshrapnel fire for the ten hueys following and the sixty soldiers of the air cavalry aboard them their task was to steal the southern end of what was hoped would be a successful encircling movement against a company of north korean regulars that had ambushed a usrok convoy the previous night en route to kaesong north of the old dmz all across the korean peninsula miles wide at this point hundreds of such missions continued to press home the usrok counterattack against the nka a counterattack made possible by gen douglas freemans daring hitandrun airborne attack against the north korean capital like david brentwood and many others who had fought and been decorated for the raid that stunned the world and bought valuable time for the fleeing usrok forces general freeman was no longer in korea on leave after undergoing a violent allergic reaction to a tetanus shot freeman had despite his protest been taken off the active list for some weeks and now there was concern that without him the counteroffensive in korea would bog down in the lead huey major tae liaison rokus officer for the seventh cavalry a man whom freeman had never met but who had been among the first to see action on the dmz was gripping the open doors edge so tightly his knuckles were white the sound of smoketailed rockets from the cobras near him streaking toward the scrubby side of the paddy along with the howling rumble of the twin chin turret guns each gun spraying out rounds of millimeter per minute into the scrub was so loud that even though tae was plugged in to the hueys intercom he had difficulty hearing the pilot telling him and the six american cavalrymen in the chopper that they were about to put down on the south side of a long eastwest irrigation ditch some of the cavalrymen in the chopper also veterans of the usrok counterattack against the invading north korean army took no notice of tae his eyes watering with the wind his viselike grip on the doorframe nothing more to them than confirmation that the south korean major was as apprehensive as they were the truth however was much different before the war tae an intelligence officer in the rok had conformed exactly to the ideals of west point a gentleman in every sense he seemed to some more american than the americans despite his short slim build indeed tae though not nearly as widely known as freeman and not known in america at all had become something of a legendary figure throughout the us army in korea interrogating the usual peacetime quota of wouldbe nka infiltrators who had been captured while trying to slip into the south tae who forbade torture of any kind was struck not by anything the nka prisoners said but by the fact that the chopsticks found in the nka infiltrators kits were shorter fourteen inches long rather than the standard seventeen from this he had deduced that the north korean army in a country with an acute shortage of timber was stockpiling wood in a calculation that merely amused the usrok headquarters in seoul and made no sense to the us officers born and bred in a throwaway consumer society tae had predicated that the norths saving in wood given the millions of chopsticks used was probably going to the manufacture of chiges these were the nka militias famed aframe backpacks on which they carried all their ammunition and food including the shoulder roll of ground pea millet seed and rice powder which mixed with water would sustain them and which made the north korean regular much more selfsufficient than the more elaborately suppliedfromtherear usrok forces despite his prediction of an impending invasion of the south by the north in august taes warning was not heeded in the main because an invasion during the monsoon was a nono in any selfrespecting army manual even the most junior usrok officer knew that your heavy armor would simply bog down in the rains in the early hours of august the morning following the souths annual independence day celebrations the nka had struck overwhelming the usrok forces all along the line the nkas light sovietmade fourteenton pt tanks able to move much faster and with more maneuverability than the much heavier and mudbound fiftyfiveton american ms behind the armor tens of thousands of nka regulars came pouring out of the tunnels that had been painstakingly dug under the dmz over several years during north korean and usrok maneuvers when normally sensitive ground noise sensors were rendered useless by the smothering noise of the maneuvers themselves the united states had found three tunnels in the s and cemented them up with machine guns at each exit but the nka had dug others which had gone undetected many of their troops streamed out in a massive feint that successfully engaged the bulk of the usrok forces on the dmz this allowed the nkas famous fourth armored division whose forebears had spearheaded the nka invasion of the south in to make an end run breaking through down the uijongbu corridor only eleven miles north of seoul most of the longstanding usrok booby traps on the elevenmile stretch to seoul had been neutralized by nka commando teams while other widespread and synchronized sabotage by in place nka cells effectively gutted the crucial american chopper and fighter bases in the south in the face of the nkas byorak kongkyok lightning warsusrok communications in a shambles from the sabotage there had been panic in both the american and south korean regiments on the dmz tae had fought bravely in his intelligence headquarters outside panmunjom but with the nka having encircled him and threatening to annihilate everyone in the area unless he surrendered tae had been captured but if the nkas general kim had succeeded in wreaking a humiliating defeat upon the americans his army was about to receive a rude shock douglas freeman his career looking as if it was about to be eclipsed by the younger men who had inherited the chronic instability of the postgorbachev world devised and led a raid on pyongyang confounding all military logic with a nighttime air cavalry attack on the north korean capital launched from fescorted choppers off carriers in the sea of japan freemans raid cut the nkas overextended supply line to the south in doing so freeman bought precious time for reinforcements from japan to reach the embattled us and rok forces who their backs to the sea were fighting a bitter retreat along a fanshaped perimeter running eastwest for eightythree miles from pusan to yosu on koreas south coast once reinforced and regrouped with an infusion of the fresh troops from bases on japans west coast the american army and the rok were soon able to launch a counterattack over the next seven weeks during which they had retaken seoul and crossed the dmz now entering the area around kaesong where the usrok overnight convoy had been attacked but while freemans daring attack had electrified the world as had doolittles on japan in and made it possible for the usrok forces to retake the dmz the american troops that liberated the uijongbu pow camps and set the then emaciated tae free had come too late for taes family his wife and eightyearold son had been strafed and killed his nineteenyearold daughter mija captured betrayed by a boyfriend junghyun who an active member of the sfr students for reunification had talked her into the huge student demonstrations against the americans that had preceded the nka invasion junghyun like so many from the sfr was now believed by the usrok intelligence to be an nka officer somewhere in the north now amid the roar of battle looking down on the windflattened green of the rice paddy tae was braced to jump but knew he must wait watching long dense trails of white smoke rising from where the cobra escorts had dropped smoke canisters to curtain off the paddy from the thick scrub on the northern side of the eastwest ditch the scrub was erupting with dust from the fragmentation rockets and tracer from the millimeter so powerful it was cutting saplings clean through branches trembling then flung to the ground creating more dust on fire and adding to the smoke tae lifted his squad automatic weapon and waved the six other men to follow him out heads lowered rivulets of water spreading away from them through the violently shivering grass the men spread out the splashing sound of their canvastopped boots lost amid the whistle of bullets and machinegun fire coming from beyond the scrub through the smoke screen the shuffling noise of the big millimeter mortar adding to the scream of the hueys engines as the choppers hovered a foot or so from the ground while they unloaded bullets thwacking into the fuselage but tae was unafraid already well ahead of the squad traversing the ditch and to the other squad members astonishment going straight over its protective wall into the thick smoke cover jesus shouted one of the air cavalrymen hes crazy the soldier was right something had happened to tae the night that the north korean major had brought in what he called a soltuk inducementfor tae to reveal the names of the top three kcia counterinsurgency chiefs in the pusanyosu region tae had withstood the initial beatings steeled himself enough to get through the unrelieved panic of the nka soldiers holding him down one of them stuffing a filthy rag stinking of gasoline into his mouth pushing him underwater then tying him to a chair blindfolding him suddenly tipping the chair back catching it setting it upright tipping it back again to increase the panic and men as four men held him another taking the pliers to his testicles but his last torture had its own answer a half second after they began he blacked out theyd left him for two days back in his cell giving him plenty of time to think about the pain next time his strength fading his only food a scumrimmed rice cup of watery soup a small piece of rancid meat flung into it it was white and they told him it was fish but he knew it wasnt having seen dozens of rats scampering through the cells and feeling them scuttling over his face and stomach during the night when they brought him into the tent the third day the major had asked him if he had enjoyed the meal tae his arms pulled back and pinned by the guard looked at the nka major and with his voice hissing through the broken teeth and raspy from dehydration replied very much thank you im glad you did said the nka major walking over and smiling down at him it was one of your allies tae did not believe him until he was dragged back into the cells again for refusing to identify any of the kcia section chiefs he knew that the nka guards as un troops had discovered in another korean war long ago were regarded as the cruelest possible captors surpassing even the brutality of the japanese still he was not prepared for what he saw a white man limbs tied to an upright mattress frame that was propped against the shellpocked remains of the uijongbu catholic church was being used for bayonet practice the man still alive it turned out that the man was not one of the swedish un observers from the dmz but a young american from a signals corps captured near uijongbu what tae remembered most about the man was how long it had taken him to die a squad of nka militia having cut a crude us of a flag on his stomach had bayoneted him again and again literally disemboweling him then once hed been cut down from the frame hacked him to death in the same way as in the incident when nka troops had stormed across the dmz and murdered two americans who had been trimming a tree for a better view across the line the next evening tae had been taken back to the dimly lit interrogation tent he would never forget the cloying smell of the flickering paraffin lamp the enormous shadows of the interrogator and the guard or the fragrance of something so sweet so familiar that even in the semidarkness heavy with terror he knew it was his daughter the north korean officer had asked tae once more for the names of the kcia agents tae said nothing and tried to smile at his daughter but when she saw what theyd done to him she began to cry the nka major gave an order and the guard jerked taes head back against the chair gagged him and taped his eyelids back so that he was forced to watch his daughter tae gave him the names and the nka major raped her after as the nka major stumbled breathless satiated back from her discarded form tae in an agony the likes of which he had never known heard his daughter whimpering like a dog in the far darkness of the tent huddled in the corner clutching her muddied clothes the nka major gave her to the troops to do as they would it was the last tae had seen of her the nka major was one of those reported killed during freemans raid on pyongyang the name of the young american soldier who had shot him brentwood one that tae would never forgetbut it was not satisfaction enough with the madness that turns sorrow to rage all tae wanted to do now was to find mija and to kill every nka he could find most of all he wanted to kill junghyun who had betrayed his daughter and though he had already had more searchanddestroy missions in the last week than anyone else in i corps he had particularly wanted to go on this mission intelligence had received information that the company of nka the air cavalry was now engaging was led by officers formed from the south korean chapters of the students for reunification ahead through wafts of acrid white smoke beyond the slight rise of an irrigation ditch tae could see the wooden stock of a rpk machine gun surrounded by concertina wire sweeping through a wide field of fire their bursts were too long the barrel would overheat but it you rushed the wire alone and tried to go through it it would wrap itself around you faster than any concertina and too far for a grenade the choppers had all gone if the air cavalrymen didnt move now they would lose the advantage of the smoke screen tae checked to make sure that the barrel of his saw wasnt clogged with paddy mud he waved for two air cavalrymen to come up to his position one man steadying his helmet with his left hand mouth parched with fear drew level with him behind the ditch thought we were gonna get some fs up here the american said eyes squinting skyward off the carriers theyre busy said tae carriers have all been called up north fuck said the cavalryman were up north despite the heat of the battle it struck tae that the american private would never speak to an american officer like this but he didnt mind all he cared about was the nka russians are moving against the aleutians tae explained fuck the aleutians send the tomcats here they dont see it that way said tae i want you to cover me where are you goin tae indicated the machine gun still stuttering away theyll have to change a drum soon yeah said the cavalryman thatll take em about two seconds flat you ready asked tae down yelled the cavalryman the air filled with a shooshing noise then an explosion that shook the earth a hole blown in the wall of the irrigation ditch a spume of dirtycolored water rising high in the air tae pulled the two smoke grenades from his pack and threw them upwind the smoke cover the cobras had laid almost gone ready asked tae again well have to do it without the tomcats the cavalryman nodded his mouth too dry for him to speak chapter twentyfive malle knew there was nothing she could do but submit to the corporal neither her daughterinlaw nor son had returned from the docks and she like everyone else in the mustam√§e apartment complex had heard the tearing sound of machinegun fire down near viru gate and feared the worst unable to closet her grandson edouard in any of the other apartments for fear of party informers in the building there was always at least one on each floor malle had tried to explain it to edouard telling him that for now until the nightmare was over whenever the corporal called by he would have to be ready to go straight up to the crawl space above the double bed in her son and daughterinlaws room malle had tried to lead the corporal away into her room but he said he liked lots of room to move about raising his eyebrows in unison like a gypsy meaning to convey an allknowingness and sexual prowess he did not have his impatience his ripping and slobbering whenever he mounted her and took his pleasure reminded her of hogs she had seen out on the collectives above all she despised his cowardice not simply the bullying rape in exchange for not launching a search for her grandson but the cowardice evident in his gasps for raza razahis wifes name for malle it wasnt that she was a standin for raza that angered her thinking of someone else while making love to ones partner was a common enough thing she thought what did disgust her whenever he called his wifes name was that it clearly wasnt a cry of separation from his wife so much as a primitive ploy for absolution that somehow the utterance of her name while he was raping another woman would lessen his culpability before the corporal had called by the second time malle had sat down feeling unclean contaminated but determined and with a sense of obligation to explain it all as best she could to young edouard yet how could he understand that she had no option to her surprise he said he understood very well then his eyes burning with hatred he told his grandmother that next time hed kill the corporal no she begged him edouard no no dont you see hell edouard he is the only one who knows you havent been taken in for questioning he doesnt care about searching for you as long as i she was talking to him now as one adult to another the hatred in his eyes having evicted the innocence of childhood forever edouard she clasped his hands in hers his coldness frightening her edouard if you do anything she closed her eyes at the horror of it shaking her head wishing it away holding him close she felt him draw away from her if you do anything like that they will kill you she told him and your mother and papa they already have said the boy speaking in a tone so seemingly detached from his body that he seemed to be talking to someone else it was a voice she had never heard before we dont know that malle said quickly you heard them outside he said evenly looking straight at her you heard them screaming nana nana she seized upon the word of endearment as a desperate soul grasps for the slenderest hope edouard she pleaded squeezing his hands which were still cold and unresponsive they will take your nana and you all of us she tried to smile the smile of the brave showing that if she could accept it then surely be patient she told him soon they will find who it is theyre after and leave us alone he said nothing for a moment and his silence was thick with accusation finally she could bear it no longer her head bowed shaking from side to side her age at once ashamed and prostrate before his youthful impatience you must see we have no choice they would go to your school your friends until they found you then there was a knocking on the door edouard the muscles taut in his face looked from her to the door and back at her from the precipice of decision go she whispered hoarsely then walked out into the hall through the kitchen toward the door her eyes frantically searching again for anything that might betray edouards presence in the apartment catching her breath as she spotted one of his socks having dropped from the dirty wash basket she snatched it up and stuffed it back into the basket beneath slips and lace underwear of various designs which the corporal had insisted on her wearing to make it different each time he had complained bitterly of her peasant attire and she had been forced to borrow some of her daughterinlaws more daring lingerie to keep him happy one hand at her throat the other on the doorknob she steadied herself for a moment putting on what she shamefully called her collaborationist grin she opened the door he said nothing the moment the door was closed his hands were already under her skirt bunching it about her waist where he used it to pull her toward him his lips smothering hers wetly his garlic breath so strong it made her want to throw up he mumbled for her to try and stop him she tried to push him away but couldnt his game becoming her panic yet knowing she must yield backing her up against the hallway wall he pushed against her so hard that the mirror of the hallway hutch shook throwing their reflections in a quivering embrace pull it he told her she closed her eyes buried her face into his neck which he took as arousal you like it eh he smiled looking down at her feeling her trembling excited eh surely she thought he must know how repulsed she was that no amount of force could ever change her hatred for him and his kind come on malle he said smacking her bottom to bed eh turn around when she did as he commanded her he grabbed her left hand and held it between his legs pull he said hey wait he laughed roughly you dont know your strength malle no you swine she drought you dont thats better he sighed whoa steady horse he made her stop by the small refrigerator opening the door and peering in no beer no we havent been allowed out to buy she had completely forgotten that he had brought two cans the day before and that in her distraction she had put them in the small freezer section so that now the cans were distorted ah he said annoyed taking them out and setting them on the small kitchen counter soon they would explode like me eh he said laughing she didnt hear him her eyes riveted on the slightly opened cutlery drawer she couldnt be sure but it looked as if the big serrated bread knife was missing hey malle he bellowed what is it what oh im sorry theyre frozen what oh the beer he pulled her close to him again but im hot eh malle she stopped his expression had changed he was looking high up in the kitchen she felt her carotid artery pounding like a taut cable had he seen something oaf that he was he had a natural animal instinct but he was looking above the counter at the meagerly stocked shelf like honey he asked suddenly she thought she heard edouard moving in the crawl space above the master bedroom only a few meters away to the right of the hallway yes yes i do she answered hastily why he let go of her hand walked over and brought down the small can of danish honey turning to her with a leer ill bet you do it took her a moment to realize what he meant but didnt know how long she could go on debasing herself for as long as it took she supposed for as long as it took him and his barbarians to find whom they were searching for and leave the apartment block for as long as she could prevent them from searching for edouard as he levered the lid off the can of honey malle moved back toward the single drawer what are you doing he demanded for a split second she saw suspicion in his eye it was the same look hed given her a day before when shed tried to lure him away from the master bedroom why she said getting a towel the bedspreadll all right but hurry i have to be back by four its already three as she took the hand towel hanging on the small chromium rack beside the refrigerator she glanced quickly in at the cutlery drawer the knife was gone she closed her eyes her breath caught in her throat no she implored edouard as if by the sheer power of her mind she could forestall him from protecting her honor from getting them all killed malle the corporal shouted impatiently from the bedroom she could hear him undressing the sound of his suspenders thwacking the bedside dresser taking a deep breath she walked into the bedroom he had a pillow under his knees and it was staring at her like a oneeyed snake and she knew that directly above them was her grandson you want it dont you he asked it was part of the game he knew she didnt how could anyone think she wanted to yes she said say i cant wait i cant wait he handed her the small opened can of honey put some on me she dipped her finger in the honey trembling she could not have him here another day edouard was probably right his look had told her he believed his parents had been executed by the viru gate and she knew that even when the troops left the mustam√§e apartments the corporal would not stop calling on her edouard would always be a hostage to the corporal how many other women was he doing this to she put the honey on him all round the top he instructed her guiding her hand groaning with pleasure she made her decision she would be especially nice to him then ask him to take her to kadriorg park and put an end to it now he said be a good bear eh she smiled quizzically at him a bear lick your honey he explained tossing her head to one side with an abandon the corporal had not seen in her before malle pinned her hair back so as to keep it out of the way then her tongue moistening her lips her eyes closed she lowered herself to him she would make it the best hed had chapter twentysix before the war the kill ratio on the nato books was six to one that is six soviet combatants had to be killed for every nato combatant if nato was to hold within four hours of the fulda gap becoming the fulda gash the ratio changed dramatically to ten to one the armored spearheads of the soviet divisions a half million men in all first crossing the polish plain with a speed that surprised even general marchenko he had long held that the fatal flaw in natos armor would be the wests bourgeois reluctance to engage other elements by which he meant the wests reluctance to kill civilians and he believed it would work in the soviets favor he was right the army of refugees fleeing west of fulda and indeed all along the northsouth axis that had been natos central front impeded nato tank reinforcements no matter how hardnosed as the americans called it natos troops had been trained to be most british american and particularly dutch tank regiments found it unacceptable to fire pointblank into the human tide of refugees that clogged the roads some of the allied tanks seeing a blur of red the treads of russian ts mercilessly rushing and chopping through the screaming columns of refugees did open fire the belch of the ms and leopards their and millimeter guns sending whitehot dartlike armorpiercing tungsten through the tightly packed refugees in efforts to stop the russian ts only added to the carnage the air sleeve alone surrounding the armorpiercing needle traveling and discarding its sabot or shoe at over fortyfive hundred feet a second was so hot that it alone seared people for distances up to two or three meters from the trajectory path even so the molten discarding sabot rounds and the hesh highexplosive squash heads of molten metal that were deadly as tank killers effective on both sloped as well as flat armor were not the rounds that caused the major casualties among the refugees this dubious honor was left to the highexplosive antipersonnel rounds which were favored by both sides as much to destroy supporting infantry as the tanks that spearheaded them in the first twentyfour hours following the soviet breakthrough to a megaphoneshaped twohundredsquaremile area west of fulda there were over seventeen thousand civilian casualties most of these women and children in the raging cacophony of the battle involving five thousand nato and soviet tanks the inability of nato medevac choppers to get through the dust smoke and cross fire meant that many wounded civilians and combatants perished who would otherwise have survived had they been treated at mash units within the first two critical hours of having been hit this was particularly the case among the elderly many of them disoriented some gone mad from the sight and smells of bodies blown apart and from the earshattering screams of shellfire and the gutpunching sound of earth exploding all about them utterly confused in the tumult of the highly mobile battle positions of friend and foe shifting rapidly from one moment to the next and dazed by indiscriminate artillery and mortar fire some of the elderly were separated from loved ones and wandered about dazed blinded by dust and smoke suffocating in gasolinedrenched air and then crunched beneath the advancing soviet and defending nato tanks the breaching of the gap by the russian army divisions had come much faster than expected not only because bad weather over the polish plain hampered allied air attacks but because of a single piece of equipment vastly underestimated by the allies as reports came through to allied hq in brussels it quickly became evident that the ts having been fitted with thermal imagers of a quality underestimated by nato intelligence had created havoc during nighttime battles in addition to mixtures of expensive laser and stad r stereo coincidence and optical range finders neither of which was proving as good in actual battle conditions as in maneuvers when the cost of real shells had precluded thorough testing the russian ts and ts had a thermal sight originally made under contract in south korea and later copied in east germany it proved remarkably resilient whereas the other more sophisticated laser imagers used by nato had run into unexpected trouble after the sustained shock of actual combat although maj kiril marchenko had played only a relatively minor role in advocating the thermal sight he nevertheless managed to take a lions share of the credit and it was true that the purchase of the much less expensive thermal imagers did fit with his advocacy of the svyatye dvoyniki holy twins of the soviet high command the first tenet was that overwhelming numbers in the soviet armies would have to make up for qualitative superiority in the west and secondly this meant you had to win quickly before nato could rally andor resupply in turn a quick war meant that not only must sabotage be ruthlessly stamped out in the republics as general brodsky in tallinn had finally realized but armored columns had to be trained to fight as well at night as in the daylight accordingly at marchenkos urging a very unpopular move at the time t and t tank regiments had been trained on the vast russian steppes first at night then in daylight maneuvers indeed the division of tanks in which marchenkos son sergei had fought before winning his transfer to the air force academy and his posting to the far east station had itself trained first at night and during these night maneuvers commanders insisted on tanks maintaining the soviets punishing twentyfivemeter margin between each tank a much narrower one than that used by the german leopards american ms or british challengers who disdained such distances for fear of attracting highdensity antitank artillery fire one advantage the nato tanks did possess was a gun depression of nine and ten degrees twice that of the russian tanks so that whenever nato armor was given the chance to withdraw to defensive hunkered down defilade firing positions they exacted a deadly price for any swp advance still the sheer numbers of the russian tanks that had poured through the fulda gap a ratio of four to one had overwhelmed and continued to overwhelm nato and this despite the carnage visited upon the massed russian armor by the hightailengined american thunderbolts once thousands of tanks were joined in close battle often at ranges of less than a thousand yards the deadly hail of the american thunderbolts armorpiercing twentymillimeter cannon fire was lost for in the confusion of night battles particularly where a t and an ml became indistinguishable on the pilots infrared natos air superiority in ground attack aircraft ceased to count out of the melee a report initially lost or simply disregarded in the avalanche of incoming signals reached an allied intelligence officer in heidelberg it would forever change the nature of war and strike down the prejudice of renowned tank commanders like gen douglas freeman recovered from his hospitalization and riding high on his korean exploits freeman over the objections of most of the joint chiefs of staff had been ordered by the president to take over command of the dortmundbielefeld pocket freeman known to even the european troops as george c scott after his successful attack on what he called the verminous pad of the runtkim il sungs pyongyang had stunned his officers during the pyongyang raid by using women volunteer chopper pilots in the lead assault on the north korean capital at a time when americanrok morale was rockbottom in korea freeman had paradoxically reversed his previous stand against using women in combat roles he had asked for women volunteers to pilot the lead choppers and had got them in one stroke he had ended debate in america about women in combat and shamed reluctant male conscripts to volunteer even so a prejudice freeman held close to his bosom and took to europe was his belief that no matter how successful women might be as chopper pilots or superb ground crew there was no place for them in a tank the dutch fortysecond mechanized regiment now trapped in the dortmundbielefeld pocket had been the first to raise the matter freemans objection in a confidential memo to the pentagon was now part of the growing freeman legend a tank battle he had written is no place for a woman forty sixtypound rounds may have to be handfed into the main gun if automatic load malfunctions i do not subscribe to the common theory that a woman aboard a tank will make the men softer cause the men to be more concerned with protecting the weaker sex than with killing enemy tanks nor do i believe they are the weaker sex in terms of their ability to sustain highlevel stress on occasion i would argue they are superior in this regard nevertheless a woman aboard a tank is unacceptable because it is a matter of hygiene no one in the pentagon seems to realize that in battle a tank crew cannot make rest stops for a tank to stop in the kind of sustained and highly mobile battles we have been engaged in to date would make the tank a stationary target and as we have discovered with the russian night sights the enemy needs only a fivesecond fix on a stationary target to blow it to pieces besides which the interior of the tank is a highly charged fumeladen atmosphere in which the necessary body functions only add to an already unpleasant situation in short defecation and urination will in most cases have to be undertaken as they have traditionally been in helmets until the opportunity for jettisoning such material presents itself which may not be for many hours it is not only the severe discomfort and unpleasant atmosphere which i have in mind in strenuously arguing against women tank crews but rather a sensitivity to their need for privacy which simply cannot be accommodated aboard an armored fighting vehicle col maureen davis of the usmc replied that general freemans objections to women tank crews no doubt arise out of his sincere concern for hygiene and practicality he need not be so concerned no doubt the general knows a great deal about tanks and in being so occupied with this it appears that he has not kept pace with the results of an astonishing study which shows a womans anatomy allows her to drop her pants as quickly as any male and in any event women find it easier to relieve themselves than their male colleagues who as i understand it often have difficulty in aiming cheeky bitch freeman had thundered and was not won over until the intelligence officer in heidelberg personally requested three minutes of the generals time after freemans intense briefing of the disastrous nato situation whats your name snapped freeman norton sir major james nor all right norton youve got one minute shoot sir ive been tallying destroyed tanks by crew composition those russian tanks with mixed crews are scoring better than allmale crews he paused youve got thirty seconds left major growled freeman im not a goddamned mind reader shoot sir it seems that our assumption that women would inhibit aggressive action that male crew would want to protect the women and therefore withdraw is incorrect all the evidence suggests the opposite with a woman aboard male crews are afraid of being seen as well as cowards said freeman yellowbellies yes general whats your name again norton yes sir all right norton well put gals inside the turrets it was the kind of decision that endeared freeman to field officers the ability to cancel his own prejudice on the evidence and to waste no time in implementing a new tactic or strategy mind added freeman none of them over thirtyfour norton was nonplussed their tits explained freeman pulling tje glove on harder riding crop dangling freely from his wrist as he smelled the change in the air still dusty and corditefilled blowing in from the battlefields to the east but much colder more bracing no big tits he continued get in the way of the laser sights cant get close enough to the eye cup norton looked for help from col al banks the generals aide from his korean days but help was not forthcoming sometimes al banks didnt know himself whether the general was being serious or making a joke norton yes general weve got to do something about this dortmundbielefeld pocket we need every man woman and jackrabbit we can get appreciate your report youre welcome general freeman was already walking back to his staff humvee buttoning his coat collar against the sudden drop in temperature that had resulted from an arctic front when he turned to norton major howd you like to be in my g get your ass out of that castle in heidelberg to where the action is thatd be fine sir norton lied good man al you see to it yes sir norton when you get yourself to arnhem i want you on aerial reconnaissance not afraid of flying are you no sir norton lied for the second time that night good youre the kind of man who sees detail any ass can draw arrows on a map but what i want is attention to detail that right al yes sir you know about tae and the chopsticks norton norton looked blank well never mind i think youll work out fine as he was getting into his humvee freeman could hear the rumble of russian artillery in the oden wald to the east like the bad weather also to the east it was getting closer driving out of heidelberg to catch his plane to arnhem he said to banks al i want all aerial photographs for the last twentyfour hours at arnhem hq youve got that look again general have i well ill tell you what else i want a plan for a fighting retreat regimental level banks wasnt sure hed heard correctly retreat general whats the matter you got sand in your ears no sir but well sir youve never pulled back before ive never been surrounded by four thousand russian tanks before and al when we do start using women in the tanks i dont want anyone playing sir galahad and getting out of the tank for a leak thats an order and i want it circulated to all commands northern central and southern nato commands whats left of em al banks tried not to smile but freeman caught him think i m a rude son of a bitch no sir i just dont think the men are going to obey an order that involves unzipping in front freemans voice grew cold any man or woman who leaves a tank to urinate or defecate in action will be fined five hundred dollars and ill flail em alive those russian thermal detectorsll pick up a hot shimmer at a thousand yards he paused you know how i know because i bought one of the sons of bitches on the black market when the berlin wall was getting holes punched in it and all the goddamn liberals and fellow travelers were having orgasms over gorby and thought it would be peace ever after im not losing a single abrams not a goddamn one of em because some jokers too embarrassed to piss inside his helmet that clear yes sir one more thing al those casualty lists we saw in heidelberg show six crewmen killed because in defilade they spelled one another off all six were crushed because the ground under the tank suddenly gave way under the weight i dont blame them underneath a tanks as good a shelter as any besides theyd just been shipped over so didnt expect it different geology than california still their commander should have known better we need every goddamn tank and man we can get now our g tells us the russians are stockpiling oil supplies in our own underground depots theyve captured outside the pocket safe from aerial attack meanwhile the bastards are pounding the shit out of our atlantic oil and supply convoys they keep getting clobbered we could lose this thing for the want of a shell banks said nothing as usual the general was exaggerating and as usual he was right chapter twentyseven morning comrade general welcomed the captain of security marchenko grunted and kept walking down the long crimson corridor of the kremlins council of ministers building to the first deputy prime ministers office the general was in no mood for pleasantries and his lumbago was starting to act up again a sure sign that winter was on its way when he arrived in the waiting room outside the deputy ministers office the general informed the secretary he must see the minister at once is it pressing the immaculate major asked his red shoulder boards vibrant in the pale shafts of sunlight damn protocol thought marchenko its not pressing he retorted its critical the major unperturbed it was always criticalput the ivory desk phone on conference often the minister could deal with it over the phone without wasting his time in the office general marchenko here sir the major informed the minister crisply he wishes to speak with you there was a slight hesitation very well said a voice resonant in the tinnysounding speaker marchenko could see through the beigedraped panel of the glass door that the minister wasnt coming to meet him so that the general was required to walk the twenty meters down the long rectangular office to where the deputy sat talking on one of the seven white phones to his left waving marchenko to a chair as a headmaster to a prefect marchenko bristled after all he was the senior adviser to premier suzlov and yet the deputy minister wouldnt meet him halfway at the end of the row of chairs down the woodenpaneled wall to the ministers right a young nervous executive type sat waiting apprehensively below the sepiatoned portrait of marx comrade said the deputy minister a small squat man with a shock of graying hair he pushed himself back from the semicircular cutaway in the elegant desk and rose extending his hand but marchenko felt it was more protocol than heartfelt the general envied the minister hed always wanted a desk like that where documents were all around you rather than where you could never reach them comrade deputy said marchenko simultaneously indicating the glum nervous man sitting below marx its all right the deputy reassured him he is one of my advisers we all need advisers eh comrade marchenko was a recognized expert on military matters but the nuances of superiors often bemused him was the deputy reminding him of the kremlins pecking order with his comment or was he merely being polite so whats critical general marchenko gave him both barrels at once the japanese fleet is in la perouse strait sailing north the deputy said nothing his face impassive between japan and sakhalin continued marchenko the japanese call it karafuto you might recall still the minister made no comment indeed he seemed rather bored containing his exasperation marchenko went on to explain theyre obviously strengthening their western flank northern sakhalin is a perfect springboard for an invasion of siberia oil said the deputy unconsciously marchenko gave a sigh of relief among other things comrade yes oil and our siberian bases from which our bombers have been hitting their west coast you are sure its an invasion force i thought you were the one who doubted japan would escalate her involvement militarily marchenko looked straight at the deputy i was wrong there are a dozen transports at least replied marchenko a carrier helicopter ships as well and a screen of fighters and surface vessels thirty vessels in all can we stop them i dont know said marchenko if we were only fighting on one front yes of course but the japanese defense force i didnt think was all that defense force cut in marchenko eyebrows raised its as offensive as any other force defense was there propaganda because they were forbidden to call it anything else under the surrender terms with the americans in marchenko paused and the deputy noticed the general looked more worried than he had ever seen him we could muster enough troops in vladivostok and ferry them over but we havent the time and there are only two divisions on all of sakhalin its as big as japans north island but our main concern comrade deputy and this is why ive come straight to you for your support in the politburo is that even if we repulse the japanese landing and this may be possible with our fighters out of yuzhnosakhalinsk in south sakhalin so long as japan continues to get oil from the americans she will be able to harass us along our eastern flank weve got to stop the oil coming to her from alaska even if their fleet is a feint to what about our submarines interjected the deputy we surely have enough of those out of vladivostok so do the americans comrade deputy and quite frankly the us hydrophone arrays underwater microphones are so good in the pacific they pick us up way ahead at the moment we cant get near those tankers because of shemya and adak the deputy glanced up at his wall map at the aleutians arcing like a sickle toward russias kamchatka peninsula with only the two soviet komandorskiye islands between kamchatkas icbm sites miles to the west and the westernmost us island of attu miles east of the komandorskiyes so we have to take out shemya and adak proffered the minister adak would do its the us submarine listening post and base can we do it general if there are so many american submarines in the pacific no no the general was quick to tell him not by sea by air its the only way given the time problem fighter attacks to soften the island base up then paratroops the deputy minister frowned it was now evident why marchenko was seeking his approval so urgently he would need a majority of politburo supporters on this one general i am not as adroit as you in military matters but i would doubt the americans will fail to see you coming an attack on the island by our fighters flying below enemy radar can be done this i know but when you take in paratroops the radar will surely see them not if our fighters knock out the american radar first and what if they dont as i remember from your reports on our airtoground rocket raids on england radar installation masts can be notoriously difficult to knock out almost as difficult as bridges i believe but if i am correct shemya island as well as being one of the most heavily armed places on earth is between komandorskiyes and adak marchenko nodded and if we wait we could have the american pacific fleet to contend with elements of it are already heading up from the sea of japan where they were providing carrier fighter cover for the usrok counterattack in north korea then how do you propose dealing with the adak submarine base marchenko walked to the wall map extending his hand out from the komandorskiyes we will fly due east two hundred miles north of shemya midair refueling for the migs then due south to adak the deputy minister nodded approvingly then what about the americans antiaircraft missile batteries on adak island marchenko permitted himself a smile of anticipated satisfaction we have our covert trawlers commanded and manned by disaffected aleuts descendants of our fur traders some of them still believe the aleutians are theirs very much like the american indians and we have them yes but can they do the job its already proven comrade one of them has already downed a hercules off unalaska the americans thought it was volcanic ash from mount vsevidof the aleutians are a chain of volcanos the trawlers will be fishing off alaska very rich fishing grounds especially off adak the american shore batteries on adak will blow them out of the water marchenko shrugged of courseafter the trawlers have wreaked havoc on adak station our paratroopers will finish the rest and we will have secured a stepping stone to alaska most importantly we will have neutralized the american advance warning station for their submarines just as the japanese neutralized their wake island station in the second world war our submarines will be much freer to attack oil tankers en route from alaska in addition this will take the pressure off our western front said the deputy and allow us time to deal with the japanese exactly said marchenko will you support me in the politburo the deputys fingers were tapping his blotter you really think it will work marchenko comrade deputy my son is stationed in the far eastern theater in ulanude i fully expect him to be one of the fighters in the attack on adak if youre that confident comrade said the deputy ill support your proposal to the premier thank you comrade dep one thing cut in the deputy pushing himself back from the desk i take it the americans had a board of inquiry into the crash of their hercules do you think they are convinced it was what did you call it volcanic ash i have taken steps to cover that eventuality comrade how sir the officer in charge of covert operations is an aleutbering no relation to the explorer he has things well in hand the trawlers carry grail surfacetoair missiles infrared homing fired off the shoulder berings trawler brought down the hercules and the americans never picked it up on their radar thats what i mean hes very resourceful he fired it off a volcanic caldera there is often volcanic ash clogging the engines but bering is very careful he volunteered to the american commander to look for possible soviet missile sites on the nearby islands not surprisingly hes found nothing thats what i call initiative the deputy minister concurred so youre sure he will be able to neutralize the adak radar and communications installation i hope he has more than grail aa rockets for that he has answered marchenko we pay him very well hell keep adak naval station more than occupied while our paratroopers are landing elsewhere on the island and closing in when do you suggest we initiate the plan if im to support you ill need documentation and marchenko reached into his vest pocket and extracted a fivebyseven satellite photo of a carrier and battleship battle group the carrier is the salt lake city the battleship we are almost certain is the refurbished missouri the seventh fleet off korea elements of the third fleet from hawaii are also en route from hawaii strictly speaking the aleutians are the third fleets responsibility so you see the very fact the americans are also taking one carrier battle group the salt lake city from korean waters shows how serious they are in trying to thwart any attack from us on the aleutians the only way to beat them is to go in now with paratroops the deputy minister nodded slowly very well general youve managed to convince me ill support you in the stavka marchenko sat back relieved there is one thing i should tell you before the meeting is called deputy yes two of our airborne assault brigades are already on their way from petropavlovsk on kamchatka peninsula en route to the komandorskiye islands theyll make the attack from there he paused minister i had to put my neck outthere simply wasnt enough time to go through channels the ministers tone was quiet be careful general people who stick their neck out too far are likely to get it cut off he smiled and extended his hand marchenko rose and returned the smile as he left the deputys desk for the long walk out to the waiting room he heard the telephones start ringing general marchenko turned around comrade deputy the deputy minister was holding a receiver one hand over the mouthpiece waving it censoriously at the general what about the two divisions you have put on full alert in khabarovsk without my approval you never mentioned those for the first time in years kiril marchenko felt himself blush with embarrassment ah reinforcements minister but you dont think well need them do you no i dont think they will be necessary comrade deputy the deputy sat back in his swivel chair hand still over the receiver i hope not general for your sake chapter twentyeight when constables melrose and perkins checked the oxshott emergency ward and discovered that the man who had given his name as corbett was indeed mr corbett and a milkman to boot as perkins put it to inspector logan there was relief and embarrassment all around relief for logan because he hadnt completely bungled the attempted catch of mr wilkins whose wife had lied about him being home to protect her milkman lover embarrassment for mrs wilkins who following the inspectors threat to charge the milkman admitted to logan and the two constables that her husband was in southampton where he was ostensibly assessing damage wreaked upon a convoy for the purposes of apportioning government reimbursement to the shipping lines whose merchant ships had been requisitioned logan and the two constables took the to southampton they were delayed at woking because of track torn up by a russian rocket attack between woking and basingstoke necessitating a detour via farnborough and guildford and a late arrival in southampton at pm a light drizzle was falling through the blackout as they got out of the southampton police car and approached the westward arms pub on the southampton dockside the contrast between the cold bleak darkness from which they had come and the hearty warm noisy pub was striking logan commenting that he hadnt seen such thick clouds of cigarette smoke since prewar days whole ruddy navy must be here said perkins wilkins was well dressed in a brown suit but even his tailor couldnt hide his beer belly ello ello someone called out at the sight of the policemen anybody smell coppers there was ragged laughter someone else shouting youre for it to the bar in general wilkins was turning with a pint of guinness in one hand and a gin and orange in the other when he saw the inspector in his tweed jacket cap still on and the two constables by his side his face changed from a merry pink to ash white mr wilkins james g wilkins of hemes street oxshott wilkins nodded someone shouting at him i want you to elp us wiv our inquiries logan had the charge card out and was reading wilkins his rights perkins and melrose watching their flanks it was a tough crowd mostly merchant seamen getting well and truly sozzled after the harrowing atlantic run come along logan told wilkins wilkins looked pained whatll i do with these he asked plaintively looking at the drinks ill ave the guinness mate said a distinctly australian drawl whos the lolly water for it isnt lolly water wilkins said no worry said the australian ill drink it too perkins drew the inspectors attention to a young woman getting up from one of the cubicles logan nodded and perkins made his way through the drinkers toward her wilkins was still standing immobilized holding the drinks might as well give them to ned kelly logan advised him indicating the australian well give you a chit for them if you like logan added intent on following procedure to the letter jesus said the aussie laughing free booze logan feared a rush on the bar cuff him melroad melrose did as he was told and amid a solid chorus of boos and you bastards led wilkins out im innocent said wilkins looking about in the darkness feeling the pull of the handcuffs of what said logan as he hit the cold bracing air wilkins looked from one policeman to the other i dont know well thats a start said logan eh melroad yes sir replied melrose dutifully you have the lady melroad asked logan yes sir good into the car then logan was jollier than melrose thought he had a right to be theyd darn near botched what oxshott station was already dubbing the case of the pummeled pumpkin nevertheless melrose felt a sense of achievement himself and the warmth from the lady against him helped then as they were leaving the dockside he caught a glimpse of one of the ships in the convoy her list near to capsize point and he wondered how many men had died on her because of spies he heard logan calling in scotland yards cid the criminal investigation division would add an extra shine to logans glory if wilkins talked in berlins alexanderplatz it was pm and also raining but here no rights were being read to the prisoner and the crowd of one of the suburban committees against terrorism were a sullen lot dragged out in the rain as witnesses to what happened to anyone found spying against the newly declared peoples german democratic republic behind them there was the smell of chicory from the ersatz coffee being brewed in the police station what made the charge even more serious than usual was that the prisoner had been found wearing a uniform of the peoples antiaircraft battery the alexanderplatz was chosen because while it was some distance from the point of arrest it afforded the authorities maximum propaganda value for television cameras were already installed overlooking the platz and the population at large could see the penalty for actions against the state could i please asked the prisoner with great dignity leave a message for my wife and family in frankfurt no answered the stabfeldwebel who had arrested him at the roadblock you may not as they blindfolded him leonhard meir thought of his son who had fought at fulda gap and wondered whether he was alive or dead as the stabfeldwebel pinned the white paper disk on meirs boiler suit meir started to say something but his throat was so dry no sound came as the shots rang out across the vast platz the citizens of l√ºbars had already turned to head home chapter twentynine id rather you volunteered your help snapped la roche his lean tanned frame reclining in the ultramodern chair that overlooked pearl harbor from his topfloor office of the la roche building two forrestalclass carriers though in the safety of the harbor were surrounded by a swarm of destroyers and fastguided missile frigates loading up with supplies though it wasnt general knowledge la roche knew this battle group would be the second to head for the aleutians his sources in washington informing him that while the war in korea was going well for a change japans move north to protect her western flank meant that the united states back door the aleutians might be endangered as the soviets sought to isolate japan from the vital supply routes to and from the united states hed heard that already elements of the third fleet out of yokosuka were steaming toward the farflung islands whichever way it went jay la roche was satisfied he was in the right place at the right time hawaii being the supply hub for americas pacific war its not that im unwilling to help replied the congressman adjusting his tie of dark maroon and blue stripes against the starched white shirt that contrasted with the blue striped suit but this trouble with your wife he was very careful not to say exwife well what she did up there off halifax i mean its a very touchy subject with the navy theyre sticklers for discipline as you know and if she suddenly transferred out of there to here well waikikis hardly a hardship posting itll look awfully suspicious suspicious to who asked la roche angrily using his letter opener as a drumstick on his desk of carrara marble the same kind he told all visitors that was used by michelangelo the congressman shifted uneasily it would be suspicious to everyone stationed up there i dont give a fuck said la roche his drumming on the marble increasing all im interested in is getting her the hell out of there and back here i understand your feelings mr la roche no you dont said la roche he was tired of onenight stands there was nothing after he wanted her back damn it way the world was going you never knew you had to take what you wanted when you wanted it otherwise it might be too late hed promise to behave cut down on the booze and dust i can get you unelected congressman easy as i put you there anyway why the fuck should you care what a bunch of stumblebums in the navy thinks anyway mr la roche my boys fighting in korea if i cant get him out you can get him out the congressman tried to look la roche straight in the eye it was difficult la roches eyes bored into you with more experience behind them than most men accumulated in a whole lifetime i dont continued the congressman want to pull special favors for my son then youre a goddamned fool anyway if you have a quiet word with the navy sweeten it with the promise of increased appropriations or whatever whos going to know i will said the congressman quietly his voice seemingly swallowed by the vastness of the plush graypilecarpeted office i dont mean your kid for chrissake said la roche temper rising i mean whos going to know about my wife word gets out la roche opened a drawer pulled out an irish bond envelope and walking closer to the panoramic view slid the envelope across the marble desk no congressman word doesnt get out not if you pay enough now how much do you want the congressman was surprised la roche was smarter than that hed banked from new york to shanghai he should have known that on some things even congressmen cant be bought i dont want money he told la roche course you fucking do ten grand twenty youre already a whore all were talking now is price ive bought your way to capitol hill and you know it i like to think that some people voted for me said the congressmen evenly think what you fucking like but i bought the commercial that bought you the vote mr fucking nice and cleanrobert redford from the sunbelt dont give me a dance la roche walked back to the desk and slid the envelope closer to the congressman go on have a look la roche spun the envelope opener which in the fluorescent light threw a series of long white slashes on the high ceiling i know your boys in korea he said american division near racin port for pyongyang or it was until our bombers pounded the shit out of it the congressman tried to hide his surprise at the extent of la roches knowledge about his son la roche shrugged nonchalantly sat down and swung his highbacked leather chair around toward the harbor watching a fog bank that was moving inshore you shouldnt feel out of it he told the congressman youre not the only he almost said gofer but used connection instead then why dont you have your other connection fix the transfer asked the congressman looking down at the unopened envelope la roche was watching the fog starting to roll as the warm land eddies rose from beneath the cooler air of the sea la roche spoke without turning back to face the congressman hes in japan at the moment i can hardly fax him can i besides hes busy over there if we dont watch it were going to lose our supply of china crude the congressman lifted the envelope it was heavy as he began opening it he had to admit to himself that la roche certainly was well informed the fact that the united states because the fighting in the mideast had effectively dried up arab shipments of oil depended for up to percent of its oil supply on china crude was a littleknown and carefully unpublicized statistic in the united states la roche turned away from the window and stood behind the congressman looking down at the contents of the envelope i like the redhead jay said how olds he sixteen seventeen hard to tell with you on top of him his face is in the shadow but thats you all right isnt it the congressmans head didnt move where did you get these i got them thats the point isnt it now get the transfer ah the congressman couldnt go on his voice cutting out you need a drink said la roche moving over to the mahogany wall pressing the panel that opened with a quiet whir revealing a bar twinkling in its opulence jack daniels crushed ice right the congressman didnt answer la roche returned and held out the drink the congressman hesitated but then his body slumped and he seemed to shrivel as he took the drink he could hear the quiet tinkle of the ice collapsing the smell of la roches minty breath overpowering i suppose you have copies no said la roche not of that lot but ive better photos of you than that the congressman didnt want to look at the photos anymore but he was shocked doubly by the fact that they were polaroids that someone must have used a flash but how you were so pissed said la roche anticipating him in a matteroffact tone you probably thought the bright light was a fucking sunrise the congressman felt something on his shoulder la roches hand relax intoned la roche sipping a cr√®me de menthe youre all right should be a bit more careful though use someplace you know somewhere youve checked out i always do la roches other hand was on the congressmans shoulder massaging his neck christ said the congressman slumping forward now his head buried in his hands la roche kept up the steady massage its a bastard isnt it still we have to keep it in the family right i mean for the familys sake outside the fog had become a gossamer of gold swallowing the carriers chapter thirty though the afternoon was overcast above tallinn it could not dampen the corporals spirits for him it was a day of singular victory were malle any older it could have been embarrassing normally it wouldnt do a man courting a woman ten years his senior but she kept her figure well it was the first thing hed noticed on the day hed knocked on the door of her apartment in the mustam√§e complex he had commented on her beauty often especially after she undid the tight bun and let her hair cascade down and the more he told her how beautiful she was the more he convinced himself that having sex with her was a completely natural outcome of their first meeting as he called it rather than rape in his eyes she had confirmed as much herself asking him after theyd made love the day before to go with her today for a walk in kadriorg park explaining that with the mpos captain malkov continuing to arbitrarily take hostages from the street until he rooted out the munitions saboteurs in tallinn she was terrified to go out alone i would be honored he had told her the very idea of his comrades seeing him with a vivacious woman on his arm pleasing him immensely indeed he regarded his being posted to estonia as the best thing that had happened to him since hed been conscripted his liaison with malle confirming his belief not only that things work out for the best in the long run but that at heart women craved a palochku bit of stickeven though they would never admit it and what if anyone in his mpo company saw him and blabbed about it to his wife raza back home then he determined he would merely tell raza that malle had been another suspected estonian saboteur he had been ordered to well that would be a bit thin he thought but it was highly unlikely someone would mention it in their letters besides the company censor would be quick to black out anything that might cause consternation on the home front they were strolling beneath the copse of linden trees the pigeons walking about more skittishly than usual pigeons were fresh meat in a time of severe rationing you are very quiet today he said to her smiling yes you look sad i thought you would be pleased to be out in the park again yes two mpo guardsmen passed by one of them giving him a knowing leer well the corporal pressed why are you sad because she began looking pensively ahead at the denuded chestnut trees etched black on the gray sky of the war she fell silent dont be so glum he said slipping his arm about her he was surprised she didnt resist most women did in public at least it made him even surer of himself sometimes the war brings good things he said i like you and you like me not at first but you see strange things happen in the war things we have no control over yes yes she agreed slowing down by the rest rooms the grass about them kneedeep in fallen leaves that were spilling out onto the cement pathway wait here for a moment she said i have to go to the rest room waiting for her the corporal pulled his gloves on more tightly something he always affected when he felt in a particularly good mood problem was if malkov ever found his damn saboteurs the corporal knew hed be moving out probably reassigned god help him to guard duty around the mines in east estonia the backside of the baltic he hoped malkov would never find the saboteurs but anyway he would turn the boy in then did malle really think he hadnt figured out the boy was tucked away in the crawl space he could smell him the kid was probably masturbating every time they did it the corporals attention was on a motorcade the big boy admiral brodsky was down from leningrad and word had it that he wasnt happy with malkovs failure to root out whoever had been sabotaging the munitions that had gone to the yumashev and god knew where else the mpo had already taken over six hundred hostages with no results it was said brodsky was also under pressure from the stavka to settle the problem and quickly an artillery battery in germany had come across several duds in what was supposed to be highexplosive millimeters it was all going to mean more hostages most likely pray thought the corporal that the saboteurs whoever they were would hold out and give him more time with malle but he doubted they would some teenagers like malles grandson had been shot in the last few days suddenly it occurred to him malle had been gone a long time though heaven knew women always took an age in the maybe there was a rear door he started toward the washroom whats wrong it was malle coming out her hair no longer in a bun but about her shoulders her coat over one arm her hair shocked him she only did that when they were about to make love it was as if she were undressing in public she took his right arm with her left and pulled him close to her my god he said you want to do it here he looked about halfecstatic halfinhibited here in the park not in the open silly she said smiling and led him up the incline by the pond into the thicket of linden trees out of view she turned to him looked expectantly in his eyes pushing her thigh into him my god he said his voice a hoarse whisper in his excitement my god malle i love you i love you she said her expression unchanged and as they embraced her coat fell among the dead leaves the long hat pin piercing his heart blood spurting over her bodice staggering back wiping the hair from her eyes she picked up the coat put it on and trying not to hurry walked awaythen she was running she slowed down breathing quickly intent on not looking at all conspicuous unaware that when she had brushed her hair from her face she had left it smeared with his blood the compaccommander pacific was in his pentagon office when congressman haileys call caught up with him it was on the scrambler and the congressman was talking about a wave a nurse la roche l nee brentwood separated given the fact that her younger brother david brentwood was mia in northern germany and another brother ray excaptain of the ffg uss blaine was badly burned and undergoing restorative surgery in la jolla vets would it be possible for the familys sake to have her posted to a noncombat area to honolulu to be specific on an unrelated matter the congressman would like to get together sometime with compac to discuss increased naval appropriations from congress im afraid the admiral informed the congressman ill have to forward the request to the chief of naval operations in washington computer here says there was a disciplinary problem yeah i realize that replied the congressman little indiscretion off halifax but surely shes paid for that being posted up there in siberia anyway we still have the siblings policy dont we one missing or killed the other is called home its voluntary congressman hell said the congressman you dont think shed volunteer to get out of the aleutians well congressman we need everyone we can muster and none of admiral brentwoods children have been killed jesus shot back the congressman what dyou want one kids a goddamned monster in la jolla vets and one kids mia id say that was a fair contribution to the war effort very well congressman ill put the request through normal channels shit i dont want you putting through anything itll get lost in a sea of paper thats why im calling you when you come up for congressional approval for the post of cno im not going to be wading through normal channels ill check it out congressman fine when can i expect to hear from you oh id say a week or two jesus admiral i mean today tonight ill get back to you but i cant promise appreciate it said the congressman you boys are doing one hell of a job thank you sir when he put the phone down the admiral was shaking his head passing a slip of paper to his aide a wave la roche l what some guysll do for a bit of poontang were trying to fight a war and hes trying to get his favorite piece of tail to honolulu i thought id seen everything put it through normal channels i dont give a damn if the son of a bitch doesnt confirm me yes sir said his aide a balding worldweary officer whod served two other compacs when his boss left the aide faxed the request for a transfer to washington strictly speaking it wasnt worded as a request but the aide was long schooled in not saying what he was saying his boss could afford to take the high road at least officially but the aide knew a quick response to the congressman would do compac no harm and aide to a cno was one of the most powerful positions in the country either way compac had to deal with it he was going to get a lot more of this bullshit if the truth be known the aide thought it was probably old admiral john brentwood behind the request using the congressman as a front chapter thirtyone in the heaving darkness eleven hundred miles northeast of japan the rainlashed flight deck of the us carrier salt lake city was a roaring blaze of bluewhite light slivers of red yellow and green piercing the frenzied air the carrier battle group of ten warships centered about salt lake city was thirtysix hours less than halfway from the aleutians but its airborne screen and combat air patrols had been up since leaving the korean waters as one of the pancakerotodomed hawkeyes part of the carriers earlywarning airborne screen came in to land three twinengined electronic countermeasures prowlers were warming up for the waist catapult their bent bee stinger refueling nose rods casting strange shadows on the deck hes tired said the assistant lo the landing officer in his yellow id vest waving off a second hawkeye for another run around the plane already in its bolter pattern tired gets you killed yelled the lo hand over his extended throat mike the hawkeye was coming in again looking good for the threewire said the alo the plane approaching in low over the fantail clean trap confirmed the alo the hawkeyes nose dipping power off lurching to a stop seconds later its three moles electronic warfare operators came out arms extended grasping the shoulders of the men in front of them they were led through the blaze of light like blind men their eyes not yet readjusted after the hours of near total darkness in the windowless aft of the hawkeyes electronic cave as the seaman led them out of harms way across the hosestrewn deck greenjacketed men checked the arrester cable a blue jacket driving his yellow mule out to push the plane as quickly as possible to the parking lot another hawkeye its rotodome already up well above the fuselage turned about at the refueling station as a grape jacket with earmuffs quickly hooked up a wirewrapped pressure hose pumping a load of jp fuel into the aircraft two men green shirts sprinted through the rain to frank shirers f tomcat as he and his radar intercept officer stood by trying not to look upset the two green jerseys maintenance men flicked up an access panel and replaced a black box try it one yelled at the top of his lungs and the second man watched the cockpit as the tomcats hud lit up aok the man screamed back thumbs up thanks said shirer his voice drowned in the fury of a prowler a blast sheet up as the plane roared off the waist catapult into the raindriven night on a mission to try to protect shemya island from an ominous buildup of russian fighters and bombers at petropavlovsk on the kamchatka peninsula no one admitted to being scared they were too busy thinking about what they had to do next to submarine duty working a carriers flight deck was the most dangerous job in the navy made especially so this night by the line of squalls sweeping in all the way from the sea of japan screaming across the carriers deck the wind gusts and shears combined with the backblasts in a fierce hodgepodge of crosscurrents that could blow a man off the deck like a tumbleweed the only good thing about this night was that the smell of avgas wasnt so astringent the winds whipping fumes away as soon as they rose the first wave of fighters having taken off to go ahead and cover the carriers wild weasels the advance electronicjamming prowlers it was now shirers turn as leader of the second wave his cockpit closed the tomcats two twentythousandpound pratt and whitney turbofans in high scream preflight check completed shirer asked his rio radar intercept officer if he was all set ready to go major the tomcats light gray fuselage appeared angular ungainly from the carriers island the two intakes cumbersomely boxlike until the plane turned under the lights presenting its streamlined profile the two flyers names stenciled alongside the cockpit bright white as shirer lined her up with the starboard bow catapult track a yellow jacket both his flashlights arcing walked back as the jet fighter inched forward two redjacketed ordnance men appeared in front of the plane and shone their flashlights directly onto the tips of the tomcats sidewinder missiles through his headphone shirer heard the faint burr its sound like the rundown battery sound in a car the heatseeking missiles were now armed and live the tomcats nose settled its chin gently nudging the catapults hook as the latter was attached to the nose wheels strut across left of him through the rain and steamfilled night shirer could see his wingman lining up on the port bow catapult the twin exhausts of shirers f turbofans wailed in zone three having changed from red through crimson to bright orange harsh on the deck crews eyes and now moved to zone four purplish white and then with the engines in the high banshee of zone five the exhaust turned to screaming white circles edged in icy blue the catapult officer saw both men had hands off instruments so as not to interfere with catapult launch shirer saw the yellowclad catapult officer drop to the left knee right hand extended seaward the shooter in his dugout pushed the button shirer sucked in his breath for the kick the f shooting forward from zero to miles per hour in three seconds shirer feeling his whole body slam back into the seat ejaculated under the g force as they were hurled aloft then took back the controls the white slab of the carrier tilting crazily downhill in the rear vision flecks indicating the nine ships in the carriers screen coming up on the rios radar on the carrier where he was one of the team of professionals handling up to forty jet aircraft in various stages of takeoff loading refueling and arming on a slab of steel shorter than most commercial airport concourses a ground crew plane captain brown jacket sodden with spray and winddriven rain jumped down from checking a tomcats martinbaker rear eject seat he saw the left bow cats blast deflector up and bent down head low hand on his helmet to be on the safe side a weapons trolley low to the deck and unloaded lurched smacked him on the thigh pushing him just left of the deflector a quickthinking ordnance man hauled him down on the deck but a wind gust caught him in the slip of the jets blast and he was gone man overboard came through to the bridge the air boss in the tower kept his eyes on the planecrowded deck the two men on the situation board moving the small magnetic plane models according to their new disposition there were still twelve tomcats to launch the second wave of shirers arrowhead formation the huge ninetythousandton ship would not turn nor would it stop it was up to the rescue department to pick up the man either with its launches or silver sea king chopper hovering a safe distance off from the carrier its red and green lights blinking hardly visible however in the black void beyond the ships undulating apron of light ironically the light from the carrier so flooded the sea immediately about her hull that the plane captains saltwateractivated safety light normally quite visible in darkness was not seen the captain of salt lake city had never met him there were six thousand men aboard they called up his file from shipco ships personnel computer and gave the details to the executive officer it being his job to write the boys parents farm people in springfield missouri already sixty miles from the carrier shirer on strict radio silence checked his headup display and vectored in the present tail wind which would be against them coming back if they came back even with drop tanks carrying enough fuel for a maximum twothousandmile round trip the computer was telling shirer and his rio that they would have only four minutes over shemya island still last intelligence reports to the carrier relayed by the pickup station at adak naval station east of shemya reported that everything was quiet on shemya and that in what was a crucial game for the pennant the new york yankees had doubled the boston red sox four to two when the phone burred jay told the girl to get out of bed and go and answer it i left it in the bathroom he said you should turn it off said the girl she was seventeen consenting age jay la roche was very careful about that dont you fucking tell me what to do you little tightass said la roche using his foot to push her out of the bed he watched her walk away with an indifference bred of boredom just a moment he heard her say she brought in the phone jay snatched it cupping the mouthpiece you can go theres a hundred by the lamp we didnt even start she said no well i want a real woman you dont know your ass from your tit and put on the lock when you go out he turned back to the phone la roche here he said pulling a kleenex and wiping his nose its me said the congressman careful not to give his name that was quick so whats the story listen i did the best i could jay scrunched the kleenex into a tight ball what are you telling me congressman jesus dont use my what are you saying damn it pressed la roche throwing off the covers and getting out of bed look theres some kind of flap going on up there up where the islands compac said hed put the request through but theres nothing he can do right now she and a bunch of other nurses have been sent to some naval base hospital adak i think it was you jerkin me off no hey wait a minute i did my best you did fuck all i want results youre the big politico youd better get me results congressman or youre going to lose your friggin reelection committee i meant what i said now you get to it i want her you hear me i want her here in honolulu in a fucking week otherwise youre in the morning edition photos and all la roche slammed the phone down and looked at himself in the mirror for a few moments admiring his lean physique and how well hung he was he made his way to the bed opened a drawer in the night table and took out her photo like a brunette marilyn monroe someone had said she wasnt but her lips yes jay would give her the lips and the figure but her eyes were so different shy yet not timid how much had she changed touching the photo he got into bed and in a rage started to weep suddenly he sat bolt upright it was time to kick ass he wanted her now goddamn it she could be killed up there snatching the phone he got up and walked over to the globe on the plush burl coffee table and in the soft peach light looked to see if he could find adak christ it was just a spot in the ocean to hell and gone all hed heard about was shemya and the big earlywarning radar there what if the russians hit this adak as well as the base on shemya had anyone thought of that admiral brodskys motorcade had passed by the kadriorg park as malle was halted by the mpo guardsmen who had seen her earlier with the corporal distraught so weak shed collapsed and had to be carried out of the park where a crowd was garnering she was taken to mpo headquarters across the street in front of the old city hall and charged with murder alarm spread throughout the mpo and other occupation troops if a fiftyfiveyearold woman one of the normally passive estonians the handholders as theyd been dubbed since when theyd helped form a human chain with the other balts to protest russian hegemony could strike so wantonly and brutally against the occupying troops the situation was getting out of hand the matter was brought to admiral brodskys attention at once though the womans name was not mentioned was she a suspected saboteur he asked malkov no admiral but that doesnt mean dont tell me what it doesnt mean youve let these estonian renegades run rampant stavkas still receiving reports of dud ammunition all over the place when i initially recommended you i thought you were tough enough to put an end to it i was persuaded that the mpo could handle it better than the gru obviously i was misinformed with all due respect admiral replied malkov weve shot over six hundred hostages already in an attempt in an attempt yes but it obviously isnt working is it i believe it is comrade admiral informants are telling us for the first time that there is enormous internal pressure on the saboteurs to give themselves up for the sake of any further hostages i believe it is only a matter of days before captain malkov brodsky cut in i am officially taking over this operation he looked at his watch sixteen forty hours from now on it will revert to gru jurisdiction under my command you will be reassigned to riga headquarters malkov waited for more details but brodsky had nothing further to add when malkov stormed out to his halftrack in front of city hall his mouth was set grimly eyes brimming in such temper that his driver could tell it was going to be a bad day or rather what was left of it he hesitated to say anything at all to the captain but a call had just come through on the radio from the docks whats it about snapped malkov i dont know sir the lieutenant asked me to all right all right growled malkov give me the phone lieutenant malkov here what is it sir it seems that your hostages are cracking the silence we received an anonymous message this morning from number three shipyard six men are willing to talk but only on condition that we will recognize them as members of the estonian liberation front that is they want us to treat them as prisoners of war and no more hostages are to be shot malkov sat back in his seat the driver having overheard the conversation equally relieved tell them said malkov we will agree to that on one condition we want all saboteurs to come forward by ten hundred hours tomorrow otherwise we will continue to take hostages and they will have lost their chance from then on they would be treated as spies and shot on the spot yes sir beaming malkov handed his driver the phone to barracks igor its time for a drink yes sir the following morning at number three shipyard fourteen men and five women gave themselves up but malkov did not get the credit for it as the official documentation showed he had been relieved of his assignment at the day before the surrender was made under brodskys reign of authority furthermore malkovs agreement that they would be treated as pows had no legal standing under military law not that he had intended to keep his word anyway brodsky fed the prisoners well and told them he expected a full list of all saboteurs in three days or five hundred hostages he had ordered rounded up would be shot along with the nineteen the dam broke and over fifty names were presented to brodsky one day later brodsky signed an order that the saboteurs be sent to the shale oil fields around kohtlaj√§rve ninety miles east of tallinn i made at least twenty duds on the day i gave up declared an old man defiantly as they were taken on their way i scratched mj on them too the others obviously didnt know what he was talking about that women who shot that corporal bastard her name was malle jaakson mj see huh grunted one of the others his tone surly a lot of good itll do her or us added another but soon the tensions among them and the animosities over whether or not they should have surrendered after all were lost beneath the overwhelming fact that theyd had no choice but to give in if they didnt want to see the slaughter go on the emotional strain had been tremendous and to revive their spirits some of the oldest aboard the trucks began singing the estonian national anthem the convoy stopped for a while in the forest outside the city of rakvere and the prisoners were machinegunned as brodsky asked to sign the death warrant for the murderer of the mpo corporal and unscrewed the cap of his gold parker pen he noticed the first name of the woman was malle when he turned the page in the file and saw her photo his hand froze has this woman been interrogated he asked his aide oh she confessed the aide assured him theres no doubt about it admiral claims it was rape of course trouble is she was apparently having it off with the corporal for sometime where is she brodsky asked curtly the aide was confused where else would she be but here here sir in cells bring her to me it wasnt a forced confession sir the woman fully admitted to having bring her to me brodsky repeated the aide had never seen him so agitated the admiral rose and seemed to grow angrier by the second dont you understand a simple order he shouted yes sir immediately yes admiral the aide was utterly perplexed it was a shutandclosed case no matter what the circumstances it was murder the penalty death chapter thirtytwo sneg snow it was the one word in russian that gave pause to soviet commanders all the way from the northern reaches of the kara south to bavaria sneg nemozhet byt neytralnymsnow is not neutralwas one of the maxims of the frunze military academy only fools thought it an equal impediment to friend and foe alike snow was regarded by the russian armies with the same passionate intensity as that with which a priest might look to the holy see time and again fate had used it to preserve their destiny to deliver them from the darkest hours of their history it had defeated napoleon in and hitler at stalingrad in if you were a russian you did not complain about the snow you melded in with it became part of it used it your russian greatcoat enfolding you and you kept moving for you understood snow better than anyone on earth save the eskimos you could tell better than anyone else the temperature by the whiteblue aura of the northern light how falling powder snow was the best for attack the worst for defense whiting out ones vision the great soft billows hiding you from the enemy and muffling the sound of your tanks preceded by a barrage of over a thousand guns for two hours the soviet divisions under marshal leonid kirov led the attack on a hundredmile front against the northsouth sausageshaped pocket surging ahead with their fourtoone advantage the tanks converged in thousands refugees and tens of thousands of farm animals scattering pathetically before them with only twenty miles to go marshal kirov estimated that if all went well his forces would reach the outer defenses of the db perimeter in the next two hours the british and americans marshal kirov assured the russian premier would be dug in in defilade positions and with thermal imagers in addition to their laser range finders would take a heavy toll of soviet tanks but dug in the nato armor would be loath to risk leaving their defilade positions and revetment areas in deference to the sound military axiom that defense was easier than attack especially in such foul weather on the other hand the only pause his armor had to make reported kirov in the sudden change in the arctic front from heavy rain to snow was for some of his most forward tanks to make the switch from summer thirtyweight oil to winter tenweight this was achieved with remarkable efficiency by the crack soviet armored divisions coming down on the dortmundbielefeld pocket from the north and those coming from the far south where the tyrol was already blanketed by early snowfall the very mention of snow even to those russian troops in the green flats of the palatinate was welcome because except for the odd canadian contingent in the pocket it was more their element than the americans and british and it was this point that general marchenko pressed home to his political officers in charge of morale oh certainly the nato forces had run maneuvers in the arctic but that was a stopandstart affair compared to the russian soldiers whod been raised to it and who like those from khabarovsk knew what it was to go fishing in the icecovered lakes not for sport but for survival it was this edge kiril marchenko confidently assured the stavka that would finally tell in the soviets favor marchenko also brought them good news about the lastminute allied airlift out of heidelberg here hungarian divisions had outflanked natos southern commands wermacht divisions with such unexpected speed it was reported that paper shredders had overheated and caught fire in the haste that verged on panic during the allied withdrawal that the hungarians had achieved such a success was no surprise to marchenko and other soviets old enough to remember the hungarians tenaciousness in battle but it was around heidelberg that one of the most pervasive allied illusions was shattered namely it was the belief that because hungarians hated russians they would either turn against marshal kirovs forces or surrender in droves to the allies and yet any cold objective analysis of the prewar situation would have shown what would happen with russia literally behind them virtually holding hungary as hostage in an otherwise complex world the answer was as simple as it was brutal if the warsaw pact did not win the russians would raze eastern europe in their retreat the russians strategiya vyzhzhennoy zemli scorched earth policywould turn the hungarian plain into a slaughterhouse such as the world had never seen and which in its utter desolation as a base from which to wage war would as likely stop the allies just as it had hitler for the hungarians there was no choice better to be on the winning side in any case the west could not be relied upon the martyrs had called upon britain and america and all the other democracies to help them when theyd rebelled against the soviets in and then were brutally crushed by russian tanks as the west looked on in paralyzed horror chapter thirtythree up against the eccentric but brilliant american general freeman marshal kirov and his sector commanders were determined to avoid north koreas fate when general kims rapid advance down the peninsula outstripped his supply line which in turn had made freemans attack on pyongyang so effective indeed kirov was convinced that it was precisely this kind of spetslike interdiction that had been the intent of the american airborne drops behind his lines the shock exhibited by some of the captured american paratroopers the marshals intelligence units had told him seemed to indicate otherwise that the american airborne had simply been blown off course yes commented the marshal sarcastically just like our spets units behind nato lines blown off course and in american uniforms this got a belly laugh from the cluster of officers pressing in around kirov determined to be in the newsreel the ministry of propaganda was taking it was a decisive moment in history the impending and massive defeat of the american and british armies a certainty something that one could look back on with ones grandchildren and this time the marshal announced we wont be as stupid as hitler everyone laughed knowingly including a young colonel of artillery who really wasnt sure what the marshal meant the colonel looked about for someone lower in rank he saw a major on the marshals staff standing away from the map table hurriedly signing for receipt of motorcycleborne field reports for a headquarters it struck the colonel as being as hectic as usual an outsider would think it chaotic but it was relatively quiet given the slight radio traffic all the important orders concerning the imminent attack on the dortmundbielefeld pocket being issued and received at the marshals express order by motorcycle companies it struck the colonel as terribly oldfashioned the colonel waited until the cameraman had finished at the map table then walked over to the major what does the marshal mean about hitler normally the major would have deferred to the colonel but a headquarters major in effect outranked a field colonel you should recall your antifascist history colonel the major told him in hitler pushed the british and the french right to the sea at dunkirk they were trapped hitler could have the major glanced quickly at a requisition handed to him scribbled his signature and continued hitler could have driven them into the sea annihilated them but he didnt why not the major shrugged the fat man goering wanted glory and persuaded hitler to let the luftwaffe bomb the anglofrench into submission air force types always think bombing will do it like the american lemay in vietnam eh anyway while hitler halted his armor to let the luftwaffe have its day a british armada everything from destroyers to sailboats plucked the british and french off the beaches and took them back to england the marshal wont halt our armor colonel or our artillery youll be going all the way to ostend its the nearest port for nato withdrawal so youd better get lots of sleep once the offensive begins therell be no stopping in munster town hall its walls already scarred and pockmarked by the big longrange russian guns freeman walked past the ruins of what had been the foyer down into the basement headquarters of the dortmundbielefeld pocket which had once been used to store the city records with the cacophony of noise a babble of radio traffic of motorcycle messengers for the lines that had been cut and for the areas that had been jammed by the enemy the scene was faintly reminiscent of the blueversusred games fought in the hot stuffy headquarter tents of fort hood in texas but there was something new something he had never experienced before the smell not of men and women perspiring in high summer heat or overheated winter quarters but the vinegary stench of impending defeat heavy in the air people were moving so fast that he could see panic was gripping many only a few officers aware of his presence perfunctorily saluting his eyes took in the situation from one glance at the situation board a long snaking line of red pins marking the everexpanding easternmost front of the dortmundbielefeld pocket running north to south the diagonal crisscrosses of soviet armor creating a sharklike mouth its jaws either side of the men from the british army of the rhine bundeswehr and what was left of the us x corps trapped inside the rhine behind them its snowing heavily twenty miles east of us said a british brigadier his face drained eyes red with fatigue might slow them down a bit i should think whos commanding their northern sector asked freeman yesov believe so general answered the brigadier believe so or know so said freeman sharply taking off his gloves and helmet dropping them in the nearest in tray without once taking his eyes from the map of northern germany seeing the northernmost point of the squaremile pocket still held by the allies barely five miles away yesov confirmed the brigadier marchenkos stable said freeman taking out his reading glasses using the metal case to tap the area sixteen miles northeast of bielefeld what we have to do is kick their asses back here beyond oeynhausen across the weser may i ask what with general said the brigadier pointedly fatigue overriding caution with determination general freeman told the brigadier and tanks the brigadier was too tired to bristle at the inference restricting his utterance to a description of what he called a devil of a logistical problem spets commandos had apparently been reported in the area and the two major fuel depots for the pocket had been blown you mean were outta gas freeman said turning on him the brigadier called over his supply officer you have the figures on that petrol smythe yes sir answered the british major weve enough petrol for our most advanced tanks to run four or five miles out from the perimeter the brigadier looked down at the majors notes you said we had more than that youve lost the depot at ahlen said freeman without taking his eyes from the board you also have fewer tanks than you had yesterday nine hundred approximately the brigadier said nothing feeling he had been set up by the american to reveal the deficiency of his own intelligence reports still the brigadier was relieved that freeman was as the americans would say on the ball he was equally resentful of the fact that while elements of the united states bundeswehr and the british army of the rhine had been fighting and dying for almost five weeks in various stages of retreat since the breakthrough at fulda in the south no one outside the pocket seemed to know just how punishing this hightech war of movement had been on the allied troops meanwhile the troops waited apparently in vain for natos air forces to be resupplied enough so that they could do more than simply harass the russian armor the war they had thought would be a quick pushbutton affair wasnt quick nor was it pushbutton you pushed buttons all right but often nothing happened for all the training in peacetime the accuracy of laser beams standing in for cannon fire to save the exorbitant cost of live ammunition there was no substitute for the terrible punishment of a highexplosive shell hitting an ml s reactive armor packs which blew up and destroyed the shell but which couldnt do a thing about the jarring impact that set sensitive electronic and computer circuits awry time and again the brigadier had seen high tech fail the retreating troops as the more simple brutish russian armor kept on coming losing more tanks than the americans but with a fourtoone advantage the russians could absorb it we cant just sit here said freeman yesovs a mover not the old zhukov at all he wont wait for too much longer before he attacks hed prefer a steady buildup of men and materiel before he hits us but given this snow cover for attack he wont wait then said the brigadier hell run into our mines the british major couldnt suppress a wry smile at his superiors ready response the mine fields beyond the perimeter were ample evidence that the british army of the rhine hadnt exactly been sitting on their derrieres the brigadier had spread his hand eastward out from the bd pocket indicating the fan shape of the mine fields hell clear said freeman if i may say so general replied the brigadier i dont see how oh certainly hell use his roller and flail tanks to move ahead but thats a slow business at the best of times in this weather i grant you hell clear here and there but weve got twoman mobile antitank units to close them up again even if he gets through hell pay an awful price i daresay it would give him pause general if not stem the assault altogether you dont have to justify stopping and seeding mines rather than standing your ground general said freeman evenly it was your decision and i wasnt here but if our intelligence reports are right yesov has at least a threetoone possibly fourtoone tank advantage we can gobble up as much of his steel as we like and hell still have enough to break through spread north and south split our forces in two then eat them up just like they did at fulda russkies arent shy about repetition general if it works once theyll do it again freemans knuckles rapped an area on the map ten miles northeast of hereford reconnaissance has russian tanks converging on a twentymile front about bielefeld on a tanktotank basis freeman knew that the ms had an edge on the ts for though the russian tanks had good laser and thermal range finders the ms dug in with a much better defilade angle or what the gis called the angle of dangle freeman also knew the british brigadier had acted correctly ordering the nato tanks to dig in under camouflage nets using the mine fields as a protective moat with mobile platoons of three tanks each ready to rush any gap through the milewide mine field but if the russians should somehow break through the mine field on a wider front the dugin nato tanks would quickly find themselves surrounded and the mobile nato reserves would be in danger of hitting a nato tank for every russian t they missed the greatest danger wasnt only to the men trapped inside the db pocket but a rupture through the mines would allow yesov an end run to the rhine if they cross the rhine began freeman he did not need to say anything more but he did ordering all tanks and apcs to prepare for immediate counterattack well open the narrow channel through the mine field and break out hit them with all weve got before they roll over us freeman glanced at his watch then taking a blue marker pen from below the map slashed three broad strokes at tenmile intervals along the eastern side of the db pocket i want them ready to roll at oh four hundred general said the brigadier a word what grunted freeman a word he realized the englishman wanted to speak with him in private walking away from the babble and surging static of the ops table freeman his hands on his hips waited impatiently for the british brigadier to make his point surely the brigadier told freeman their best hope was to simply keep dug in let the storm slow the russian advance the allies best hope he argued was to effect a stalemate behind the mine field to buy time for nato reinforcements of men and materiel to hold out a few days a week even until what the brigadier flatteringly called the clear genius of the american air force to resupply by air would allow a nato buildup agitated freeman turned back to the wall map thumping it with such violence that some of the blue nato pins popped to the ground a bundeswehr corporal quickly picked them up again but not before a sudden and noticeable silence ensued as all operators eyes momentarily turned toward freeman the brigadiers jaw was clenched not in anger so much as in shock while freemans eyes far from indicating any embarrassment swept over every man in the headquarters basement now you listen to me this isnt a command post this is a goddamned tower of babel and its all about how the russians have got us on the run well were going to change that in he looked at his watch approximately six hours from now at fourteen hundred hours were going on the attack those tanks that run out of gas will siphon fuel from the apcs those men in the apcs will ride on or behind the tanks do what the russians do rig up sleds prisoner intelligence tells us ivans low on gas too recon flights show theyre carting refueling drums just as they did in all the prewar maneuvers that means gentlemen his supply lines overextended tell your battalion commanders that i want to see some initiative or tomorrow they wont be commanders ill break the sons of bitches to sergeants every goddamned one of em freeman stopped but it wasnt for breath he wanted to make sure every man in the hut had his eyes fixed on him they did now im gonna tell you something else its the last thing yesov will expect every goddamned tinhorn reporter is telling everyone that the db pocket is on its last legs he turned to the brigadier and the other british officers who had gathered to watch the mad american why last night even your bbc were telling your own people were about to fold well were not going to fold he snatched up his helmet and gloves pushing them sharply in front of him to underscore his point we are going on the offensive there was silence even the crackle of the radios seemed to have died there were no cheers no jas from the german officers present one obersleutnant lieutenant colonel commenting to his colleage kindlicher qtatsch nonsense did freeman they wondered really think that this silly american football pep talk would have any effect would he expect the headquarters company most of them career officers to be suddenly filled with elation freeman certainly didnt expect it he knew that an order to the topechelon commanding officers no matter how forcefully delivered was not enough to galvanize a dispirited army and so within minutes he was in his command humvee its driver peering through the smudge of windshield as the wipers howled heading through the blanket of softly falling snow to visit individual battalion commanders freeman noting the increase in russian artillery their distinctive thuds louder than the quieter thump of american artillery cheap gunpowder he told his aide col al banks it was almost certainly the softening up before what freeman believed would be a massive russian frontal and flank assault the nato artillery battalions were firing intermittently thensupply of ammunition dictating restraint one that could not help but be noticed by the russian divisions boosting their morale even further we have to keep telling our boys freeman shouted over the highgear whine of the humvee that concentrated fire is far more effective than blanket random fire his aide found it difficult to concentrate with the rolling crunching noise of the creeping barrage coming toward them from the russian artillery around bielefeld the racket made it even more difficult to hear freeman who as usual insisted on standing up in his humvee gripping the top of the windshield his leather gloves now covered in snow the general seemingly oblivious to the increasing menace of the enemys artillery the whistle of shot above them and the clouds of cordite burning rubber and fuel that wafting westward smudged the white curtain of falling snow freemans expression beneath the goggles was one of eager expectation looks like a kid at a fairground grumbled a gi one of the bedraggled remnants of a reconnaissance patrol making its way back wearily to their battalion headquarters hes mad said one of the loaders in a cluster of millimeter howitzers the harsh metallic aspect of the discarded shells now softening melding into a mound of virginal white as the black spaces between the brass casings filled with snow with the humvee nearing the perimeter al banks heard the splintering of timber and an eruption of black earth only a few hundred yards ahead of them his eyes like those of the driver frantically searching either side of the road for some kind of shelter the pines of the forest too close together for the humvee to hide in them the road turned sharply to the left ahead they saw a small bridge had been taken out one of the bridges elegantly carved wooden posts miraculously intact its dwarfs face smiling sweetly beneath a hikers hat capped with snow as the shelling increased banks thought that for a moment enemy intelligence must have somehow found out where freeman was and bracketed his position ordering its artillery to saturate the area the driver seeing a small foresters hut in a clearing a hundred yards to the right of the bridges ruins wasted no time in pulling the humvee off toward it the other two humvees one front and back of the generals braking and following approaching the hut freeman saw it was unlocked and what he thought was movement inside he spotted discarded ammo belts and empty cans he saw the movement again something orange drawing his pistol from the shoulder holster beneath his camouflage jacket he flicked the safety off and opened the door inside the gloom he heard a huffing sound like someone out of breath as if theyd been running then he saw a blackened face gazing up terrified from a pile of hessian sacks the soldier an american didnt move the woman her greenandbrownsplotched bundeswehr jacket open breasts rising and falling rapidly beneath her khaki tshirt reached quickly for her trousers crumpled by her side looking first at the soldier as be grunted and rolled off her she gazed up in terror at the general freeman saw the flash of dayglo orange the woman clutching her trousers sorry sir began the gi his camouflage greasepaint catching the light from the snow as he scrambled awkwardly to his feet two feet in one trouser leg falling and knocking over a pickax and shovel in the corner of the hut where the hells your squad asked freeman dont know sir we got separated the general holstered his well son finish up here and get aboard one of our jeeps were going up to the front you he looked across at the german womanand your young lady friend can come with us if that isnt too inconvenient the soldier was too frightened to answer freeman left the hut goddamn it banks he said ive been in this mans army for over forty years and the incompetence we harbor never ceases to amaze me the shelling seemed to have subsided or at least passed beyond the immediate area the humvee drivers taking the opportunity to brush off as much snow from windshields and windows as possible take a message freeman told al banks immediate and confidential saceur is it necessary to compound the danger to our fighting men by the issuance of technicolor rubbers which can be seen by the enemy at a thousand yards in snow conditions the resulting injury to our men from enemy fire would be far more hazardous than that which you seek to avoid the message puzzled both supreme allied command europe and commander in chief channel forces in northwood england until it was explained by an american liaison officer that rubbers were not erasers but american slang for condoms oh replied a brigadier oh mirth in the british officers mess aside saceur realized that the american general had a point quite apart from the fact that over percent of all casualties in all armies were due to venereal disease often higher than the casualty rate suffered in combat in any event the story of the generals encounter with the battlefield lovers swept like wildfire through the decimated ranks of american x corps and other contingents around the perimeter including those among the american airborne who had not been blown off course into enemy territory beyond the drop zone by the time the story had reached dortmund only fifty miles in the rear it was attaining mythical proportions and was completely changed the story now being that freeman comes across one of our guys humping a fr√§ulein and says what the fuck are you doing soldier well this dogface looks up at freeman and says this little honey bee if shell let me general so freeman says to his aide al youd better promote the son of a bitch any man that quick on all fours deserves a battlefield citation so his aide says you want him made a sergeant general and old freeman says you make him a lieutenant and thats an order back at his headquarters in minister freeman was told the story and though he smiled was curiously ambivalent about it on the one hand he told his aide the story would probably do more to raise allied morale in the pocket than a dozen speeches on the other hand the distortion that the story had undergone in the retelling disturbed him for it was as clear an example as youd want he told banks of how screwed up the simplest verbal exchange gets as its passed down the line no matter how sophisticated the communications equipment all the more vital in a war of rapid movement it often came to naught when messages had to be relayed verbally the general state of communication glitches that had been reported from heidelberg before it fell was one of the reasons he was so determined to reestablish personal contact with as many units as possible within the chaos of the shrinking perimeter he particularly wanted to rally the airborne who had taken a terrible beating many of them like young david brentwood who had fought with him in korea now reported missing apparently having come down on the wrong side of the drop zone well there was nothing he could do about those out of reach in the rear the media army most of them safely across the rhine were clamoring for interviews with freeman once theyd heard the fr√§ulein story freemans press aide suggested to the general that it might be prudent before he spoke to any of the reporters to rephrase his response for home consumption hell no was freemans response too busy in any case with trying to figure out how he would meet what he was sure would be yesovs massive and final assault upon the perimeter doesnt matter what you say said the general as he held out his hand impatiently for his map case newspapers screw it up anyway freeman placed his forefinger on bielefeld and moving the second finger to form a divider checked the rough measure against the maps scale it was twentyseven miles east from bielefeld to the weser river if only there were some way he could push the russians back to the river to suddenly reverse the position to buy time for nato reinforcements to pour in from the convoys that he hoped were now unloading at the british and french ports the russians had damned good leggo bridges but if they were forced to withdraw the crossing would slow them down giving the allies a vital pause so that raf usaf and luftwaffe fighters could bring all the firepower they still had from their fastdwindling supplies to bear onto the smaller concentrated areas of the bridges with hopefully devastating results you know he told his press aide without looking up from the map spread out before him that james cagney never said you dirty rat no said his aide somewhat nonplussed i didnt know that freeman ordered the dutch mobile infantry to close on what he believed would be the northernmost righthanded punch of the russian armor the dutch had always been a concern for prewar nato hq but recognizing the implications of being stationed farther away from the front line theyd made up for it developing a speed that had won the respect of even the bundeswehr well freeman told his press aide trying to boost morale with a little trivia cagney didnt say you dirty rat what he did say was judy judy judy when the press aide saw al banks walking toward the command bunker the snow was falling heavily as banks took off his coat the aide noticed he had a somber pained look about him the aide poured a mug of coffee for him and handing it over asked what the hells the general on about judy judy judy what asked banks cupping the coffee mug in his bands listen weve just got stealth infrared overflight photos that show the russians are moving in three more tank regiments under this blizzard another two to three hundred tanks jesus i think theyre just trying to frighten us said banks laughing there was a hint of fatiguecraziness to it that unsettled the press aide ts asked the aide no pts apparently well thats not as bad as the s yes it is i think the old man hates them more than the s nineties are like our ms great when everythings going great but one good bang and out go half the electronics with the s were down to vw beetles versus cadillacs sometimes the simpler the better in weather like this easier to repair said the press aide eager to show he knew more than the usual media flak yes confirmed banks pouring more sugar into the steaming coffee he could see freeman at the situation board a corporal with a plugin wire trailing from his headset writing in the estimated strength and position of the russian armored buildup with his marker pen they had been using the small magnetic block stickers the kind civilians use for sticking messages on refrigerators but theyd had a major foulup near heidelberg because the magnets on the big tote board had wiped a nearby computer disk clean the result was a rifle company misdirected and lost it was the sort of unpredictable screwup that haunted all the commanders freeman especially who confided in banks that it was the accidents of history that worried him more than the enemy the little things upon which great events can turn despite the bestlaid plans another thing about the pts said banks is theyre about half the weight of our tanks kraut leopards and british challengers included dont get stuck nearly so easily in the slush thats why the north koreans caught us with our pants down gave em the edge this wet snow isnt going to help them replied the press aide nope what we need now is it to get a damn sight colder drop well below freezing that way wed have hard ground that how we beat em in korea that and an uninterrupted supply line from japan replied banks the worry lines in his face so deep they made him look like a man twice his age if we dont get a full nato convoy through in three weeks were sunk jesus said the aide you really think well lose the perimeter banks looked down at him whereve you been larry we could lose the war if i were you id have a press release ready in case they bust through the young press aide was visibly shaken christ i didnt think it was that bad youve been reading your own press releases no one else but the old man our g and those poor bastards right on the perimeter know im just saying that meanwhile youd better cover your ass not too much about our gallant boys at the front if you pump up the public back home theyll turn on you if we get our butts kicked back behind the rhine why do you think the old man wont allow any tv cameras on the perimeter banks drained the coffee cup its going to be the biggest attack since fulda gap i dunno if i can keep the media off that said the press aide shaking his head those tv guys are pretty persistent already theres a stringer on the loose one of my guys said he put on a groundsheet no press insignia showing weve lost track of him whats his name asked banks rodriguez theres a thousand rodriguezes you have his accreditation number yes why we dont want him doing a vietnam on us not now when were down i dont see how we can stop him al hell be hard to spot i mean those handheld videos these days are no biggern a hershey bar never mind said banks you get mps out after him now banks had a faraway look in his eye i havent had a hershey bar for he couldnt remember since when and a coke he said wistfully not that goddamned flat shit they pump into paper cups i mean a bottle glass no friggin plastic just turning to ice not quite i mean just about to depression was not unknown to gen douglas freeman but it was rare he was a believer in seeing the glass halffull not halfempty as a british commander of submarines had told him in the end the best equipment could not stand up to the best morale witness the outmanned outgunned vietcong in the vietnam war and the outnumbered outradared nazi uboats in nevertheless freemans habitual optimism with which he imbued his troops like the young brentwood boy in korea was sorely tried when all stealth overflight photos of the enemy prepo sites were presented to him as his mobile humvee command post headed out for another sector of the front north of munster as the machinegunmounted jeep bumped around the bombcratered road freeman found it difficult to focus the d overlay on the latest aerial photos just taken within the last two hours perhaps he told col al banks there were the ubiquitous extra fuel drums on the soviet tanks in the photos but he couldnt spot any they had definitely been there in the photos from the earlier overflights he ordered the humvee to stop to look more closely and steadily at one of the t turrets that the stealth had picked up by infrared through the low ceiling of peasoup stratus a lot of skirting around this turret al looks like some kind of spaced or reactive armor soon as one of our shells hits it blows itself up most they get inside is a headache but damned if i can see any extra fuel drums on the back you have a look no general no fuel barrels i can see goddamn it russkies always carry extra fuel two things you know about russian armor is those bastards break down sooner than ours and their materiel support isnt anywhere as good as ours banks said nothing and the general did not speak for several minutes confirming to banks just how worried his boss was the general got out of the humvee and pulling his lambswool collar high about his neck walked ahead slapping his leg with his gloves as he turned back to the truck banks slowly keeping pace behind him the look of disgust hed had when hed gotten out was still there damn it al i just got through telling my field commanders damn it my whole strategy was based on telling our boys to pull back to defilade positions suck ivan into thinking were turning tailconserve our ammunition get those commie sons of bitches overextended till their spare fuel drums are empty then we go on the offensive hit em with everything weve got i dont understand general i thought youd be pleased theyre not hauling extra fuel tanks limits their range i know i know replied freeman his hand in the air irritably brushing bankss observation aside gas drums are normally their most vulnerable spot but in this fight theyll outnumber us al four of their tanks to every one of ours there are only so many you can stop like that then the rest are all over you no what worries me is that no auxiliary gas tanks means they dont need auxiliary tanks means theyve got lots of gas more than we thought stashed in that prepo site south of hannover the general climbed back into the humvee ive got to think of something else fast he was looking straight ahead three other humvees behind him and an armored car in front but al banks was betting that what the general was really seeing was a map of the db pocket there was a whoosh of air somewhere above them in the low cloud followed by the chatter and rattle of machine guns holy began the humvee driver his voice drowned by the feral roar of an aa missile hitting an apache gunship the bugnosed chopper momentarily visible in the orange ball of flame engulfing it the humvee driver put his foot down swung the truck away from the deep pothole and straightened it oily smoke curling toward him they hit the humvee in front of them hard on its left rear fender and rolled by the time the men in the humvees behind reached them down a steep embankment whose vegetation hid a drainage ditch the driver was bleeding badly from multiple lacerations to the face al banks was dead his neck snapped apparently in a swing blow from the barrel of the humvees swivel machine gun freeman was unconscious his left arm looking as if it was broken watch it one of the soldiers cautioned dont move him are you serious i think hes bought it answered another general the sergeant was shouting general can you hear me hes dead said one no he isnt close enough frank cmon wheres that fucking medic chapter thirtyfour outside kaesong rok major tae jumped over the irrigation ditch burst through the thinning smoke his squad automatic weapon spewing flame its tracer tattooing the nka machinegun position twenty yards from the ditch wall the us cavalryman giving him supporting fire spraying the paddy to their right the rice stalks trembling under the hail of the millimeter bullets when tae reached the machinegun post he saw it was abandoned one nka dead the top of his skull blown off the sovietmade rpk gone tae felt several spent casings they were still hot and he waved for the sixman squad from his huey to advance where the hell have they gone asked the cavalryman relieved but surprised hot damn those bastards can melt away onya tae saw one of the cavalrymen off to his left prod a dead nka down by the irrigation channel dont touch him cautioned tae the cavalryman by taes side was signaling the other sixtyodd troops behind him on the searchanddestroy mission he turned to tae they wouldnt have had time to boobytrap their dead major tae was down on one knee clipping a new magazine into his saw surveying the paddy field wisps of cover smoke still obscuring his view where the hell have they gone repeated the cavalryman underground not unless theyve got scuba suits said a sergeant moving up to join tae and the other cavalryman nothing but flooded paddy out there theyre using reeds said tae they wait till we pass then well go around it suggested the sergeant they couldve rigged sticks put in another referring to the camouflaged pits of spikes so often set by the nka so what do we do major get our feet wet sitting ducks or do we risk sticks the major ordered a fiftyfifty split half the force about thirty men in a broken line to go across the paddy the remaining thirty to sweep the flanks beyond the paddy requesting an air strike ahead of them to clear within ten minutes an f phantom came in low over the hills strafing the bush area beyond the paddy a quarter mile away and dropping two napalm canisters which turned the jadegreen countryside to orangeblack leaving the once bushy area denuded a swarm of insects had started to bother the men while they had been waiting and several in the paddy pulled on head nets over their helmets before they moved forward still tense but feeling better now that the air strike had pummeled the area before them the major was moving cautiously but was so far out front that one us cavalryman dubbed the once shy major hound dog every one of them now knew the story of his daughter being raped before his eyes and sympathized with his obsession for vengeance on the nka but they werent keen to be part of it taes obsession was making him altogether too dangerous in their eyes they slowed as they approached a second area where they saw the remains of four nka one mans limbs charcoal two of the faces black jam already seething with insects tae was annoyed the napalm had burned off all unit patches or any other kind of identification that might have confirmed they were against one of the units led by students for reunification traitors like junghyun the men on the flanks were resting on the slope up from the ditch when they heard the spitting of light machinegun fire hitting the ground no one knew where it was coming from until two cavalrymen dropped in the paddy fifty yards behind them the high waterspouts dancing amid the stalks of rice the americans around tae were unable to return the nka fire for fear of hitting their own men in the paddy and it wasnt until two more americans had been killed in the paddy and an nka was seen floating that the firing ceased seeing two of his men badly wounded staggering from the rice field the air cavalry lieutenant was on the prc calling in a medevac chopper major tae ordered the others into a tighter defensive perimeter there was a scream off to his left three men hit by a malay whip a long sixinchthick dead log rigged to a trip wire slamming down like a swing trapeze two men were killed outright the other his back broken screaming in agony someone yelling at him to shut up the lieutenant pulling a violet flare its purple smoke designating the landing zone for the chopper and also alerting any nka nearby to the americans position it was then that tae saw two badly burned nka fifty to sixty yards away crawling into unburned brush a whiff of burnt flesh and wood smoke in the air one of them tried to turn and fire what looked like an ak but either he was out of ammunition or the gun jammed the other nka all but naked save the singed rags of what had been a drab olivecolored uniform kept crawling toward the brush the cavalry sergeant caught up with him and the man though beaten was staring up eyes alive with hatred his breathing labored and wheezy eyebrows gone and a gellike pus where napalm had eaten into his left thigh but there was no mistake and tae recognized him at once junghyun his daughters onetime boyfriend and sfr activist whod turned on his own country the cavalry lieutenant could tell at one glance that tae had found his man about time eh major if tae heard he gave no indication but while the lieutenant was preoccupied with organizing covering fire for the incoming medevac tae handed his squad weapon to the sergeant then bending down drew his knife from its leg sheath the chopper was coining in sporadic nka fire erupting from the bush where is mija junghyun refused to answer tae grabbed jungs tattered collar bringing his head close to the blade once more he saw his daughter across the interrogation room the smell of her perfume and the rape as real to him as if it were happening now and for her he could not kill jung as he stood up in the stinging dust of the medevac chopper whose rotors were beating the air into a maelstrom about him taes anger at his inability to do that for which he had stayed alive overwhelmed him and he kicked jung in the side jungs body rolled there was an explosion taes body seemed to jump sending him crashing into the sergeant the grenades shrapnel killing the sergeant outright and mangling taes feet his boots shredded with splintered bone streaming blood in the american camp south at uijongbu the instructors used it as an example of how an officer tae well trained and knowledgeable about booby traps had in a case of what the instructor called emotional overload forgotten the very thing hed just told a us air cavalryman a few minutes before never move close in to an nka body live or dead one of the oldest nka tricks in the book was to pull a grenades pin and shove it under the weight of your body as soon as youre moved down goes the striker boom had it not been for the medevac getting tae to a field hospital within half an hour said the instructor the rok major would have lost his life rather than having to be in a wheelchair for the rest of his life would have been better off said one of the pupils chapter thirtyfive schnell quickly shouted one of the stasi guards the pow column had slowed momentarily while a salvo of highexplosive shells whistled overhead every one of the british and american soldiers hitting the forest floor the guard was waving an akm submachine gun its black folding butt and tangent sight a stark contrast to the falling snow the powder snow had stopped for a while over the northernmost part of the teutoburger wald and now with the temperature only slightly above freezing the flakes were big and damp disappearing on contact into the blankets that were being worn as capes by many in the column who had had their uniforms taken by the spets now with other prisoners being picked up along the way the british and american column being forcemarched to gobfeld eighteen miles north of bielefeld and forty miles southwest of hannover had swelled to more than three hundred men as much as the prisoners resented the bullying guards most of them like david realized that ironically in the russians haste to move the pows out of the way of their advancing echelons of armorled troops and motorized regiments the stasi guards were in fact keeping some allied prisoners alive who would have otherwise died from hypothermia had they been allowed to stop for any length of time even so the cockneys earlier comment to david brentwood and waite that they were all for the high jump executionmade the prisoners reluctant to keep up the punishing pace hope the bastard thats got my uniform is warm complained a us engineer im sure as hell not least youve got your boots mate said fred waite the british private who had teamed up with david brentwood least your twinkies wont fell off speak for yourself anyway schweig dock yelled a guard shut up your fucking self said waite turning to brentwood his breath steaming the air that krauts getting on my tit brentwood said nothing glancing anxiously about as another stream of pows thirty or so americans up ahead were being melded into the main column heading for gobfeld for a moment david thought he recognized thelman but the main pow stream quickly swallowed up the new additions before brentwood could know for sure dizzy like so many of the other prisoners from lack of food and sleep and the effects of the cold david found it necessary to muster all his strength merely to keep going in the column nevertheless he tried to increase his pace easy davey old son cautioned waite his breath no longer visible in the air his body losing the battle not the world cup you know thought i saw a buddy of mine answered david yes well relax husband your energy old son thats the waite wanted to say ticket but couldnt go on gasping for air like an exhausted swimmer brentwood took the englishmans left arm and draped it about his shoulder taking his weight you okay fred no schnell schnell one of the guards yelled soon joined by several others shouting at the stragglers on the flanks brentwood heard the shouts of an altercation several yards behind them the snow muffled the tramp of the column and the voices seemed unusually loud bouncing off the pine trees schnell the guard kept shouting brentwood saw it was the englishman with the badly injured eye the bandage had slipped down from his eye the blood now a dark plum color against the snow the man was sitting on a stump winding up the bandage and telling the guard to stuff it several prisoners stopped including david and within seconds it was looking ugly a feldwebel was running down the side of the column with two other guards trying to keep up with him other guards yelling for prisoners to stay in column prisoners retorting some of them derisively clapping the stasi guards run girls run you sausage guts the feldwebel stopped by the englishman drew his pistol and ordered the man to get up the englishman refused and the feldwebel shot him there was silence then a bulge of prisoners forming around the dead englishman his bandage fallen like a streamer in the snow guards either side of the feldwebel held cocked sudayev submachine guns suddenly david saw thelman fifty yards ahead of him also looking back at what was going on the tension hung in the air like icicles the feldwebel shouted and a few prisoners shuffled forward the outrage still thick in the air but the submachine guns were staring the prisoners down at pointblank range any soldiers stopping shouted the feldwebel will be shot you understand christ said waite the bottom seeming to drop out from what david had thought was the englishmans reservoir of high morale im im for the knackers confessed waite like bloody running downhill once you slow down youre buggered david had tried to get thelmans attention but he had disappeared into the column in front of a tall flyer one of the glider pilots whod overshot munster coming down too close to the teutoburger wald as the pow column emerged from the wood a few miles south of gobfeld the prisoners were surprised to see a convoy with ten olivegreen army trucks with russian markings on the rear bumper bloody ell said waite his teeth chattering as they were ordered aboard the trucks this is more like it yeah came a doubting voice from behind where are they taking us if they wanted to do us in mate said another englishman they could have done it in the woods the doubting voice was silenced but waite himself gave david a very cool practical reason why the woods wouldnt have been a place of execution not enough open space to bury three hundred of us unless they used dozers as if to underscore his point waite now remarked on the fact that they were loading the dead englishman onto one of the trucks no evidence said waite take cover shouted one of the prisoners three thunderbolts terrifyingly close to the ground swept out of the cloud above the trees a short burst from the lead gau cannon its rotary barrel spewing a narrow cone of thirtymillimeter tracer exploding three trucks in less than two seconds the men aboard the trucks half of them on fire dropped from the tailgates rolling in the snow at the roadside the other two thunderbolts pilots so near they were plainly visible as they whooshed by withheld their fire the moment they recognized allied pows waving them offnatos thunderbolts supply of thirtymillimeter tankkilling ammunition dangerously low due to the heavy convoy losses the stasi guards short of trucks now were already quickly selecting the fittest of those who had survived loading them onto the other vehicles david brentwood and waite already on one of the other trucks in the middle of the column found themselves squashed hard against the vehicles cabin by the press of newcomers stumbleass it was thelman face lighting up the moment he spotted brentwood schweig dock shouted one of the four guards assigned to the truck but in the confusion no one took any notice buddy of mine explained david grinning for the first time in the last seventysix hours we were at parris island together same di called me stumbleassthelman thelma he was a son of a bitch charming said a cultured english voice when they reached gobfeld the convoy roared on through the town thought someone said we were stopping here youve been misinformed old boy came the english voice were going to a holiday camp in stadthagen wheres that seven miles farther on i believe as the truck bumped its way north over the artilleryscored road snow started falling again but this time more densely than before whats in stadthagen fritz asked one of the americans the guard said nothing anyone speak kraut asked someone else the cultured english voice which brentwood could now see belonged to a junior lieutenant in the royal engineers owned up to knowing a few words of german in fact he was fluent and the rest of the men fell silent so that he could talk to the guard but it was still difficult to hear above the high whine and rattle of the convoy he says the englishman reported to his eager audience that there are no girls in stadthagen and that it will be hard work what will be the englishman asked the guard to be more specific he says there is a store there a very big store macys suggested thelman harrods said another david was pleased to see the morale picking up now that they were off their feet at least for a while and in the relative warmth of the truck even if they were destined to work hard at whatever it was in stadthagen i think proffered the english engineer that he rather means stores i should think hes alluding to a prepo site of some kind did we have one at stadthagen he looked about the truck yes answered a british lance corporal wearing the insignia of raf ground crew ruddy great petrol dump ah said the engineer then chaps well roll out the barrel and well have a barrel of fun a few voices chimed in but the hilarity collapsed beneath the rumble of more massed soviet artillery than any of them had heard before chapter thirtysix in pitch darkness flying low over the sea six hundred miles southeast of mednyy island the smaller of the two windswept komandorskiyes or commander islands col sergei marchenkos attack wing of fourteen mig flogger ds with three drop tanks apiece were now turning due south toward adak island seventy miles away with a jagged rugged coastline and topography the us island one of the aleutians chain of fortysix volcanoes looked large enough on the map but in reality it was at no point more than twenty miles wide marchenko was glad they were on satellite navigation at their attack speed it wouldnt take more than two minutes for the entire wing to pass over the island with almost half their fuel for the mile round trip gone they would have approximately five minutes over adak naval station from the initial aiming point of the thirtysixhundredfoothigh mount moffett if all went well they would drop over ninetytwo thousand pounds of iron and laserguided bombs on the remote american submarine base a half hour later adak radar out one thousand spets paratroopers already in the air aboard seven candid transports from both mednyy and beringa in the komandorskiyes would be chuted into the remains of adak to take over the bombgutted submarine listening and provisioning base that threatened the entire soviet east flank it would be strictly hitandrun with high losses expected and though sergei marchenkos wing would not run from a fight the orders from stavka via khabarovsk command were very specific no aircraft were to be sacrificed in dogfights with either the advance us carrier screen fighters or the relatively few american fighters on adak dogfights usually meant going to afterburner and fuel suddenly sucked up at twenty times the normal rate leaving the floggers with insufficient fuel to make the return journey to lend weight to stavkas order sergei marchenko during engine startup on mednyy strip had stressed that even if the enemy carrier salt lake city picked up the migs departure from the komandorskiyes on satellite the range to and from the american carrier meant that the danger of running low on fuel would be as much a problem for the americans from the carrier battle group as it was for marchenkos wing though the american jets had greater ranges than their soviet counterparts the americans had farther to come and could afford only a very short time over the aleutians this was particularly so given the fact that the americans would most likely be drawn away from adak by the feint of nine shorterrange but faster mig fishbeds now approaching shemya four hundred miles west of adak hopefully all the enemy fighters between adak and shemya would be drawn in the americans logically assuming that as the prelude to any soviet invasion of the aleutians the first soviet target would be the massive earlywarning radar arrays on shemya which was only miles from the kamchatka peninsula icbm sites four hundred miles east of adak one of the huge phased radar arrays on shemya looking like some great wedge of black cheese in the night was picking up six surface vessels either big japanese trawlers or possible hostiles they were bearing at a distance of miles coming in behind them at five hundred feet were nine blips traveling at mach undoubtedly fighters to cover a possible invasion force wondered shemyas co there were other unidentified aircraft shemya had been tracking but they had been much slower possibly a longrange reconnaissance subhunting force in any case they had now passed into adaks radar envelope well to the east the co quickly turned his attention back to the faster blips and the six ships if it was an invasion force it was a small one on the other hand if the ships were chopper and vtol vertical takeoff and landing fighter carriers it would constitute a major fleet attack the commanding officer or gatekeeper as he was known because of shemyas strategic importance was taking no chances he ordered eight f phantoms aloft to intercept the suspected hostiles withholding his fourteen much faster swingwing ffs in the event of other attacks that might be coming in on the deck successfully evading his radar to the north south and west of him the thing that puzzled co shemya most was that if the soviets were going to try to take out shemyas earlywarning capability why hadnt they used an attacking force of their longrange supersonic blackjack swingwing bombers the duty officer however turned to the vast triangular area of ocean covered by shemya in the west adak four hundred miles to the east and the salt lake city carrier force nine hundred miles south he pointed out that it wasnt enough merely to knock out the radar station on shemya you had to occupy it and make sure it stayed that way otherwise the us navy would immediately send in their seabees to repair the damage this convinced the co that his first hunch was right that the six blips and accompanying fighters were an initial invasion force coming at him to be followed by many more once and if the base was secured he ordered engine start for the fourteen ffs carrying the combinations of iron bombs and tvguided maverick airtosurface missiles in fact the commanding officer was halfright about the soviets using blackjack bombers six of them from the kurile islands base south of kamchatka peninsula each replete with over thirtyfive thousand pounds of bombs the most sophisticated electronics in the soviet air force and with a range of over eight thousand miles were now approaching the salt lake city battle group far to the south of the aleutians their crews were in high spirits after having so badly mauled the japanese defense fleet the day before and knowing that over half the salt lake citys fighter screen was well away from them flying combat patrols to cover possible attacks on shemya chapter thirtyseven two hundred miles south of ireland a bulge suddenly appeared on the surface of the dark blue celtic sea the next moment the bulge erupted in a phantasm of white the boomer in this case the uss roosevelt bursting through the surface white smoke as well as spray pouring from her from a fire in her aft engine room where the crew had been working on the moss no one knew exactly where the electrical short had occurred as several of the monitoring circuits were themselves out of action following the severe concussion of the yumashevs depth charge attack it was the submariners worst nightmare and robert brentwood knew that the acrid smoke pouring from the subs sail would alert the enemy for a hundred miles around yet he was the epitome of calm as he kept his men moving through control up the sail where he had posted his executive officer if the fire was uncontainable he had to get as many men as possible out and into the inflatables before setting the destructive charges that would be sure to destroy codesafe and disks along with the sub in any event with the carbon dioxide scrubber system out of action the men had to get fresh air several offwatch crewmen asleep when the fire had broken out were unable to get their masks on in time and were asphyxiated by the highly toxic fumes in the face of their loss the thing brentwood was most proud of as he stood in control overseeing the evacuation through the dense smoke was that there was no panic he might have been a coach welcoming his team back to the dugout after a losing but hardplayed game up in the sail executive officer peter zeldman saw men were also coming out of two of the sixfootdiameter hatches one forward above command and control the other leading up from the reactor room but no one as yet was exiting the stern hatch above the turbinedrive space and he reported this to brentwood brentwood knew there was a fiftyfifty chance that the firefighting party having sealed themselves off in one of the fortyone cylinders that welded together formed the sub might extinguish the flames if they could get in quickly enough behind the panels but as captain he couldnt have taken the chance of staying submerged with the lives of over men in his hands he called up to zeldman officer of the deck i want every available man on deck acting as a lookout dont load the inflatables till you get my word every man a lookout dont load inflatables aye sir next brentwood called through to the chief of the boat in charge of battling the fire what are we looking at back there chief a young voice came on rising above the hollow roar of the fire sir this is electricians mate richards the chiefs brentwood waited either the circuit had gone or the seaman had also been overcome by the toxic fumes a defective mask seal the mask knocked askew by falling lagging anything could happen brentwood pulled a man out of the line of sailors waiting to go up to the sail and guided him toward the ladder give me your mask sailor brentwood informed zeldman he was going aft so that should anything happen to him zeldman would take over give me five minutes pete brentwood instructed five minutes aye sir mind how you go brentwood strapped on the mask his throat already raw from the smoke his voice nasal inside the mask as he entered the smokechoked passageway on your left make way on your left as he walked through sherwood forest the smoke was swirling thickly about the huge missiles like the set of some fantastic opera chapter thirtyeight by the time the bulk of mount moffett the initial aiming point fifty miles away started dipping green in sergei marchenkos headup display the flogger d automatically started to climb in preparation for bomb release knowing he was going to be in full view of adaks radar as he gained altitude marchenko released his khlam as did the other thirteen fighters in his wing the chaff aluminized glass fiber strips cut to lengths corresponding to those of adaks radar band immediately started sowing havoc with adaks radar the screens a frantic dance of fly shit as the fourteen soviet fighters passed between mount moffett massive but invisible on their right and the twothousandfoot mount adagdak to their left marchenko saw the snowframed mirror of andrew lagoon racing toward him and beyond it the soft glow of the marker fire indicating the command and control center of the naval base below off to his left he could see long arcs of red and white tracer disappearing eastward over the black void of kulak bay though marchenko only glimpsed the trawler intermittently in flare light reflected off the snowy peaks surrounding the icy blue crescent of the bay he was more aware than any of the other pilots of how much they owed the crew of the trawler for having set the bonfire marker and now firing grail missiles at virtually pointblank range into the kulak bay defenses despite his high state of tension marchenko was content to let the flogger d have its head trusting entirely to its contourmatching radar its computer automatically selecting wavelengths to be different from those being jammed it was at once exhilarating and frightening he saw the target growing on his infrared screen and took over the controls adak base directly ahead its cluster of long huts all the same in appearance looking in the snow surprisingly like a camp hed seen in the gulag between the huts there were shimmering figures people running for cover the computer had already selected the floggers exit trajectory the shortest vector away from the point of bomb release as the large sub base its pens outlined now on the infrared tv screen above the main instrument panel came in on the zoom frame immediately below the larger screen he felt the shock wave bumps of antiaircraft fire but ignored them releasing only when he heard the bip bombs released turning hard right he heard the chatter of american voices on the radio spotted an american tomcat in his hud and went airtoair the american passed out of sight above the sudden light of the exploding inferno beneath them that had been adak naval station marchenko turned left rolled hard right trying to center another tomcat a wing edge slipped into his hud he fired a missile but the american had gone down and now was probably going around trying to get into the floggers cone to take him out from behind he saw another tomcat on his radar coming for him then breaking off down for a stern conversion he went to afterburner and climbed high shirers tomcat was on warning yellow weapons hold status fourteen miles from adak having been halfway to shemya before they heard adaks call for assistance master arm on he told his rio in the backseat centering the t bogeys ten miles centering the dot bingo it was his wingman on the halfway fuel mark breaking off to head back to the carrier there was a rush of static then the rios voice came through you got the tone to confirm whether the tomcats sparrow missile was ready got it answered shirer centering the dot fox shirer felt the twelvefoot sparrow release bogey at three oclock called the rio bogey shirer hit the afterburner the rio felt the sudden g like steel against his chest shirer saw another bogey climbing fast crossing his huds green lines he centered fox this time a sidewinder took off from the tomcat heading for the floggers exhaust angels said the rio telling shirer they were at two thousand feet shirer hit the afterburner again the steep wall of fire that was adak base slipped downhill from him into the darkness he was in cloud he glimpsed the flames again they were making tiny shadows on the fading patch of snow as he entered more cloud the flogger d had exploded its orange ball curling to black outstanding the rio yelled thatll there was a ragged crimson streak in front of them a flogger ds sixbarreled rotary cannon spitting out twentythreemillimeter tracer a tomcat exploding to shirers left the flogger d passed into shirers hud for only a millisecond but shirers reaction was automatic the tomcat slid its rotary cannon in the port side erupting in a long bluewhite flash the reflection dancing madly in the cockpit a sound like tearing canvas then the tomcat went crazy shirer doing everything he could but realizing he was quickly slipping into an inverted spin eject he shouted to the rio through his mike as he tried every trick he knew released the break chute nothing worked as the plane continued yawing pitching and rolling simultaneously its engine flamed out the blood roaring from feet to head eject he yelled again elbows in head tucked he pulled the release felt the kick of the rocket assist then blacked out an f and flogger collided over andrew lagoon as the four fs that adak had scrambled tried to beat off the surprise lowlevel soviet attack two of the remaining three fs in the flight were destroyed on the davis runway the other one was destroyed by one of the tomcats sidewinder missiles after having been mistaken for a sukhoi fitter c which like the f was also a singleengined fighter the engagement involving all planes had lasted minutes the adak base by kulak bay gutted rendered ineffective in the light of the fires from the oil and food stores those among the two thousand civilian and military personnel still alive saw the shoreline around the cshaped bay littered with the bodies of hundreds of dead fish and gannets some of the birds coated with the sheen of highoctane from the ruptured storage tanks but most of the wildlife killed by the concussion of several offtarget bombs exploding in the bay the commanding officer of adak was trying to contact shemya four hundred miles to the west and dutch harbor about five hundred miles to the east but could reach neither meanwhile the duty officer was informing him that the sosus the underwater hydrophone sound surveillance system was out whether the underwater arrays themselves about the island had been damaged by depth bombs or whether it was the connection between shore and the arrays that was the problem there was nothing but garbage coming in adak was on its own then our first priority is to get those fires out replied the co unless we do well all die of exposure in this weather contact our wave contingent and see what they can rig up if the hospital huts are gone and make sure every available pump hose is sir there was a crackling noise in the distance above the noise of the nearby fires whats that demanded the co probably the aleut shacks that are by god said the co that sounds like smallarms fire to me it was the first sign they had that soviet paratroops were descending on adak chapter thirtynine robert brentwood and the chief of the boat collided outside roosevelts galley the smoke so thick they couldnt see more than a few inches in front of them but the fire was out and a sixinch coil suction hose was rigged to the hatches to vent the smoke am i glad to see the chief began but couldnt continue his coughing going into a dry retch come on chief said brentwood lets get topside with everyone else as the chief and his firefighting party emerged from the forward hatch there was a smattering of clapping on the deck and the sound of several sailors being violently seasick in the heavy swells that were slopping over the roosevelts deck the moment his gas mask was off brentwood looked skyward and at the whitish silver of horizon between the sea and cumulonimbus that was piling up like bruised ice cream heading farther away from them in the direction of the bay of biscay officer of the deck sir responded zeldman soon as we clear this smoke get everyone below im going down to assess damage chief says our automatic scrubbers have had it but we can break out crystals run a few days on those even at three and a half knots we should get to holy loch in another seven days i think the water supply will at the same time as the roosevelts lookouts spotted them brentwood also saw the long line of more than thirty ships southeast of them the subs surface radar not having picked them up because its circuit like that for the passive underwater sonar receivers had been shut down due to the fire once they got under way the consoles would be operational brentwood felt strangely calm yet vulnerable the rolling deck twentyfive feet below him more than ever looking like some great whale pushed back and forth by the gray swells on the other hand there was the disadvantage that the subs position was almost certainly known now by satellite bounceoff for even without infrared their smoke trail had now spiraled thousands of feet above the celtic sea it was an unenviable situation as his father would have said wryly knowing that now he would almost certainly come under attack brentwood decided to rule out any thoughts of reaching home port at holy loch well set course for falmouth he instructed zeldman even with our present dragass three and a half knots we should make it in plus or minus fiftyfive hours a hell of a lot sooner than if we tried holy loch now weve been spotted maybe no ones picked us up yet said zeldman right pete and elephants fly well said zeldman indicating the line of ships on the horizon weve received no fire from them which is why we know theyre ours theyre not the ones im worried about pete its what we havent seen that concerns me the lookout was reporting two sheffieldclass british destroyers in the horizon line confirming brentwoods hunch very well responded brentwood and for a moment seeing as their smoke was undoubtedly being picked up above cloud level by satellite brentwood elected to use the abovewater highfrequency antenna for a quick transmit to saclant supreme allied commander atlantic via acchan allied commander channel to arrange for a tow as soon as possible to reduce their transit time to falmouth for a moment it struck brentwood that it was possible the war had ended between the time roosevelt had been attacked by the yumashev and now the reply from saclant decoded in seconds immediately disabused him of any such notion a tow could not be sent for at least four days and roosevelt was instructed by saclant via sat bounce from norfolk virginia that she was to maintain her position and provide a defensive umbrella in the area for the convoy now only seventeen hours from the port of brest in the bay of biscay the war message stressed the db pocket was so critically short of supplies that several squadrons of natos thunderbolts were waiting at brest unable to fly effective missions against the russian armor because of the lack of thirtymillimeter depleted uranium ammunition the message ended imperative you give max assist to convoy convoy notified i thought said zeldman the royal navy would have the channel approaches bottled up obviously not old boy said brentwood in a bad imitation of an upperclass english accent course added zeldman the russians will have come out from kola around the top captain it was the chief we have three casualties aft lost em in the smoke coming out all right chief take the tags have a deck party put them by the hatches then back quick as you can deck party to put casualties by the hatches aye sir the chief didnt hesitate it might seem to others a cruel decision but roosevelts job was to fight and she needed all tubes free for firing to help make up for her lack of speed and helm response time zeldman was on constant lookout as the deck party heaved the body bags up through the hatches and laid them on the deck they were in what the nato sub captains called sarancha gulch saranchas being the fast small missile boats operating from milch cow auxiliary mother ships highly maneuverable and bristling with surfacetosurface sixtymilerange n missiles and surfacetoair n missiles the boats were perfectly suited for this kind of lastminute attack around the bay of biscay and the other western approaches before the convoys reached brest or the relative safety of lands end falmouth and the channel as zeldman came down the ladder into control he heard the hatch close behind him a seaman beginning the holy litany of the dive officer of the deck last man down hatch secured zeldman took up his position as officer of the deck last man down hatch secured aye captain the ship is rigged for dive current depth one ten fathoms checks with the chart request permission to submerge the ship very well officer of the deck said brentwood submerge the ship submerge the ship aye sir zeldman turned to the diving console diving officer submerge the ship submerge the ship aye sir dive two blasts on the dive alarm dive dive the wheezing sound of the alarm followed loud enough for the crew in control to hear but not powerful enough to resonate through the hull a seaman shut all the main ballast tanks all vents are shut vents shut aye a seaman was reading off the depth fifty fiftytwofiftyfour one of the chiefs watching the angle of dive trim and speed reported officer of the deck conditions normal on the dive very well diving officer confirmed zeldman turning to brentwood captain at onethirty feet trim satisfactory very well answered brentwood steer four hundred feet ahead standard zeldman turned to the helmsman helm all ahead standard diving officer make the depth four hundred feet they were just flattening out at when brentwood heard sonar contact possible hostile surface warship bearing two seven eight range fiftythree miles brentwood turned calmly to the attack island very well man battle stations man battle stations aye sir repeated a seaman pressing the yellow button a pulsing f sharp slurring to g sounding throughout the ship brentwood turned to the diving officer diving officer periscope depth periscope depth aye sir brentwoods hand reached up taking the mike from its cradle without even looking this is the captain i have the con commander zeldman retains the deck beneath the purplish blue light over the sonar consoles the operator advised range fiftytwo point six miles classified surface hostile by nature of sound up scope ordered brentwood ahead twothirds scopes breaking said one of the watchmen scopes clear brentwoods hands flicked down the scopes arms and eyes to the cups he moved around with the scope on the compac screen zeldman could see the dot moving so fast at forty knots it had to be a hydrofoil brentwood stopped moving the scope bearing mark range mark down scope above the soft whine of the retracting periscope brentwood reported i hold one visual contact range fortyfour point five miles came the reply placing the hostile fortyfour miles northwest of roosevelt the convoy ten miles to the southeast the sub was between them but brentwood had a problem to fire a cruise missile with its nuclear warhead was out of the question unless he wanted to start a nuclear war and yet the subs stateoftheart mark torpedoes had a maximum range of twentyeight miles with the hostile still over forty miles away he would have to wait to make matters worse it was unlikely that the convoy had seen the hostile their sonar not as good as the subs their radar not picking up the hostile which because of its small size would be lost in sea clutter range every thousand yards ordered brentwood range every thousand yards aye sir range ninetyone thousand yards ninetyonethousand yards confirmed brentwood the hostile would have to close to at least fortyfive thousand before he could fire at its present speed this would be in minutes however it was now that robert brentwood showed why he had been chosen as the skipper of the uss roosevelt officer of the deck confirm moss tube number moss in tube number two sir very well angle on the bow said brentwood port four point five check came the confirmation range asked brentwood ninety thousand yards ninety thousand yards repeated brentwood firing point procedures master four five tube one firing point procedures aye sir master four five tube one aye solution ready weapons ready ship ready final bearing and shoot master four five the sonar operator announced the roosevelt was now bearing three four nine speed four up scope ordered brentwood bearing mark down scope the firing control officer responded stand by shoot fire said the shooter pushing the lever forward the firing control officer watched the screen the torpedo running monitored the tension in control was palpable no one spoke except for the sonar operator reading off the range watching intently to see if the hostile would go for the bait of the moss mobile submarine simulator its sound disk having been altered according to brentwoods orders to duplicate the new sound signature of the roosevelt following the yumashevs depth charge attack that had bent its prop the hostile vector was unchanged the sonar operator now confirming its signature as that of a sarancha hydrofoilarmament one thirtymillimeter multibarrel closein gun four surfacetosurface siren antiship missiles two surfacetoair n missiles then suddenly its radar dot seemed to blur as it changed course heading to intercept the moss it went to a small dot then shuddered on the screen the sonar operator announcing hostile has fired surfacetosurface trajectory two seven four the siren was streaking toward the convoy several hundred miles to the north james g wilkins having been arrested and brought to london for trial now found himself standing in the dock in londons old bailey looking ashenfaced before a jury as he heard the verdict of guilty he was convicted of fraud the money he was stashing at home being kickbacks from several shipping companies whose marine loss claims as the magistrate pointed out were assessed by mr wilkins as being substantially higher than in fact they were the difference between the claim paid by the government to the shipping companies and the actual value of the goods lost had been split by what his lordship described as a mutually convenient agreement between the defendant and various members of the mercantile establishment rosemary spence was there out of some vague sense of responsibility toward young graham wilkins who although he had clearly charged his stepfather out of malice and had been wrong about any spying had nevertheless enabled the government to arrest and convict a war profiteer and to make an example of him the magistrate sent him down for three years and three on probation and commended inspector logan of the oxshott surrey constabulary mrs wilkins looked relieved more fun with the milkman now melrose told logan as they walked out of the central courts i suppose so said logan cant say i envy him she seems a hard woman the sons the hard one put in perkins didnt even blink when the beak sentenced his old man stepfather though logan corrected him not his real pater still put in melrose youd think hed show some emotion the schoolteacher the spence woman she was more upset than anyone well said logan shes the type worrywart see it a mile away cool outside but underneath quite churned up i expect probably worried about her boyfriend commented perkins engaged to some yank i believe navy type ah said logan as if that made everything clear well then that explains it separation and all bad days for the navy dicey business on the water how about you melrose you a sailor no sir actually melrose had done some sailing in his youth but he was so shocked from logan getting his name right at last he didnt really think about the question you and i wont be needed then said logan knowingly perkins glanced across at melrose and shrugged ostend continued logan thats where well be pulling them off this time nearest port to the pocket you think its that bad inquired melrose yes i do im afraid thats one thing ill say about old professor knowlton he faces facts professor knowlton laughed melrose isnt he the old bloke who keeps on about hair dryers conserving electricity on the home front et cetera that old bloke as you so impudently call him constable knows what hes about mark my words logan dropped his voice looked around and continued just between you me and the gatepost i can tell you all about that hair dryer business oh said melrose winking at perkins yes said logan harriers he said it as if the word alone would explain all harriers said perkins willing to go along as he eyed two young beauties emerging from barclays bank yes going to be the rafs last defense the way the russians are knocking out our airstrips you know how they put the wings on harriers stitch em on i should think answered perkins dont be bloody clever said logan theyre made of carbon wafer special epoxies among other things stuck together found the same thing with the new models as with the original harriers the drying i mean has to be done by hand you see its a craft just cant stamp them out like ruddy milk bottles you re joking said perkins i most certainly am not without enough hair dryers we dont have enough harriers theyre more important to us than the spitfire was in the last show crikey said melrose so the old blighter isnt so potty after all logan eyed him irritably just because you get to retiring age melroad your brain doesnt stop working of course not sorry inspector logan slowed as he neared the entrance to the tube station at the risk of sounding immodest melroad youll note that this old bloke he pointed to himself wasnt so dim that he couldnt crack this wilkins case no conceded melrose youre right there sir tooraloo said logan heartily heading down into the temple underground station melrose touched his cap in farewell smiling and muttering to perkins no you silly old twit you just nick villains instead of spies minor detail i think ill get my name tattooed on my forehead think hell remember then perkins shook his head doubt it melroad the air raid sirens were starting up again and people were running for the shelters at the beginning of the war theyd affected a traditional british calm and disdain for any panic but this time it was very different the rockets so fast you had absolutely no idea where they would hit a bit like the old vs logan had told him only much worse hang on melrose called out to a couple of callow youths almost running an elderly woman down in their eagerness to get below suddenly the underground sign vibrated the railing below it shaking people were falling and in the distance above the mall there was a high spume of brick and sandstone now falling in a deafening hail bit close to the palace commented perkins as they hurried without trying to appear as such into the shelter outside blackfriars station what do you think i think it was the palace bloody ell they should have left london like they were told what and leave everyone else to take the shit while theyre nice and comfy up in windsor not bloody likely im no monarchist mate but thats one thing ill say about old charles hes no coward heading for oxshott the train rosemary was on stopped near wimbledon during the rocket attack the engineers had found that the soviet pilots always favored a moving train assuming that because it was moving it was carrying vitally needed supplies to try to stem the impending catastrophe in northern germany but rosemary believed that the feet that the enemy pilots went after moving passenger or goods trains had less to do with strategic considerations than the fact that a moving target was more exciting to kill the mere thought that robert was at the center of such hazard at sea overwhelmed her and when the conductor asked for her ticket and she discovered shed lost it she burst into tears what made it even more terrible was that in that moment she was sure she felt their baby move which she knew was impossible so early in her pregnancy up scope ordered brentwood ahead onethird scopes breaking scopes clear in the scopes circle brentwood could see an orange speckle one of the convoys screen destroyers afire its crew abandoning ship he swung the scope about and saw the sarancha at its full speed of sixty knots its hull clear out of the water foilborne the boat was obscured by a cocoon of spray in weaving pattern closing on the convoy behind it were three more well thought brentwood marks can weave too angle on the bow he said port point four zero check came the confirmation range asked brentwood forty thousand yards very well replied brentwood firing point procedures master four zero tube three firing point procedures master four zero tube three aye solution ready weapons ready ship ready final bearing and shoot master four zero a seaman announced bearing three four one speed six up scope ordered brentwood bearing mark down scope the firing control officer responded stand by shoot fire came the confirmation as the shooter pushed the lever forward the firing control officer watched the screen and confirmed the torpedo was running and being monitored roosevelt repeated the procedure three more times one after another the dots of the saranchas on the screen swelled then vanished because of roosevelts interception only five transports in forty were lost the remainder safely reaching brest as the gray dawn fog swirled about the aleutians scurrying over the spindrift like the cape of some primeval beast about to devour the islands the fighting on adak was confused and bloody because of the natural amphitheater on the northern part of adak island formed by mount moffett and mount adagdak only four hundred of the two thousand civilians and military personnel escaped injury those not killed outright by the blockbuster bombs used to destroy the runway which filled the air with everything from auto to fistsized concrete fragments traveling at hundreds of miles an hour fell victim to the cluster bee bombs which opened up midfall releasing hundreds of smaller bombs each in turn filled with thousands of razorsharp steel darts filling the air with their distinctive buzzing sound like a swarm of bees the darts sometimes would kill outright but more often than not inflicted terrible wounds kiril marchenko and others in the stavka responsible for efficient defense spending favored the bee bombs for such missions for casualties in the field required many more support troops to transport and care for them than did corpses and the americans were notoriously obsessive about getting their wounded out to the nearest mash field hospitals all of which meant fewer troops who could actually man the front at first the rugged terrain surrounding the base favored the survivors for it was taking time for the russian paratroopers to descend from the hillsides through the deep snow but soon the terrain would work against the shellshocked survivors of the adak raid because their only means of escape was either eastward through the sixmile valley between the mountains to shagak bay or kulak bay immediately behind them to the west only of the man marine company assigned to airstrip guard duty were still alive at dawn and these moved out to intercept the paratroopers but though the marines were superbly equipped they had had no cause to be issued white battle coveralls these werent the drill for guarding the runway at night when the only danger had seemed to be sabotage from the sea white coveralls on the darkened runway being perfect targets and those they had in stock had gone up in flames in the bombing anyway as the sixtythree marines moved out east from kulaks cshaped bay the fighting was not yet at close hand indeed most of the smallarms fire that the adak co had heard shortly after the bombing attack had fallen off during the night as the paratroops were presumably trying to form into a coherent force before attacking what was left of the base nevertheless sniping had continued from the foggy mountainsides and more than a dozen marines and civilians fell to this sporadic but deadly fire in an attempt to use the thick gray fog that was rolling down the sides of the mountains to their advantage the sixtythree marines moved out a quarter mile west of the base to form a semicircular perimeter meanwhile the co of adak was trying to assemble the civilian survivors as best he could down by the shore of kulak bay and to find enough boats that were still seaworthy enough to take them out beyond sitkin sound through asuksak pass and on to atka station a hundred miles to the east many of the women who had rushed out from the burning huts clad in no more than night attire were in the early throes of hypothermia which only added to the commanding officers problems as if this werent enough atka could not be raised on the radio by the communications officer as the microwave repeaters on the island had been destroyed in the raid along with the seatoshore sosus connections one of the mothers whose children oddly enough were contentedly playing amid the ruins of the base approached the commanding officer asking him what she could do the co paused not knowing what to tell her and for want of anything helpful to say directed her toward the mash tent down by the bays edge where dozens of casualties still lay awaiting attention from the overworked staff many of whom were also injured itll be a hell of a squash the communications officer reported to the co after the woman had left ive done a quick check on the waterfront most of the fishing boats are holed well just have to do the best we can by now the boys on the salt lake city will sure as hell know weve been hit their combat patrols should keep those bastards busy if we can hold out till they come we should be all right the communications officer didnt say anything but thought maybe the co should go down and join the line outside the mash tent hell even if the salt lake city sent every fighter they had there was nowhere on adak they could land now with the runway destroyed anyway every marine left on the island there wouldnt be enough boats for them would be a hostage if the tomcats bombed theyd kill as many marines as russians suddenly the valley was filled with the staccato echoes of machinegun fire firefights breaking out as the marines engaged the russian paratroopers but the russians had the overwhelming advantage in that the dark camouflage of the american marines uniforms so ideal in the summer months on the wild windswept islands was disastrous for them now in a desperate defense the marines began to dig in but the spets had planned the operation with great detail and soon a telltale shuffling sound in the air above them gave them only seconds warning of a murderous heavy mortar attack from the mountainsides spumes of dirty snow leapt high in the air and the screams of the wounded could be heard above the muffled thumps of a fire so concentrated that it was evident to the commanding officer as well as the hysterical civilians in the ruins of the base that they would soon be either killed or taken prisoner a mortar bomb exploding barely twenty yards from the mash tent sent a hail of shrapnel killing two small children one of the bombs fins slicing through the tent and decapitating a surgeon who had been in the final stages of suturing a stomach wound as a hospital corpsman and two others carried the doctor outside the wave in charge of nurses called out brusquely brentwood finish that suture then lend a hand here so busy she didnt have time to be afraid lana moved quickly to take over the surgeons task using the suture gun to finish up then turning the patient over to the junior nurses for postop she turned to the next casualty in line this ones in a coma lieutenant said the corporal some facial lacerations xray shows a sprained wrist but cant find anything else ive taped the wrist lana knew there wasnt much she could do for the man his face bloodied and dirty with gravel rash his cheeks swollen they could come out of a coma within twentyfour hours or stay in it forever next one she called out to the medical corpsman quickly glancing at her watch and grabbing the admission sheet she jotted down superficial lacerations coma the corporal reached for the dog tags from beneath the mans flying suit shirer he said frank j lana suddenly felt immobile aware only of his face trying to see if it was him or merely the same name all right everyone boomed a chief petty officer down to the wharf weve got to get these wounded loaded fast as possible were pushing off load em on what someone shouted whatever floats well do the best we can women and kids first then the wounded lets move where the hell are we going for gods sake a frightened orderly asked anywhere said the petty officer throwing open the flap of the tent one of the other islands nearby all i know is the co wants everybody down there on the double watch that iv called out the head nurse a saline pouch swinging wildly on its stand is he dead lana heard someone say lieutenant brentwood did you hear me what yes sorry major no hes in a coma then get him out with the oth the mash tent shook violently and outside lana could hear the screams of wounded and children and return fire from the few marines who were left and a shattering ringing noise as the russian heavy mortars finding the range began pounding the beach now she could see white figures moving in the gray fog through the smoking black remnants of the base russian paratroopers chapter forty the trucks carrying the pows had stalled outside stadthagen the snow falling so heavily and the temperature dropping so fast that by nightfall black ice covered the snowplowed road from the huge fuel depot twenty miles behind the front so that the prisoners were made to get out and push the trucks up a long oneintwenty incline the guards were yelling at them to work harder but to no avail as prisoners like david brentwood waite and thelman despite loud exclamations of intent merely leaned against the trucks grimacing ferociously but doing as little as possible to aid and abet their captors military police were in evidence everywhere directing convoys of tank refuelers moving slowly out of the dump of countless drums of fuel hidden under enormous camouflage nets in woods several miles north of stadthagen david brentwood was surprised to see in lines of other prisoners all wearing distinct white pow armbands hundreds of bundeswehr troops before the american airborne had left for their illfated drop outside the db pocket they had been told that the only nato troops they might run into should they be blown off course would be members of the dutch fortyfirst army looks like the whole german army surrendered brentwood said casually blowing on his frozen fingers he had no idea that his comment to thelman about why there were so many germans would trigger a series of events that would have a profound effect on his life and thousands of others in a chain of fate over which he had no control yeah added thelman thought we were told wed only be running into the dutchies whered all these krauts come from germans to you said someone amid the scrabble of boots and curses of men clambering back into the trucks their breath in the frozen air creating a mist that momentarily made the four stasi guards look as if they were in a steam bath all right said thelman germans no offense how the hell should we know where they came from retorted an infantryman grumpily what is thislets make a deal whats it matter were all in the same boat actually put in the english lieutenant i think theyre from the territorials who are they when theyre at home asked waite in his cockney twang reserves the lieutenant replied damn well trained too not frontline troops of course like us said brentwood it got a good laugh touch√© said the englishman no what i mean schweig dock one of the four guards called out up your doc too said thelman the guard began shouting again but the british lieutenant ignored him as the other three guards didnt seem to care one way or the other bundeswehr territorials the lieutenant continued as the truck skewed dangerously on a patch of black ice before straightening territorials were assigned to man and maintain all nato transport in northern command unfortunately they ran out of gas thanks to our spets friends who got behind our lines and cut both amsterdam and rotterdam pipelines ergo the territorials in our midst like doug freeman did in korea said one of the americans he didnt use enemy uniforms said david well said the english lieutenant wryly i dont think americans look much like north koreans do they suppose not answered david not quite knowing whether the englishman was being sarcastic or merely gently matteroffact how do you know he didnt put south koreans in gook uniforms asked a disgruntled signaler david felt the man was less interested in finding out than in venting his spleen against the spets whod deprived him like david of his uniform and whod left him near death with cold he knows thelman said pointing to david he was there really asked the englishman somewhat haughtily yeah really replied thelman silver star brentwood was acutely embarrassed but the englishmans voice lost any trace of haughtiness i say well done brentward isnt it brentwood said david feeling conspicuous silver star and no fucking brains right brentwood an american ribbed him signed up again right said david boyishly grateful for the laughter that swept through the truck and started the guards shouting again this time all of the guards were joining in one of them waving the akm as the truck slowed a hundred yards from the main entrance to the fuel dump which was almost obliterated in the swirling snow as lines of prisoners carried liter drums on stretcherlike pallets to waiting trucks on the opposite side of the road a stasi oberst approached the truck tiny balled snow bouncing off his uniform like fine hail english amerikaner yes answered the lieutenant being the most senior rank you will be issued with armbands which you must wear at all times when are we to dine asked the englishman who are you asked the oberst lieutenant grimsby royal engineers and you are oberst hotter the lieutenant jumped down from the tailgate and gave a snappy salute very well colonel hoffer i must request that these men be fed as soon as possible weve been traveling all day and as im sure youre aware under the rules specifically agreed to by both nato and warsaw pact under the gorbachev protocols david wasnt listening he was far more interested in the fact that the fuel dump wasnt in the old nato prepo site after all but had been cunningly moved no wonder the nato bombers had been unsuccessful in penetrating the old prepo sites what would freeman do not sit on his ass whining about the next meal thats for sure it was a godgiven opportunity the idea literally caught his breath for a moment the row developing between the stasi colonel and the disdainful englishman over the issue of appropriate apparel and victualing passing over him why hadnt he thought of it earlier he wondered but that was easy his only concern like everyone else in the truck had been to survive defensive driving freeman used to call it derisively drilling them that defensive thinking was a disease for the timid defensive tactics excuses for not attacking a goddamn torpor looking for reasons to fail david could still see him aboard the chopper carrier before theyd lifted off on the pyongyang raid against kim il runt as freeman had called the dictator kim il sung david hadnt known what torpor meant until hed heard the general use it there was a sudden crack silence then bedlam in the truck the guards outside firing into the air what the began david in the pale yellow light of the tailgate he could see the englishman spreadeagle in the snow a dark pool round his head a look of utter amazement on his face the oberst slapped the pistol back into his holster ja he was saying a smile on his face that david recognized immediately as the mad look spawned of sustained battlefield stress janow you see you will do as you are told he turned to the guards one of whom looked as astounded at what had happened as the dead englishman and rattled out a series of sharp orders turning to the prisoners in the truck he informed them you will go over to the depot two men to each drum and you will load them back into this truck is this understood no one answered and as the guards motioned them out and they dropped down to the snow one by one they looked down at the dead englishman no one speaking out of respect and fear in the distance muffled by the snow they could hear the steady crump of marshal kirovs thousand guns that kept pounding away in a massive creeping barrage through the db pocket to stun the already battleweary americans and british as the russian advance moved inexorably westward now and then the sound of the guns would change as the creeping barrage shifted when the russian gunners after having bracketed an area laid the shells down in a different sector to confuse and undo any of the defenders attempts to predict where they would be hit next david clutching his blanket and shivering plaintively held up his hand reminding thelman of a timid student asking for permission to go to the washroom ja asked the oberst brusquely sir may i bury him you want his clothes his boots ja david shrugged ingratiatingly the oberst nodded to one of the guards and then told brentwood be quick we must be loading the trucks in twenty minutes could i have a spade asked brentwood use your hands said the oberst but sir david started to protest then stopped himself thank you sir the oberst had turned away from him heading across the road toward the entrance to the dump schnell said the guard whom the oberst had ordered to follow brentwood waving the machine gun toward a ditch and the snowcovered field across from the truck in the opposite direction to where the prisoners were being marched david motioned to the guard that he needed help carrying the lieutenant off the road across the ditch the guard obviously understood his gestures but wasnt going to help instead indicating brusquely that brentwood should hurry up by the time freeman was out of the field hospitals or the advancing thunder of the russian guns was barely twenty miles away east of bielefeld the russians having already penetrated the defenses south of bielefeld beyond the weser river simultaneously other soviet tank and helicopter surges out of frankfurtammain to the south were hammering at the fragmented nato line forcing what was left of the belgian sixteenth armored bundeswehr second mechanized and the american third and eleventh armored to try to contain the everwidening arrowhead of the enemy advance swelling and curving north from fulda in a left hook encircling movement heading toward krefeld and gelsenkirchen if this left hook coming from the south was successful supreme allied command europe knew that the hundredmilelong dortmundbielefeld pocket could not retreat the rhine behind them cut yet saceur in having to commit nato forces to the south were forced to deny the pocket vitally needed reinforcements which could provide rearguard actions to effect withdrawal from the pocket you cant give the general that major norton advised the doctor as he prepared to give freeman a shot of demerol to ease the pain after the operation hed had to relieve complications of paresis why not asked the harried doctor major norton whom freeman had seconded to his g staff did not know everything about the general yet but al banks had made a point of telling him early on that the general was a man who eschewed medication boasting on occasion that the strongest pill hed ever taken was an aspirin and that anything stronger than the medical corpsmans apc was for goddamned sissies are you serious asked the exhausted doctor scornfully the pains acute after that surgery what exactlys wrong with him asked norton hes got paresis insufficient blood supply to the spinal cord its a partial paralysis but hell get over it meanwhile id like to make him as comfortable as i can freeman stirred his eyes opening briefly then closing again his voice slow raspy with dehydration al the doctor looked down at him loudly informing him general im going to give you a shot itll ease your discomfort the general tried to turn his head al what the hells he slipped back to unconsciousness the doctor gave him the shot i hope that wont make him confused when he wakes up norton admonished him well without it he wont be thinking at all major anyway it doesnt really matter does it no ones getting out of this abattoir for a moment norton thought the doctor was talking only about the hospital until he realized the doctor meant the entire pocket norton had to admit to himself that the latest batch of aerial reconnaissance photos still showed no sign of russian tanks with fuel drums attached it confirmed freemans lastminute discovery on the way back from heidelberg that the russian tanks were not short of gas as soon as the front wave of kirovs tanks were on empty rather than having to stop sitting ducks for the stationary nato tanks dug in defilade positions already low on ammunition and with no fuel reserve a second wave of russian tanks would sweep forward in echelons to cover the first as they refueled the other members of freemans staff told norton that it was the first time in freemans career that the general had ordered a defensive strategy hoping to convert it to an offensive one when the russians overextended supply line brought their tanks to a stop southern command was pressing freemans staff to release the tanks arguing that they might as well rush the breaches in the db perimeter but without oil and the tankkilling thunderbolts it was adjudged by freemans staff that any such move would only trade shortterm gain for a massive overall loss as well as giving away the defilade positions to the russian choppers which though hampered by the blizzard conditions were on infrared the vacated defilade positions merely providing the soviets with more gaps in the line there are too many holes in the dike conceded norton and not enough fingers to plug them the final blow to the already rockbottom morale of the american british and bundeswehr divisions fighting for their lives in the pocket was the news that soviet spets who had infiltrated the rear areas had blown up fuel reserves west of munster and that freemans mine fielddefilade strategy was not working the russians driving prisoners before them to clear the mine fields the choice for the prisoners had been a stark and simple one run for your lives or get shot in some places to the south particularly near leverkusen it didnt work prisoners refusing to be used as human detonators but in other areas they ran toward the lines blown into oblivion opening corridors for the soviet armorborne troops to pour through allied helicopters roughly equal in number to the soviets were in general superior fighting machines and for the most part the allied pilots could literally fly rings about their russian counterparts but as in the thunderbolts case the allied choppers were short of ammunition and missiles of all types compounding natos problems in the first few hours of marshal kirovs attack was the soviets dropping of nonnuclear emp electromagnetic pulse bombs knocking out all radio communications every microchip circuit within a twentymile radius blown leaving natos frontline commanders without communications while kirovs divisions stayed in close touch with each other via kirovs superbly trained motorcycle courier battalions the db pocket was becoming an abattoir on marshal kirovs general staff only the marshal was worried he held the awesome responsibility if anything went wrong and he understood better than any of his subordinates that for all the years since world war ii and especially after the defense cuts of the gorbachev years the soviet unions victory in the west had to be a quick victory a victory of quantity over quality before the americans and their damnable ability to resupply had a chance to make any difference still as the battle wore on the fact that the nato forces were now being split in two raised to a certainty the possibility of driving them into the sea before the americans could muster the wherewithal for a counterattack shaking with cold david brentwood had quickly dug a shallow grave in the snow as he dragged the englishmans body into the depression and removed the englishmans clothes he felt as unobtrusively as he could for a cigarette lighter there was none maybe it was inside the boots but here too he drew a blank he was sure hed seen the englishman smoking but perhaps hed got a light from one of the guards he looked about for anything that he could make a rude cross from but there was nothing the guard was telling him to hurry up again quickly putting on the englishmans uniform and taking the englishmans dog tags he heaped up the snow and placed a bramble as the only marker he could find for the makeshift grave he bowed his head for a moment and then trudged slowly back to the ditch slipping the dog tags over his head forlornly carrying the snowsodden blanket with his left hand jumping the ditch breaking his fall with the right as he got up he threw the blanket into the guards face shoved the akm up into the air and kicked the man in the groin he heard the explosion of air from the stasi as the guard fell back into the ditch cracking the ice david falling with him bringing his knee up to the guards chin there was a crunch of bone and for a second david didnt know whether it was his knee or the guards jaw either way he finished the job with the butt of the akm quickly he took the dead guards coat off him but the mans torso fell back into the broken ice so that when brentwood reached for the mans undershirt it was sodden as was the rest of his uniform damn said david under his breath but he did find a lighter he could do it he guessed by cutting out a strip from the truck cabins plastic upholstery but the problem was he didnt know how long it would take he heard voices as the men started to return from the dump he wouldnt have enough time to hotwire the truck theyd cut him down before he got behind its steering wheel all right he muttered to himself determined to do a little spets number of his own its time we evened the score he tore off the guards dog tags and inside thirty seconds hed put on the guards sodden coat stuffed the two grenades the guard was carrying into the coat pocket put on the helmet and started running to the last truck in the line he could hear the colonels voice and the muffled thud of an oil drum and a guard shouting at the two men who had dropped it his back to the other prisoners now he guessed about fifty yards off he lifted the collar of the guards coat high around his neck and fired a long burst across the ditch into the field screaming amerikaner hah behind him he heard prisoners dropping to the ground the other guards running through the snowstorm to join him at the end of the line of trucks and the oberst shouting orders he moved quickly back down alongside the ditch to the first truck unscrewed the gas tank cover snapped the akms swing butt hard on the stock and using its bayonet cut through the neck of his tshirt to make a wick for the gas tank but the guards were closing faster than hed thought and he still wouldnt have time to get into the truck he stuffed half the tshirt strip into the tank lit the bottom of the taper and slid down the embankment toward the ditch running as fast as he could away from the line of trucks he guessed it would be no more than five seconds before the truck would blow and instinctively everyone around it would hit the road for a few minutes afraid to go to any of the other vehicles behind it he slipped on the ice crashing headlong into the snowcovered side of the ditch the blizzard swirling about him and glanced back the fifty yards or so the trucks dim blots in the rolling snow there was no explosion maybe the taper had been too long and theyd seen it in time or maybe it hadnt been as dry as he thought he kept running and although hot from the effort the sodden clothes turned his perspiration to ice he paused to catch his breath the unexpected the di had always told thelma and stumbleass go for the unexpected gasping the icy air searing his lungs he wondered how far he could get before they recaptured him he heard shouts coming from the direction of the parked convoy and then an ominous silence except for the howl of the blizzard crawling up to the top of the embankment he looked for the trucks again but they had vanished in the whiteout and though he knew the dump was opposite him a hundred yards or so across the road the loss of depth perception in the whiteout created the dangerously comfortable illusion that because he couldnt see his enemy he was safe then beneath the wail of the blizzard he heard a swishing noise faint yet distinct coming closer chapter fortyone while in the port of brest the convoy minus one merchantman and one of its destroyer escorts was docking gen douglas freeman beside himself with frustration was raging against his immobility which prevented him from being at the front during the attack here i am trussed up like a mummy and my boys are dying like flies increasing his sense of failure freemans headquarters received a message via a ham operator using an antiquated radio set that operational because it used vacuum tubes instead of uptodate printed microchip circuit boards picked up a bbc broadcast of the nineoclock news reporting that a strike of dockworkers was under way in several of the french ports including brest freeman ordered norton to grab the nearest f pilot at krefeld to take a message to brest that the french strikers were to be shot on the spot you threaten that general major norton advised him and we could have one hell of a problem with france theyre allowing us to use allowing us nothing snapped freeman theyre allowing us and the british and germans and every other poor son of a bitch in that pocket to die only dying theyll do is to protect france and if the nato commander in brest is too cowardly to do it ill order air strikes on french forces and make it look like the russians hit them you see how quickly thingsll loosen up then i want those supplies and i want them now norton was appalled staring wideeyed at the general convinced that when freeman had been thrown out of the humvee hed lost some of his marbles as well we cant do that general i mean theres no way freeman his face contorted with pain eyes smarting nevertheless managed to fix norton in his stare watch me if id had my way id bomb the sons of bitches myself to get them into the righting now are you going to transmit that order or do i have to shoot you as the generals apache helicopter rose to ferry norton to krefeld its rotor slap momentarily drowned the noise of battle but he knew it was an illusion and that like it or not the general had a point if they lost western europe it was all over freeman called for the doctor yes general i want another shot of that painkiller the doctor tried but couldnt hide a smirk of satisfaction that said so youre human after all i may be freeman began but for a moment he couldnt go on i might be stubborn doc but im not stupid he turned to his logistics aide charlie you got a manifest for the convoy thats due in brest no sir but get one i know there are twentyfour merchantmen all over twenty thousand tons theres a hell of a lot of stuff if it got through well if it did get through i dont want any screwups down there ammunition and fuel charlie ammunition and fuel onto the hercules and up here at least weve still got fighter cover bring me a map of north rhinewestphalia fox fox shirer was calling the nose of the mig plainly visible in the flash of an exploding tomcat then he was falling gradually he became aware of someone holding his hand and a rush of sensations all at once the stink of a boats diesel fumes and a stringent antiseptic smell and perfume the hand holding his warm and reassuring the womans face indistinct warping in and out of focus as if through a glass tumbler swaying to and fro with the motion of the boat and somewhere in the distance above the rhythmic throbbing of the marine engine the chatter of machinegun fire and other wounded all around him the perfume was a memory to him and he couldnt quite match the face in his mind but it awakened a desire in him that transcended everything else around him hows he doing a mans voice asked hell be all right she said he was in a coma at first and we thought his arm was broken but he was lucky the marines who brought him in said his chute was a little twisted but he came down all right and the snow helped cant keep a good man down no she answered smiling now shirer could see her clearly you know him the man asked she turned to look up at him as she answered and shirer knew the profile at once lana he was grinning like a schoolboy well said the man straightening up arms akimbo i guess that cuts me out it was a tone of goodnatured resignation and here i thought id hit pay dirt with a pretty navy nurse if youll pardon me im going to try my luck elsewhere surely theres one nurse whod take pity on a lonely sailor lana laughed easily in reply and in that moment shirer knew beyond the shadow of a doubt that if he did nothing else in this damned war hed take her hold her and never let go captain lana called out thank you for all youve done if you and the others on that beach hadnt got us off ah he said waving aside any thanks no problem lieutenant fish werent running yesterday anyways and dont call me captain makes me feel like im in the navy shirer watched her effortless laugh as entranced by her beauty as when hed first met her only she was more maturelooking now more confident than the girl he had known before the war and if he could he would have made love to her right then and there her hand was still in his and he said my god i never thought id be glad to be shot down neither did i you are feeling better arent you more than you know soon they were talking as if they had never parted where are we headed he asked her to atka she answered itll be about five hours from there theyll probably fly us back to dutch harbor and youll her pause conveyed more to him than she realized both of them pretended that they would have more time together once they reached the safety of dutch harbor but both of them had seen enough of the war to know that as soon as he was able he would be flying again as every effort would be made to gain air superiority over adak as a prelude to retaking the island in order to protect shemya four hundred miles east of adak before it was permanently cut off and overrun by the russians the head nurse coming down the companion ladder from the wheelhouse where more of the wounded had been crowded in noticed lana was still with the same patient lieutenant brentwood could i see you a moment please her tone was admonishing we need help on deck lana rose taking her hand from his uhoh im in trouble ill see you at dutch harbor lana he asked yes are you still afraid of pirates for a second she didnt know what he meant they wear eye patches he grinned she was buttoning up her parka before going on deck her voice was subdued yet quietly joyful i love them she said you were very palsywalsy with that pilot the head nurse commented sharply do you hold hands with all your patients hes an old friend so i gathered but id appreciate it if you could spare time to attend to some of the other patients we have several cases of yes of course replied lana im sorry it was selfish of me surprised and mollified by lanas apology the head nurse put lanas lapse of duty down to the battle fatigue they were all feeling adopting an equally conciliatory tone she asked lana if she would help her secure all the medical supplies theyd had to put on deck to make room below for the wounded wed better hurry she told lana captain bering says well likely run into some squalls before we reach atka on the other side of the world major norton bearing freemans message to brest had just finished a terrifying flight with zero visibility in a storm sweeping in over the ardennes he had sat whiteknuckled in the electronic systems operators tandem seat in a luftwaffe tornado out of krefeld eyes closed throughout the mile flight which the tornado made in thirtyeight minutes often flying less than five hundred feet above the ground courtesy of its contourscanning radar as norton deplaned his legs almost buckling under him the luftwaffe pilot apologized effusively telling him i am sorry we took so long but you see major the stoby which the pilot meant the smithsteldixomi headup displayis a little off you understand so it was necessary for us to go a little slow adding insult to injury when norton arrived at nato brest hq with freemans threat he discovered that there had been such an uproar from the french public about the dockside strike that the unions were back at work within the hour and the convoys supplies were already en route to natos beleaguered northern army you wish to go back now asked the tired but eager young luftwaffe pilot no said norton i think ill sit a while as he headed farther away from the trucks following the line of the ditch parallel to the road david brentwood heard the swishing noise increasing and now there seemed to be more than one source of the noise skis he crawled up the sharp incline of the embankment but slid back a hump under his foot giving way looking down he saw it was a childs body he hesitated held the childs frozen hand a little boy though not expecting a pulse david checked anyway there was none realizing he could do no more but unable to leave the tiny corpse he turned the body facedown the savagery of it all overwhelming him unmarried no children of his own he found it difficult to judge how old the little boy might have been but he guessed no more than five or six the swishing noise was louder now and he thought he saw a flashlight through the thick curtain of the blizzard he touched the boys head the hair frozen stiff eyes closed and was about to make his way up to the top of the embankment again when he noticed several more humps in the snow scattered along the shoulder of the road one body a womans was covered by that of a soldier who had obviously fallen on top of her trying to protect her the soldiers uniform was that of the bundeswehr why the advancing soviet forces had perpetrated such a massacre he had no idea perhaps it was nothing more than that civilians posed inconvenient delays looking back down the road he saw four figures with flashlights the black barrel of their slung weapons in contrast to the falling snow sliding back down toward the ditch he ran for another twenty yards or so and when glancing back he could not see them he quickly crossed the road ready to slide down the ditch on the other side there was none and so he kept running into a snowcovered field the unexpected he told himself again they would not think of looking for him on the dump side of the road he saw the dim shapes of trees about a hundred yards ahead of him a wood and at the edge he crawled beneath the snowladen branches looking back across the field he watched as the search party four of them now continued down the road one of them stopped looking down at what david guessed must be the childs body damn he shouldnt have touched the body disturbed its blanket of snow because now they knew but then they began moving again stopped and turned back jesus christ he admonished himself you dumb bastard you stupid dumb bastard they had seen his footprints and given the heavy fell of snow they would know he must have crossed the road shortly before heaving himself up under the weight of the coat he began moving through the woods then paused calm down he told himself so they were betterequipped betterarmed and they were already starting to cross the field following his footprints toward the wood but he realized it would be much easier for them to pick up his footprints inside the wood where the snowfall was not nearly so windblown he turned back toward the edge of the wood unslung the akm thought about himself and thelman on the range at parris island and eased himself into the prone position seeing the di not shouting for once but calmly telling them youve got time relax get your breathing under control youre going nowhere and the enemys advancing dont panic and start spraying everything in sight waste your ammo deep breaths stumbleass i said deep breath exhale not all of it hold thats it now squeeze the trigger not your cock thelma fire and dont keep looking at the target youre not at the county fair no dollies or box of chocolates move your aim straight to the next one or hell move you you got that stumbleass david cupped the barrel in his hands letting what warmth he had in them thaw the snow that now might be ice inside hed come too far to kill himself if he was to die they were going to have to do it for him far over on his right down the road he heard the trucks starting up the convoy he expected warming up getting ready to head back to the front as soon as loading was completed he flipped up the rear tangent sight set it for fifty meters aligned it with the front protectedpost sight and moved the bayonet scabbard from where it was digging into his belly when the first man filled the sight david squeezed off a burst snow fell from a branch overhead from the air vibration and he shifted the akm to the right firing again the first man was already down the second thrown back till the safety bindings gave on the skis and he toppled into the snow the other two were down returning fire bullets thwacking into the timber above and around him but so high and wide he doubted they had any precise idea of his position getting up behind the cover of the branches sticking a twist of handkerchief into the barrel he headed through the wood toward the dump if he was still within the dumps precincts he was making much better time now the snow in the woods nowhere as deep as in the field behind him in a few more minutes having left the sporadic fire well behind him he saw the trees were thinning he was out of the wood halt the stasi trooper had his rifle up david dropped to the ground as he fired a wide sweeping burst the mans legs buckled snow flicking up around him and david felt his left shoulder stinging like crazy he heard a loud panting noise coming out from the wood too close for the other two to have caught up with him then he felt the hot rush of air a flurry of snow instinctively his left hand flew up but the doberman had it between his teeth fangs crushing through the thick coat crunching to the bone david reached for the akm but couldnt find it he tried to roll the dog over but the doberman had him pinned his left arm bleeding profusely david shoved his right into the coats right hand pocket felt the lighter and grasping it with all his strength flicked the flint the blueorange propane flame shot up and david pushed it at the dogs eyes astonishingly the doberman hung on jaws still clamping down on davids arm trying to shake the life out of him then suddenly the dog jumped back skittering a short distance away his paws frantically wiping his eyes david saw the stock of the akm and pulled it toward him its barrel was jammed with icy snow getting up he flipped the butt down lifted the gun by the barrel and felled the dog the voices in the wood behind him were getting closer now stumbling through the snow david reached the dogs handler who was making a noise as if he were snoring something wrong with his breathing david almost passing out from the pain in his arm removed the two m screwthreaded stick grenades from the mans belt as well as two banana clips of millimeter stuffing them into his coats pocket then headed toward what looked like a barn fifty yards away a horse trough nearby congealed with ice then beyond the barn he saw what hed been after from the moment hed seen the englishman dead in the snow and had asked the oberst permission to bury him for once the snow was helping firm underfoot packed down presumably by the boots of prisoners as theyd marched in from the trucks the huge snowladen camouflaged canvasandnetting roof formed a strikingly beautiful and symmetrically scalloped pattern like the awning of some vast expensive garden party marquee behind him he could hear the two men crossing the field and was about to turn to see if he could spot them when seventy yards in front of him away to the left he heard a truck slowly coming to a stop and the sound of more dogs without hesitating he fired the whole magazine at the truck the barrel so hot the steam rose all around him the trucks engine was now in the high whine of reverse he knew that now was his only chance the akm slung over his right shoulder he ran the fifty yards toward the black wall of fuel drums kneeling unscrewing the stick handle from two grenades screwing them together forming a demolition charge he pulled both pins and threw them as far as he could into the gap between the canvas roof and the stacked fuel drums running fast through the blinding snow he estimated he would have five seconds he was wrong on a threesecond fuse the grenades blew and the next instant he was lifted off the ground the force of the explosion throwing him forward at least twenty feet behind him a mountain of orange fire and dense black smoke the air like a desert wind fantastic shadows playing across the snow men running farther down the road from rivers of lighted fuel spewing out into the snow like molten lava david dragged himself up stumbled and fell rose again not knowing where he was heading so long as it was away from the fire he heard screams and the futile spinning of truck tires trying to grip on snow that in seconds had become a bubbling sludge more men somewhere off to his right were running throwing weapons down clambering aboard what looked like halftracks in a desperate exodus as more and more of the drums exploded adding to the towering flames leaping hundreds of feet into the air visible to nato positions as far south as bielefeld hauling himself to the woods edge it was not until about a quarter hour later that david realized the back of his head had been singed and the coat covered with the burns of airborne cinders he knew he could run no more if they got him the best he could hope for was that hed make them pay he put the akm across his lap and felt for the other two grenades making sure no snow had iced up on them last thing he needed was the pins to freeze chapter fortytwo the german army would call it the time of deliverance the americans the bustout the british about bloody time but whatever name they gave it the americandriven counterattack was something to behold ironically the first man to witness its beginning was not a combat soldier at all but a bundeswehr surgeon assigned to the field hospital west of munster the surgeon had always admired the americans for their inventive knowhow especially the revolutionary must medical unit selfcontained hospital that had been first designed in the s seemingly rising out of nothing inflated within twenty minutes by sterile compressed air from portable generators and airconditioned throughout the fiftytwofootlong twentyfootwide and tenfoothigh ward of six operating tables and inbuilt equipment had greatly reduced the fatality rate the only fault the german surgeon found with it was that as in all american installations the thermostat was set way too high stepping out at around hours on the day of the convoys arrival in brest for a blast of cold and invigorating air between operations he heard a thunderous roar overhead in the blizzard that had blanketed the front from lower saxony as far south as heidelberg he hoped it was an american plane for if not there was nowhere to go for shelter the slit trenches dug earlier in the day were now snowfilled every available man having been sent to the perimeter in the desperate lastditch attempt to stop the russian advance the roar of the aircraft had barely abated when out of the blizzard he saw a dark square the size of a house descending several hundred yards away above the airstrip designated minister but dubbed by the americans monster as he watched the object a vinelike mesh dangling from it and saw the four ghostlike chutes above he realized the mesh was the cargo net about a resupply palette the blizzard so welcomed by kirovs divisions and which kirovs staff had predicted would bog down the americans was proving no impediment from the bielefeld line to the danube three hundred miles to the south the american ms german leopards and british challengers were about to be given new life the airlift from brest would fly in more supplies than in either the famed berlin airlift of or the resupply of khe sanh in the vietnam war in the blinding whiteout american ingenuity german organization and british doggedness came together like old friends called to the bedside of a critically ill relative in the snow the americans hightech instrument flying constantly amazed the soviet divisions that had broken through rolling toward what they had thought was certain victory with fighter cover provided by raf tornados flying out of southern england and american ff swingwing fighter interceptors dozens of the giant footlong foothigh american cc galaxies flying out of brest delivered fuel and ammunition to the hastily prepared prepo sites west of munster the giant transports normal load of tons was increased to tons the galaxies able to cut down on thenown fuel load because of the short sixtyeightminute fivehundredmile flight from brest to the dortmundbielefeld pocket almost none of the galaxies landed in the pocket most of their intermodal concar containerized cargo having being taken straight from ship to plane was dropped low by chutebraked palette the cargo of ammunition and fuel drums from the hundreds of fortyeightfootlong containers was heading toward the front within twenty minutes of a palette skidding to a stop the snow helping to brake the palettes slide in a shorter distance than usual the massive resupply drop had no noticeable effect for the first six to seven hours the natosown mine fields freeman had relied upon to slow the soviet armor breached by russian divisions pouring through gaps where the mines had been rendered useless in the heavy fall of snow because of this a british infantry battalion and an american ranger regiment were overrun southwest of bochum over three thousand taken prisoner many of them were shot out of hand for no other reason than that the soviet supply line already stretched for the final attack on the besieged allies had no containment areas or food allocated for prisoners after us m and m and uk slr millimeter ammunition had been stripped from the british and american bodies they were left to be covered by the snow kirov and his staff regarding the fuel necessary for a bulldozer to dig mass graves too vital for their armored and mechanized divisions the early discovery of this by an american airborne battalion led to some of the most vicious fighting anywhere on the perimeter six hours after the airlift had begun around hours the snowfilled sky over the pocket became brilliantly incandescent with blossoming patches of rubyred and icecreamwhite flares shot through with green and orange parabolas of tracer as refueled apache and cobra gunships flying in excess of miles per hour swarmed across the outer reaches of the chaotically shifting and segmented front firing thousands of hellfire fire and forget antitank missiles though equipped with infrared sensors far superior to those of the soviets the initial hellfire attacks were not as effective as hoped because of the lack of laserbeamequipped forward air controllers to guide each missile to its target nato choppers with pods of eight towtubelaunched wireguided missiles were more effective against the enemy tanks the tows not requiring anyone on the ground to assist soviet hind and havoc helicopters having had it their own way for the last fortyeight hours because of natos rapidly dwindling fuel supplies were now faced with a far different situation scatter fragments from the exploding warhead of the sidewinder missiles proving deadly to the soviet gunships much of the credit for the destruction of the soviet choppers was due to the contourimaging guidance radar aboard the american apaches which permitted their pilots noe or nap of earth flying the choppers able to skim less than fifty feet above ground tree or water contour even in the worst snow conditions noe flying was especially easy over the flatter southern sector of the db pocket by the time major norton had returned from brest to freemans hospital hq outside munster he found the general though still rigid in his brace very much alert looking up at the maps of lower saxony north rhinewestphalia and the rhineland palatinate that were taped to the field hospitals ceiling the generals exhausted yet attentive staff clustered about the bed the mood of new hope evident from the sheer vitality that radiated out from freeman who was holding forth a telescopic pointer stabbing at the ceiling ah there you are norton what dyou think of my chapel before norton could say anything freeman raced on if michelangelo could do it on his back so can i eh i guess so general i heard on my way up here that weve stopped our withdrawal stopped it sounded like an obscenity by god major were moving we are going on the attack their advanced dump the bastards had it hidden away up here in the goddamned woods has blown up in their faces the general moved the pointer north of bielefeld outside stadthagen freemans face was so flushed with optimism that at first norton thought the general had had some kind of adverse reaction to the pain shot now freeman continued lowering the pointer and looking around at his staff the shoes on the other foot kirov the general paused savoring the moment is running out of gas gentlemen here norton said freeman passing him a bulging manila folder feast your eyes on these they were infrared aerial reconnaissance photos at first norton thought they had been badly overexposed everything seemed white almost no contrast at all to the wooded area around the edge of the photographs then he realized what he was seeing my god general thats some bonfire it must be norton glanced down at the scale line over two thousand yards freeman cut in they must have had enough gas our gas there to fuel lord knows how many divisions freeman paused and looked about at his staff god is on our side gentlemen we shouldnt get too damn cocky about this least not until were in moscow well general said norton goodnaturedly but clearly skeptical i think itll be some time before we get to moscow theres the matter of eastern germany poland norton freeman responded youre a good g youve got an eye for detail that surpasses anyone i know thats why i seconded you to my staff but youre too conservative in matters military because weve been losing up to this point you want to hold back consolidate i understand your caution but it would be fatal its unamerican their tanks are chugging to a stop and within twentyfour hours well have every one of our tanks gassed up and ready to go instead of sitting on our butts in defilade our only option till now we can move out in force kick their ass all the way back to the volga at this moment gentlemen we have a confluence of forces that will not visit us again our navys secured atlantic resupply of troops and materiel the enemys supply line is now overextended out of gas and we have air superiority with our thunderbolts killing their tanks by the bushel itll be a rout well grow stronger as they grow weaker here freeman paused fixing each man in turn with what his commanders called the patton look if we strike nowwhile theyre confused out of steam freemans assumption that kirovs army was confused was incorrect as relayed to the world by the tv reporter who had earlier defied freemans ban on media at the front the truth was that the russian armies were stunned not only by the refueling and resupply of troops and tanks all along natos front but above all by the a thunderbolts the snowfilled tv pictures were often blurred but nevertheless plainly showed the subsonic thunderbolts coming in low often at acute angles of attack their maneuverability holding even the supersonic pilots in thrall at times almost in a stall nose down the highmounted rear jets making them look like enormous insects the thunderbolts sent down an orange rain of depleted uranium tracer this fusillade from the thirtymillimeter cannon lasted for only a second or two but streaming down at a rate over four thousand rounds a minute while the pilot sat protected in the titaniumsheathed seat passed through the soviets main battle tanks and anything else in the way like a hot poker through butter exploding the tanks fuel if it had any left or igniting the fiftyodd rounds of tank ammunition it blew the tank apart most of the more than one thousand ts and s were destroyed in the ensuing fortyeight hours by the thunderbolts long before natos tanks were refueled and ready to move ironically had the nato tanks been moving the thunderbolts would not have been anywhere near as successful for as in the dustshrouded battle of fulda gap at the beginning of the war identification between friend and foe in the blizzard would have been extremely difficult with many allied tanks destroyed as a result the american public and all those watching the tv reports now freeman was offering transport to media reps wherever they wanted to go did not realize that the reason for freemans order to keep his tanks in defilade was that his decision had been dictated by the critical shortage of gas nor was natos supreme command anxious to let them know how close the entire nato front had come to irreversible disaster in the db pocket what viewers saw before their eyes on every news report in a jubilant america was yet another example of the tactical genius of end run doug as the more sensational papers were calling him and even the new york timess indepth reporting could not detract from his glory it was clear to everybody from florida to alaska that freeman had gone on the offensive when lesser men would have counseled caution the reputation of the once unknown onestar general who had been close to retirement when hed led the raid on pyongyang was now secure it seemed in the pantheon of american heros while a prisoner dressed in stasi greatcoat and helmet with stasi identification tags and captured by the coldstream guards during the british advance on stadthagen was claiming he was an american called brentwood general douglas freeman was receiving a congratulatory call from the president of the united states four days later when it was confirmed by a private thelman and others whod escaped when the fuel dump at stadthagen had blown that the man who said he was david brentwood was in fact david brentwood freemans headquarters was informed david weak from pneumonia and en route on a hospital train to lille in belgium oblivious to the fact that news of his exploit was now being broadcast around the world was greeted ecstatically upon arrival in lille by normally reserved belgian civilians who a week before had thought they would be under the heel of soviet occupation in the hospitals admissions office a pretty young female clerk asked david pronouncing every english word with painstaking exactitude this honor medal you will be getting it is made of gold david sitting down his breathing labored feeling so tired he could fall asleep that instant nevertheless managed a wink it had better be he said her name tag he noticed was lili you will be famous no she asked like your general freeman he liked the way she said generalsounded cute dont tell anyone he said pausing for breath but i taught him all he knew she laughed and he with her it was the first time he had done so in a long while he watched her trying not to be too obvious as she completed the form no rings he noticed it reminded him of the last letter hed had from melissa telling him as gently as she could that perhaps they shouldnt be too hasty about marriage plans after all she reminded him his brother robert hadnt become engaged until he was much older than david lili was looking better all the time chapter fortythree cold as it looked rising bleak and forbidding out of the fog dutch harbor was a welcome sight to lana and the evacuees from adak after hours of forcesix winds more than enough seasickness to go around on the boat and air sickness on the hercules flight from atka when they got ashore the news of the americanled breakout from the dortmundbielefeld pocket was general knowledge but as yet news of davids action had not been received in fact the only news about her family was a letter from her mother its postmark showing that it had been mailed a week before at first after frank had left her to report to the base commander lana had looked forward to reading the letter but before long it had made her feel thoroughly depressed her mother told her how excited she was about roberts imminent marriage to rosemary spence lamenting the fact that none of the family could be there all together again she was naturally worried about david but reported that ray was coming along and that your father is still doing too much and has started bringing work home with him after some tiff at the office lana rushed through the remainder of the letter feeling more angry than grateful it was good to hear from home but her mother had started using a kind of pablum code with her ever since lana had had what her mother called her little problem with jay as if avoidance of discussing anything unpleasant would make it go away she had never been like that until ray was so badly burned on the blaine what did her mother mean she wondered by ray coming along and what exactly was fathers tiff at work when lana finished reading the letter she realized that what was really eating away at her was what would happen to frank they had hardly stepped ashore when he was requested to report to colonel morin she was afraid that he would have to report back to the carrier as soon as possible she told him he wasnt ready that after what hed been through in the last few days he needed rest and that she didnt have any qualms about telling morin that but hed gone all macho on her and said that if he had to go he had to go that someone owes those marines back there and she knew he was right but the thought of losing him just when shed felt her life was coming together again filled her with such anxiety that although all she wanted to do was sleep she couldnt when shirer came back from morins office he told her he didnt have to go back to the carrier at least not immediately not until he and the squadron of fs being ferried the following day to dutch harbor had flown an attack and reconnaissance mission over adak as winddriven rain swept the runway at dutch harbor the redvested ordnance man stepped out from beneath the wing of shirers f holding the red streamers up showing shirer that all safety wires had been removed the bombs and missiles now ready shirer gave him the thumbsup okay and within a minute the afterburning thrust of the twin pratt and whitney turbofans had the tomcat aloft leading the other nine in arrowhead formation for the mile mission to adak climbing fast they leveled out at ten thousand feet keeping subsonic wings on full spread to conserve fuel for the ninehundredmile return trip this would give the planes well over an hour above and around adak where each plane would drop its concrete divers to crater the runway hopefully rendering it unusable for the russians until a us seaborne and combinedops invasion could be mounted any dogfights of course would drastically decrease the time over target to a matter of minutes with the afterburners kicking in the tomcats would consume a third of their fuel in less than four minutes at full war speed as dutch harbor slid back on the snailgray sea shirer for the first time since his carrier sorties in the sea of japan worried if he would return yet he was not so much afraid as impatient no other woman had made such an impression on him merely to be near her was exciting an excitement only increased by anticipation having been unable to spend any time with her since their arrival in dutch harbor with the rest of the evacuees from adak he found it difficult now to think of anything else last night hed dreamed of having her but each time they embraced she drew away from him shy or afraid he couldnt tell perhaps both he told himself not to get all hung up about it to expect too much if war had taught him anything it was that and a relationship took time or so they said but who had time in a war at fifteen thousand feet they were over umnak a hundred miles west of dutch harbor and he could see the white cone of okmok caldera and the black patches that warned of the turmoil below the surface the next instant they were in thick cloud which had ballooned up under the pressure of a westwardflowing millimaw covering the western aleutians all the way from atka to amchitka island even the most experienced pilot was leery of going into soup on passive radar and radio silence but any signal emanating from the tomcats could provide a homing beam for an enemy missile keeping on radio silence not even talking to their rio in the backseat until the last possible moment shirer and the other ten pilots began their descent toward adak instruments telling them they were okay but every pilot wanting to see for himself the iap of cape adagdak on the northern side of mount adagdak which would bring them over clam lagoon and kulak bay to the left of andrew lagoon where they would pass between mount moffet on their right mount reed to their left exiting over shagak bay and adak strait on the western side of the island coming down through the cloud his cockpit in a constant slipstream of moisture shirer saw the weather clearing and switched on the active radar jammers and the four cameras in the nose suddenly the cloud broke adak dead ahead the sea a shining cobalt blue shot through with silver three dotsfishing boats most likely far left on kulak bay almost immediately the sky started to smudge with aa fire the gutted remnants of adak base like some vast scattered campfire racing toward them at over six hundred miles an hour as their first bombs toppled and they climbed to avoid the shock waves he saw an orange wink from one of the fishing boats and his alarm was flashing the trawler had fired a missile shirer released chaff and flares to thwart its trajectory felt his tomcat buffeted the f to his right gone bogey four high four high someone was yelling he glimpsed the mig closing reduced speed slid left in a defensive break hoping the russian would overshoot instead the russian stayed with him diving down as shirer went into a rolling scissors the two fighters turning fast around each other waiting for a shot suddenly shirer found himself in the migs cone of vulnerability the three green arcs on shirers hud not yet cutting the migs image the bars widening shirer gaining but the mig still outside the impact lines the russian wiggled left right high left but shirer was still on him the sea a blue wall far to his left angel two angel two came his radar operators voice warning him he was at two thousand feet he hauled the tomcat into a steep climb saw the russian behind him then dropped like a stone the huds circle on the migs tail for a millisecond shirer pressed the button and felt the staccato tug of the twentymillimeter multibarreled cannon the tail was gone the migs cockpit flashed in the sun the pilot ejecting his chute ballooning now miles behind the tomcat by now shirer was fifty miles out to sea and as he headed back toward adak he saw the palls of smoke from the bombs of the other eight fighters swooping low in one last pass coming in west of the island he saw the trawler lost in a thick smoke but it hadnt been hit the smoke camouflage of its own making the cockpit went milky and for a moment he thought hed hit a seabird but the radio officer told him it was tracer coming up from the trawler climbing banking hard left now out beyond sitkin sound east of the island he came back in upwind of the trawler its smoke no longer affording it as much protection its tracer still feeling up toward him he centered the dot and gave the trawler a onesecond burst his tracer dancing on the deck shattering the wheelhouse but still the trawler kept firing shirer recognizing it now as the boat that had evacuated them from the island that thing must be armorplated between the bulkheads said shirers rio now everything slid into place explaining the tracer hed seen pouring in from the sea to adak base the night he was shot down maybe hes got a titanium hull the rio half joked not for much longer said shirer the trawler was centered and shirer released his faefuel air explosive the trawler engulfed in an ovoid canopy of fire as he climbed down from the cockpit thanked the ground crew and walked across the tarmac toward the debriefing hut the weather was piteously cold some of the worst hed ever seen but he couldnt care less for lana was waiting though he knew that shortly he and she would be part of this new war in the aleutians for now at least they would be together and just as when he was in the air high above the earth where time was measured not by the hour but by the second and life rushed in the vein it was the quality of the time they would have together that was important not its duration not even the fact that the camera recon showed that the flogger he had shot down had probably been the one that had brought him down particularly interested him there was no doubt the floggers logo a russian name that translated as marchenko above a rampant black bear crushing a bald eagle in its claws would stay with him and it was certain that the two air forces would clash in battles yet to come but until then he would spend as much good time with lana as possible chapter fortyfour her face drawn beside herself with worry about edouard and his parents her sense of selfdignity and worth shattered by the humiliation of her jail cell malle jaakson was lost for the first time in her life for the past fiftyodd years she had been a model citizen of the republic of estonia to her people who ended up behind bars were the neerdowells of society even political prisoners automatically assumed by the west to be innocent of all wrongdoing against society had been regarded by her as fundamentally troublemakers the kind who would not be happy in any system and now here she was inside the damp cold cell the smell of it the odor of ageless despair no matter how you were when they brought you here the degradation of that moment would never leave forever after a part of you would feel dirty it was not the charge of murder that overwhelmed her of this she knew she was guilty she had seen no other way and would pay the ultimate price what had struck her with the most force was the indifference of her jailers she had feared they would beat her and they had not at first she thought this was because she had no information to give that they assumed she knew no saboteurs in tallinn which was true but it quickly became evident to her that she did not matter to them because she was a mere thing one of the countless thousands of balts they had processed through these cells over the years they had photographed her given her a number checked her file for previous crimes against the state there were none indeed she had an honorable discharge from the baltic fleets signal school then locked her up and left her to herself she had found this bad enough but what was worse was the mundane but dreadful formality of having to surrender her stockings her bra the belt of her coat the laces from her lowheeled shoes and her glasses having not said a word so far she now asked them why this petty humiliation was necessary to stop you answered one of the guards his voice one of tired boredom from trying to kill yourself do you care she had wanted to ask but the cell gave her the answer it was merely a rule they were enforcing like that of having to use the bucket in one corner of the cell to move it was punishable by solitary confinement they issued her prison garb a coarse blackandgraystriped woolen dress supposed to fit all sizes and which without a belt made everyone look pregnant how she wondered did the mens prison pajamas stay up surely they were not fitted with a belt she remembered seeing trials on tv of those charged with crimes against the state the prisoners required to stand before the prosecutor allowed only one hand with which to clutch the waist sometimes one of the more frail prisoners who could not keep his balance would falter and the pajamas would drop the packed courtroom erupting in laughter the three judges warning the gallery they would not tolerate such outbursts after she had been so suddenly taken from the world above to the world of the cells the effect of her first few hours an old man a psychiatric criminal in the next cell telling her what he would do with her was devastating she was terrified not of what she had done but of how quickly her selfconfidence had been shattered by the most banal loss of dignity malle had always believed she was made of sterner stuff but now with the suddenness of revelation she understood how so many confessions had been obtained by the secret police most of the public she thought felt as she did that apart from admissions of guilt extracted under duress most other confessions especially those given in the first twelve hours when the ink was barely dry on the charge sheet were true now she understood how in those first hours the psychological collapse could be total you were ready to confess to anything just to get your shoelaces back during the night she had been unable to sleep the terror of her impending death mounting in her the madman in the cell quiet asleep or dead she did not know she called to him and there was no answer she listened vainly for the sound of breathing but there was none or if there was it was muffled by the hollow clanking of the pipes in that moment the certainty of the firing squad made her so weak that she longed only for its finality the end of her suffering and sobbing she clung to the bars you she thought it was a new guard she hadnt seen before but without her glasses she was unsure she could hear the crunching of boots on the cobbled courtyard above her and the click of the rifles bolts come on the guard hurried her instinctively she looked about for her glasses then remembered they had been taken walking in front of him she heard the crash of the volley the clicking of rifles and the crunch of the boots again barely able to stand clinging to the banister as she was ordered to the second floor her mind numb with fear and unable to see the edge of the steps clearly because of her shortsightedness she was nevertheless vaguely aware of the guard changing his deportment and brushing what appeared to be dandruff off the shoulder boards of his baggy uniform inside the room she squinted in the brightness of the northern sun that was streaming in its beams of light giving the rooms sparse but elegant furniture a surreal look but there was nothing surreal or imaginary about the russian officer his back to her an admiral from his splendid uniform he turned as the guard slid the chair behind her told her to sit down clicked his heels and left the room the echoes of his footsteps hollow and hard she sat down why asked the admiral looking out the window standing behind his wide baizecovered desk a ray of sunlight slicing the air between them dust particles dancing crazily within why did you kill the corporal he did unspeakable things to me he raped you yes how many times did this occur does it matter she marveled at her defiant tone why did you not come to the authorities he was the authorities she said it was as if her inner voice against all odds demanded to be heard he came to my city like you all come and do what you want you knew no saboteurs he was investigating none your son daughterinlaw were they saboteurs she wanted to say no but instead she said perhaps i dont know they went to work one morning and never came back shot along with all your other hostages i expect it was several seconds before the admiral spoke again you have a grandson she said nothing sensing danger he was caught last night said the admiral trying to storm the jail it was very silly she started forward in her seat what have you we have taken him to school where he belongs he turned and glanced down at a file mustam√§e complex is this where you live she nodded afraid to say another word the admiral sat down took out a pen signed a paper and tapped the small bell by the blotter the admirals aide entered the admiral handing him the file return the prisoners personal effects yes admiral the aide a major his features indistinct until he came closer smiled down at malle follow me please as he led her down the curving stone stairwell he glanced back at malle youre a lucky woman she dared not think of it she dared hardly breathe but her heart was beating so hard at the prospect of freedom she thought it would burst through her chest at the front desk the major handed her a pen go on he said dont be afraid its a release form confirming that you have received all your personal effects the clerk pushed a hessian bag with a cardboard label her name scribbled on it across the counter inside were her travel in tallinn only permit card shoelaces clothes and glasses she looked up at the aide still not daring to hope youre free he said the admiral believed you you may change in the washroom over there when malle came out he escorted her to the door and called for a driver you are also to take this he said handing her a square package the size of a small cake box these papers he added giving her two buffcolored forms are your interim permits until new identity cards are issued it is a new regulation he opened the door to the car wished her good day then returned up the stone stairs in the back of the drab olive army sedan as the driver waited to pull out into the traffic she put the package by her side and carefully folded the papers the aide had given her suddenly she was staring down at the release order signed by admiral brodsky of the baltic fleet as the car pulled away she looked up at the window but the reflection of the sun was such that she could not see if he was there or not the driver cursed beeped his horn and assumed because a car had been ordered for her that she must be some kind of vip though she certainly didnt dress like it bad news eh he said what pardon it was as if she were in a dream they say the americans are crossing the weser she didnt know where the weser was exactly only that it was somewhere in germany western germany she thought yes she agreed bad news she had wanted to open the package immediately in the car but had restrained herself until she returned to the apartment the can inside the cardboard box still had the blue and white duty stamp on it to show it hadnt been opened for several minutes she merely lingered over it then very slowly opened it inhaling the deep rich smell of the finely ground chocolateflavored coffee detaching the plastic lid from the bottom of the can she placed it on the top tightly so that none would be spilled clutching it she took it to her bedroom and collapsing on the bed held it to her breast sobbing uncontrollably in san diego following the networks sixoclock news a story broke on san diego affiliate kvtv that california congressman hailey had been found dead in his la jolla home the tv story showed distraught staffers from the congressmans san diego office saying that the cause of death was not known at this time rumors that the congressman had taken his own life were vigorously denied pending an sdpd investigation the following morning mr jay la roche of la roche pharmaceuticals whom a reporter described as a close friend and supporter of congressman hailey was shocked and saddened by the tragic news commenting that california has lost one of her most able and compassionate representatives within a few days la roche pharmaceuticals announced that two scholarship funds in the name of congressman hailey would be set up one for a male student one for a female at the university of california stanford campus the army driver in tallinn had been correct the americans had crossed the weser east of stadthagen as part of the general counterattack all along the nato line whether natos troops could sustain the advance was a matter of widely differing conjecture in the world capitals but for now freeman almost completely recovered from the painful paresis that had followed his back injury undeniably had the bit in his mouth and everywhere the russians were in retreat at a crucial crossing over the mittelell canal at peine thirty miles east of hannover major norton of general freemans g was in one of the bradley armored personnel carriers on the pontoon bridge when the latter came under heavy fire from an eightgun battery of soviet selfpropelled millimeter howitzers the russian gunners unable to retreat because they were out of fuel had the pontoon bridge bracketed and were bringing down a deadly rain of kilogram he shells taking out three of the bradleys killing all thirtysix men aboard in the first two salvos just when norton was convinced the apc in which he was riding was the next to be hit the russian fire became erratic and for the next three minutes stopped altogether permitting norton and the rest of the us second armored column following to cross the canal in safety when the americans overran the russian battery site fourteen miles farther on near braunschweig the russians were gone but the selfpropelled guns and piles of discarded and unused ammunition remained major nortons bent for detail did not fail him and he noted in his written report on the incident that the hitherto unexplained erratic fire of the millimeters was due not to any fault with the lay of the chassismounted guns but appeared to be caused by deficiencies in the millemeter he rounds themselves whose markings showed they had been manufactured somewhere in the baltic republics the letters mj had been stamped on several of the duds cartridge seals but as yet norton could not explain the specific designation mj chapter fortyfive richard spence resplendent in his tuxedo at the head table moved his arm forward on the dazzling white linen so that his sleeve would allow him a glimpse of his watch without him seeming rude the wedding had gone splendidly the traditional book of common prayer service quite moving and which his new soninlaw had appeared to enjoy as much as rosemary she had been breathtakingly beautiful in her mothers wedding gown and he had never seen her so happy anne to her credit as richards barrister uncle geoffrey noted had shown no outward sign of the devastating loss of their youngest and the reception was a veritable feast surely they must be ready by now richard said to geoffrey the longer rosemary was taking to change into her goingaway outfit the more her sixth form class from st anselms was going to devour well richard old boy i should think this lotll set you back a few pounds said geoffrey looking out on the swirl of the dancers and on what he called the provisioning a few pounds responded richard i should think itll wipe me out i dont know where on earth anne got all this food and richard waited till the skirl of the bagpipes died down secretly wishing theyd die altogether hoarding geoffrey said raising his voice theyre very good at it women even so were feeding over two hundred people as well as good lord richard sat forward almost spilling his champagne did you see that that boy one of rosemarys students i think he ate an entire cupcake at one gulp hate to think of what hell cost me alone with that richard sat back sighing resignedly shant have any money left for young georgina ah said geoffrey pausing over his sherry i didnt know she was casting her net she isnt replied richard he is the first officerzeldman good grief a bourgeois american dont tell me georginas giving up on mel richard was completely taken by surprise i didnt think she was going out with anyone called mel no no richard marx engels and that awful lenin oh that richard smiled well she has an attack every now and then usually when she and rosey get together cats and dogs quite nasty at times though they seem to care when it counts she gave rosey and robert a lovely wedding present dont tell me cut in geoffrey das kapital first edition richard raised his glass to a beefy courtly man pushing his wife about the floor no he answered geoffrey but youre close the first edition brownings poems the portuguese oh said geoffrey then richard im afraid youre right how dyou mean i mean old boy that once they start spouting that stuff let me count the waysyoud better batten down the hatches to your bank account itll be wedding bells and another great cake geoffreys eyes looked over to admire the remains of the splendid threetiered creation i must say that was a magnificent icing job a rosemary hallowes i expect yes shes very good i believe they call it frosting in america really they are peculiar our cousins over the water yes said richard softly and fell silent sorry richard i didnt mean to no its quite all right geoffrey its just that im still not over it time they say cures nothing said geoffrey definitively merely covers it over itll never go away richard why should it he was a fine boy too young and too good to die they both fell silent for a moment geoffrey sipping his sherry twas ever thus richard yes i know its no help really but go on well georgina was telling me earlier before the service that commander brentwoods sister wrote to you about william his nurse apparently yes it was very kind of her and very much appreciated meant the world to anne theres another brother isnt there i dont mean our young hero of what do they call it stadthagen can never remember those german names always sound like catarrh then how about kyle of lochalsh sounds absolutely revolting is that where theyre going in scotland its on roseys list passing through though i expect the honeymoons to be a bedandbreakfast tour western scotland for two weeks in this weather theyll freeze ah then again perhaps not eh richard b and b can be quite cozy im told i hope so geoffrey they deserve it hear hear if they can grab a little happiness in this world gone mad then the best of british he paused raising his glass and yankee luck to them theyll need it up there he wont understand a word of it you know the scots are quite impenetrable oh i dont know geoffrey they managed to tow his ship back to holy loch hell be off again then i expect after the honeymoon cant say very hushhush he never talks about it all i know is the ship was towed up from falmouth should you be saying that oh the base at holy loch thats common knowledge no i mean ship i understand submarines are called boats not anymore ships these days and sailno conning tower anymore ships and sail mused geoffrey i like that possibly because it gives me the illusion along with this rather bad sherry that were not in this modern world with its pushbutton whatsits must say im glad im not in it not yet at least said richard im sorry about the sherry its not yours richard its mine i gave it to anne far too sweet and what on earth do you mean by not yet well apparently theres this chap marchenko quite ruthless by all accounts im sure hes not finished with us the telegraphs reporting that if the russians get desperate enough they could very well push the button then well all be in it well all be dead you mean no theyre talking about what you barristers i think would call a middle case what gas and biological warfare yes by god richard youre a cheery soul just facing facts geoffrey but this chap freemans got em on the run damned tough customer by all accounts yes but he cant do it alone and now the russians have got america on a twofront war then theres still this korean business its not finished by any means the telegraphs tokyo correspondent reports that the chinese are ready to move across the yalu if the americans dont stop there theyre not going to stop richard why should they they made macarthur stop and look what they got they wont make that mistake twice then the chinese will come in and the telegraph the telegraph said geoffrey with a trace of irritability fair enough i suppose but good lord richard theyre not the only source dont they publish those advertisements by that demented knowlton chap you know the hair dryer maniac really theres more than one paper old boy of course but the new york times says much the same thing that no way the russians are going to call it quits were not even at the elbe he paused alarmed at a group of annes conservative club women purposefully approaching him and geoffrey richard smiled graciously murmuring to geoffrey its that dreadful mrs lamptini again theyre going to ask us to dance what said geoffrey im off coward said richard suddenly the music died followed by cheers and scattered applause rosemary was at the top of the stairs radiant in a jadegreen coat white imitation fur hat and corsage holding her bouquet she did not try to tease with the bouquet but tossed it gently and straight to georgina the ladies were drawn by ancient rite toward the young couple peter zeldman and georgina ah prophecy said geoffrey get your checkbook ready richard richard said nothing georgina had told him she didnt like the best man but with georgina he knew you could never be sure only time would tell anne appeared fussing about lastminute details as robert and rosemary headed out for the car doesnt he look wonderful richard heard mrs lamptini say those americans as most of the guests crowded about the door to wish the couple well the st anselms boys after having checked that their cans and various impedimenta had been firmly attached beneath the car returned to the food where an argument was developing about whether or not there were enemy spies in england of course there are you twit said one of the taller boys a prefect how do you think they know where the convoys are well they havent caught any have they said another boy defensively dont be simple bingham those trials are held in camera so as not to upset the populace my pater told me the boy took a toothpick from a silver cup and looked for a cocktail sausage to stab quite frankly if i were the russians i d have spies go after the captains of the submarines submarine captains arent two a penny you know and if you get them then youve effectively oh do put a sock in it said one of the others come on lets see miss spence off mrs brentwood you nit all right mrs brentwood richard and anne had gone outside by the car to say their goodbyes when it came time to shake hands with robert brentwood richard was quite unable to speak but as the men looked at each other there was ample understanding richard knew that the war would go on and that men like robert would be returning to it soon and that the war of the submarines would almost certainly become increasingly dangerous as more and more countries sought to redress their setbacks on land by sending their secret boats into the seas that covered over twothirds of the planet he was sure also that with the russians having attacked the aleutians the titanic struggle would move to americas shore but now for a moment for two people very much in love the world stood still
