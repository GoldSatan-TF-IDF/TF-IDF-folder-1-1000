jeffery deaver hells kitchen the third book in the john pellam series im a professional ive survived in a pretty rough business humphrey bogart one he climbed the stairs his boots falling heavily on burgundy floral carpet and where it was threadbare on the scarred oak beneath the stairwell was unlit in neighborhoods like this one the bulbs were stolen from the ceiling sockets and the emergency exit signs as soon as they were replaced john pellam lifted his head tried to place a curious smell he couldnt knew only that it left him feeling unsettled edgy second floor the landing starting up another flight this was maybe his tenth time to the old tenement but he was still finding details that had eluded him on prior visits tonight what caught his eye was a stainedglass valance depicting a hummingbird hovering over a yellow flower in a hundredyearold tenement in one of the roughest parts of new york city why beautiful stained glass and why a hummingbird a shuffle of feet sounded above him and he glanced up hed thought he was alone something fell soft thud a sigh like the undefinable smell the sounds left him uneasy pellam paused on the thirdfloor landing and looked at the stained glass above the door to apartment b this valance a bluebird or jay sitting on a branch was as carefully done as the hummingbird downstairs when hed first come here several months ago hed glanced at the scabby facade and expected that the interior would be decrepit but hed been wrong it was a craftsmans showpiece oak floorboards joined solid as steel walls of plaster seamless as marble the sculpted newel posts and banisters arched alcoves built into the walls to hold presumably catholic icons he that smell again stronger now his nostrils flared another thud above him a gasp he felt urgency and looking up he continued along the narrow stairs listing against the weight of the betacam batteries and assorted videotaping effluence in the bag he was sweating rivers it was ten pm but the month was august and new york was at its most demonic what was that smell the scent flirted with his memory then vanished again obscured by the aroma of frying onions garlic and overused oil he remembered that ettie kept a folgers coffee can filled with old grease on her stove saves me some money ill tell you halfway between the third and fourth floors pellam paused again wiped his stinging eyes thats what did it he remembered a studebaker he pictured his parents purple car the late s resembling a spaceship burning slowly down to the tires his father had accidentally dropped a cigarette on the seat igniting the upholstery of the buck rogers car pellam his parents and the entire block watched the spectacle in horror or shock or secret delight what he smelled now was the same smoulder smoke then a cloud of hot fumes wafted around him he glanced over the banister into the stairwell at first he saw nothing but darkness and haze then with a huge explosion the door to the basement blew inward and flames like rocket exhaust filled the stairwell and the tiny firstfloor lobby fire pellam shouted as the black cloud preceding the flames boiled up at him he was banging on the nearest door there was no answer he started down the stairs but the fire drove him back the tidal wave of smoke and sparks was too thick he began to choke and felt a shudder through his body from the grimy air he was breathing he gagged goddamn it was moving fast flames chunks of paper flares of sparks swirled up like a cyclone through the stairwell all the way to the sixth the top floor he heard a scream above him and looked into the stairwell ettie the elderly womans dark face looked over the railing from the fifthfloor landing gazing in horror at the flames she mustve been the person hed heard earlier trudging up the stairs ahead of him she held a plastic grocery bag in her hand she dropped it three oranges rolled down the stairs past him and died in the flames hissing and spitting blue sparks john she called whats she coughed the building he couldnt make out any other words he started toward her but the fire had ignited the carpet and a pile of trash on the fourth floor it flared in his face the orange tentacles reaching for him and he stumbled back down the stairs a shred of burning wallpaper wafted upward encircled his head before it did any damage it burned to cool ash he stumbled back onto the thirdfloor landing banged on another door ettie he shouted up into the stairwell get to a fire escape get out down the hall a door opened cautiously and young hispanic boy looked out eyes wide a yellow power ranger dangling in his hand call nineoneone pellam shouted call the door slammed shut pellam knocked hard he thought he heard screams but he wasnt sure because the fire now sounded like a speeding truck deafening roar the flames ate up the carpet and were disintegrating the banister like cardboard ettie he shouted choking on the smoke he dropped to his knees john save yourself get out run the flames between them were growing the wall the flooring the carpet the valance exploded raining hot shards of stainedglass birds on his face and shoulders how could it move so fast pellam wondered growing faint sparks exploded around him clicking and snapping like ricochets there was no air he couldnt breathe john help me ettie screamed its on that side i cant the wall of fire had encircled her she couldnt reach the window that opened onto the fire escape from the fourth floor down and the second floor up the flames advanced on him he looked up and saw ettie on the fifth floor backing away from the sheet of flame that approached her the portion of the stairs separating them collapsed she was trapped two stories above him he was retching batting at flecks of cinders burning holes in his work shirt and jeans the wall exploded outward a finger of flame shot out the tip caught pellam on the arm and set fire to the gray shirt he didnt think so much about dying as he did the pain from fire about it blinding him burning his skin to black scar tissue destroying his lungs he rolled on his arm and put the flame out climbed to his feet ettie he looked up to see her turn away from the flames and fling open a window ettie he shouted try to get up to the roof theyll get a hook and ladder he backed to the window hesitated then with a crash flung his canvas bag through the glass the forty thousand dollars worth of video camera rolling onto the metal stairs a half dozen other tenants in panic ignored it and continued stumbling downward toward the alley pellam climbed onto the fire escape and looked back get to the roof he cried to ettie but maybe that path too was blocked the flames were everywhere now or maybe in her panic she just didnt think through the boiling fire his eyes met hers and she gave a faint smile then without a scream or shout that he could hear etta wilkes washington broke out a window long ago painted shut and paused for a moment looking down then she leapt into the air fifty feet above the cobblestoned alley beside the building the alley that pellam recalled contained the cobblestone on which isaac b cleveland had scratched his declaration of love for teenage ettie wilkes fiftyfive years ago the old womans slight frame vanished into the smoke a wheezing groan of timber and steel then a crash like a sledgehammer on metal as something structural gave way pellam jumped back to the edge of the fire escape nearly tumbling over the railing and as the cascade of orange sparks flowed over him staggered downstairs he was in as much of a hurry as the escaping tenants though the mission on his mind now wasnt to flee the ravaging fire but thinking of etties daughter to find the womans body and carry it away from the building before the walls collapsed entombing it in a fiery disfiguring grave two he opened his eyes and found the guard looking down at him sir you a patient here he sat up too fast and found that while the efforts of escaping the fire had left him sore and bruised sleeping these past five hours in the orange fiberglass chairs of the ers waiting room was what had really done him in the crook in his neck was pure pain i fell asleep you cant sleep here i was a patient they treated me last night i fell asleep yessir you been treated you cant stay his jeans were pocked with burn holes and he supposed he was filthy the guard mustve mistaken him for a bum okay he said just give me a minute pellam moved his head in slow circles something deep in his neck popped an ache like brain freeze from a frozen drink spread through his head he winced then looked around he could understand why the hospital guard had rousted him the room was completely filled with people awaiting treatment words rose and fell like surf spanish english arabic everyone was frightened or resigned or irritated and to pellams mind the resigned ones were the most unsettling the man next to him sat forward forearms resting on his knees in his right hand dangled a single childs shoe the guard had delivered his message and then lost interest in enforcing his edict he wandered off toward two teenagers who were smoking a joint in the corner pellam rose stretched he dug through his pockets and found the slip of paper hed been given last night he squinted and read what was written on it pellam picked up the heavy video camera and started down a long corridor following the signs toward the b wing the thin green line hardly moved at all a portly indian doctor stood beside the bed staring up as if trying to decide if the hewlettpackard monitor was broken he glanced down at the figure in the bed covered with sheets and blankets and hung the metal chart on a hook john pellam stood in the doorway his bleary eyes slid from the grim dawn landscape outside manhattan hospital back to the unmoving form of ettie washington shes in a coma he asked no the doctor responded shes asleep sedated will she be all right shes got a broken arm sprained ankle no internal injuries we could find were going to run some scans brain scans she hit on her head when she fell you know only family members can be in icu oh an exhausted pellam responded im her son the doctors eyes remained still for a moment then flicked toward ettie washington whose skin was as dark as a mahogany banister you son the blank eyes stared up at him youd think a doctor working on the roughandtumble west side of manhattan wouldve had a better sense of humor tell you what pellam said let me sit with her for a few minutes i wont steal any bedpans you can count em before i leave still no smile but the man said five minutes pellam sat down heavily and rested his chin in his hands sending jolts of pain through his neck he sat up and held it cocked to the side two hours later a nurse pushed briskly into the room and woke him up when she glanced at pellam it was more to survey his bandages and torn jeans than to question his presence whoalls the patient here she asked in a throaty dallas drawl an whos visitin pellam massaged his neck then nodded at the bed we take turns how is she oh shes one tough lady how come she isnt awake doped her up good the doctor was talking about some scans they always do that keep their butts covered i think shell be okay i was talking to her before you were whatd she say i think it was somebody burned down my apartment what kinda blanketyblankd do that only she didnt say blanketyblank thats ettie same fire the nurse asked glancing at his burnt jeans and shirt pellam nodded he explained about etties jumping out the window it wasnt cobblestones she landed on however but two days worth of packed garbage bags which broke her fall pellam had carried her to the ems crews and then returned to the building to help get other tenants out finally the smoke had gotten to him too and hed passed out hed awakened in the same hospital you know the nurse said youre all um sooty you look like one of those commandoes in a schwarzenegger movie pellam wiped at his face and examined five dirty fingertips here the nurse disappeared into the hall and returned a moment later with a wet cloth she paused debating he guessed whether or not to clean him herself and chose to hand off to the patient pellam took the cloth and wiped away until the washcloth was black you uh want some coffee she asked pellams stomach churned he guessed hed swallowed a pound of ash no thanks hows my face now you just look dirty that is to say its an improvement got pans to change bah now she vanished pellam stretched his long legs out in front of him and examined the holes in his levis a total waste he then spent a few minutes examining the betacam which some kind soul had given to the paramedics and had been admitted with him to the emergency room he gave it his standard diagnostic check he shook it nothing rattled the ampex recording deck was dented but it rolled fine and the tape inside the one that contained what was apparently the last interview that would ever be conducted in west thirtysixth street was unhurt now john whatre we gonna talk about today you want to hear more about billy doyle my first husband that old son of a bitch see that man was what hells kitchen was all about he was big here but little everywhere else he was nothing anywhere else it was like this place its its own world hmm i got a good story to tell you bout him i think you might like this story he couldnt remember much else of what ettie had told him at their last interview couple of days ago hed set the camera up in her small apartment filled with the mementos of a sevendecade life hundred pictures baskets knickknacks furniture bought at goodwill food protected from roaches in tupperware she could barely afford hed set the camera up turned it on and just let her talk see people live in hells kitchen get these ideas they get schemes you know billy he wanted land he had his eye on a couple of lots over near where the javits center is today i tell you heda brought that off heda been one rich mick i can say mick cause he said that bout himself then motion from the bed interrupted these thoughts the elderly woman eyes still closed picked at the hem of the blanket two dark thumbs two fingers lifting invisible pearls this concerned pellam he remembered month ago the last living gestures of otis balm as the yearold man had glanced toward the lilac bush outside the window of his west side nursing home and began picking at his sheet the old man had been a resident of etties building for years and though hospitalized had been pleased to talk about his life in the kitchen suddenly the man had fallen silent and started picking at his blanket as ettie was doing now then he stopped moving pellam called for help the doctor confirmed the death they always did that he explained at the end they pick at the bedclothes pellam leaned closer to ettie washington a sudden moaning filled the air it became a voice whos that the womans hands grew still and she opened her eyes but still apparently couldnt see too well whos there where am i ettie pellam spoke casually its john pellam squinting ettie stared at him i cant see too good where am i hospital she coughed for a minute and asked for a glass of water im so glad you came you got out okay i did yep he told her pellam poured a glass for her ettie emptied it without pausing i kind of remember jumping oh i was scared the doctor said i was in surprisingly good shape he said that surprisingly good didnt understand him at first she grumbled hes indian like you know an overseas indian curry an elephants havent seen a single american doctor here does it hurt much ill say she examined her arm closely dont i look the mess etties tongue clicked looking over the imposing bandages naw youre a cover girl all things considered youre a mess too john im so glad you got out my last thought as i was falling toward the alley was no johns going to die too what a thought that was i took the easy way down the stairs what the hell happened she muttered i dont know one minute nothing the next the whole place was gone like a matchbox i was shopping i was on my way to my apartment i heard you you must have gotten back just before i got there i didnt see you on the street she continued i never saw fire move like that was like auroras that club i told you bout on fortyninth street where i sang a time or two burned down in fortyseven march thirteenth buncha people died you remember me telling you that story pellam didnt remember he supposed the account could be found somewhere in the hours and hours of tapes of ettie washington back in his apartment she blew her nose and coughed for a moment that smoke thats the worst did everybody get out nobody was killed pellam answered juan torress in critical condition hes upstairs in the kids icu etties face went still pellam had seen this expression on her face only once before when shed talked about her youngest son whod been killed in times square years before juan she whispered she didnt speak for a moment i thought he was at his grandmas for a few days in the bronx he was home she looked heartsick and pellam was at a loss to comfort her etties eyes returned to the blanket shed been picking at an ashen tone flooded her face how bout i sign that cast pellam asked why of course pellam took out a marking pen anywhere how bout here he signed with a round scrawl in the busy hall outside a placid electronic bell rang four times i was thinking pellam said you want me to call your daughter no the old woman responded i talked to her already called her this morning when i was awake she was worried sick but i said im not in the great byandby yet she oughta wait bout coming and lets see what happens with those tests if theyre gonna cut id rather her come then maybe hook her up with one of those handsome doctors like on er lisbethd like a rich doctor she has that side to her like i was telling you a knock sounded on the halfopen door four men in business suits walked into the room they were large somber men and their presence suddenly made the hospital room even with the other three empty beds seem very small pellam glanced at them knew they were cops so arson was suspected that would explain the speed of the fire ettie nodded uneasily at the men mrs washington the oldest of the men asked he was in his midforties thin shoulders and a belly that could use a little shrinking he wore jeans and windbreaker and pellam noticed a very large revolver on his hip im fire marshal lomax this is my assistant he nodded at a huge young man bodybuilder and these are detectives with the new york city police department one of the cops turned to pellam and asked him to leave no no ettie protested hes my friend its okay the officer looked at pellam the glance repeating the request its okay pellam said to ettie theyll want to talk to me too ill come back when theyre through youre a frienda hers lomax asked yeah well want to talk to you but you arent coming back in here give your name and address to the officer there and take off im sorry pellam smiled confused name and address to him lomax nodded to the assistant then he snapped then get the hell out i dont think so the marshal put his large hands on his large hips we can play it this way we can play it that way pellam crossed his arms spread his feet slightly im not leaving her john no its okay lomax this rooms sealed off from visitors uh uh uh dont ask why its none of your business i dont believe my business is any of yours pellam replied the line came from an unproduced movie hed written years ago hed been dying for a chance to use it fuck it said one of the detectives we dont have time for this get him out the assistant curled his vicegrip hands around pellams arm and walked him toward the door the gesture shot a jolt of icy pain through his stiff neck pellam pulled away abruptly and when he did this the cop decided that pellam might like to rest up against the wall for a few minutes he pinned him there until his arms went numb from the lack of circulation his boots almost off the floor pellam shouted at lomax get this guy off me what the hell is going on but the fire marshal was busy he was concentrating hard on the little white card in his hand as he recited the miranda warning to ettie then arrested her for reckless endangerment assault and arson yo dont forget attempted murder one of the detectives called oh yeah lomax muttered he glanced at ettie and added with a shrug well you heard him three etties building like most new york tenements built in the nineteenth century had measured thirtyfive by seventyfive feet and been constructed of limestone the rock used for hers was ruddy a terra cotta shade before there were no codes governing the construction of these sixstory residences and many builders had thrown together tenements using rotten lathe and mortar and plaster mixed with sawdust but those structures the shoddy ones had long ago crumbled tenements like this one ettie washington had explained to john pellams earnest video camera had been built by men who cared about their craft alcoves for the virgin and glass hummingbirds hovering above doorways there was no reason why these buildings couldnt last for two hundred years no reason other than gasoline and a match this morning pellam walked toward what was left of the building there wasnt much just a black stone shell filled with a jumble of scorched mattresses furniture paper appliances the base of the building was a thick ooze of gray sludge ash and water pellam froze staring at a hand protruding from one pile of muck he ran toward it then stopped when he noticed the seam in the vinyl at the wrist it was a mannequin practical jokes hells kitchen style on a hump of refuse was a huge porcelain bathtub sitting on its claw feet perfectly level it was filled with brackish water pellam continued to circle the place pushed closer through the crowd of gapers in front of the yellow police tape like shoppers waiting at the door for a oneday macys sale most of them had the edgy eagerness of urban scavengers but the pickings were sparse there were dozens of mattresses stained and burned the skeletons of cheap furniture and appliances waterlogged books a rabbitears antenna the building wasnt wired for cable sat on a glob of plastic the samsung logo and a circuit board the only recognizable part of the former tv the stench was horrific pellam finally spotted the man hed been looking for thered been a costume change he was now wearing jeans a windbreaker and firemans boots ducking under the tape pellam walked up to the fire marshal pasting enough authority on his face to get him all the way to the building itself without being stopped by the crime scene techs and firemen milling about he heard lomax say to his huge assistant the man whod pinned pellam against the wall in etties room there the spalling he was pointing to chipping in the brick thats a hot spot point of origins behind that wall get a photog to shoot it the marshal crouched and examined something on the ground pellam stopped a few feet away lomax looked up pellam had showered and changed clothes the camouflage on his face was gone and it took a moment for the marshal to recognize him you lomax said pellam thinking hed try the friendly approach offered hey how you doing get lost the marshal snapped just wanted to talk to you for a second lomaxs attention returned to the ground at the hospital theyd taken his name and checked with nypd lomax his detective friends and especially the big assistant seemed to regret that there was no reason to detain pellam or even to search him painfully and so they settled for taking a brief statement and shoving him down the corridor with the warning that if he wasnt out of the hospital in five minutes hed be arrested for obstruction of justice just a few questions he now asked lomax a rumpled man reminded pellam of a high school coach who was a lousy athlete he rose from his crouch looked pellam over quick eyes scanning not cautious not belligerent just trying to figure him out pellam asked i want to know why you arrested her it doesnt make any sense i was there i know she didnt set the fire this is a crime scene lomax returned to his spalling his words didnt exactly sound like a warning but pellam supposed they were i just want to ask you get back behind the line the line the tape will do just let me arrest him lomax barked to the assistant who started to not a problem im going pellam lifted his hands and walked back behind the line there he crouched and took the betacam out of the bag he aimed it at the back of lomaxs head he turned it on through the clear viewfinder he saw uniformed cop whisper something to lomax who glanced back once then turned away behind them the smoldering hulk of the tenement sat in a huge messy pile it occurred to pellam that even though he was just doing this for lomaxs benefit it was gradea footage the fire marshal ignored pellam for as long as he could then he turned and walked to him pushed the lens aside all right can the bullshit pellam shut the camera off she didnt start the fire pellam said whatre you a reporter something like that she didnt start it huh who did was it you i gave my statement to your assistant does he have a name by the way lomax ignored this answer my question if youre so sure she didnt start the fire then maybe you did no i didnt start the fire pellam gave a frustrated sigh howd you get out of the building the fire escape but she says she wasnt in her apartment when it started who buzzed you in rhonda sanchez in d you know her met her she knows i was doing a film about ettie so she let me in lomax asked quickly if ettie wasnt there then whyd you go in at all we were going to meet at ten i figured if she was out shed be back in a few minutes id wait upstairs turns out shed been shopping didnt that seem kind of strange an old lady out on the streets of hells kitchen at ten pm ettie keeps her own hours lomax was now in a talkative mood so you just happened to be beside the fire escape when the fire started lucky man sometimes i am pellam said tell me exactly what you saw i gave him my statement lomax snapped back which didnt tell me shit give me some details be helpful pellam thought for a moment deciding that the more cooperative he was the better it would be for ettie he explained about looking into the stairwell seeing the door blow outward about the fire and smoke and sparks lots of sparks lomax and his prowrestler assistant remained impassive and pellam said im not much help i suppose if youre telling the truth youre tons of help why would i lie tell me mr lucky was there more flame or more smoke more smoke i guess the fire marshal nodded what color was the flame i dont know firecolored orange any blue no lomax recorded these facts exasperated pellam asked what do you have on her evidence witnesses lomaxs smile pled the fifth look pellam snapped shes a seventyyearold lady hey mr lucky lemme tell you something last year fire marshals investigated ten thousand suspicious fires in the city more than half were arson and a third of those were set by women that doesnt really seem like admissible evidence what was your probable cause lomax turned to his assistant probable cause he knows probable cause learn that from nypd blue murder one naw you look like an ojsimpsonwatcher to me fuck you and your probable cause get the hell out of here back behind the police line pellam continued to take footage and lomax continued to ignore him he was filming the grimy alley behind the building memorializing the stack of garbage bags that had saved etties bacon when he heard a thin wail the noise smoke might make if smoke made noise he walked toward the construction site across the street where a sixtystory highrise was nearing completion as he approached the smoke became words one a them ima be one a them the woman sat in the shadow of a huge dumpster beside two eroded stone bulldogs which had guarded the stairs to etties building for one hundred and thirty years she was a black woman with a pretty pocked face her white blouse smudged and torn crouching pellam said sibbie you all right she continued to stare at the ruined tenement sibbie remember me its john i took some pictures of you for my movie you told me about moving down here from harlem you remember me the woman didnt seem to hed met her on the doorstep one day when hed come to interview ettie and shed apparently heard about him because without any other greeting shed said she would tell him about her life for twenty dollars some documentary filmmakers might balk on the ethical issue of paying subjects but pellam slipped her the bill and was shooting footage before shed decided which pocket to put it in it was a waste of money and time though she was making up most of what she told him you got out okay distracted sibbie explained that shed been at home with her children at the time of the fire just starting a dinner of rice and beans with ketchup they easily escaped but she and the youngsters had returned risking the flames to save what they could but not the tv we try but it too heavy shit a motherd let her children take a risk like that pellam shivered at the thought behind her were a girl of about four clutching a broken toy and a boy nine or ten with an unsmiling mouth but eyes that seemed irrepressibly cheerful somebody burn us out he said immensely proud man you believe that i ask you a few questions pellam began sibbie said nothing he started the betacam hoping her shortterm memory was better than the recollections of her youth yo you with cnn the boy asked staring at the glowing red eye of the sony nup im working on a movie i took some pictures of your mother last month geddoutahere he cloaked his astonished eyes a movie wesley snipes denzel yeah shit you have any idea how the fire started be the crews the boy said quickly shutcha mouth his mother barked abruptly slipping out of her mournful reverie crews meant gangs which ones the woman remained silent eyes fixed on a key that passing traffic had pressed deep into the asphalt beside it was the butt end of a brass pistol cartridge she looked up at the building lookit that pellam said it was a nice building aint shit now sibbie snapped her fingers with a startling pop oh ima be one a them pellam asked one of who livin on the street we gonna live on the street ima get sick ima get the village curse and i gonna die no youll be okay the cityll take care of you the city shit you see anybody around the basement when the fire started hells yeah the boy said what it is be the crews i seen em this nigger keep his eyes open i sibbie viciously slapped her sons cheek he didnt see nothing all yall aint worry about it no more pellam winced at the slap the boy noticed his expression but the tacit sympathy didnt comfort any more than the blowd seemed to hurt sibbie its not safe around here pellam said go to that shelter the one up the street shelter shit i save me a few things sibbie motioned toward her shopping bag be looking for my mamas lace cant find it shit it gone she called out to a cluster of sightseers all yall find any lace round here no one paid her any attention sibbie you have any money pellam asked i got fi dollar some man give me pellam slipped her a twenty he stepped into the street and flagged down a cab pellam held up a twenty take her to the shelter the one on fiftieth he glanced at his potential fare hey man im going off duty pellam silenced him with another bill the family piled in from the back seat ismail eyes cautious now stared at pellam then the cab was gone he hefted the betacam which now weighed a half ton and lifted it to his shoulder once again whats this a cowboy boots blue jeans black shirt all he needs is a string tie and a horse yeehaw sonny thought everybodys tawking at me hed watched as the cowboy had stuffed the shriveledup nigger lady and her little nigger kids into a cab and had returned to the charred remains of the tenement as hed been doing for the past several hours sonny studied the destroyed building with pleasure and a modicum of itchy lust at the moment he was thinking about the noise of fire the floors had fallen he knew with a crash but nobody would have heard fire is much louder than people think fire roars with the sound of blood in your ears when the flames reach your say knees and he was thinking of the smell he inhaled the unique perfume of scorched wood and carbonized plastic and oxidized metal then reluctantly he surfaced from his reverie and studied the cowboy carefully he was taping the fire marshal as he directed an exhausted fireman to hoe through some refuse with his halligan tool combination axe and crowbar invented by huey halligan an alltime worldclass firefighter pride of the nyfd sonny respected his enemies he knew a lot about them too for instance he knew that there were fire marshals in the city of new york some were good and some were bad but this one lomax was excellent sonny watched him taking pictures of the alligatoring on a piece of charred wood the marshal had spotted that right away god bless him the black squares on the surface were large and shiny which meant the fire was fast and it was hot useful in the investigation and the trial as if theyd ever catch him the marshal picked up a sixfoot hook and broke through a groundfloor window shone his flashlight inside a few years ago the city created the red hat patrol in the fire marshals department theyd give marshals red baseball caps and sent them cruising through highrisk arson areas those were the days when sonny was just learning his trade and it had been very helpful to flag the marshals so obviously now they dressed like regular plainclothes schmucks but sonny had enough experience that he didnt need red hats to spot the enemy now sonny could look in a mans eyes and know that he made fires his living either starting them or putting them out sonny no longer quite so happy feeling shakier and sweatier glanced at the big camera in the cowboys hand a cable ran to a battery pack in a canvas bag it wasnt one of those cheap videocams this was the real thing who exactly are you joe buck what exactly are you doing here sonny began to sweat harder which didnt bother him though hed been sweating an awful lot lately and his hands began to shake which did bother him because that was a very bad thing in someone who assembled incendiary devices for a living watching tall thin joe buck take some more footage of the burntout tenement sonny decided he hated the cowboy more for his height than because he was shooting so fucking much tape of a building hed just burned down still in some part of his heart he hoped the tapes were good he was proud of this little fire after hed started the blaze and slipped back out through the basement door hed hidden in the construction site across the street and turned on his radio shack scanner he heard the dispatcher put out a secondalarm assignment it had been a code call he was pleased about the alarm which meant a serious fire but disappointed about the code which meant that thered been only injuries not fatalities code meant death the cowboy continued to shoot for a few minutes then he shut the big camera off and slipped it back into his bag sonny glanced again at the fire marshal and his cronies my gosh thats one huge faggot assistant lomax told the big boy to order a backhoe and start the vertical excavation as soon as possible silently sonny told them that this was the correct procedure for investigating a fire like this but sonny was getting more and more worried pretty soon he was all worry the way a corridor fills with smoke one minute its clear the next its dense as cotton the reason however wasnt lomax or his huge assistant it was the cowboy i hate that man hate him hate him hate him hatehimhatehim sonny tossed his long blond ponytail off his shoulder wiped a sweating forehead with shaking hands and eased through the crowd closer to joe buck his breathing was labored and his heart slammed in his chest he sucked smokeladen air into his lungs and exhaled very slowly enjoying the taste the smell beneath his hands the yellow tape trembled stop that stop that stop that stopthatstopthat he glanced up at pellam not quite a foot taller maybe a lot less than that ten inches if sonny stood up straight or nine suddenly a new spectator eased between them and sonny was jostled aside the intruder was a young woman in a rich deepgreen doublebreasted suit a businesswoman she said terrible just awful did you see it happen the cowboy asked she nodded i was coming home from work i was on an audit you a reporter im doing a film about some of the tenants in the building a film cool a documentary im alice pellam pellam sonny thought pellam pellam he pictured the name and spoke it over and over and over in his mind until like the top of a column of smoke it was there but was no longer visible at first she continued looking at the cowboys at pellams lean face it was like there was nothing wrong then all of a sudden there were flames everywhere i mean totally everywhere she carried a heavy briefcase stamped ernst young in gold and with her free hand twined her short red hair nervously about her index finger sonny glanced at her laminated business card hanging from the handle pellam asked where exactly did it start she nodded well i saw the flames break through the window there pointed to the basement she didnt seem at all like an alice to him she looked like that somber little thing on the xfiles whom sonny in a private joke called agent scullery like pellam scullery was taller than sonny he disliked tall men but he venomously hated women taller than he was and when she happened to glance down at him the way shed glance at a squirrel his hatred turned from anger to something very calm and very hot i was the one that called the fire department from that box on the corner those boxes you know you see but you never think about he also hated short hair because it didnt take very long to burn away he wiped his hands on his white slacks and listened carefully agent scullery rambled on about fire trucks and ambulances and burn victims and smoke victims and jump victims and mud there was mud all over the place you dont think about mud at fires some of us do sonny thought go on agent scullery told joe buck the faggot cowboy about glowingred bolts and melting glass and a man shed seen pulling burnt pieces of chicken from the embers and eating them while people screamed for help it was she paused thinking of a concise word excruciating sonny had worked for a number of business people and he knew how they lived to summarize did you see anyone near the building when it started in the back i did there were some people there in the alley who i didnt pay much attention you have any idea the cowboy persisted sonny listened intently but agent scullery couldnt recall very much a man a couple of men thats all i know im sorry young teenagers not so young i dont know sorry pellam thanked her she lingered maybe waiting to see if hed ask her out but he just smiled a noncommittal smile stepped into the street flagged down a cab sonny hurried after him but the cowboy was already inside and the yellow chevy was speeding away before sonny even got to the curbside he didnt hear the destination he was momentarily enraged that pellam the tall midnight cowboy had gotten away from him so easily but then he reflected that that was all right this wasnt really about eliminating witnesses or punishing intruders it was about something much much bigger he held up his hands and noticed that theyd stopped shaking a tatter of smoke dissolving ghost wafted before sonnys face and helpless he could only close his eyes and inhale the sweet perfume remaining this way for a long moment motionless and blind he came back to earth slowly and dug into his shoulder bag he found out that he only had a pint or so of juice left but that was plenty he decided more than enough sometimes you only needed a spoonful depending on how much time you had and how clever you were at the moment sonny had all the time in the world and as always he knew he was clever as a fox four windy this morning an august storm was approaching and the first thing pellam noticed when he woke hearing the wind was that he wasnt swaying itd been over three months since hed parked the winnebego chieftain at westchester auto storage in white plains and temporarily forsaken his nomadic lifestyle three months but he still sometimes had trouble sleeping in a bed that wasnt atop steel springs badly in need of replacement with this much wind today he ought to be swaying like a passenger in a gale he also hadnt gotten used to paying fifteen hundred a month for a onebedroom east village shotgun flat whose main attraction was a bathtub in the kitchen its called a bitchen the real estate woman told him taking his check for the brokers fee and first months rent as if hed owed her the money for months peoplere totally dying for them nowadays fourthfloor walkup the linoleum floor a dirty beige and walls green as ettie washingtons hospital room and what hed been wondering was that smell in his years doing location work pellam had scouted in manhattan only a few times the local companies largely had the business locked up and besides because of the high cost of shooting here the manhattan you saw in most movies was usually toronto cleveland or a set the films actually shot in the city had little appeal to him weird little jim jarmusch studentquality independents and dull mainstreams ext plaza hotel day ext wall street night the scouting assignments had less to do with being the directors third eye than filling out the proper forms in the mayors film office and making sure cash went where it was supposed to go both above and below the table but scouting was behind him for the immediate future he was a month away from finishing the rough cut of his first film in years and the first documentary hed ever made west of eighth was the title he showered and brushed his unruly black hair into place thinking about the project the schedule allowed him only another week of taping then three weeks of editing and postpro september was the deadline for mixing and delivery to wgbh in boston where hed work with the producer on the final cut pbs airing was planned for early next spring simultaneously hed have the tape transferred to film reedited and shipped for limited release in art theaters in the us and on channel in england next summer then submissions to festivals in cannes venice toronto and berlin and to the oscars of course that had been the plan but now the motif of west of eighth had been the tenement at west thirtysixth street and the residents who lived there but ettie washington was the centerpiece with her arrest he wondered if he was now the proud owner of two hundred hours of fascinating interviews that would never find their way to tv or silver screen outside he bought a newspaper then flagged down a cab the clattering vehicle wove right and left through traffic as if the cabbie were avoiding hot pursuit and pellam tightly gripped the handhold as he tried to read about the fire the story was dwindling in news value and todays paper reported only that ettied been arrested and confirmed what hed known that the only serious injury was juan torres pellam remembered the boy clearly hed interviewed his mother and recalled the energetic twelveyearold standing in his apartment by the window lefthooking a package of huggies like a punching bag and saying to pellam insistently my daddy he know jose canseco no no no really he does the boys condition was still critical a picture of ettie being led by a woman cop out of manhattan hospital accompanied the article her hair was a mess light flares sparked off the chrome cuffs on her wrists just below the cast that pellam had signed etta washington formerly doyle neé wilkes was seventytwo years old born in hells kitchen shed never lived anywhere else the w thirtysixth street building had been her home for the past five years shed resided for the prior forty in a similar tenement up the street now demolished all her other residences had been in the kitchen within five square blocks of one another ettie had ventured out of new york state only three times for brief trips two of them funerals of kin in north carolina ettie had been a star student in her first two years of high school but dropped out to work and try to become a cabaret singer shes performed for some years always opening for betterknown talent mostly in harlem or the bronx though occasionally shed land a job on swing street fiftysecond pellam had heard some old wire recordings transcribed onto tape and was impressed with her low voice for years shed worked odd jobs supporting herself and sometimes lovers while resisting the inevitable proposals of marriage that a beautiful woman living alone in hells kitchen was flooded with she finally married late and incongruously her husband was an irishman named billy doyle a handsome restless man doyle left her years ago after only three years of marriage he was just doing what a man does my billy they got that runaway spirit may be their nature but its hard to forgive em for it wonder if youve got it too john sitting beside the camera as hed recorded this pellam had nodded encouragingly and reminded himself to edit out her last sentence and her accompanying chuckle her second husband was harold washington who drowned drunk in the hudson river no love lost there but he was dependable with the money and never cheated and never raised his voice to me sometimes i miss him if i remember to think about him etties youngest son frank had been caught in a cross fire and killed by a man wearing a purple top hat in a drunken shootout in times square her daughter elizabeth of whom ettie was immensely proud was a real estate saleswoman in miami in a year or two ettie would be moving to florida to live near her her oldest son james a handsome mulatto was the only child she had by doyle he too caught the wanderlust flu and disappeared out west california ettie assumed she hadnt heard from him in twelve years the elderly woman had been in her youth sultry and beautiful if somewhat imperious as evidenced by a hundred photos all presently burned to gray ash and was now handsome woman with youthful dark skin she debated often about dying her saltandpepper hair back to its original black ettie talked like a quick midatlantic southerner drank bad wine and cooked delicious tripe with bacon and onions and she could unreel stories about her own past and about her mother and grandmother like a natural actress as if god gave her that gift to make up for others denied and what would happen to her now with a jolt the cab burst across eighth avenue the maginot line bordering hells kitchen pellam glanced out the window as they passed storefront in whose window the word bakery was painted over replaced by youth outreach center clinton branch clinton this was a raw spot with longtime residents the neighborhood to them was hells kitchen and would never be anything but clinton was what the city officials and public relations and real estate people called the hood as if a name change could convince the public this part of town wasnt a morass of tenements and gangs and smokey bodegas and hookers and pebbles of crack vials littering sidewalks but was the new frontier for corporate headquarters and yuppie lofts remembering etties voice you hear the story how this place got its name the one they tell is a policeman down here a long time ago he says to another cop this place is hell and the other one goes hells mild compared to here thiss hells kitchen thats the story but thats not how it happened no sir where the name came from was its called after this place in london what else in new york even the name of the neighborhoods stolen from someplace else look i am saying the cabbie broke into pellams thoughts same fucking thing fucking yesterday and for weeks he was gesturing furiously at a traffic jam ahead of them it seemed to be caused by the construction work going on across from the site of the fire that highrise nearing completion cement trucks pulled in and out through a chainlink gate holding up traffic that building i am wanting them to go fuck themselves it has ruins fucking neighborhood all of it he slapped the dashboard hard nearly knocking over his royal orb air freshener pellam paid and climbed out of the cab leaving the driver to his muttered curses he walked toward the hudson river he passed dark woody storefronts vinnies fruits and vegetables managros deli cuzins meats and provisions whose front window was filled with whole dressed animals booths of clothing and wooden stands filled with piles of spices and herbs packed the sidewalks a store selling african goods advertised a sale on ukpor and ogbono buy now it urged pellam passed ninth avenue and continued on to tenth he passed the shell of etties building floating in a surreal grove of faint smoke and continued on toward a scabby sixstory redbrick building on the corner he paused in front of the handwritten sign in the grimy window of a ground floor apartment louis bailey esq attorney at lawabogado criminal civil wills divorces personal injuries motorcycle accidents real estate notary public copies made send your fax two window panes were missing yellow newspaper had replaced one the other was blocked by a faded box of post toasties pellam stared at the decrepit building then checked to make sure he had the name right he did send your fax he pushed inside there was no waiting room just a single large room of an apartment converted into an office the place was jampacked with papers briefs books some bulky antiquated office equipment a dusty feeble computer and a fax machine a hundred law books some of which were still sealed in their original yellowing cellophane wrappers a sign proclaimed notary public the lawyer stood at his copier feeding pages of legal documents through the wobbly machine hot sun came through the filthy windows the room must have been a hundred degrees you bailey his sweaty face turned nodded im john pellam etties friend the writer filmmaker they shook hands the portly man touched his coif of long gray hair which was thinning reluctantly he wore a white shirt and wide emeraldcolored tie his gray suit was one size off in both directions the pants too big the jacket too small id like to talk to you about her case pellam said its too hot in here bailey stacked the copied papers on the desk and wiped his forehead the acs misbehaving how about we retire to my other office ive got a branch up the street another branch pellam thought and said lead the way louis bailey waved toward the doughy woman bartender he said nothing to her but she waddled off to fix what must have been the lawyers usual in a brogue she called to pellam whatcha want coffee irish folgers he replied i meant with whisky i meant without bailey continued so the scans came back negative the mri or whatever shell be fine theyve moved her to womens detention center i tried to visit her yesterday they wouldnt let me lomax that fire marshal wasnt much help they usually arent if youre on our side of the fence pellam said i finally found a cop who told me shed hired you with an awkward squeak the door opened and two darksuited young men entered looked around with dismay and left baileys uptown office the abysmal emerald isle pub was not the sort of place for a business brunch can i see her pellam asked now that shes in detention we can work that out sure ive talked to the ada the assistant district attorney the prosecutor lois koepels her name shes not bad not good shes got an attitude jewish thing i think or womans thing or a young thing i dont know which is worse i threatened her with an order to show cause they dont take better care of ettie make sure she gets pain pills change her bandages but they couldnt care less of course guess not over pellams sour coffee and baileys martini the lawyer gave his assessment of the case pellam was trying to gauge the mans competence from the mans mouth came no statutes case citations or court rules pellam reached a vague conclusion that hed have preferred someone more outraged and if not smarter t least chronologically closer to law school bailey sipped the drink and said whats this film of yours about an oral history on hells kitchen etties my best source the woman can tell her stories thats for sure pellam folded his hands around the hot mug the bar was freezing a bitter wind shot from a sputtering air conditioner above the door whyd they arrest her lomax wouldnt tell me anything yeah well i gotta tell you theyve found some stuff stuff and its not good a witness saw her entering the basement just before the fire it started down there next to the boiler shes got a key to the back door dont all the tenants some do but she was the one seen opening the door five minutes before the fire started i met somebody at the building yesterday pellam said she told me she saw some people in the alley just before the fire three or four men she couldnt describe them any better than that bailey nodded and jotted a few sentences in a battered leather notebook embossed with initials not his own she couldnt have done it pellam said i was there she was on the stairs above me when it started oh they dont think she actually started the fire they think she opened the basement door and let a pyro in a professional arsonist a pro yeah but a psycho too a guys been working in the city for a few years the mos that he mixes gas with fuel oil just the right proportion he knows what hes doing see gas alones too unstable so he adds oil the fire takes a little longer to get going but it burns hotter then get this he also adds dish detergent to the mix so the stuff sticks to clothes and skin like napalm burningforbucks guys i mean pure forhire stuff they wouldnt do that and they dont set fires when therere people around they dont want anybody to get hurt this guy likes it the fire marshals and the copsre worried hes getting crazier theres pressure on em from above to get him so lomax thinks she hired him pellam mused what about the fact that she was almost killed too the adas speculating she tried to get to her apartment so shed have an alibi there was a fire escape outside her window only the timing got screwed up they also think she planned it when you were coming over so you could confirm she was there pellam scoffed she wouldnt hurt me but you were early werent you pellam finally said a few minutes yeah then but everybodys missing one thing whats her motive supposed to be ah yes the motive as hed done several times before bailey paused and organized his thoughts he drained his martini and ordered another full jigger this time rosie ogrady dont let those massive olives lure you into cheating last week ettie bought a tenants insurance policy for twentyfive thousand dollars pellam sipped from the cup then pushed it away from him the vile taste in his mouth was only partly the coffee keep going its a declaredvalue policy ever hear of that it means she pays a high premium but if the apartment is destroyed the insurer pays off whether shes got chippendale furniture or orange crates inside pretty damn obvious buying a policy then burning the building the next month ah but the police love obvious crimes mr pellam so do juries new yorkers dont do well with subtleties thats why clever bad guys get away with murder the martini arrived and bailey hovered over the glass like a child eyeing a present on christmas morning on top of that women are prime suspects in insurance fraud and welfare scams see if youre a welfare mom and your place burns down you get moved to the top of the list for a nicer place happens everyday the fire marshal saw a woman an insurance policy and a suspicious fire bingo his jobs done somebodys setting her up hell if it was insurance why burn the whole building why not just her own apartment less suspicious anyway this pyro goes for the most damage he can she just happened to hire him probably didnt even know what he was going to do pellam a former independent filmmaker and script writer often thought of life as a series of storylines there seemed to be some holes in this one okay they mustve sent the insurance policy to her what did ettie say when she saw it the agency claims she picked up the application filled it out mailed it back they forwarded it to the home office her approved copy of the policyd just been mailed from the headquarters the day before the fire so she never received it then the agent or clerk could testify that it wasnt ettie pellam pointed out the clerk identified her picture as the woman who picked up the application pellam long suspicious of conspiracy theories felt a plot worthy of an oliver stone movie at work what about the premium check paid in cash and ettie says pellam asked she denies it all of course bailey said dismissingly as if a denial were as foremsically useful as the fly walking on the bar beside them now lets talk practicalities the arraignment is scheduled for tomorrow the adas making rumblings about a postponement you know what the arraignment is thats where i know what it is pellam said whats the bail situation i dont think itll be too high ill talk to some bailbondsmen i know shes a good risk not being very mobile and its not a homicide mr bailey pellam began the lawyer held up a hand louis please louie bailey growled the name and for a moment he became the damon runyon character he aspired to be youve done this before pellam asked cases like this ah bailey leaned his head back touched a flabby jowl and caught pellams gaze with eyes suddenly clear and focused ive seen you studying me my bargaincellar tie my frayed cuffs my mens shack suit notice the plaids a bit mismatched i wore out the original pants a year ago and got the closest i could find and youve been gentlemanly enough not to mention my liquid brunch he pointed to his right hand an otherwise dramatic gesture he managed to underplay thiss a class ring from new york law school thats not nyu by the way big difference and i went at night while i served process during the day and graduated somewhere to the left of the middle of my class im sure youre a fine lawyer oh of course im not bailey snorted a laugh but so what this isnt an upper east side case its not a soho or westchester case for those you need a good lawyer this is a hells kitchen case etties poor shes black the facts are against her and the juryllve found her guilty before theyre even empaneled the laws irrelevant what is relevant the gears he whispered the theatricality filling his voice like sump water pellam didnt feel like playing straight man he remained silent a car drove past slowly a bmw convertible even inside the bar you could hear the raw bass beat of a popular rap song pellam had heard several times before on neighborhood radios its a white mans world now dont be blind the car cruised on the gears bailey continued teasing his olive heres what i mean the first thing you learn about the kitchen is that anybody can kill you for any reason or for no reason thats a given so what can you do to stay alive well you can make it an inconvenience to kill you you stay away from alleys when you walk down the street you dont make eye contact you dress down you stay close to people on street corners you drop the names of union bosses or cops from midtown south in bars like this one you see what im saying you gum up the gears if its too much trouble to kill you maybe just maybe theyll go on to someone else and ettie everybody the ada the cops the press they take the path of least resistance if something clogs up the gears of the case theyll go fishing for somebody else find themselves another jimdandy suspect thats the only thing we can do for ettie gumming gears then lets give them another suspect who elsed have a motive the owner right for the insurance possibly ill check the deed and find out what the owners insurance situation is why else would somebody burn a building kids do it for kicks thats number one in the city number two revenge so and so is sleeping with somebodys wife squirt a little lighter fluid under his door presto lot of perps set fires to cover up other crimes rape murders especially burglary welfare fraud like i said vanity fires the mailroom boy sets a fire in the office and then puts it out himself hes a hero then in the kitchen we see a lot of landmark torchings the city gives old buildings this special status cause theyre historical generally if a landlord owns an old building that doesnt make money because its too expensive to maintain he tears it down and builds a more profitable one but landmarked buildings cant be torn down theyre protected so what happens lord have mercy theres a fire what a coincidence hes free to build whatever he wants if he doesnt get caught was etties building landmarked i dont know i can find out the way bailey emphasized the last sentence explained a little bit more about how gears got gummed up pellam slipped his wallet out of his back pocket set it on the bar the lawyers face broke into a ginny smile oh yessir thats how it works in hells kitchen everybodys a sellout maybe even me the smile faded or maybe i just have a high price thats ethics around here when it takes a lot to buy you a police car shot past the window with its lights going but its siren off for some reason the silent passage made its mission seem particularly harrowing and urgent then bailey grew very somber so suddenly that pellam guessed the second or was it third beefeater had kicked in with a stab of melancholy he touched pellams arm in a fatherly way and you could see reluctant shrewdness through the haze in his eyes theres something i want to say pellam nodded youre sure you want to get involved in this wait before you answer let me ask you something youve talked to a lot of people around here for your movie ettie mostly but also a couple dozen others bailey nodded examining pellams face up close scanning it well people in the kitchenre easy to approach theyll pass you a quart of malt liquor and never wipe the bottle when you hand it back theyll sit on doorsteps with you for hours sometimes you cant shut em up thats what ive found true that puts you right at ease right does yep but its just talk bailey said it doesnt mean they accept you or trust you and dont ever think youll hear anybodys real secrets they wont tell em to somebody like you and what are you telling me pellam asked the lawyers shrewdness became caution there was a pause im telling you its dangerous here very dangerous and getting more dangerous thereve been a lot of fires lately more than normal gangs shootings the times metro section was full of shooting stories kids smuggling guns into grade school innocent people were gunned down in cross fires or by crazed snipers pellam had stopped reading the papers his second week in town this is a rough time in the kitchen as opposed to when pellam wondered bailey asked him are you really sure you want to get involved as pellam started to speak the lawyer held up a hand are you sure you want to go where this might take you pellam answered the question with one of his own how much he tapped his wallet bailey dipped again back into his alcohol haze for everything shrugged ill have to find a cop to sneak me the arson report the name of the insurance agent anything else they have on her the landlord and deedre public records but it takes weeks if you dont you know grease the gears pellam muttered id say a thousand pellam wondered what the real object of the bargaining was abstract morality or his own gullibility five hundred bailey hesitated i dont know if i can do it for that shes innocent louis pellam said that means we have god on our side doesnt that buy us a discount in hells kitchen bailey roared with laughter this is the neighborhood that god forgot give me six and ill do the best i can five he had the map spread out on the beautiful butcherblock table smoothing the paper under his long thin fingers sonny took pleasure in paper knew it was the reincarnated skin of trees he liked the sound of paper when it moved he liked the feel he knew that it burned best of anything sonny looked up and surveyed the cavernous loft back to the map it was of manhattan and he traced his finger along the colored lines of streets to find the building in which he now sat with an expensive ballpoint pen he marked an x on that spot he sipped ginger ale from a wine glass he heard a shuffle and a sound like a cat mewing he glanced to his right at the witness whod been flirting with joe buck poor redheaded agent scullery from ernst young must have been paid a shitload of money at work because this was a very nice loft indeed he looked her up and down deciding again that she would look a lot better if she had long hair like his she lay on her side feet and hands bound with duct tape she was gagged too matteroffactly he said to her your show on tv i dont really believe the fbi does all that stuff do you think federal agents give a shit if there are really aliens up there he spoke in a soothing voice though absently he touched the colorful squares of the map they reminded him of blocks his motherd bought him as a child here he marked another building here another he touched several others and marked them with xs itd be a lot of work but one thing that sonny didnt mind was work virtue is its own reward agent scullery peeked over the gray metallic tape and drummed a loud panicked dance with her feet dear dear dear folding the map carefully he replaced it in his back pocket the pen went in his breast pocket diligently retracted he hated ink on his clothing then he walked in a circle around agent scullery who kicked and rolled and mewed in the kitchen he examined the gas oven and stove it was a topoftheline model but sonny knew about appliances only from his profession he used his own stove just to heat water for herbal tea he ate only vegetables and never cooked them he found the whole idea of heating food abhorrent he dropped to the immaculate tile floor and pulled open the stove he had the bimetal gas cutoff valve disabled in five seconds and the gooseneck hose off in ten the sour scent of the natural gas odorant the gas itself has no scent poured into the room sweet and bitter and curiously appealing like tonic water he walked to the front door of the loft and flicked the light switch on then off to see which bulb went on an overhead one not far away sonny climbed onto a chair reaching up stretching cracking the bulb with his wrench and sending the sleet of glass down on his hair and shoulders the ceilings were high and it was quite a stretch as hed struggled to reach the bulb he was sure that tall agent scullery was laughing at him but laughters in the eye of the beholder sonny thought glaring at her as he returned to his bag took out the jar of juice and poured it over her blouse and skirt she writhed away from him he asked whos laughing now hmm sonny walked throughout the loft shutting off the lights and closing all the drapes he walked to the front door and stepped into the corridor leaving the door slightly ajar in the lobby he jotted down the names of six of the residents in the building a half hour later he was standing in a phone kiosk a block away halfeaten mango in one hand the phone crooked under his chin punching in phone numbers on his fifth try someone answered hello say is this the roberts residence its sally roberts yes oh hi you dont know me im alice gibsons brother in your building alice sure fourd thats right shed mentioned you live there and i just got your number from directory assistance you know im a little concerned about her really the womans voice was concerned too we were talking on the phone a little while ago and she said she was feeling real sick food poisoning she was thinking she hung up and i tried to call back and there was no answer i hate to ask but do you think you could go check on her im worried that she passed out of course you want to give me your number ill just hold on if you dont mind said sonny the polite sibling youre too kind he leaned his head against the aluminum of the kiosk it left sweat stains why all this sweat he thought again but its hot out everybodys sweating not everybodys hands are shaking though he pushed that thought away think about something else how bout dinner okay what would he have for dinner tonight he wondered a ripe tomato a good jersey one they were hard to find salt and a little this was weird the sound of the massive explosion reached him through the phone before he heard it live then the line went dead as the kiosk shook hard under the wave of the blast typical of natural gas explosions there was a bluewhite flare and very little smoke as the windows imploded from the inrush of oxygen then immediately exploded outward from the force of the combustion fire draws more than it expands sonny watched for a moment as the flames spread to the top floor of the late agent scullerys apartment the tarred roof ignited and the smoke turned from white to gray to black he wiped his hands on a napkin then he opened the map and carefully drew check through the circle that had marked the loft he pitched the mango out and started back to his apartment walking quickly in the opposite direction from all the spectators noting their excitement and wishing they knew they had him to thank how you feeling mother how she feeling a voice called across the cold cement floor how she doing ettie washington lay on the cot legs tucked up under her she opened her eyes her first thought the memory that her clothes had been a problem always concerned that she looked nice always ironing her dresses and blouses and skirts but here in the womens detention center in downtown manhattan where they let you wear street clothes minus belts and laces of course ettie washington had had no clothes when theyd brought her from the hospital all she had on was her pale blue robe with dots on it open up the back no buttons just ties she was dreadfully embarrassed finally one of the guards had found her a simple dress a prison shift blue washed a million times she hated it hey mother you hear me you feeling okay a large black form hovered over her a hand stroked her forehead she feel hot mebbe got a fever god gonna watch over that woman came another voice from the far side of the detention center she be okay you be okay mother the large woman in her forties shrank down on her knees next to ettie who squinted until she could see the woman clearly hows yo arm it hurts ettie responded i broke it that quite a cast the brown eyes took in john pellams signature whats your name ettie asked her struggling to sit up no no mother you stay lying down im hatake imaham mother im ettie washington we know ettie tried again to sit she felt helpless weaker than she already was on her back no no no mother you stay there dont get up they brung you in like a sacka flour them white fuckers dropped you down there were two dozen cots bolted to the floor the mattresses were an inch thick and hard as dirt she might as well have been lying on the floor ettie had a vague memory of the cops moving her here from the hospital room shed been exhausted and doped up they used a paddy wagon there was nothing to hold onto and it seemed to her that the driver had taken turns fast on purpose twice shed fallen off the slick plastic bench and often she banged her broken arm so badly it brought tears to her eyes im tired she said to hatake and looked past the huge woman to the other occupants of the cell the detention center was a single large room barred and painted beige like many hells kitchen residents ettie washington knew something about holding cells she knew that most of these women would be in here for pissy crimes whocares crimes shoplifting prostitution assault fraud shoplifting was okay because it helped you feed your family if you were a prostitute ettie hated the term ho it was because you couldnt get a job doing decent work for decent pay besides at least you were working and not on the dole assault well whaling on your husbands girlfriend whats wrong with that ettied done it herself once or twice and as for ripping off the welfare system oh please trees ripe for the picking ettie had a taste for some wine wanted some badly shed snuck a hundred dollars into her cast but it didnt look like anybody here was connected enough to get her a bottle why thesere just girls here most of em babies hatake imaham stroked etties head once more you lie right there mother you be still and dont you worry bout nothing ima look out for you ima get you what you need hatake was a huge woman with cornrows and dangling beaded african hair exactly the way elizabeth had worn it the day she left new york city ettie noticed that the holes in hatakes ear lobes were huge and she wondered about the size of the earrings that had stretched the skin so much she wondered if elizabeth wore jewelry like that probably the girl had an ostentatious side to her ive gotta make a phone call ettie said they let you but not now the woman touched her good arm squeezed it gently some son of a bitch took away my pills ettie complained one of the guards i need em back hatake laughed honey them pills they aint even in this building no more they sold an gone mebbe we see what we can find us girls something help you bet it hurts like the devils own dick ettie almost said that she had some money and could pay but she knew instinctively to keep the money secret for the time being she said thank you you lie back get some rest we look out for you ettie closed her eyes and thought of elizabeth then she thought of her husband billy doyle and she thought of finally john pellam but he was in her thoughts for no more than five seconds before she fell asleep well hatake imaham returned to the cluster of women on the far end of the cell that bitch she the one done it she guilty as death hatake didnt claim to be a real mambo but it was well known in the kitchen that she did possess an extra sense and while she hadnt had much success laying on hands to cure illness everyone knew that she could touch someone and find out their deepest secrets she could tell that the hot vibrations radiating off ettie washingtons brow were feelings of guilt shit one woman spat out she burn that boy up she burn up that little boy the boy another asked in an incredulous whisper she set that fire in the basement girl didnt you read that on thirtysixth street she coulda killed the whole everybody in that building that bitch call herself a mother a skinny woman with deepset eyes growled fuck that bitch i say shhhh hatake waved a hand do her now do the bitch now hatakes face tightened into a glare quiet damballah we gonna do this thway i say you hear me girl i aint kill her damballah dont ask more than what she done okay sister the girl said her voice hushed and frightened okay thats cool whatcha saying we do shhhhh hatake hissed again and glanced out the bars where a lethargic guard lounged out of earshot who gonna see the man today a couple of the girls lifted their arms the prostitutes criminal term batched those arraignments and disposed of them early hatake knew it was like the city wanted them back on the street with a minimum of lost time hatake looked at the oldest one you dannette right the woman nodded her pocked face remained peaceful ima ask you do something for me how bout that girl whatchu want me to do you talk to yo man when you get

whispered hatake imaham a guard was wandering past the door six hell of a visiting room oh john am i in the soup pellam told ettie not exactly but youre walking around the edge of the bowl looks like its good to see you they sat across from each other in the fluorescentlit room a roach meandered slowly up the wall past the corpses of his kin crushed to dry specks beneath a sign that read no physical contact john pellam took the bandaged hand of ettie washington the squat uniformed matron nearby looked coldly at this disregard of regulations but didnt say anything pellam said louis baileys going to get you out on bail ettie looked bad she seemed too calm considering everything that had happened to her he knew she had a temper hed seen it when she talked about her husband billy doyles leaving her and about the time she was fired from her last job after years working for a jobber in the fashion district shed been let go without a single days severance he expected to see her fury at whoever had set the blaze at the police at the jailors he found only resignation that was a lot more troubling to him than anger she picked at a worn spot on her shift the guardsre all saying itll go easier if i tell em i did it and tell em who i hired i dont know what theyre talking about pellam debated for a moment then decided to ask tell me about the insurance policy hell i didnt buy any insurance john they think im a stupid old lady doing something like that she pressed the palm of her good hand against her stiff grayandblack hair as if fighting off a migraine where im gonna get money to buy insurance she winced in pain continued i can barely pay my bills as is i cant even do that half the time wherem i gonna get money to buy insurance youve never been in any insurance agencies in the last month no i swear her face was drawn up as she eyed the guard suspiciously ettie ive got to ask you these questions somebody recognized you taking out the policy thats their problem she said tightlipped it wasnt me somebody else saw you at the back door of the building that night just before the fire i go in the back door usually a lot of times i do that if ive been to the a p its a shortcut saves me some steps do all the tenants have keys to the back i dont know i suppose so you locked it behind you it locks by itself i think i heard it close ettie was often digressive one thought brought up ten others one question could lead via a colorful stream of consciousness to a different time and place pellam noted that today though her responses were succinct cautious the guard had tolerated pellams hand upon etties arm long enough no contact she snapped pellam sat back the guards nose was pierced three times with gold studs and each ear sprouted ten or twelve small rings her belligerence suggested that she was waiting for someone to ridicule the jewelry louis bailey pellam asked ettie you think hes a good lawyer oh hes good hes done stuff for me before i hired him six eight months ago for this social security problem i had he did an okay job that guard over there keeps looking at us with an evil eye john shes too jaunty for my taste sticking pins in her nose pellam laughed this witness told me she saw some men in the alley just before the fire did you see them when you got home from the store sure who was it nobody i recognized some boys from the neighborhood theyre always there you know its an alley where kids always hang out did fifty years ago do now some things never change pellam remembered what sibbies son had told her what earned him the slap in the face he asked ettie were they from the gangs could be i dont know much about them they leave us alone pretty much and maybe there were some of those workers too from that big building theyre putting up across the street you know with those telescopes they have for surveying yeah im sure i saw some of them in the alley i remember cause they wear those plastic helmets some of them were those men who came around with the petition we signed pellam remembered ettie telling him about the highrise how the locals had greeted the huge project with such excitement roger mckennah as famous as donald trump was building a glitzy skyscraper in hells kitchen his company had sent representatives out into the hood asking residents in the blocks around the highrise to sign waivers so that the building could go five stories higher than the zoning laws allowed in exchange for their approval of the variance he pledged that the building would feature new grocery stores and a spanish restaurant and a twentyfourhour laundry ettie had signed along with most of the other residents and then theyd found that the grocery store was part of a gourmet chain that charged for a can of black beans the laundry charged three dollars to wash a blouse and as for the restaurant it had a dress code and the limos parked out in front created a terrible traffic jam pellam now made a mental note about the workers wondered why they were surveying in the alley across the street he wondered too why theyd been working at ten oclock at night i think we should call your daughter pellam said i already did ettie said and looked at her cast in surprise as if it had just materialized on her arm i had a long talk with her this morning shes sending money to louis for his bill she wanted to come tomorrow but i was thinking ill need her more round the trial im voting that there wont even be a trial the bejeweled guard examined her watch okay come on washington i just got here pellam said coolly an now you just be leavin a few minutes he said times up move it and you washington hustle pellam lowered his eyes to the guards shes got a sprained ankle you want to tell me how the hells she supposed to hustle dont want lip from you mister less go the door swung open revealing the dim hallway in which a sign was partially visible prisoners shall no ettie pellam said grinning you owe me something dont forget whats that the end of the story about billy doyle pellam watched the woman tuck away her despair beneath a smile youll like that story john thatll be a good one in your film to the matron she said im coming im coming give an old lady a break seven inside baileys office a gaunt man hunched over the desk listening to instructions the lawyer was firing at him over a paper cup filled with jug chablis bailey saw pellam enter and nodded him over this is cleg the thin man shook pellams hand as if they were good friends cleg wore a green polyester jacket and black slacks a steel penny gleamed in his left loafer and he smelled of brylcreem the lawyer was looking through an impacted rolodex let me see cleg said to pellam you play the horses it wasnt a question no pellam admitted the slim man was dismayed well i got a lock for you you interested whats a lock bet cleg responded a bet that you cant lose thanks anyway he stared at pellam for a moment then nodded as if he suddenly understood everything there was to know about him he searched his pockets until he found a pack of cigarettes here we go bailey said he jotted a name on a yellow postit that had been reused several times he took two bottles of liquor from his desk slipped them into large interoffice envelopes along with smaller packages that contained presumably pellams former cash he handed cleg one envelope thiss for the recorder of deeds the clerk hes the fat man on the third floor sneely then this one goes to landmark preservation pretty ms grunwald with the cat a receptionist she gets the irish cream as you probably guessed greasing gears or maybe clogging them the man nestled the bottles among his sporting papers and left the office pellam saw him pause outside to light a cigarette then continue toward the subway bailey said the ada ms koepel asked for a postponement of etties arraignment i agreed pellam shook his head but shell have to stay in jail longer true but i think its worth it to keep the bitch happy his head dropped toward the chipped mug he held koepels a madwoman but then theres a lot of pressure to catch the firebug thingsre getting worse did you hear hear what pellam asked there was another fire this morning another one a loft it wasnt too far from here matter of fact destroyed two floors three dead looked like it was a gas explosion but they found traces of our boys special brew gas fuel oil and soap and one of the victims was bound and gagged bailey shoved a limp post toward pellam he glanced at the picture of a burntout building jesus pellam had scouted for a lot of action adventure films most of the spectacular explosions on screen supposedly c or tnt or dynamite were actually containers of gasolinesoaked sawdust carefully assembled by the arms master on the set everybody kept far back when he rigged the charges and stuntmen who thought nothing about freefall gags from twenty stories up were damn cautious around fire bailey looked over his notes now whatve i found whatve i found goddamn air conditioner jiggle that switch its the compressor jiggle it did it go on pellam jiggled no response from the dusty old unit bailey grumbled something inaudible over the throbbing motor he pulled a fax off his desk the prelim arson report about etties building getting it cost most of your money i made a copy for you read it and weep privileged and confidential memorandum from supervising fire marshal henry lomax to lois koepel esq assistant district attorney re preliminary findings fire of suspicious origin w threesix street at pm on august tenth a call was received from box on tenth avenue regarding a fire at the w threesix street a was received at pm regarding same ladder company three eight responded to the first alarm assignment and the captain at the scene concluded that because of the gravity of the fire and the presence of injuries a second alarm assignment was needed this assignment went out at pm present at the blaze were two six truck three three truck four eight engine one six engine and one seven ladder lines were run immediately and water was laid down on the three top floors access to the premises was gained by entry through the third floor and the building was successfully evacuated the captain on the scene concluded that the flames had so weakened the top floors that access through the bulkhead on the roof was inadvisable and pulled the firefighters back shortly thereafter the roof and top two floors collapsed the fire was finally knocked down at pm and all units took up at am the captain requested a fire marshal because certain observations about the fire suggested it was of suspicious origins i arrived at am and began my investigation i concluded that the point of origin was the basement of the building spalling on the brick and melted aluminum confirmed this i observed that the basement windows had been broken outward not due to heat fracturing but due to being struck with an object of some sort possibly to provide better oxygen supply to feed the fire this is consistent with witnesses observations that the flames did not have a bluish tint which would indicate a high level of carbon monoxide and might be expected with a fire in a closed space but orange indicating a plentiful oxygen source i observed fragments of melted and shattered glass consistent with a large possibly halfgallon or gallon bottle at the apparent site of origin and burn marks on the floor indicating that a liquid accelerant might have been used subsequent spectrographic analysis indicated that there was such a substance hydrocarbonbased see nyfd laboratory report the substance was approximately percent octane unleaded gasoline thirty percent diesel fuel and ten percent dish detergent determined by subsequent photospectrometric analysis to be dawn brand this is consistent with witnesses observations that the fire appeared to burn orange in color with a large amount of smoke indicating a hydrocarbonbased accelerant a gasoline can found on the premises contained residue of octane unleaded gasoline but a comparison of the dyes added to both the gasoline contained in the accelerant and those in the gasoline can indicated that they came from different sources photospectrometric analysis was able to differentiate the fuel oil in the tank at the premises from the composition of the fuel oil found at the point of origin an attempt was made to ascertain the supplier of the gasoline and fuel oil used in the accelerant but they were found to be blends and so a source could not be determined in addition it should be noted that thirteen semiautomatic pistols four mm glock three mm taurus and six browning were found secreted behind the oil tank in the premises the weapons were unloaded and there was no ammunition present they were shipped to nypd forensic lab for latent fingerprint testing afis search came back with no match batf and nypd major crimes was notified witnesses reported they had seen a tenant e washington enter the building through the back door ten feet from the point of origin shortly before the blaze on the basis of this i instituted a search of the national insurance underwriters fraud prevention service which revealed that on july of this year suspect washington applied for and received an insurance policy from new england mutual casualty and indemnity policy no b declared value policy proceeds payable into her checking account east side bank trust acct no fingerprints taken from several of the glass bottle shards located near the point of origin were compared with fingerprints taken from three knows found in the remains of the premises and known to be subject washingtons two partials matched this provided the basis for probable cause and suspect washington was arrested at new york hospital where she was recuperating from injuries sustained in the fire subject washington was read her rights and refused to say anything and was given the opportunity to seek legal representation the investigation is ongoing and i am continuing to search for evidence to assist the district attorneys office in prosecuting this offense note the vast majority of forprofit arsons involve a suspicious fire on the top floor and to the rear of the premises this serves two purposes it destroys the roof which in most cases is the most expensive portion of a building to repair a destroyed roof will usually result in an insurance company declaring the building a total loss second it causes severe water damage throughout the rest of the premises and thus causes significant additional damage with minimal loss of life this particular fire was set in the basement that is without any concern whatsoever for human life if the perpetrator is the individual who has set similar fires over the past several years as the mo and nature of accelerant indicate we have reason to believe that this individual is a particular threat to others we recommend that all pressure possible be brought to bear on suspect washington to have her reveal the identity of this perpetrator who in my opinion she hired for the purposes of perpetrating insurance fraud insurance and fingerprints and damn if the color of the fire and the amount of smoke all that technical stuff hadnt come right from his own mouth when hed confronted lomax at the scene pellam thought the adas having a document examiner go over the insurance application to see if the handwriting matches hers but there is a tentative match bailey nodded his head in the direction cleg his greenjacketed emissary had just disappeared im getting a copy of the report at the same time its sent to ms koepel if she hadnt denied having the policy it probably wouldnt have looked so bad for her pellam said maybe she denied it because she didnt take out the policy bailey didnt respond to that pellam returned to examining the report again the insurance is payable directly into her account is that unusual no its pretty common if a house or apartment burns the company pays the proceeds directly into the bank so the check wouldnt be mailed to a place that no longer existed so whoever took out the policy would have to know her account number thats right baileys yellow pad was sunfaded around the edges it looked like it was ten years old guns pellam said eyes on the report what do you think that means bailey laughed that the apartments in hells kitchen thats all it means therere more guns here than on la freeways which pellam doubted very much he asked did you find out who the landlord is and if the building was landmarked thats why cleg is delivering my thankyou presents bailey rummaged in a file and dropped a photocopy on the desk it bore the seal of the state attorney general bailey seemed to think this was a significant piece of paper but to pellam it was legal gibberish he shrugged looked up the lawyer explained yes the building was landmarked but thats irrelevant why the owners a nonprofit foundation bailey flipped through several pages and tapped an entry pellam read the st augustus foundation w thirtyninth street everybody in the kitchen knew about st augustus it was a large church rectory and catholic school complex in the heart of the neighborhood and had been here forever to the extent hells kitchen had a soul st aug was it in an interview ettie had told him that francis p duffy the chaplain of the kitchens famous world war i regiment the fighting th had celebrated masses at st augustus before becoming pastor of holy cross church pellam asked skeptically you think theyre innocent just because its a church its the nonprofit part bailey explained not the theological part any money that a notforprofit makes has to stay in the organization it cant be distributed to its stockholders even when its dissolved and the attorney general and the irs are always checking upon the books of nonprofits besides the foundation had it insured for its book value that was only a hundred thousand oh sure ive known a lot of priests who ought to go to jail for one thing or another but nobodys going to risk sailing up to sing sing for that kind of small change pellam nodded at the papers whos this father james daly hes the director i called him an hour ago he was out finding emergency housing for the tenants of the building ill let you know when he calls back pellam then asked can you get the name of the insurance agent ettie talked to sure i can can it was turning into the most expensive verb in the english language pellam slid another two hundred in stiff twenties toward the lawyer he sometimes thought atms should flash a message that read are you going to spend this money wisely he nodded out the window toward the highrise baileys office was only two doors from etties burnt tenement and a haze of lingering smoke still obscured his view of the glitzy place roger mckennah he said slowly ettie said some of his workers from across the street were in the alley behind her building the night of the fire whyd they be there but bailey was nodding as if he wasnt surprised at this news theyre doing some work here here in your building right hes partowner of this place thats the work going on outside that you hear he nodded toward the sound of hammering in a hallway upstairs the new donald trump himself renovating my building why thats a source of some speculation but we think we think hes fixing up a hideaway for his mistress on the second floor but you know rumors you dont suspect him do you why shouldnt i bailey glanced toward his wine bottle but forewent another glass i cant believe hed do anything illegal developers like mckennah steer clear of shenanigans why bother with small potatoes like burning an old tenement hes got hotels and offices all over the northeast that new casino of his on the boardwalk in atlantic city just opened last month you dont look convinced a rule in hollywood thriller scriptwriting is that if you dont want to spend a lot of time developing your villains character just make him real estate developer or oil company executive bailey shook his head mckennahs too topdrawer to do anything illegal let me make a call pellam took the phone the lawyer apparently changed his mind about the wine and graciously poured himself another pellam declined with a shake of his head as he punched in a long series of numbers alan lefkowitz please after several clicks and long moments on hold cheerful voice came on the phone pellam the john pellam shit where you be hating himself for it pellam slipped into producerspeak big apple whats cooking lefty doing that thing with polygram you know the costner one on the way to the set right now pellam couldnt recall whether he owed multimilliondollar producer lefkowitz anything at the moment or whether lefkowitz owed him but pellam took on a the creditors attitude one when he said i need some help here lefty you bet johnny talk to me you know all the big boys out here on the right coast some roger mckennah we rub elbows hes on the film board at columbia a trustee or nyu i dont remember i want to get in to see him or lets say i want to look at him socially his crib not the battlefields silence from the other coast then so whyd you be interested in that research ha research poking around gimme a minute lefty remained on the line but grunted somewhat breathlessly as if he was making love though pellam knew he was leaning across a massive desk and flipping through his address book well hows this hows what lefty you wanta go to a party you live to party right the last party pellam could recall attending had been two or three years ago he said im party animal lefty mckennah pokes the social beast all the time drop my name and youll get in ill make some calls find out where and when ill call spielberg spielbergs assistant he meant and the call would finally end up with an assistants assistant located in an entirely different town than the chief raider of the lost ark was in my undying gratitude lefty i mean it so the producer said coyly research huh john research silence while the signals of ambition bounced off a satellite somewhere in cold space and shot back down to earth ive been hearing things john what that oaklands losing and the cardinalsre winning somebody in some postpro house out here was telling somebody i know youve booked editing time thats a lot of somebodies pellam observed and thats not the only thing ive heard isnt it a couple studiosve tried to get you to scout for them but the word is youre out of the scouting business somebody told somebody about something the word in hollywood was as quick as the word on the streets of hells kitchen naw naw im just on vacation oh sure got it and you need a good editor to clean up that footage you took of mickey and goofy when you were at epcot sure something like that come on john i always had faith in you a safe way of saying that whatever had gone down however bad it looked for pellam and itd looked pretty bad at one time lefkowitz hadnt abandoned him which was with some creative recasting slightly true its always warmed my heart knowing that so youre trying to get something on arent you its a little thing lefty a small project you wouldnt be interested all i need at this point is domestic distribution you got financing and i didnt hear about it he whispered this its a very small project your palm dor and your la film critics award were for small projects too youll recall distribution i was saying producers love distributiononly deals because if the film bombs they dont lose millions its a percentage arrangement the execs dont get the academy awards and they dont get as rich but they dont get as poor either and hence dont get fired as soon my earsre turned your way pellam talk to me im in a meeting now yeah with who a lawyer cant really go into it pellam winked at bailey wall street which firm hush hush pellam whispered whats going on john this could be big a new pellam feature if lefkowitz found out he was slavering over a documentary hed hang up the phone in an instant and the pellam he had always been behind one hundred per cent would cease to exist distribution for the arthouse circuit meant selling the film to a total of about one hundred screens around the country like the film forum in new york and the biograph in chicago feature films went to thousands of multiplexes pellam deciding he didnt feel guilty said you get me in to see mckennah and ill have my lawyer here give you a call there was a pause that screenwriters call a beat i may have to burn some bridges but id do it for you love you johnny i mean that sincerely oh about mckennah you know hes an unchained shit dont you i just want to crash his party lefty i dont want to sleep with him you have that lawyer call me they hung up was that bailey asked a hollywood person to the core do you really want me to call him i wouldnt do that to you louis but i do have a legal question bailey tipped the jug of wine into his cup once more pellam asked whats the sentence for carrying an unlicensed pistol in new york city there were probably some questions that gave the lawyer pause and some that surprised him this wasnt in either of those categories he answered as if pellam had asked him about the weather not good here its technically a mandatory sentence but the judge has some discretion unless of course youre a felon then its a year mandatory rikers island and the sentence comes with several large boyfriends whether you want them or not youre not talking about yourself are you im just asking theoretically the lawyers eyes narrowed is there something about you i should know no theres nothing you should know bailey nodded to the window what do you need a gun for anyway look outside young man you see tumbleweeds you see cowpokes indians this isnt the streets of laredo i dont think thats a lock louis eight from somewhere in his apartment building pellam heard that song again strident and loud it mustve been number one on the rap charts now dont be blind open your eyes and whatta you find a large stack of videocassettes sat at his feet representing several months worth of taping they werent edited yet or even organized beyond subject and date written in his sloppy handwriting on firstaid tape stuck to each cassette he found one and slipped it into a cheap vcr that rested precariously on a cheaper tv through the wall came the steady bass thud of the song its a white mans world its a white mans world the screen of the cheap motorola flickered reluctantly to life showing this ettie wilkes washington sat comfortably in front of the camera shed wanted to be filmed in her favorite rocker an oak relic her husband eddie doyle had bought for her but even the slight rocking motion had been a distraction and hed moved her to a straightbacked chair as a young assistant pellam had worked on jaws and remembered spielberg telling the director of photography to bolt the camera to the deck of robert shaws boat during the location shots the seasoned dp wisely suggested that they better shoot handheld or else risk sending seasick audiences racing for restrooms around the country so pellam had moved her to an overstuffed armchair hed wanted her in front of a window with the construction work going on outside you could also see in the frame another antique an old rolltop desk filled with papers and letters on the wall behind it hung a dozen pictures of family you asking bout billy doyle my husband ill tell you he was a funny man nobody like him i ever met ill tell you what he looked like first of all he was handsome yessir tall and well you know very white wed walk down the street together he always made me take his arm didnt matter whether we were uptown near san juan hill where the blacks were mostly and they didnt like mixed couples or in hells kitchen where it was white the irish and italian boys there didnt like mixed couples either we got glares from everybody but he always had me on his arm day or night and hed always go to clubs with me when i sang hed sit at a table with a whisky in front of him the man loved his whisky sit there thonly white man in the whole place and he kept getting looks but after a while nobodyd pay any attention to him id look down from the stage and there hed be eating chitlins and talking with a couple three men smiling up at me knocking them on the shoulders and saying i was his gal then id look down and see him arguing i knew he was talking bout billie holliday and bessie smith but the thing about him was he never found himself and that was hard for a man hardest thing there is a man who doesnt come into his own sometimes he doesnt really have to find it sometimes he just ends up someplace and digs his heels in and some years go by and thats who he is and hes all right with that but billy was always looking what he wanted most was land to own something thats the funny thing its why we never really had a home because he wasted all his time on these schemes to get a building get some land he wanted it bad and that was why he served that time in jail documentary filmmakers should never intrude but off camera a surprised pellam asked he did time but just then ettie shifted in her chair and looked up turned her head pellam remembered that florence besserman etties friend from the third floor had come to the door unexpectedly the tape went blank shed never finished the story about billy doyles criminal history and pellam had agreed to come back on the night of the fire as it had turned out to record the details pellam now rewound the tape to the beginning and found what hed been looking for not ettie but some footage of pretty pudgy anita lopez apartment a who spoke in her machinegun voice her fireenginered nails flying everywhere despite pellams reminders to keep her hands still sí sí we got gangs just like what you see in the movies they got guns they get into trouble they drink they got cars boomboom these big speakers ai so loud used to be the westies they gone now what we got is we got the cubano lords they is the big gang now they got a apartment and they dont mind if everybody know where i tell you on thirtyninth between ninth and tenth oh they scare me dont say nothing to nobody i told you please pellam shut the vcr off he dropped to his knees and inventoried the canvas bag which contained everything an astute documentarian ought to have the betacam the ampex deck the nicad battery pack two extra cassettes a cardioid mike with sponge wind guard steno notebook pens and a colt peacemaker singleaction pistol five of the six chambers loaded withcaliber shells the rosewood grip was battered and sweatstained he was thinking of what his mother had told him just before hed left the placid town of simmons ny en route to manhattan last may thats a crazy city down there new york is you keep an eye out johnny you just never know pellam had lived long enough to understand that no you never did he walked west along the sweltering concrete of thirtyninth street on doorstep sat a heavy woman holding a long dark cigarette and rocking a dilapidated baby carriage she read el diario buenos días pellam said buenas tardes the womans eyes swept over pellam examining the jeans the black jacket and white tshirt i wonder if you could help me she looked up exhaled as if she were smoking im making a movie about hells kitchen he held up the camera bag about the gangs here no gangs aquí well some of the young people teenagers i didnt mean to say gang faltan gangs no gangs somebody told me about the cubano lords es un club club they have a clubhouse here right un apartmento i heard it was on this street buenos muchachos no shit happen round here they make sure of that id like to talk to them nobody come here nobody bother us they good hombres thats why i want to talk to them and look at las calles she waved her hand up and down the street they clean or what could you give me the name of whos in charge of the club i dont know none of them you no hot in that jacket yeah i am i heard they hang out around here she laughed and returned to the paper pellam left her and crisscrossed the neighborhood over to the river and back again skirting the squat black javits convention center he didnt find what he was looking for which is what he wondered a halfdozen young men standing around like george chakiris and the sharks in west side story a young latino family walked toward him the couple in tank tops and shorts a teen girl in a short tight dress they lugged a cooler and blankets and toys and lawn chairs dads day off they were headed for central park pellam guessed he was watching the family vanish toward the subway when he saw the man on top of the building he was about pellams age a few years younger maybe latino he wore closefitting jeans and a tshirt brilliantly white he stood on the roof of a tenement looking down with dark eyes that even from this distance seemed to beam displeasure the man leapt from one building to another and was directly above him pellam could see only a silhouette he was making his way east along the roofs of the tenements pellam turned and headed in the same direction he paused at the corner lost sight of the young man then a sudden flash of white disappeared into a crowd of workers along tenth avenue crossing the street fast pellam tried to follow but the man had vanished how the hell had he done that he asked the workers if theyd seen anyone but they claimed that hadnt seen anybody and the alley they stood in front of the only place the man could have escaped was blind barred windows no doors no exit pellam gave up and returned to thirtysixth street wandering toward the charred remains of etties building it wasnt the noise that warned him but its absence some raucous hammering from the construction site across the street suddenly dulled the sound absorbed by the young mans body and clothing without even looking sideways at the running footsteps pellam set the bag down and reached inside he hadnt yet found the colt when a piece of metal a pistol barrel he guessed touched the back of his neck the alley the voice said in a melodic spanish accent lessgo nine his thick brows were knitted together and beneath them his lids dipped slightly as if he was nursing a deep grudge they stood in the alley behind louis baileys building on greasy cobblestones the smell of rotten vegetables and rancid oil filled the heavy air pellam stood crossed his arms glancing down at the tiny black automatic pistol then he studied his captor again a pink leathery scar traversed the mans forearm it was recent on his hand in the y between his thumb and forefinger was a blurred tattoo in the form of a dagger pellam lived in la he recognized a crew insignia when he saw one pellam asked habla inglés the man looked down into the bag keeping the automatic trained on pellams chest he bent down and lifted the betacam partially out appreciate your leaving that alone its shut up the man didnt find the colt he lowered the camera stood up youre a cubano lord pellam said he was as tall as pellam most latinos he knew were shorter ive been looking for you pellam said me one of you why to have a talk his eyebrows twitched in surprise you talking now im doing a film on hells kitchen i want to talk to some of the people in gangs or is it a club the other day what you doing the other day what you looking for talking to people on the street here you taking pictures what you do that for pellam remained silent the young man let a disgusted sigh ease from his lungs you gonna say we did it you gonna say we torch that building im making a film i the terse young mans brows nestled closer there a tv news show here in the city latino station you never hear of it i know they slogan is primero con la verdad you believe in that is la verdad siempre primero with you the truth arms crossed again he lifted a hand to his chin and with a callous thumb rubbed a short deep scar below his mouth you some kind of reporter you some kind of geraldo pellam nodded toward the cobblestoned alley this where you play basketball have bake sales pony rides for the kids all those things a club does whatre you asking me man i heard some of your boys were hanging out here just before the fire you heard so that make it true a white man say los cubanos burn down a building so it true a black man say it so it true pellam didnt answer and he continued you no think this old nigger lady do it you think i do it why cause you like niggers moren you like spics pellam didnt think more anger could be inside the young man but more anger now flooded his face he shifted his weight on expensive running shoes and pellam wondered if he was going to shoot he glanced sideways for a place to roll wondered if he could get to his colt in time decided he couldnt make the call apologize or get tough pellam frowned leaned forward he spat back im here to do a job you dont want to answer my questions thats your damn business but im not interested in any fucking lectures the dark eyes narrowed suddenly im gonna get shot hell shouldve kissed ass knew it but the man didnt pull the trigger and he didnt pistolwhip him either the second option pellamd figured he put the gun away and walked around the front of etties building gesturing pellam after him he ducked under the police line and walked up the stairs to what was left of the tiny entryway pellam dug the colt out of the bag and slipped it into the back waistband of his jeans he lifted the bag and walked out to the sidewalk with a booted foot the young latino was kicking in the shattered front door of etties building he shouldered his way inside filthying his tshirt on the charred wood pellam heard breaking glass and loud crashes the man returned a minute later with a rectangle of metal he tossed it to pellam who caught the heavy frame it was the building directory with a long finger the cubano lord tapped a name c ramirez she my aunt okay she live there with two niños my mothers sister okay you figure it out im not gonna burn down no building my family living in and you wanna know something else that lady my aunt carmella she see one of jimmy corcorans micks drop the hammer on some guy last month and she testify against him he up in attica now and jimmy he no so happy about what she say how you like that story my friend you

go back and tell them the cubano lords they no do this kind of shit im not a reporter so now you no have to talk to me you know la verdad pellam asked your names ramirez whats your first name the man paused and held a muscular finger to his lips silencing him then pointed it at pellams face you tell them his eyes sank down to pellams boots then rose again as if he were memorizing him then he walked slowly out of the shadow of the ruined building into the crisp hot sunlight but jimmy corcoran was a ghost no one had heard of him no one knew any corcorans pellam had wandered around the neighborhood stopping in puerto rican bodegas korean vegetable stands italian pork stores nobody knew corcoran but everybody had a funny lilt in their voices when they said they didnt their denials seemed desperate he tried a bodega he hangs out around here someplace pellam encouraged the ancient mexican clerk with an immensely wrinkled face stared at his flyblown tray of lardy pastry smoked his cigarette and nodded silently he offered nothing pellam bought a coconut drink and stepped outside he mbled up to a cluster of tshirted men lounging around a ystand sprinkler hookup and asked them two of them quickly said theyd never heard of jimmy corcoran the other three forgot whatever english they knew he decided to try further west closer to the river he was walking past the parochial school on eleventh when he heard yo yo yourself pellam said the boy stood in a tall battered dumpster and looked down hands on scrawny hips he wore baggy jeans and despite the heat a red green and yellow windbreaker pellam thought the mosaic haircut was pretty well done the razor notch mimicked the grin that was etched deep into his dark face whassup tell you what come on down here why i want to talk to you dont jump climb around the back no he jumped the boy landed on the ground unhurt you dont member me sure i do your mothers sibbie straight up you be cnn the man with the camera on the playground behind him four baseball diamonds stood empty two basketball courts too the gates were chained easily a hundred cans of paint had been sacrificed to decorate the yard wheres your mother and sister be at the shelter why arent you in school aint no school be summer pellam had forgotten despite heat or snow cities are virtually seasonless he had trouble imagining what summer vacation in hells kitchen might be like pellams augusts had been filled with sneaking into movies and trading comics and occasional softball games he remembered many summer mornings bicycling like a demon zipping over smooth concrete marked by the slick paths of confused snails and slugs whats your name ismail yo whats yours im john pellam yo homes i aint like john slob nigger i know called john he aint down to do nothing you know what im saying ima call you pellam wasnt mr an option hows the shelter his smile faded this nigger dont like the peoples there slanging all the time cluckheads all over the place drugs the boy was saying a cluckhead was a crack addict pellam had worked on several films in south central la he knew some gangspeak its only for a little while pellam said but the reassurance sounded leaden he had no idea how the boy took it ismails eyes suddenly flashed happily yo you like basketball i like patrick ewing he the best you know what im saying i like michael jordan too yo ever see the bulls play i live in la lakers yeah magic he be fine i like mr b the barkley he the man to have at yo back ina fight he sparred against an unseen adversary yo yo you like basketball cuz

nicholson does so shall you do not really he confessed and shaq too man be ten feet tall i wanna be that nigger ismail danced around on the sidewalk and performed a mini slam dunk pellam glanced at the boys tattered hightops and dropped to his knees to retie a dangling lace this made the boy uncomfortable he stepped back and clumsily tied it himself pellam rose slowly you started to tell me something the other day about the gangs burning down your building your mother hit you when you started to tell me something i wont say anything to her he looked surprised as if hed forgotten the slap i heard corcorans gang mightve had something to do with it you know bout his crew how you know corcoran i dont im trying to find him man that fuckedup you doin that his set they some bad ogs original

impressed that pellam talked the talk ismail said i aint know were they hang man he kept his eye on pellam and did a few layup shots yo you got a daddy pellam laughed a father sure the grin was gone i dont got one pellam reflected that a large percentage of black households were missing an adult male then felt ashamed this news bite was his immediate reaction to the boys comment the boy continued matter of factly got hisself shot hey im sorry ismail there these cluckheads outside on the street okay selling rock my daddy go out and they just smoke him right there i seen em do it he didnt do nothing they just smoke him pellam exhaled in shock shook his head they find who did it who the jakes jakes you know jakes joey the man the man the poeleece ismail laughed with a frighteningly adult

fourflight walkup under shortterm lease i dont really have one he told the boy check it out you just like me damn pellam laughed at this then decided the parallels were unsettlingly accurate john pellam single former independent film director and itinerant location scout sometimes missed family life but then hed laugh and try to picture himself attending a suburban grade school pta parentteacher night wherere you going to go he asked the boy dunno cuz maybe get my own crew together aint no nigger crews round here get a kickback on thirtysixth ima call it the trey six ghosts how

what was probably half of his own weight ill get that pellam said its heavy shit dont weigh nothing yo over there there no more back yeah yo back is what im saying back ismail was pointing out to pellam where he thought the fire had started i smell smoke then see all these flames cuz right here an a big pop yeah pop and i run inside thapartment and i go yo all yall gotta get out there this fire and my mama she start to scream you see anybody by the window before the fire this old lady is all she live upstairs on the top floor anybody else i dunno people hanging i dunno pellam looked at what was left of the back door it was metal and had two large locks on it wouldve been a tough job to break through he leaned down and peered through the window hed wondered if the pyro could have thrown the bomb through the bars but they were too close together for anything but a beer bottle the wine jug never would have fit somebody would have tove let him in the back door was locked right yeah they try an keep it locked but shit there a lotta traffic you know what im saying in that back place there see it pellam this fag doing business you know givin head and all he a cluckhead too a

hector ramirez his crew be the cubano lords they bad motherfuckers too but they dont give this nigger no shit not like corcoran hes sprung cuz corcoran is man be a hatter but ramirez see hed wax you but only if he had to even this tenyearold was better patched in to the word on the street than pellam he glanced at the name e washington on the directory and tossed it to the ground a police car cruised slowly past the building and paused the officer in the drivers seat was looking his way he gestured pellam out of the police tape ismail the boy was gone ismail the squad car drove on he searched for several minutes but ismail had vanished a brittle sound of falling brick and hollow metal filled the night a soft grunt followed ismail pellam stepped into the alley behind the building and saw boy about eighteen blond in faded blue jeans and a dirty white shirt he crouched beside a pile of trash he was digging something out occasionally dislodging a small avalanche leaping back like a spooked raccoon then digging again he had fine baby hair selfcut ear length the obligatory generation x goatee was anemic and untrimmed he glanced at pellam squinted then returned to his task gotta get some stuff man some stuff you lived here the boy said gravely in the back he nodded toward where the rear basement apartment had been me and ray he was like my manager me and ray he was like his pimp this was the one ismail was talking about the male prostitute he seemed so young for a life on the street pellam asked wheres ray now dunno can i ask you some questions about the fire with a grunt of exertion he pulled what hed been looking for from beneath the pile and wiped at the cover of the book kurt cobain the final year he gazed at it lovingly for a moment then he looked up thats what i was going to talk to you about man the fire you pellam right he flipped through the book pellam blinked in surprise so heres the deal i can tell you who started the fire and who hired them if youre like interested ten howd you know about me just did the boy caressed the glossy cover of the book with a filthy hand how pellam persisted as curious as he was suspicious you know like you hear things tell me what you know im not a cop his laugh said he already knew this about him the word on the street the boys attention returned to his book like a childs golden book just a photo laminated on a cardboard cover the type was large and the words sparse the photos were terrible pellam prompted so who set the fire who hired him in a very young face the very old eyes narrowed then the boy broke out into a laugh geargreasing is expensive work pellam mentally totaled his two savings accounts and an anemic ira penalty for early withdrawal and some remaining advance money from wgbh the figure eightyfive hundred floated into his mind there was a little equity left in the house on beverly glen the battered winnebago had to be worth something but that was it pellams lifestyle was often liquid but his resources largely were not the boy wiped his nose a hundred thousand he thought a grungestud like this would have more modest aspirations pellam didnt even bother to negotiate he asked howd you find out about the fire the guy who did it i sorta know him hes hatter crazy dude you know he gets off burning things the pyro bailey had told him about the one ada lois koepel whom pellam already detested was so eager to track down he told you who hired him like not exactly but you can figure it out from what he told me whats your name you like dont need to know it you like know mine i could give you one the boy continued but so what it wouldnt be real well i dont have a hundred thousand bucks nowhere near bullshit youre like this famous director or something youre from hollywood of course you got money in front of them the police cruiser eased down the street again pellam thought about tackling the skinny kid and calling the cops over but all it took was one look into pellams eyes oh nice try you asshole the boy shouted clutching the precious book under his arm he burst down the alley pellam waved futilely at the police car the two cops inside didnt see him or they ignored the gestures then he was racing through the alley boots pounding grittily on the cobblestones after the kid they streaked through two vacant lots behind etties building and emerged onto ninth avenue pellam saw the boy turn right north and keep sprinting when the kid got to thirtyninth street pellam lost him he paused hands on hips gasping he examined the parking lots the approaches to the lincoln tunnel the rococo tenements bodegas and a sawduststrewn butcher shop pellam tried a deli but no one in there had seen him when he stepped out into the street pellam noticed half block away door swinging open the boy sprinted out lugging a knapsack and vanished in a mass of people pellam didnt even bother to pursue in the crowded streets the boy simply turned invisible the doorway the kid had come out of was a storefront windows painted over black he remembered seeing it earlier the youth outreach center inside he saw dingy fluorescentlit room sparsely furnished with mismatched desks and chairs two women stood talking in the center of the room arms crossed somber pellam entered just as the thinner of the two women lifted her arms helplessly and pushed through a doorway that led to the back of the facility the other womans pale round face was glossy with faint makeup barely hiding a spray of freckles she wore her red hair shoulderlength he guessed she was in her midthirties she wore an old sweatshirt and a pair of old jeans which didnt disguise her voluptuous figure the longsleeved top maroon bore the harvard crest veritas pellam had a fast memory of the cubano lord verdad he recalled primero con la verdad she glanced up at him with some curiosity as he stepped inside she glanced at his camera bag he introduced himself and the woman said im carol wyandotte the director here can i help you she adjusted a pair of thick tortoiseshell glasses break in the frame fixed with white adhesive tape shoving the loose glasses back up her nose pellam thought she was pretty the way a peasant or farm girl would be absurdly she wore a choker of pearls a kid left here a minute ago blond grungy alex we were just talking about him he ran inside grabbed his backpack and left we were wondering what was going on i was talking to him down the street he just ran off talking to him pellam didnt want to say that the boy knew about the arson for the youngsters sake the word on the street traveled far too fast he remembered the gun in ramirezs hand and how the whole world seemed terrified of jimmy corcoran you can carol said dryly tell me the truth shoved her glasses onto her nose pellam cocked an eyebrow happens all the time one of our kids cops a wallet or something then somebody comes in blushing and says i think one of your boys found my wallet pellam decided she was a smart rich girl turned social worker which was probably a very tough category of person to deal with well he might be a great thief but he didnt steal anything from me im making a film and a reporter carols face went ice cold much angrier than if hed accused alex of finding his wallet he thought her eyes are remarkable pale pale blue almost blending into the surrounding white not exactly he explained that west of eighth was an oral history i dont like reporters a bit of brogue slipped into carols voice and he had a clue to the feistiness inside her a grit that the director of a place like this undoubtedly needed a temper too all those damn stories on preteen addicts and gang rapes and child prostitutes makes it hard as hell to get money when the boards of foundations turn on live at five and see that the little girl youre trying to rehabilitate is an illiterate hooker with hiv but of course its exactly kids like that whore the ones you need to rehabilitate hey maam pellam held up his hand im just a lowly oral historian here the hardness in carols round face melted sorry sorry my friends say i cant pass a soapbox without climbing on top you were saying about alex you were interviewing him ive been talking to people in the building that burned down he lived there off and on carol corrected with his chicken hawk me and ray she continued you know juan torres pellam nodded hes in critical condition the son of the man who met jose canseco carol shook her head it just kills me to see something like that happen to the good ones its such a damn waste you dont have any idea where alex took off to ran in ran out dont have a clue wheres home he claimed he was from wisconsin somewhere probably is im sorry ive forgotten your name pellam first john pellam go by the last usually you dont like john lets say i dont lead a very biblical life any chance hell come back impossible to say the working boys you know what i mean by working only stay here when theyre sick or between hawks if hes scared about something hell go to ground and it could be six months before we see him again if ever you live in the city im from the coast im renting in the east village the village shit hells kitchen sleaze beats their sleaze hands down so give me your number and if our wandering waif comes home ill let you know pellam wished he hadnt thought of her as a peasant he couldnt dislodge the thought peasants were earthy peasants were lusty especially redhaired peasants with freckles he found himself calculating that the last time hed slept with a woman theyd wakened in the middle of the night to the sound of winds pelting the side of his winnebago with wet snow today the temperature had reached he pushed those thoughts aside though they didnt go as far away as he wanted them to there was a dense pause pellam asked impulsively listen you want to get some coffee she reached for her nose to adjust the glasses then changed her mind and took them off she gave an embarrassed laugh and readjusted the glasses again then she gave a tug at the hem of her sweatshirt pellam had seen the gesture before and sensed that a handful of insecurities probably about her weight and clothes was flooding into her thoughts something in him warned against saying you look fine and he chose something more innocuous gotta warn you though i dont do espresso she brushed her hair into place with thick fingers laughed he continued none of that starbucks yuppie frenchroast crap its american or nothing isnt it colombian well latin american carol joked you probably like it in unrecyclable styrofoam too id spray it out of an aerosol can if they made it that way theres a place up the street she said a little deli i go to lets do it carol called be back in fifteen a response in spanish which pellam couldnt make out came from the back room he opened the door for her she brushed against him on the way out had she done so on purpose eight months pellam found himself thinking then told himself to stop they sat on the curb near etties building at their feet were two blue coffee cartons depicting dancing greeks carol wiped her forehead with the souvenir cambridge cotton and asked whos he pellam turned and looked where carol was pointing ismail and his tricolor windbreaker had mysteriously returned he now played in the cab of the bulldozer that had been leveling the lot beside etties building yo my man careful up there pellam called he explained to carol about ismail his mother and sister the shelter in the school its one of the better ones carol said theyll probably get them into an sro in a month or so single room occupancy a residence hotel at least if theyre lucky so you know the neighborhood pretty well he asked cut my social work teeth here youd know the good stuff then the stuff that we touristas never find out try me carol glanced at the tooling on pellams battered black nokona cowboy boots the gangs he said the crews sure i know about them but i dont deal much with them see if a kids in a set hes gonna get all the support he needs believe it or not theyre better adjusted than the lone wolves yo ismail called to carol i going back to la with my homie there he said pointing at pellam i dont recall that being on the agenda young man he raised his eyebrows to carol no no its cool cuz i come with you hook up with a blood or crip crew i get myself jumped in with them be cool you know what im saying he vanished down the alley give me lesson pellam said gangs in hells kitchen carols glasses had reappeared he wanted to tell her she looked better without them he knew better than that gangs huh where do i start all the way back to the gophers carol smiled coyly then she laughed in surprise when pellam said i heard onelung currans outa business now you know more than youre letting on pellam remembered an interview with ettie washington battle row thirtyninth street the turn of the century grandma ledbetter told me what a dreadful place it was thats where onelung curran and his gang the gophers hung out in mallet murphys tavern grandmad go to dig in bins for scraps of gabardine or maybe look for knuckle bones and she had to be careful cause the gang was always shooting it out with the police thats where it got the name they had real battles sometimes it was the gophers that won believe it or not and the cops wouldnt come back for weeks until thingsd settled down he now said to carol how bout the gangs now she thought for a moment the westies used to be the gang here and therere still some around but the justice department and the cops broke their back a few years ago jimmy corcorans gangs pretty much replaced them theyre the dregs of the old irish the cubano lordsre the biggest now mostly cuban but some puerto rican and dominican no black gangs to speak of theyre in harlem and brooklyn the jamaicans and koreans are in queens the tongs in chinatown the russians in brighton beach the director within pellam stirred momentarily at the thought of a story about the gangs then he thought been done two words that are pure strychnine in tinseltown carol stretched and her breast brushed pellams shoulder accidentally or otherwise it had been a remarkable evening that night eight months ago the snow hitting the side of the camper the wind rocking it the blonde assistant director gripping pellams earlobe between very sharp teeth eight months is an incredibly long time its three quarters of a year practically gestation wheres corcorans kickback he asked his headquarters carol asked shaking her head those boysre a step away from caves they hang out in an old bar north of here which one carol shrugged i dont know exactly she was lying he glanced at her pale eyes he was letting her know shed been nabbed she continued unapologetically look you gotta understand about corcoran its not like the gangs on tv hes psycho one of his boys killed this guyd tried to extort them jimmy and some of his buddies cut up the body with a hacksaw then they sunk the parts in spuyten duyvil but jimmy kept one of the hands as a souvenir and tossed it into a toll basket on the jersey pike thats the kind of crew youre dealing with here ill take my chances you think hell just grin and tell you his life story on camera pellam shrugged nonchalant though an image of hacksaws had neatly replaced the image of making love in a snowswept winnebago carol shook her head pellam the kitchen isnt bedsty it isnt the south bronx or east new york there everybody knows its dangerous you just stay away or you know youre going to get dissed and you can see trouble coming here its all turned round you got yuppie lofts you got nice restaurants you got murderers whores corporate execs psychos priests gay hookers actors youre walking past a little garden at noon in front of a tenement thinking hey thosere pretty flowers and the next thing you know youre on the ground and theres a bullet in your leg or an ice pick in your back or maybe youre singing irish songs in a bar and the guy next to you somebody walks up and shoots his brains out you never know who did it and you never know why oh hell pellam said i know that jimmy corcoran spits poison and walks through walls thats not news carol laughed and lowered her head to pellams arm he felt another sizzle from the contact hot enough to melt january snow she said okay sorry about the preachin its in my job description dont say i didnt warn you you want jimmy ill give you jimmy the four eightyeight its a bar on the corner of tenth and fortyfifth you can probably find him there three or four days a week but if you go go during the day and she laid a firm grip upon pellams arm id recommend you take a friend yo ismail jumped onto the stairs next to them i be his friend im sure thatll have corcoran quaking in his shoes fuck yeah ismail ran off to find more earthmoving equipment carol kept her eyes on pellam for a long moment pellam looked away first and carol stood up back to the salt mines she said laughing taking the glasses off as they walked back to the youth outreach center she said you know youre not the first creative sort ive run across one of our youth outreach graduates was an author really wrote a bestseller about a murderer the bad news is it was an autobiography call me sometime pellam heres my card dannette johnson was standing on tenth avenue this was a broad street the buildings lining it were low and it seemed even wider because of that the sun sinking over new jersey was still very bright and hot she stood in one of the few shaded places for blocks around under the awning of an abandoned late night club a relic from the eighties she thought nosir not that one examining drivers who slowed and looked at her in a particular way nope not that asshole nope not him neither she stood in the shade not because of the heat she was wearing no more than eight ounces of clothing on her extravagant body but because teenage acne had dimpled her face and she believed she was ugly another car drove past slowed almost to stopping like most of them here it had new jersey plates this was an approach to the lincoln tunnel main route for commuters who lived in the garden state it was also a very easy place for a girl to make five six hundred a night but not from this fellow not today she looked away and he drove on dannette had been working the street for eight years since shed turned nineteen to her the profession was absolutely no different from any other job most of the johns were decent guys who had a job they didnt really care for bosses who didnt particularly like them wives or girlfriends whod stopped giving them head after the first baby she provided a necessary service like the stenographer her mother had dreamt shed be a red irocz turned onto tenth and cruised slowly toward her the exhaust bubbling sexily behind the wheel was a pudgy italian boy in an expensive monogrammed white shirt his moustache was trimmed carefully and he wore a gold rolex on his left wrist he looked like a salesman at one of the car dealerships on the west side wanna fuck she smiled leaned forward said in a sexy voice kiss my black ass git outa here as dannette retreated to the shade again the car vanished a few minutes later a toyota cruised by inside was a thin white man wearing a baseball cap he looked around nervously hi he said how you doing today hot isnt it sure is hot she looked around and then walked to the car her high heels tapping on the concrete with loud pops yeah hot i go home this way from work he said ive seen you out here yeah where you work a place up the street yeah what kinda place she asked office its boring i seen you a couple times here i mean on the street he nervously cleared his throat this boy was too much yeah i hang here some she said youre a pretty lady she smiled again wondering as she did a hundred times a day if a plastic surgeon could smooth out her cheeks so he said dannette eyed him again echoed so after a moment she added well honey you innerested in a date maybe you sure got nice boobs you dont mind i tell you that do you everbody like mah tits sugar so whatta you do the boy wiped his face he was sweating he started to take his cap off but changed his mind what i do she asked frowning like if we were to have a date you and me whatd we do to have fun oh i tell you i do everthing i suck and i fuck and you can put it up my ass you want sokay with me you gonna be wearing a rubber anyways and i got me some ky wow he seemed embarrassed but she definitely had his attention i like it you talking that way dirty talk then ill talk tyou that way on our date man you are one hot woman shit honey that aint news dannette said straightfaced whats your name dannette whats yours joe there was a warehouse across the street joe septimos hauling and storage painting in letters twenty feet high half the guys who stopped here were named joe well joe hows that date sounding she leaned forward letting him get a good look at the tits he seemed to like and letting him see they were real and that she wasnt a transvestite sounding pretty good he whispered something she couldnt hear she leaned forward on the car her hands inside now he looked at her nine rings whats that you said honey i said how much we talking for our date i mean fo a nice boy like you what it is is i go down on you for fifty you can fuck my pussy for a hundred you can fuck my ass for two and we can do it right in your backseat there this alley i know bout now whatchu she gasped in shock as the boys eyes hardened and he reached into his pocket grabbing the handcuffs in one hand and her wrists in the other he was skinny but surprisingly strong whatre you doing she screamed with a click the cuffs ratcheted onto her narrow wrists well ill tell you what im doing dannette im arresting you for soliticiting sexual services in violation of the new york state penal code i want you to stand over there with that lady whos coming up right behind you the boy pulled her purse off her shoulder what dannette turned around eyes wide the policewoman appeared behind the car and walked up to dannette led her to the shaded part of the sidewalk oh shit she said astonishment in her voice you dont mean you a cop fooled you pretty good i do that oh shit man i dont believe it i just got outa detention shit i coulda swore you was just another asshole from jersey pleased with this review of his performance the vice officer nodded to the policewoman said get her in the wagon take em downtown the stocky woman cop gripped dannette by the arm and led her around the corner where a dodge caravan waited an unmarked paddy wagon and helped her up inside the vehicle where two other prostitutes sat bored and sweating man they on a fucking fishin trip dannette blurted dont they got nothin better to do wtheir time i mean shit dont you got nothing better to do well get you downtown in ten fifteen minutes the woman said ill tell em to turn on the air conditioning when we start moving you whats so funny but dannette was laughing too hard to answer more sweat and look how these poor hands shake ah momma can this really be the end sonny walked through the construction site across from the burnedout building on thirtysixth street which hed decided was rapidly becoming one of his favorite jobs of his whole career a trophy job despite pellam the faggot joe buck midnight cowboy heehaw or maybe because of him to be stuck inside of mobile with the memphis blues again sonny paused looking for pellam no sign of him he kept hearing the music in his head thinking of his mother dead five years now thinking of her walking around the house listening to dylan on that thing that turntable all those records she had lps funny things scratchy and jumpy and when you burned them they melted into weird shapes his mother played dylan dylan dylan all night long month after month after month for a moment now he actually heard the music thought his mother was back he spun around no she wasnt there he saw only workers yellow hard hats stacks of sheetrock tanks of diesel oil and gasoline and propane nice he continued east until he came to a grating over the subway tunnel at eighth avenue he crouched behind a series of small dumpsters wiped the sweat from his face with his trembling hands can this really be the end not yet no but soon the end was looming the moment of his death was approaching and sonny knew it while most people are consumed by a vision of what their lives might be as egotistical as those visions were as wrong as theyd ultimately prove sonny was possessed by the vision of his death this made him he felt christlike our savior born to die our flesh our blood counting down the minutes to calvary indeed he resembled jesus at least the vaticanapproved souvenir shop cecilbdemille version lean narrow of face wispy goatee long blonde hair hypnotic blue eyes skinny whoa were getting pretty dramatic here sonny thought but when youre in love with fire your thinking can easily become apocalyptic the image of his death was a complicated one and had been forming since he was a young boy unable to sleep he would lie in his mothers silent still house sometimes in her silent arms sometimes her restless arms and picture it embellish edit hed be in a large room surrounded by thousands of people writhing in agony as gallons of marvelous juice his sticky concoction flowed over them hed be in the middle of the chaos listening to their screams smelling their burnt flesh watching their agony as the substanceless yet undeniable fire caressed their hair and groins and breasts and fingertips and hed be grappling with his enemy the antichrist the creature that had arrived on earth to take sonny away quiet tall dressed in black just like pellam he pictured the two of them chained together as the flowing fiery liquid surrounded them strong sweating bodies entwined as the flames removed their clothes then their skin their blood mixing the two of them and ten thousand others packed broadway theater a coliseum a school auditorium sonny was filled with energy and purpose he had to tell the world about the coming conflagration and so he did in his special way as the subway rumbled into the station and screeched to a stop beneath him he glanced around and poured the two gallon canister of juice through the ventilation grate he lit and dropped in after it a novelty birthday candle the kind that cant be blown out stuck in a wad of modeling clay with a subdued whooosh the flaming liquid flowed into the vents of the subway cars and inside happy birthday to you he sang then regretted his flippancy recalling that he was engaged in important work he stood and left slowly reluctantly sorry that he couldnt stay longer and listen to the screams rising through the black smoke the screams from those dying underground beneath his feet momma can this really be the end the sirens seemed to come from all around him they were raw urgent hopeless but sonny thought all the fuss was silly he was just getting started the city hadnt seen anything yet eleven hatake imaham was holding court in the womens detention center now listen here she told the young women gathered around her dont buy that crap high john conqueror root blackbat oil lodestones bichons twohearts drawing candle that be bullshit all that crap people be trying to sell you just to take yo money youghta know better ettie washington across the cell listened with half her attention she hurt more today than she had right after the fire her arm throbbed sending waves of pain into her jaw her ankle too and her headache was blinding shed tried again to get some painkillers and the guards had merely stared at her the way they sometimes stared at the mice scurrying around on the floors here but i know it work one skinny woman said one time mah man was cheatin and what it was listen to me if you got the sight you dont need them oils and candles and roots if you aint got the sight then theres nothing gonna do it you come to make a sacrifice at my honfour you leave a few pennies for damballah thats all you gotta do but mosta the mambos and houngnans in new yorkre just out fo money her voice lifted what about you mrs washington you believe in damballah in the serpent god santeria hoodoo not really no i dont ettie said she didnt feel like explaining that grandma ledbetter bless her heart had squeezed every shred of religion out of ettie by her fierce lectures that mixed catholicism and fiery baptist dogma which come to think of it didnt seem to ettie very different from the crazy stuff hatake was talking about incense and holy water instead of high john conqueror root hatake tugged at her naked punctured earlobe and continued to expound on the silliness of manfetching spells and law stayaway oil what was in your heart was what was important hatake said etties mind wandered and she thought again about john pellam wondered when hed come to visit her again if hed come that man ought to be a hundred miles away by now what the hell was he helping her for she thought with horror how hed almost been trapped by the fire thought about little juan torres too she said a nonbelievers prayer for the boy then a noise from the front of the cell the clank of metal on metal some of the women shouted hello to a new prisoner yo girl werent out but one day you got yo ass busted that quick shit dannette yo bad luck i staying away from you girl ettie watched the young woman with the pocked face and the beautiful figure walk uncertainly into the large cell she was one of the prostitutes whod been released just yesterday back so soon ettie smiled at her but the woman didnt respond dannette walked up to the circle of women sitting around hatake imaham who nodded to the woman hey girl good to see you which sounded a little odd sort of like hatake had been expecting her and the woman continued her lecture on hoodoo talking now about damballah the highest in the voodoo order ettie knew this because her sister had dabbled in that craziness some years ago then the huge womans voice faded and the women began talking among themselves very quietly one or two of them glanced at ettie but they didnt include her in the conversation that was all right she was thankful for the quiet and for a few minutes peace she had many things to think about and as the good lord or damballah she laughed to herself knew there were few enough moments of peace in here one of those feelings somebody watching him pellam stood on the curb in front of etties building wasting his time asking amnesiastruck construction workers if theyd been in the alley when the fire started or if they knew who had he turned suddenly yep there it was about fifty feet away a glistening black stretch limo was parked in the construction site under the large billboard on which an artist had rendered a dramatic painting of the finished building pellam had seen a number of billboards like this one on the west side whoever painted them managed to make the highrises look as appealing and as completely phoney as the drawings of women modeling lingerie in the saks and lord taylor newspaper ads pellam focused on the limo the windows were tinted but he could see that someone in the backseat a man it seemed was gazing at him pellam suddenly lifted the camera to his shoulder and aimed at the limo there was a pause and then some motion in the backseat the driver punched the accelerator and the long vehicle bounded out of the drive it vanished in traffic toward the fishgray strip of the hudson river he stepped off the curb still aiming the camera and so he never saw the second car the one that nearly broadsided him when he heard the brakes he spun around and stumbled back over the curb out of the way falling he lost some skin on his elbows rescuing the betacam which was worth more than he was at the moment a man was all over him in an instant huge man vicegrip hands grabbed pellams arms jerking him to his feet lifting the camera away not even time to blurt a protest before he was flung into the backseat of the sedan at first he thought jimmy corcoran had found out he was looking for his crew and sent some boys to find him hacksaws the image just wouldnt leave him alone but he realized these men werent gangies they were in their thirties and forties and they wore suits then he remembered where hed seen the one who grabbed him the one with the smooth baby skin and muscles upon muscles and so wasnt surprised to see who was in the front passenger seat officer lomax pellam said the huge assistant climbed into the front seat and started to drive im not an officer lomax said no uhuh then what do i call you inspector fire marshal kidnapper ha maybe i should call you mr funny instead of mr lucky aint he a kick lomax asked his assistant the wrestler didnt respond neither did the the man beside pellam a scrawny cop or marshal tiny as a rooster he didnt seem even to notice pellam and just stared at the scenery as they drove past how you doing lomax asked around the mans neck was a badge on a chain it was gold and had a meanlooking eagle perched on top of a crest soso to his assistant the marshal said take him where we just were then added only where nobody can see us the alley yeah the alleyd be good this seemed rehearsed but pellam wasnt going to play the intimidation game he rolled his eyes three cops or whatever fire marshals were werent going to shoot him in an alley we want to know one thing lomax said looking out the window at a recently burned store only one thing where can we find that shit the old lady hired thats it just that tell us and you wont believe the kind of deal well cut for her she didnt hire anybody she didnt torch the building every minute you spend thinking she did is another minute the real perp is free this was another line from one of his movies it sounded better on paper than it did when spoken aloud but that may have been the circumstances lomax said nothing for a few minutes then he asked you wanta know difference between women and men women break down easy a manll hardass you for days but you stand in front of a woman and scream and they start crying they say yeah yeah i did it dont hurt me dont hurt me i didnt mean to or i didnt know anybodyd get hurt or my boyfriend made me do it but they break down ill share that with gloria steinem next time i see her more of the humor glad you can laugh at times like this but you maybe better listen to what im saying i intend to break that woman one way or another i dont care how i do it tommy am i saying this the marshals huge assistant recited i dont hear you saying anything beside pellam the skinny cop the silent one examined some kids opening a hydrant he didnt seem to hear anything either lomax said i am gonna stop this fucking psycho and youre in a position to make it easier on washington and save a lot of innocent people in the process you can talk to her you can ah ah ah dont say a word mr lucky tell him what happened this morning tony fire on the eighth avenue subway lomax was looking at pellam again how many injured tony the assistant recited sixteen how bad real bad boss four critical ones not expected to live lomax looked at the sidewalk said to the driver go the back way i dont wanna be seen they were all very grim these men two of them outweighing pellam by fifty pounds at least and it was starting to occur to pellam that while they might not shoot him they could beat the crap out of him theyd probably even enjoy it and break the fortythousanddollar camera that wasnt his you know what we call an easy case one with witnesses and solid evidence lomax asked a grounder offered tony lomax continued leaning close to pellam you know what we call a case we cant figure out a balk pellam tried we call it a mystery mr lucky well thats what we got here a big fucking mystery we know the lady hired this guy but we cant find any fucking leads and i just dont know what to do about it so i dont have any choice all i can think of is to start hitting that old lady hard am i saying this tony youre not saying anything and if that doesnt work mr lucky then im going to start hitting you hard me you you were at the building around the time of the fire like you were supposed to be an alibi for the old lady now youre walking around talking to witnesses with that big dick of a camera you got youre a mans been around cops i can smell that i think youve seen more of em than youd like you ask me so before i start whaling on her and on you i want a straight answer whats your interest in all this simple you arrested the wrong person getting that to register in your mind thats my interest by destroying evidence intimidating witnesses fucking up the investigation pellam glanced at the man beside him a nebbishy guy the sort youd cast for an accountant or if he had to be a cop one from internal affairs pellam said let me ask you a few questions the marshal grimaced but pellam continued whyd ettie burn down a whole building if shes just got a policy on her apartment because she hired a fucking psycho who couldnt control himself well whyd she need to hire somebody at all why couldnt she fake a grease fire too suspicious but it was suspicious anyway less suspicious than just burning her place besides she didnt know about the insurance fraud database she lost everything in the fire what everything a thousand bucks worth of old furniture and crap pellam said and her fingerprints what about them you think shes going to hire somebody then give the pyro a bottle with her fingerprints on them and isnt it kind of funny that the parts of the bottle with her prints on them dont get melted into bubble gum what should i ask this fellow now tony lomax asked his belabored assistant who thought for a moment before answering then said id wonder how he knew we got her prints on the bottle well lomax raised an eyebrow lucky guess pellam responded true to my name turn here lomax said to the driver the car skidded around a curve and stopped tony the marshal gave the cue the assistant turned and pellam suddenly found an very large pistol resting on his temple jesus i got more trivia for you pellam us fire marshals arent cops we dont have to worry about pd regs we can carry whatever kind of weapons we want what kind of gun is that youre holding tony this is a magnum i load it with plus p rounds so you can fuck around with innocent people more efficiently pellam asked is that the idea the cop holding the gun drew it back pellam laughed again shaking his head he knew he wasnt going to get hit physical evidence of a beating was the last thing these boys wanted tony looked at lomax who shrugged the gun disappeared into the big mans pocket he and lomax climbed out of the front seat looked away pellam was thinking called their bluff when the skinny man slammed his bony fist wrapped around roll of quarters or nickels into pellams head just a behind the ear an explosion of pain shot through him man christ another blow pellams face bounced off the window outside lomax and tony were examining a pile of trash in the alley nodding before he could lift his hands the skinny man delivered another fierce blow there was a burst of yellow light and more astonishing pain it occurred to him that the bruise and the welt would be virtually impossible to see through his hair so much for evidence the man dropped the roll of coins into his pocket and sat back pellam wiped pain tears from his eyes and turned to the man before he could say anything or haul off and break the mans jaw the door opened and lomax and tony pulled him out dropped him in the alley pellam touched his scalp no blood im not going to forget that lomax forget what tony dragged pellam up the deserted alley no witnesses was all pellam could think lomax escorted them halfway for about thirty feet motioned to tony who pinned pellam to the wall just like hed done in etties hospital room the other day pellam flinched lomax shoved his hands into his pocket he said in a low voice ive been a supervising fire marshal for ten years ive seen lot of pyros before but ive never seen anybody like this guy this is your groundzero asshole hes out of control and its gonna get worse before we get him now are you going to help us she didnt hire him okay if thats the way you want it pellam balled his fists he wasnt going down without a fight theyd arrest him for assault probably but they were going to arrest him anyway it looked like go for tony first try to break his nose then lomax nodded to tony who released pellam the big guy walked back to the car where the skinny man with the coins was reading the post lomax turned to pellam who shifted his weight ready to start slugging it out but the marshal only gestured toward an unmarked gray door go through there and up to the third floor room threethirteen got it whatre you talking about in there he nodded toward the door room threethirteen just do it now get out of my sight you make me sick stepping into the elevator and pressing the disk of oily plastic that said the building was a hospital the same one where hed been treated and where ettie washington had been arrested pellam followed the corridors and found the small room that lomax had directed him to pausing in the doorway he didnt pay any attention to the couple who stood inside he didnt notice the fancy medical equipment he didnt acknowledge the whiteuniformed nurse who looked at him briefly no all john pellam saw was the pile of bandages that was a twelveyearold boy young juan torres the most serious injury in the fire at w thirtysixth street the son of the man who knew jose canseco pellam looked around the room trying to figure out why lomax had sent him here he couldnt figure it out in pellams heart was a balanced pity equal parts for the child and for ettie washington but he wondered were these sorrows exclusive he debated for a difficult moment if ettie washington was guilty then yes they were forget it he told himself shes innocent i know she is wondering again why lomax had directed him here la iglesia the woman said evenly el cura another nurse walked brusquely into the room jostling pellam and continued on without apology she offered the mother a small white cup maybe the woman was sick too at first pellam supposed shed been hurt in the fire but he remembered helping her out the doorway herself behind the fireman who carried her son shed been fine then though now her hands trembled and the two tiny yellow pills spilled from the wax cup and tapped on the floor he realized that something about this room differed from the others hed just walked past what is it something odd was going on here yes thats it the monitor above the bed was silent the tubes had been disconnected from the boys arm the chart had been removed from a hook welded to the bedframe cura pellam had a southern californians grasp of spanish he remembered that the word meant priest the child had died this was what lomax wanted him to see the boys mother ignored the dropped pills and leaned against her companion he turned his head covered with tight shortshorn curls and looked at pellam my daddy he knows jose canseco no no no really he does the nurse again walked past pellam this time uttering a soft excuse me then the room was silent or almost so the only sound was white noise an indistinct hiss like the soundtrack on the tape of otis balm in his death pose or the tape of etties empty armchair after she rose to answer the door in the last scenes he shot of her pellam remained frozen in the center of the room unable to offers words of condolence unable to observe or to analyze it was some moments later that he finally realized the other implications of this silent event that the charge against ettie washington would now be murder twelve business was brisk at new york state supreme court criminal term john pellam sat in the back of the grubby crowded courtroom beside nick flanagan the bail bondsman louis bailey had hired round worldweary man with grime under his nails and a rapidfire mind that could figure various percentages of bail faster than pellam could use a calculator after the boys death bailey had revised his estimate of the bail upward to a hundred thousand dollars according to the usual bond arrangements ettie would have to come up with cash or securities worth ten percent of that flanagan agreed to post on five and a half percent he did this grudgingly revealing either his nature or more likely some vast resented debt owed to bailey that this was in small part repaying ettie washington would contribute her savings to the cash deposit nine hundred dollars bailey had arranged through one of his faceless street contacts to borrow the rest ettie wouldnt let pellam put up one penny not that he had much to contribute pellam was impressed with the dealings bailey had orchestrated but he wondered if the lawyers skills in a courtroom would be equal to his sleight of hand in bars clerks offices and filing departments bailey had also received the handwriting report and the news wasnt good etties bouts of bursitis and arthritis made her handwriting very inconsistent the signature on the insurance application was according to the report more probably than not that of subject washington pellam examined the assistant district attorney lois koepel a young woman with a sharp jaw small mouth and a tangle of very unlawyerly hair she seemed selfassured brittle and far too young to be handling a murder case the clerk muttered people of the state of new york versus etta wilkes washington bailey and at his urging ettie stood his eyes were up hers downcast the elderly judge reclined along the bench in boredom his fingertips supporting his temple which was disfigured by a prominent vein visible even from the back of the courtroom the ada said weve amended your honor the judge glanced down at the young woman the boy died correct your honor not a single s in the sentence and she still managed to sound extremely shrill the judge scanned papers ms washington he droned youre charged with murder in the second degree manslaughter in the first degree criminally negligent homicide arson in the first degree arson in the second degree assault in the first degree criminal mischief in the first degree and criminal mischief in the second degree do you understand these charges startling the first several rows of spectators ettie washington called out firmly i didnt kill anybody i didnt do it the adas groundglass voice snapped your honor the judge waved her silent mrs washington youve had the charges explained to you have you not yessir how do you plead to each of these charges without prompting she said not guilty your honor all right what is the state seeking for bail your honor the people request ms washington be held without bail in this case bailey grumbled your honor my client is a seventytwoyearold woman with no resources no passport and severe injuries she isnt going anywhere the ada droned she is charged with murder and arson i wouldnt kill that boy ettie shouted never never counsel will instruct his client the judge roused himself from his boredom long enough to deliver this lethargic command the ada continued we have here a woman accused of a very elaborate scheme to defraud an insurance company involving premeditation and the hiring of a professional arsonist do you have that suspect in custody we do not your honor this is the man we believe to be responsible for a series of other fires around the city resulting in a number of deaths and serious injuries it seems hes on some kind of rampage im sure your honors read about it in the paper those fires yes sir your honor bailey said sounding appalled quiet counselor the judges brow furrowed the most emotion hed displayed so far weve had three fires in two days the most recent was a subway and i just heard a report before coming to your honors courtroom that there was another one bailey turned slowly and glanced at pellam another fire koepel continued at a department store on eighth avenue what happened the judge asked the ada continued that homemade napalm again your honor in a womens clothing department a clerk just happened to be standing by a fire extinguisher station in the store when it started she put it out before it did much damage but it couldve been a real tragedy the ada fell out of character she sounded exasperated as she said judge the police just dont know what to do they cant find this perp there are no witnesses these fires just keep appearing and frankly its got everybody on the west side scared as hell your honor bailey said in the voice of a melodramatic stage actor this is the most rampant form of speculation why the month is august its been hot peoples tempers are flaring thank you for the weather report mr bailey whats your point copycat crimes counselor the judge raised an eyebrow at the ada unlikely the mixture he uses in his bombs is unusual its like a fingerprint of this particular arsonist and the press has cooperated in not mentioning the exact substances were sure the same perpetrator is behind them the defendants been completely uncooperative in identifying him and shes uncooperative bailey said echoing pellams thought because she doesnt know who he is this is as i was saying very elaborate scheme to perpetrate a vicious crime resulting in a childs death and in light of her prior fraud conviction we what the lawyer asked are you objecting mr bailey no your honor im not objecting because if youre objecting its misplaced theres no jury here there are no evidentiary issues im not objecting what prior conviction he glanced at a mute ettie whose eyes were downcast pellam was sitting forward well ms washingtons felony conviction for fraud and extortion six years ago arson was threatened in that case too your honor she has a record an arson threat pellams memory fastforwarded through his many conversations with ettie this had never come up on the tapes not even a hint his thumb and forefinger rubbed together heatedly baileys head turned to ettie but her eyes remained downcast this is the first ive heard of it your honor he whispered something to ettie who shook her head and said nothing well the ada said thats not the states problem true mr bailey the judge said the vein on his flushed temple seemed to change course he wanted to move on to the other cases on his calendar your knowledge of your clients history is hardly relevant can we wrap this up on the motion koepel hissed the people request the suspect be held without bail the judge reclined in his tall black chair bail denied he banged the gavel with a sound like gunshot we got outflanked louis bailey stood beside pellam on the sidewalk beside the criminal courts building an odd smell sour filled the hot august air the lawyer gazed down absently at his feet his navy blue sock sported a hole but the green one looked almost new i shouldve seen it coming the ada pulled a fast one she kept requesting a delay in the arraignment she hinted that if i agreed shed be more likely to go along with a bail reduction pellam was nodding a technical legal strategy called lying ah thats old news but the sick thing is that she was just delaying until the boy died put her in a better spot to ask for a nobail order our public servants pellam thought god bless em he asked you didnt know about her conviction no she never mentioned it news to me too how bad is it well they cant use it in her trial unless she takes the stand and i wont let her do that but its just troubling pellam muttered bailey sought a better word but settled for echoing troubling they each looked at the blackandgray county court building across the street their gazes took in a somber discussion between a keenfaced darksuited lawyer and his dumpling of a gloomy client as it happened pellams eyes were fixed on the lawyer baileys the man he represented two bailiffs sat down near them and began eating cold noodles with sesame paste the courthouse was three blocks from chinatown that was the smell pellam understood overused vegetable oil im worried about her louis can you get her into protective custody nobodys doing me any favors not until the pyros caught pellam tapped his wallet ive got no connection with the department of corrections if i can do anything itll have to be the oldfashioned way a noticed motion order to show cause can you do that i dont think theyll buy it but i can try his eyes watched a huge cluster of pigeons in a frenzy over a scrap of hotdog bun a businessman had thrown onto the ground level with me bailey said pellam cocked an eyebrow the bail situation threw you didnt it you were pretty upset i dont want her to spend any more time in jail pellam said i dont either but its not the end of the world after a moment he asked what exactly is this all about what bailey said im asking whatre you doing here pellam shes an innocent woman in jail bailey said sore say twenty percent of the people in there he nodded toward the detention center thats old news too whyre you playing detective whats your stake in this whole thing pellam looked out over busy centre street courthouses government buildings justice at work he thought of an ant farm finally he said if she goes to jail my films worthless three months of work down the tubes and ill end up probably thirty forty thousand in hock the lawyer nodded pellam supposed that this commercial motive wouldnt sit too well with bailey who may have been a worldly geargreaser but was also a friend of etties but that was all pellam was willing to say to the lawyer on the subject bailey said ill get started on the protective custody order you want to come back to the office cant ive got to meet somebody about the case who the worst man in the city of new york seven men stared silently at him tshirts dusty with cigarette ash long hair dark from dirt and sweat black crescents under fingernails in need of a trim pellam thought of a word from his adolescence word thatd been used to describe the blackleatherjacket element at walt whitman high in simmons new york greasers a young woman sat on one mans lap he had a long bony face and gangly arms he swatted the girl on her taut butt and she scooted off with a resentful scowl but she snagged her purse and left quickly pellam glanced at each of the seven they all stared back though only one slightly built curlyhaired resembling a monkey returned his gaze with anything that resembled a flicker of sobriety and intelligence pellam had already decided not to go through the pretense of ordering anything at the bar he knew there was only one way to handle this and he asked the longfaced man youre jimmy corcoran of all the things the man mightve said he offered none of them and surprised pellam by asking youre irish he was as a matter of fact on his fathers side but how could corcoran tell he believed his other side was more prominent a hybrid traceable so the family legend went to wild bill hickok the gunfighter turned federal marshal it included dutch and english and arapahoe or sioux some pellam told him yeah yeah thought i could see it id like to talk to you on the table he saw seven shot glasses and a forest of tallnecked beer bottles too many to count corcoran nodded gestured at an empty table in the corner of the bar pellam glanced at the bartender man who had that rare talent of being able to look over an entire room and not see a single person in it youre not a cop corcoran said sitting down this wasnt a question i can tell its like a sixth sense for me no im not corcoran called out bushy a moment later a bottle of bushmills and two glasses appeared in the far corner of the bar six large hands groped for beers and six voices resumed a heated conversation of which pellam could hear nothing corcoran poured two glasses the men tapped them together a dull sound and they tossed back the liquor so youre the man from hollywood the moviemaker the word of course had gotten around corcoran grinned and tossed back another drink he thumped the tabletop with his monstrously large hands little finger and thumb extended as if playing a bodhran drum keeping excellent rhythm so where are you from he asked the east village i where in ireland you from he said i was born here pellam told him my father was from dublin corcoran halted the percussion he gave an exaggerated frown im from londonderry you know what that makes us you and me mortal enemies so if you know who i m then you know what i want mortal enemies youre quick aint you well i dont know exactly what you want alls i know is youre making a movie here the word is pellam said you know everything about the kitchen a heavy dulllooking man gazed at pellam belligerently from the corner table a black plastic pistol grip protruded from his belt and he kneaded it with fat fingers pellam said i know you run a gang laughter from the table a gang corcoran repeated or is it a club no its a gang we dont mind saying it do we boys yo jimmy was the only response corcoran busied himself with a metal tin then extracteded a wad of copenhagen and shoved it into his mouth further altering the eerie almost deformed shape of his equine face tell me what do you think of the kitchen he asked pellam in all his months here no one of the thirty or so people hed interviewed had ever asked pellam his opinion of the neighborhood he thought for a moment and said its the only hood ive ever seen thats getting better safer cleaner and the oldtimers here dont want any goddamn part of that corcoran nodded with approval smiling thats fucking good the table got another spanking and he poured two more shots have some more poteen he looked out the window and his bony face grew wistful thats good man the kitchen aint what it used to be thats for certain my father he come over the water was in the forties coming over the water thats what they called it had a hell of a time getting work the docks was the place to work then now its just a fucking tourist thing but back then the big shipsd come in cargo and passengers only to get a job you had to pay the bosses i mean payoff big my pa he couldnt get it up to get a job in the union so he worked day labor he was always talking about the troubles about belfast and londonderry into all that stuff the politics you know that dont interest me your pa was he a sinn feiner republican or was he a loyalist i have no idea how do you feel about independence im all for it i stay away from ninetofive jobs corcoran laughed i went to kilmainhan jail one time you know where that is where hanged the rebels of the easter rebellion it was you know weird being there walking on the same stones they walked on i cried i dont mind admitting it neither corcoran smiled wanly shook his head he sipped his liquor then scooted back slightly in the chair it was pure instinct that saved pellams wrists corcoran leapt to his feet grabbed a chair and brought it down on the tabletop in a hissing arc just as pellam shoved himself back into the wall you fucker he screamed cocksucking fucker he slammed the chair into the table again the legs met the oak tabletop and cracked with a noise loud as twin gunshots fragments of glass and a mist of smoky whisky showered through the air you come here to my home to spy on me his words were lost in a stew of rage you want my fucking secrets you fucking tinker pellam crossed his arms didnt move gazed calmly back into corcorans eyes aw jimmy come on a voice from the corner called it was the man pellam had noticed when he walked in the smallest of the crew monkey man jimmy its the liquor talking the man offered look mister maybe you better another started to say but corcoran didnt even notice them you come into my fucking home into my neighborhood and ask questions about me i heard what you was doing i know i know everything you think i dont what kind of stupid asshole are you its fuckers like you thatve ruined this place you took the kitchen away we was here first all you fuckers come with your cameras and look at us like fucking insects pellam stood up dusted glass off his shirt corcoran broke the remaining legs on the chair with another fierce blow he leaned forward and screamed what gives you the right he didnt mean nothing jimmy monkey man said calmly im sure he didnt hes just asking a few questionss all hes doing what gives him the right corcoran shrieked he tossed another chair across the room the bartender found more glasses that desperately needed polishing have a drink jimmy someone said just be cool dont any of you cocksucking tinkers say a fucking word the gun appeared in corcorans hand like a black snake striking the table fell silent no one moved it was as if their bodies were somehow wired to the trigger hey jimmy come on monkey man whispered sit yourself down now lets not do nothing stupid corcoran found a glass on the floor walked to the bar and snagged a new bottle he slammed it down in front of pellam poured it to the brim with bushmills enraged he snarled hes going to take a drink with me and hes going to apologize if he does that ill let him go pellam lifted his hands smiled pleasantly to the bartender okay but make it a soda just like in shane alan ladd orders a soda pop for joey pellam had loved that movie hed seen it twenty times in school his friends wanted to be mickey mantle pellam dreamed of being the director george stevens soda corcoran whispered pepsi no make it a diet pepsi the bartender stepped toward his refrigerator corcoran spun lifting the gun toward the terrified man dont you fucking dare this faggots drinking whisky and hes all a blur leather spun through the air and suddenly corcoran was on the ground face down his right arm extended straight up wrist and pistol twisted in pellams hands damn not bad pellam hadnt been sure he could remember the move but it came back to him just fine from his stuntman days when he was doing battle gags on the set of some indochina flick fifteen years ago hed learned a few martial arts tricks from the fight choreographer pellam lifted the gun from the irishmans grip and pointed it toward each of the six frozen thugs he didnt let go of corcorans wrist no one moved fucker corcoran wheezed pellam twisted harder oh shit youre dead man youre a little harder all right fucker all right pellam released the wrist and pressed the muzzle of the gun against corcorans forehead pellam said what a mouth you got on you king of the kitchen huh you know everything then you know i was gonna offer you five hundred bucks to find out who torched that building on thirtysixth street thats what i was doing here and what do i get a pissing contest with a teenager who needs a bath he pointed the gun at monkey man who raised his hands pellam asked him would you please get me that pepsi now the man hesitated then walked to the bar the bartender had materialized again and his corporeal form looked on the verge of death he stared at redfaced corcoran who raged get him the fucking drink you asshole in a quavering voice the bartender said i uhm the thing is we dont have a cokell be fine pellam said pointing the smith wesson at the fat man at the table just toss that piece on the floor would you do it corcoran grumbled the gun hit the floor pellam kicked it into the corner the bartender asked in a trembling voice was that diet you wanted sir whatever yessir the bartender opened the can nearly dropped it with steady hands monkey man poured the soda into a glass and carried it to pellam thank you he drank it down and set the empty glass on the table backed toward the door wiped his face with a napkin the man had provided as well corcoran rose to his feet and turning his back to pellam returned to the table the lanky irishman sat down again snagged a bud and began talking a mile a minute cheerful as could be he banged the beer bottle to punctuate for emphasis lecturing colorfully about the easter rebellion and the black n tans and the hunger strike of as if in his mind pellam was already gone pellam unloaded the gun tossed the bullets into the ice tray under the bar and the gun into the corner with the other one then stepped outside into a truly blistering heat thinking august in new york city man thirteen standing in the ugly concrete park across the street from the javits center wondering if the man would show or not or more to the point pellam reflected if he does show will he shoot me he studied this part of hells kitchen where even the blaring sun couldnt mute the bleakness here in the valley between the javits center and the towering gray aircraft carrier the intrepid converted into a floating war museum the blocks were stubbly lots and onestory buildings long abandoned or burntout a graveyard of chopped cars razorwiretopped fences weeds old boilers and factory machinery melting into rust after ten minutes of hypnotically studying the boat and barge river traffic on the hudson he heard a cheerful voice call out hey you crazy fuck well the man had showed and no gunshots so far the man was walking toward him through heat ripples rising from the concrete despite the temperature he still wore the long black leather jacket and he still looked like a monkey he slipped the cigarette he held into his mouth and muttered jacko drugh john pellam they shook hands you got some balls pellam giving me the high sign right under jimmy cs nose he said this with the boisterousness of a born loser drugh was exactly the sort of fish hed gone trolling for at the bar and grill his point in going there wasnt to get information from jimmy corcoran who was exactly the petty little weasel hed expected if somewhat more psychotic no hed been after a snitch you looked like somebody i could trust read buy ah sure jackos somebody you can trust to point my man up to a point pellam offered a slight smile and slipped him the five hundred the amount theyd agreed to when pellam announced it in the bar and drugh had handed him a soggy napkin with the name of this park on it when hed brought pellam the soft drink drugh didnt look at the money he shoved the wad into his pocket with the air of someone whos rarely if ever cheated so your boss is he going to try to kill me pellam asked dont know do i any other time youd already be swimming in hell gate in four different glad bags but lately the old jcs playing stuff close to his chest he dont do mucha the wild stuff no more which i dont know why thought it was a woman at first but jimmy dont usually go nuts over pussy least not rumpbunny like that katie you seen him with so i dunno maybe hell forget about you hope so for your sake if he wants you dead youll be dead and theres nothing you can do bout it i mean you could leave the state but thats all they sat on a bench the heat made his back itch fiercely pellam sat forward drugh finished his cigarette and lit another pellam stroked so youre the one really in charge right drugh shrugged some of the time youre a lot cooler than he is the downward glance and smile bespoke considerable mutiny in the ranks pellam guessed that either drugh or corcoran would be dead within six months pellam decided the smart money was on corcoran as survivor we dont got things like capos and shit you know but im number two yeah and i stand in for jimmy a lot specially when he loses his head his brothers a lightweight the elevator dont stop at every floor reflecting drugh added but im careful i know the line see jimmys crazy fuck a lot of the time but when hes not he looks out for his people and hes got a fuck of a lot of friends drugh looked him over you dont got an accent you didnt come over no i was born here you know the emerald underground no see somebody comes over from ireland and theres this you know network of people look out for em till they get on their feet jimmy he does a lot for em hes got em job lined up and an apartment fore theyre outa customs at jfk men in construction girls in bars or restaurants making good money too he arranges marriages for the card loans people money keeping some for himself oh jimmys a businessman isnt he drugh was gazing at the black javits center functional and boxy as if it were still in a packing crate he laughed it became a cough and as if this reminded him it was time for another cigarette he lit one you really making a movie yep i never knowed anybody done that before i like movies you see state of grace sean penn and gary oldman ed harris good movie it was about us he said proudly which one played you pellam asked joking the movie had been about a gang in hells kitchen but it was

drugh squinted youngold eyes and stared at the flat plain of the jersey horizon you listen to jacko its ramirez did it hector el spico guarantee it but his aunt lived there aw she was probably gonna

them using your life and not asking you bout it i mean fuck i didnt wanta be the star or nothing i just wanted to be in the fucking movie id be good i know i would pellam made sure not to smile as he said if we ever get to casting ill call you jacko you bet ettie washington stared out the window of the womens detention center it was high above her head and the glass was so filthy you couldnt see through it but the light was comforting she was thinking back to eddie doyle remembering how much the two of them liked to be outside walking around the neighborhood saying hi to their neighbors her second husband harold washington didnt like being indoors either though he was a sitting kind of man the two of them when he was home and more or less sober would sit on the steps and share a bottle but living by herself ettie had discovered the pleasure of a good rocking chair and a window a joy that now seemed to be gone forever mistakes she was thinking of mistakes shed made throughout her life and secrets and lies some serious and some not so how slightly bad things you did grew into very bad things how the good things you tried to do faded away like smoke and she was thinking of pellams face when that bitch in court told everybody about her conviction would he ever come to visit her again she wondered she guessed not why should he oh this thought cut her deeply but what she felt was pain not surprise shed known all along that hed be vanishing from her life he was a man and men left didnt matter if they were fathers or brothers or husbands men left footsteps sounded behind her mother hatake imaham cooed how you feeling you feeling good ettie turned around several of the prisoners were standing behind the large woman they all approached slowly six others stood at the far end of the cell looking out into the corridor ettie couldnt figure out why they were in a line like that then she realized they were blocking the guards view of the cell a cold feeling pierced her it was just like the feeling that sliced through her when the two policemen showed up at her door and asked grimfaced if her son was billy washington could they come inside there was something they had to tell her hatake continued in a calm voice you feeling good im okay ettie said looking uneasily from one woman to another bet you feeling better than that boy mother what boy that little boy you killed juan torres i didnt do it ettie whispered she drew back against the wall no i didnt do it she looked again toward the door but she was completely hidden by the line of women i know you done it bitch you kill that little boy i didnt an eye for an eye the large woman stepped closer she had a cigarette lighter in her hand the woman next to her dannette had one too where had they gotten those then understood dannette had purposely gotten arrested again and smuggled in the lighters hatake stepped close ettie shrank away then suddenly lunged forward swinging her cast into hatakes face it connected with her nose loud thud the woman screeched and fell back the other women gasped no one moved for a moment then ettie took a deep breath to scream for help and found herself tasting sour cloth someone had come up behind her and flipped the gag over her face hatake was on her feet wiping blood from her nose smiling cruelly okay mother okay she nodded to dannette who lit a cigarette and tossed it onto etties shift she tried to kick it off but two other women held her down she couldnt move the ember began to burn through the dress hatake said you shouldnt be smokin in here gainst the rules mother an accidents happen them lighters they spill sometimes get that stuff inside that gas all over you burn up yo hair burn up you face sometime it kill you sometime it dont hatake stepped closer and ettie felt the icy spray of the butane on her scalp and cheek she closed her eyes trying to twist away from the women who held her lemme hatake snapped snatching the lighter out of dannettes hands she muttered something else but ettie couldnt hear it over her own squealing and muttered pleas there was a snap and a hiss and the huge woman walked closer and closer holding the lighter like a beacon fourteen a star can make a movie open open the classic revered hollywood verb defined as to make enough people plunk down their hardearned bucks on opening weekend so film company execs dont have to spend all monday thinking up excuses for their wives mistresses bosses and daily variety reporters to explain why theyve just spent millions of other peoples dollars to make a flop bankable stars can make a movie open so can a dropdead story line nowadays even special effects can do it particularly if they involve explosions but nothing in the universe can make a documentary open documentaries might be enlightening or touching or inspiring they can represent the highest form of moviemaking art but they dont do what people go to feature films for to escape from their lives to enjoy themselves for a few hours walking through downtown manhattan toward the sooty carnival of the courts and prisons pellam was reflecting he had directed four independent films all of them cult classics two of them ward winners he had degrees in film making from nyu and ucla hed written dozens of articles for cineaste and independent film monthly and he could recite the dialog from most of hitchcocks films his credentials were impeccable of the eighteen studios and production companies hed approached with the idea for this documentary all had rejected him oh everyone had been full of praise and enthusiasm for west of eighth an oral history of hells kitchen but not a single dollar from big studio was forthcoming to back it as hed pitched the idea he explained that the neighborhood offered a wonderful mix of crime heroism corruption beauty those are all capitalized words pellam a friend a vp for development at warner brothers had told him capitalized words do not good movies make only alan lefkowitz had expressed any interest and he didnt have the foggiest notion what the film was about still pellam had great hopes for the flick and believed it had a shot at an oscar confidence founded largely on an encounter that had occurred on west thirtysixth street last june excuse me hed asked you live in this building yes i do young man the elderly black woman had answered eyes confident amused not wary hed looked up and down the street this is the last tenement on this block used to be nothing but tenements place i lived in for forty years was right there see that vacant lot there i lived here for lessee five years or so how about that almost half a century on the same block goddamn thats a scary thought your family lived in the neighborhood all your life the woman had set down the thin plastic grocery bag containing two cans two oranges and a half gallon jug of wine you bet i have my grandpa ledbetter came up from raleigh in his train it came in at ten at night and he walked out of the station and saw these boys dozens of em in a alley and said lord why aint you home and they said whatre you talking this is our home go on with you old man he felt so bad for those boys sleeping outside was called carrying the banner and thousands of children had to do it they had no home otherwise shed spoken without a trace of accent a deep melodious voice a singers voice as he would later learn was it a nice building pellam had asked gazing at the vacant lot overgrown with weeds where apparently the womans old tenement had once stood where i lived that old thing shed laughed falling down ugly you know something interesting though i thought it was interesting anyway when they tore it down there was a big crowd of people came to complain you know protestor sorts dont take our homes they were yelling dont take our homes course i didnt recognize most of em from the neighborhood i think they were students come down from morningside heights or the village cause they smelled a good protest get the picture those sorts anyway whod i meet but a woman i knew long long time ago many years she was close to ninety then been married to a man much older run a livery stable and sold horses to the army hells kitchen used to be the stable of new york still have the hansom cab stables here anyway this woman shed been born in that very building they were tearing down ineeda jones not anita like youre thinking ineeda like i need a that was a southern name a carolina name she was up in harlem for years then she came back to the kitchen and was poor as me cradle to grave cradle to grave say mister i dont take any offense but what exactlyre you smiling at can i ask your name im ettie washington well ms washington my names john pellam howd you like to be in a movie a movie hell say why dont you come on upstairs have some wine the interviews had begun the next week pellam would climb the six flights to her apartment and turn on the recorder and let ettie washington talk and talk she did about her family her childhood her life age six sitting on a scrap of purloined sears roebuck carpet beside a window listening to her mother and grandmother swap stories about turnofthecentury hells kitchen owney madden the gophers the most notorious gang in the city my grandpa ledbetter he used a lot of slang he heard on the street when he was a young man hed say booly dog for a policeman a flat was a man you could fool like at a card game blue ruin was gin and chips was money my brother bend laugh and say grandpa dont nobody use those words no more but he was wrong grandpa always said crib for where you live your home you know and peoplere saying that again nowadays ettie at age ten working her first job sweeping sawdust and wrapping meat in a butcher store age twelve in school numbers easy and words hard but getting mostly as stealing scraps from restaurant bins for lunch classmates vanishing as the need for money edged out the need for learning age fourteen her beloved and feared grandma ledbetter dying as she sat on the couch at etties side one hot sunday afternoon a week before her th birthday age fifteen ettie herself finally leaving school working for twenty cents an hour sharpening knives and chisels in a paperboard factory stropping blades on long speeding bands of leather some of the men gave her extra pennies because she worked hard some would call her back into the stock room and touch her chest and say dont tell one touched her between her legs and before he could say dont tell he received his own knife deep in his thigh he was bandaged up and given the day off with pay ettie was fired age seventeen sneaking into clubs to hear bessie smith on fiftysecond street wasnt much in the way of entertainment in the kitchen but if mama and papa had an extra dollar or two theyd go down to the bowery on the east side where they had what they called museums which werent what you think they were arcades freak shows and varieties and dancers vaudeville for a really good time mama and papad go to marshalls on fiftythird you never heard of that but it was a hotel and nightclub for blacks that was the big time none better ada overton walker sung there will dixon too age thirty eight a decade of cabaret jobs behind her the singing work drying up ettie falling for a handsome irishman billy doyle a charmer a man with apparently a criminal record pellam was still waiting to hear the end of that story age fortytwo the marriage not working she was restless still wanting to sing billy was restless too wanting to succeed looking for his own niche finally he told her he was going off to find a better job and would send for her of course he never returned and that broke her heart all she ever heard from him was a short note that accompanied the nevada divorce decree at fortyfour marrying harold washington who died drunk in the hudson river some years later a good man in many ways a hard worker he still left more debt than seemed fair for a man who never played the horses tape after tape of these stories five hours ten twenty you cant really be interested in all of this can you ettie had asked pellam keep going ettie youre on a roll pellam had told himself to get outside and interview other residents of the infamous neighborhood and he had some of them but ettie washington remained the heart of west of eighth billie doyle the ledbetters the wilkeses the washingtons prohibition the unions gangs epidemics the depression world war two the stockyards the ocean liners apartments landlords ettie was on a roll and the roll never stopped until her arrest for murder and arson now a blistering afternoon a uniformed guard handed john pellam pass and ushered him through the dank halls where the scent of lysol ran neck and neck with that of urine he passed through the metal detector then stepped into the visiting room to wait the detention center was chaotic today shouts in the distance a wailing voice or two me duele la garganta yo bitch estoy enferma yo bitch ima come over there and shut you up fo good five minutes later the green metal door opened with a twonote creak a guard came in glanced at him you here for washington shes not here pellam asked where she was you better go to the second floor is she all right second floor you didnt answer me but the guard was gone he walked through the bleak corridors until he came to the dark alcove where hed been directed it was no less dirty but it was cooler and quieter a guard glanced at his pass and let him through another door he pushed inside and was surprised to see ettie sitting at a table hands clasped together there was a bandage on her face ettie what happened whyre you up here isolation she whispered they were going to kill me who some girls in the cell downstairs they heard about the torres boy dying they fooled me pretty good i thought they were my friends but they were planning all along to kill me louis got some court order or another to move me the guards came just as those girls were about to burn me they sprayed stuff on me and were gonna burn my face john the stuff it hurt my skin howre you feeling now she didnt answer she said oh i never thought that boyd die that gave me a turn oh the poor thing he was such a sweet little one if hed been at his grandmothers like he was supposed to be hed still be live i prayed for him i did and you know me i dont waste any time on religion pellam put his hand on etties good arm he thought about saying he wasnt in any pain or he went quickly but of course he had no idea how much pain the boy had experienced or how quickly hed died finally she glanced at his unsmiling face i saw you in court when you heard bout that time i got myself arrested you want to know about that ill bet what happened remember the time priscilla cabot and me were working at that factory the clothing place they fired you a few years ago it was a desperate time for me john my sisterd been sick and i didnt have any money at all i was beside myself anyway this man priscilla and i worked with we all got laid off together and he had this idea to scare the company so theyd pay us money we figured we were owed it you know hell i went along with em shouldntve didnt really want to but the long and short of it was they called up the owner and said his trucks were going to get wrecked if he didnt pay us we werent really going to do anything at least i wasnt and i didnt know they threatened to burn them i didnt call they did priscilla and this man anyway the boss he agreed but he called the police and we all got arrested and the other two said it was my idea well the police didnt believe i was the ringleader but i did get arrested and i spent some time in jail im not proud of it im pretty ashamed im sorry john i didnt tell you the truth bout that i shouldve theres no reason for you to tell me everything about yourself no john we were friends too i shouldnta lied shoulda told louis too didnt help in court any near them someone laughed hysterically the sound rising higher and higher until it became a faint scream then silence youve got your secrets i do too pellam said ive kept some things from you she looked at him closely city life gives you a quick eye what is it john he was debating something you want to tell me isnt there she asked finally he said manslaughter what i did time for manslaughter her eyes grew still it was a story that he had no interest to tell no desire to relive but he thought it was important to share it with her and tell it he did the story about the star of pellams last feature film the one never completed the four canisters of film were sitting at the moment in his attic back in california central standard time tommy bernstein lovable crazy out of control only six setups left to shoot four secondunit stunt gags a week only a week just give me a little john just to get me through wrap but pellam hadnt given him a little pellam had given him lot and the man had stayed up in his cokeinduced frenzy for two days straight railing laughing drinking puking he died of a heart attack on the set and the city of angels district attorney chose to go after pellam in a big way for supplying the cocaine that caused it he was the guilty party the da claimed and the jury agreed bestowing on pellam conviction and some time in san quentin i am sorry john she laughed isnt that a stitch you me and billy doyle were all three of us jailbirds she squinted again you know who you remind me of my son james pellam had seen pictures of the young man etties oldest son her only child by doyle photographed in his early twenties he was lightskinned doyle had been very pale and handsome lean james had dropped out of school several years ago and gone out west to make money the last word from him was a card saying the young man was going to work in the environmental field that had been over a decade ago the guard glanced at her watch and pellam whispered we dont have much time ive got to ask you a few questions now that insurance policy they claim you bought had your checking account number on it and your signature on it howd somebody get them my checking account well i dont know nobodys got my account number that i know bout have you lost any checks lately no who do you write checks to i dont know i pay my bills like everybody mama put that in me never let em get the edge on you she always said pay on time if youve got the money you written any checks to somebody you wouldnt ordinarily no not that i can think oh wait i had to pay some money to the government few months ago they gave me too much social security by mistake one check had three hundred moren i ought to get i knew about it but i kept it anyway they found out and wanted it back thats what i hired louis for he handled it for me all i had to pay was half what they wanted i gave him check and he sent it to em with this form see the government maybe theyre out to get me john maybe the social security people and the policere working together this manic talk of conspiracies unsettled him but pellam cut her some slack under the circumstances she was entitled to be a little paranoid how bout samples of your handwriting how could somebody get them i dont know have you written any letters lately to somebody you dont normally write letters i cant think of any i write to elizabeth and send cards sometimes to my sisters daughter in fresno send em few dollars on their birthdays thats about it anybody broken into your apartment no i always lock my windows and door im good about that in the kitchen you got to be careful thats the first thing you learn she played with her cast traced pellams signature the answers made sense but they werent compelling to a jury they might be true might be fishy as with so much else about hells kitchen he wasnt sure what to believe pellam slipped his notebook into his pocket and said will you do something for me anything john tell me the end of the billy doyle story which story about his doing time that one yeah okay my poor billy heres what happened i told you all along that his goal in life was to own land for a man with wanderlust he couldnt go past a lot or a building with a forsale sign on it without looking it over and calling up the owner and asking questions about it etties eyes glowed this was where she belonged pellam thought weighing memories and using them to spin her stories he knew the seductive lure of storytelling too he was after all a film director except that her stories were true and she expected nothing in return for them no critical acclaim no percentage of gross you remember i told you about my brother ben he was about billys age a year or two younger ben came to billy and said he had this idea how to get some money for a down payment for some land only he needed a partner to help him well it wasnt an idea at all it was just a scam ben knew some people at a union headquarters and he did some fake contracts and got them slipped in when the bosses werent there ben listened too much to grandpa ledbetters stories about the gophers and the gangs he wanted to be in one real bad even though there werent any black gangs in the kitchen then or now but he was real proud of this scam of his but ben didnt tell my billy about the scam part he thought they were just real contracts for hauling and stuff they were taking a brokers fee on he lived on the edge billy did but he wasnt stupid there mightve been people hed scam but the union wasnt one of them then lemmy collins the longshoremens vicepresident found out there was money missing he thought bend done it he knew billy was tight with ben but he knew an irishman wouldnt steal from his own but a black mand steal from irish without thinking twice so lemmy came to see my brother with two other men from the union and a baseball bat just as they were about to beat him to death they got a call from union headquarters the police had called it seemed that my billyd confessed to the whole thing it was all his idea since the police were involved then lemmy couldnt kill ben even thought he wanted to the union got the money back and billy did a year in jail see he knew being irish and white he could get away with his life if ben had gone down he wouldve died if not in the kitchen then in sing sing he took a rap for somebody pellam said for my own brother ettie said pellam added softly he did that for you you know i know he did ettie was wistful but i think that year changed him i got my brother saved but i think i mightve lost my husband because of it it was a year after he got out that i came home one night and found the note excuse me sir the guard said pleasantly im afraid times up pellam nodded to the guard just one more thing hey mrs washington look up there was a snap and the soft buzz of a small motor she blinked at the flash as pellam took the polaroid whatre you doing there john you dont want to remember me this way lemme fix my hair at least its not for me ettie and dont you worry your hair looks just fine fifteen lefty came through pellam was in his bitchen boots off listening to messages as he sat on the plywood sheet turning the bathtub into a table there was one hangup then another finally alan lefkowitzs mileaminute voice was telling him about a party roger mckennah had planned and that pellam had only to drop leftys name and hed be admitted into the inner sanctum of new york business a line the producer actually recited without noticeable irony pellam however rolled his eyes as he listened to it kicking his foot against the wall to scare off a wiseass pigeon that alighted on his window sill the lengthy message continued with relevant details including the orders to dress for the event an hour later pellam suitably dressed new black jeans and polished nokona cowboy boots strolled out into the suffocating heat and took a subway to the citicorp building from there he walked to an address on fifth avenue and ducked into the revolving door once inside nobody knew that he unlike most of the other guests hadnt arrived via bentley rollsroyce or for the impoverished the stately yacht of a lincoln continental look its another one the woman spoke breathlessly and the crowd on the top floor of the triplex murmured less in horror than appreciation oh man look at that you can see the flames where there see ronnie go see if someones got a camera joan look pellam eased closer to the window six hundred feet above the sidewalk on which cartier tiffany and henri bendel hawked their wares he gazed west another fire he noticed with disgust a building somewhere in hells kitchen north of louis baileys block occasionally youd see a lick of flame shooting through a massive cloud of smoke rising a thousand feet into the milky sky it blossomed like the mushroom of an atomic bomb oh god a woman whispered its the hospital manhattan hospital where he and ettie had been treated he realized where juan torres had died you think its him where is that camera i want to get a snap you know who i mean that crazy man i read about in the times this morning is that the fifth one hes set or the sixth the flames had grown and were now clearly visible no cameras materialized and after five minutes the fire became just another part of the scenery alone or in groups of two or three the guests turned back to the party pellam continued to watch for a few moments the silent ballet of the flames the cloud of gray smoke rising high above manhattan hey how you doing the mans voice was close by riddled with long island lockjaw youre dressed like an artiste are you an artiste pellam turned found himself standing in front of a drunk beefy young man in a tuxedo nope ah quite a place isnt it he gestured his groggy head around the twostory living room in the fifth avenue penthouse triplex rogers little abode in the sky not too shabby at that moment pellam caught sight of his quarry across the room roger mckennah then the real estate developer was lost in the crowd again you know the story pellams new friend began laughing drunkenly sipped more of his martini the story pellam responded the young man nodded enthusiastically but said nothing more pellam prompted the one about the priest the rabbi and the nun the man frowned shook his head then continued drunkenly and began explaining how the triplex here was latticed with rabbit warrens of rooms mckennah described as dens and parlors and music rooms and entertainment spaces uhhuh pellam said uncertainly looking over the crowd for mckennah once more theyre really just bedrooms see the young man told pellam spilling vodka on his patent leather shoes but therere fifteen of them and the thing is roger mckennah doesnt have a single friend i mean forget fifteen whod be willing to endure him long enough to stay overnight the young man shivered with laughter and drank some more of the alcohol that the butt of his mean joke was providing a blonde in a lowcut red dress cruised past she caught the eyes of both pellam and the young man and suddenly the young man vanished as if he were the tail and she the dog pellam gazed out the window again at the huge plume of smoke in the hour hed been here hed learned a few things about mckennah much of it like the sniping hed just heard none of it particularly helpful the developer was fortyfour stocky but fit his face was a younger puffier robert redfords his net worth was rumored to be two billion pellam had observed that the developer had a kaleidoscope of expressions mckennahs visage flipped from boyish to greedy to demonic to pure ice in a fraction of a second in fact the most telling thing that pellam had learned was that no one really knew much about roger mckennah at all his only conclusion was that the developer had some inexpressible quality that drove guests like these attractive or powerful or obsessed with the attractive or powerful to pray for invitations to his parties where they would drink his liquor and think of clever ways to insult him behind his back he eased closer to mckennah who had moved on and was cruising slowly through the crowded room a young couple doubleteamed the developer by the beluga table nice roger the husband said looking around very nice know what this room reminds me of that place in cap dantibes on the point lhermitage thats where beth and i always stay you know it the woman presumably beth asked mckennah its so wonderful the developer demurred with a faint pout fraid i dont he said to their delight then he added when im over there i usually stay with the prince in monaco its just easier you know i hear you the husband said hearing nothing really the couple pasted glazed smiles on their faces evidence of how snugly their hearts had been nailed by the chubby roger mckennah the substantial crowd milled and hovered over the tables filled with caviar like black snowdrifts and sushi like white jewels while a tuxedoed pianist played fats waller but he didnt go to choate pellam overheard someone whisper read it carefully he gives them money he lectures there but he didnt go there he went to some parochial school on the west side in his old neighborhood hells kitchen pellam asked breaking into the circle thats it yes responded the woman whose facelift was remarkably good so mckennah was a kitchen pup himself it mustve taken years to polish off the rough edges then suddenly pellam himself became the prey the crowd had momentarily parted like the red sea and mckennah was staring directly at him fifty feet away a memory came back to pellam the limousine in front of etties building it had probably been mckennahs but the developer gave no greeting and as the crowd swept back together mckennah turned and stepped into a cluster of guests and turned his attention on them like klieg lights on a movie set then the developer was moving again on stage always questioning poking probing ambitions a bitch aint it he was about to follow when from behind him a womans voice said in a very northeastern accent howdy partner pellam turned to see an attractive blonde woman in her forties holding a champagne flute her eyes were faded but not from drinking merely from exhaustion with a sequined shoe she tapped pellams boot explaining the greeting hi he said her eyes flitted to mckennah pellam followed her gaze she said which one im sorry pellam asked you a betting man he said to paraphrase mark twain there are only two times a man shouldnt gamble one when he cant afford to lose money and two when he can that didnt answer my question yep im a gambling man pellam said you see those two women the brunette and the redhead pellam spotted them easily they stood by the sweeping staircase chatting with mckennah both in their late twenties good figures attractive the redhead was by far the sexier and more voluptuous the brunette had a colder face and she seemed distracted almost bored in about five minutes rogerll disappear upstairs thats where the bedrooms are five minutes after that one of those women will follow which one do you think itll be does he know either of them probably not you on pellam studied the redhead the extreme v of her neckline revealing the upper slope of white breasts hair tumbling around her shoulders a seductive smile and freckles pellam loved freckles the redhead he said thinking eight months eight months eight goddamn months the woman laughed youre wrong whatre we betting a glass of our hosts champagne as mark twain also said its always better to gamble with somebody elses money than your own they tapped glasses her name was jolie and it seemed that she was unaccompanied he followed her to the window in the corner of the room where it was quieter youre john pellam he gave a perplexed smile i heard somebody mention your name who he wondered it didnt seem likely that the word on the streets of hells kitchen would rise all the way into this stratosphere i saw one of your films she said about an alchemist it was very good i cant say i completely understood it but thats a compliment is it he asked looking at her steady green eyes she continued think about kubricks its not a very good movie so why did it endure the blue danube with the space ship anybody couldve thought of that the monkeys beating each other up no special effects of course not it was the ending nobody knew what the hell it was about we forget the obvious we remember the uncertain he laughed i do love my ambiguity pellam said eyes on mckennah so okay ill consider it a compliment are you making a film here yes he answered across the room mckennah glanced around trying to look casual then trotted up the stairs maybe he was just going to take a pee pellam thought they hadnt considered the contingency of a draw pellam didnt care he was enjoying her company jolie had a vshaped neckline that held its own with the redheads very admirably pellam even thought he saw a few freckles where the white flesh disappeared beneath black sequins whats it about jolie asked your new film its not a feature its a documentary about hells kitchen that fires an interesting metaphor isnt it she nodded out the window there was a faint smile on her face itd be a good motif for your film she added cryptically whatever its really about how do you know mckennah he asked then the words registered really about across the room the sullen brunette stubbed out a cigarette and lifting her slinky skirt a few inches looked around discreetly she climbed the stairs in the tracks of the developer good guess pellam said wasnt a guess jolie responded i know my husband pretty well now get me the champagne you owe me get one for yourself too then lets go in there and drink it she nodded toward a small den off the main room and smiled as the piano player launched into stormy weather you know one of our cleaning ladies sells what she finds in our trash cans to the government irs sec competitors too im sure roger has fun putting phoney info in the trash along with tampax wrappers and condoms the irs pays for that pellam asked yep so thatd be my tax dollars at work pellam asked you dont really pay tax do you she seemed surprised if you do ill give you the name of my accountant they sat in the teakpaneled den the sounds of the party and the music filtering through the walls pellam picked up a picture of mckennah with his arm around a large mickey mouse a few years ago jolie said entranced by the frantic bubbles in her champagne he was really into euro disney he took a bad hit there i told him it was a bad idea i just couldnt see french people wearing big black ears why are you so cool about what just happened with your husband youre from hollywood i assume you know the difference between being cool and acting cool touché howd you figure the brunette she was the tougher one more of a challenge roger never takes the easy way his office is on the seventieth floor of this building he walks up every one of those flights in the morning quite a view pellam said walking to the floortoceiling windows he gazed out over dusky manhattan jolie pointed out several buildings that bore mckennahs name and several more older ones that she explained were owned or operated by his companies pellam lifted his hands and pressed the cold glass with his fingers because of the faint light in the den his reflection appeared to be an angel floating outside touching pellams fingertips with its own your film its about roger isnt it no its about the old west side then why are you spying on him he said nothing jolie said were getting divorced roger and i pellam continued to stare at the lights of the city was this a setup was she spying on him hollywood made you paranoid for your job hells kitchen your life but he had a vague sense that he should trust her he recalled the look in her eyes when she saw the brunette lift her skirt and start up the stairs pellam had worked with many actresses some of them excellent but very few had enough command of the method to summon up that kind of pain theres talk about you jolie mckennah said in the distance the fire on the west side had been mostly extinguished still you could see a hundred lights from the emergency vehicles flashing like lasers in a tawdry disco did he say anything pellam didnt know whether nodding at the ceiling where mckennah was bedding the tough brunette was appropriate no but he knows about you hes been watching you so why are we here talk to me she sipped then smiled mournfully we never had any secrets roger and i none it got to the point where i even knew his girlfriends bra sizes but then something happened attrition thats good pellam yes exactly little by little things got worn down we havent been in love for a long time oh ages but we were close and we were friends but then that went away that friendship part he began lying to me that broke the rules we decided to get divorced he decided to get divorced she meant and you feel betrayed she considered refuting this but she said yes i felt betrayed he was gazing out the window past his reflection the arson on thirtysixth street some of the men who work for his company were nearby that building just before the fire this got her attention so youre a crusader are you not hardly i just want to know who was behind it i dont think roger would ever do anything like that think he could see she wasnt sure she held the champagne beneath her nose and inhaled you find me attractive yes it was true and had nothing to do with the glacial eight months you want to make love to me another time another place yes i would this satisfied her how fragile is our vanity and how recklessly we wear it for all to crush tell me what youre really after and maybe i can help you and maybe she can cut me off at the knees ah youre hesitating she continued think ill report back to him think im a spy maybe i thought you were a gambling man the stakesre high how much one billion two ten years of an old womans life she hesitated i dont have any power over him anymore not like i did she nodded toward the party but the gesture was aimed like a sniper rifle at all the brunettes and redheads and blondes in the room and ill never get that back hes won hands down in that arena the bedroom our home so i have to hurt him the only way i still can in his business he said that woman i mentioned she was a tenant in the building that burned down shes been arrested for the arson and she didnt do it washingtons her name jolie said i read bout that an insurance scam or something pellam nodded did your husband burn the place down jolie thought for a long moment staring again at the needlepoint bubbles not the old roger no he wouldnt the new roger all i can say is hes become a stranger he doesnt talk to me anymore hes just not the same man i married i will tell you hes been going out a couple times a week at night hes never done that before im mean not without telling me and hes never lied to me about it hell get a phone call then leave you know whos calling i did that star thing on the phone to dial back the call that just came in it was a law firm not one that ive ever heard of before what was the name pillsbury millbank hogue she said pellam heard an edge in the womans otherwise controlled voice it quavered she continued the chauffeur drops him off on ninth avenue and fiftieth he meets someone some man the meetings are secret the chauffeur pellam asked delicately could he be more informative hed be willing to she said but roger makes sure he leaves after he drops him off pellam jotted down the name of the firm and the address she said you know he has good qualities he gives money to charities so presumably do some serial killers at least those who need writeoffs jolie took his glass from the table and sipped it hers was empty pellam said what you just told me could cost him a lot and it could cost you a lot too me the divorce isnt he going to be paying you settlement alimony laughter you dear man why you really do pay taxes dont you lets just say ive looked out for myself whatever happens to roger wont affect me in any fiscal way pellam glanced down at her taut tanned skin eight months a hell of a long time to another time another place she said lifting the glass he remained at the window for a moment gazing at the radiant buildings of manhattan then stepped toward the door while outside reflected in the window pellams angel also turned lowered his ghostly arms and faded into the night above the city fire points up not down fire climbs it doesnt fall sonny gazed at the map the hospital had been a good fire not a great fire too many good citizens were vigilant too many cops too many fire marshals looking and poking everybody ready to dial nineoneone everybody ready to shoot carbon dioxide from extinguishers they all took this so fucking seriously he was distracted too by thoughts of the antichrist cowboy pellam sonny thought he saw him everywhere in shadows in alleys hes after me hes the reason im sweating hes the reason my hands shake sweat poured from sonnys brow and soaked his hair usually the shade of pale citrus the strands today were dark with moisture his breath came fast and occasionally his tongue would protrude like a pink eel and dampen a parched lip a movie theater was next on his list hed debated about whether to burn a faggot porno theater or a regular theater he decided on a regular one first though he needed some more supplies arsonist are lucky because unlike bombers or snipers the tools of their trade are completely legal still they have to be careful and sonny alternated the places where he bought his ingredients never showing up at the same gas station more frequently than once a month or so but manhattan had surprisingly few gas stations they were mostly in jersey or on long island and because he had no car he could only shop at those stations within walking distance of his apartment he was now on his way to the east village to a station he hadnt been to for more than a year it was a long walk and would be an even longer walk back with the five gallons of gas but he was afraid to tempt fate by making a purchase any closer to home he thought about how many jars of his juice hed need for a movie theater just one probably sometimes sonny would crouch for hours outside a building and try to decide how he could burn it down most efficiently he was very thin excruciatingly thin and when he squatted outside grand central station say playing the howmanyjars game people would drop coins at his feet thinking he was homeless and had aids or just thinking that man is so damn thin and all the time hed have a thousand dollars in his pocket be fit as a fiddle and was merely squatting on the curb enjoying his fantasy about razing the baroque station with as few fires as possible grand central would require seven fires hed decided rockefeller center sixteen the empire state building merely four the world trade towers five each those crazy arabs got it all wrong sonny now walked past the gas station nonchalant looking carefully for police or fire marshals hed seen more squad cars patrolling the streets around stations in the last day but here he saw none and returned to the station walking up to the pump furthest from the attendants office he uncapped the can and began to pump the sweet smell brought back many wonderful memories sonny had known from the first hour of his first visit to the city eight years ago that he would live and die here new york how could he live anywhere else the asphalt streets were hot steam flowed like smoke from a thousand manholes buildings burned daily and no one seemed to pay that fact much mind this was the only city in the world where somebody would ignite trashcans and cars and abandoned buildings and passersby would glance at the fire and continue on their way as if flames were just a part of the natural landscape hed come to the city after his release from juvenile detention for a time sonny worked office jobs messenger mail boy xerox operator but for every hour in offices or in his probation counselors office sonny spent two honing his craft working for landlords and real estate developers and even the mafia occasionally gasoline natural gas nitrates naphtha acetone and his precious juice created by sonny himself virtually patented adored by him the way bach loved the keyboard juice fire that kisses human skin and wont let go in his first years living in the city on the west side he wasnt as solitary as he was now hed meet people on the job and he even dated some but hed soon grown bored with people dates became awkward early in the evening and after several hours the only thing they had in common was a persistent desire to be rid of each others company in restaurants he tended to stare at the candles more than his companions eyes in the end sonny proved to be his own best friend he lived alone in small neat apartments he ironed his clothing perfectly balanced his checkbook attended art films and lectures on nineteenthcentury new york watched this old house and educational specials and sitcoms and he lived to watch things burn into exquisite still ash as the gasoline can filled with tender rosy liquid he found himself thinking again about pellam the tall blackclad angel of death the antichrist the moth frying itself to death against the bulb that so attracts him ah pellam isnt it astonishing how our lives have become so entwined like the strands of a wick isnt it odd how fate works that way youre looking for me and im looking for you will you be my mate forever well lie together in a bed of fire well turn into pure light well be immortal three gallons as he glanced at the pump gauge he happened to look past it and he focused on the attendant who was stepping quickly back inside the tiny cashier stand three and a third gallons sonny left the nozzle in the can stepped toward the attendants stand saw the man on the phone he returned to the pump hmm problem here problem what do we do as the three squad cars rolled silently into the station the police officers found sonny standing motionless looking uncertainly toward the attendant station the pump nozzle in his hand problem excuse me sir a cops voice called i wonder if you could hang that pump up and come over here the police climbed out of the cars five of the six cops had their hands on their pistol grips whats the problem officer just hang that up that nozzle okay do it now sure officer sure he shoved the hightest nozzle back into the pump you have some id on you sir i didnt do anything i dont even have a car what do you want to give me ticket for he fished into his pocket just step over here sir and if we could see some id okay sure did i do something wrong sonny didnt move now sir step over here now yessir id be happy to oh christ no a heavily accented voice shouted from behind him sonny was surprised it had taken the station attendant so long to notice the gas the other lines the one turned on sonny smiled when hed seen the police cars in the reflection of the pump hed dropped the open gas hose on the ground and grabbed the hightest hose the one hed dutifully hung up as ordered at least twenty gallons of gas had poured out onto the apron and was flowing toward the cops and their car invisible on the black asphalt in an split second before a single officer could draw his gun sonny had his lighter out he flicked it a small flame burned on the end he crouched down okay mister one cop said holding up his hands just put that down nobodys going to hurt you for a moment no one moved but then in a snap they all knew it was coming maybe sonnys eyes maybe his smile maybe something else gave it away the six cops turned fleeing from the deadly pool sonny was on a dry patch of asphalt though when he touched the flame to the flowing river of gasoline he leapt back fast like a roach the fireball was huge he grabbed the container and fled a huge whoosh as the flames swept under the police cars igniting them the fiery river continued past them flowing down houston street roaring sending a black cloud rolling into the sky screams horns collisions as cars stopped and backed away from the flames sonny got a halfblock away and couldnt help himself he paused and turned to watch the chaos he was at first disappointed that the main tank didnt go up but then he grew philosophical and simply enjoyed the fire for what it was thinking fire is not energy but a creature that lives and grows and reproduces its born and it dies it can outthink anyone fire is the messenger of change the sun is fire and the sun is not even particularly hot fire eats the dirt of men fire is the most blind justice fire points toward god sixteen hey mister you got yourself a famous lawyer working for you he sued the port authority and won you ever hear of anybody suing the city and winning the man sitting at louis baileys desk rose the instant pellam entered the room it was the greenjacket handicapper from yesterday the man with a lock cleg please bailey said selfeffacing and tell him about the time you sued rockefeller cleg the skinny guy seemed to have forgiven pellam for not taking his tip about the horses he said rockefeller stole this guys invention and louis took him to court he caved too louis scared the bejeebers out of him hey sir you look like a cowboy anybody ever tell you that you ever ride broncos what is that exactly bronco i just know about the oj one the white truck i mean its an untamed horse pellam said well how bout that cleg said astonished a handicapper whod just discovered a different kind of horse he took more geargreasing envelopes from bailey and left the office hes quite a fellow was all that pellam could offer you dont know the half of it bailey said ambiguously then he opened that mornings paper slapped it look at this the front page story was about a fire at a gas station in the village thats our boy the pyro pellam asked theyre pretty sure almost got him but he got away seriously injured two cops and three pedestrians almost a million dollars in damage pellam examined the picture of the devastation bailey swallowed a mouthful of wine this is turning into a nightmare theres a public uproar the police department and the attorney general are under incredible pressure to get this guy they think that hes gone nuts like ettie switched him on and he wont shut off now its become a citywide crusade to stop him pellam bent wearily over the paper there was a sidebar that included a map of hells kitchen tiny drawings of flames marked the spots of the fires they were in a pattern it seemed a semicircular shape north of etties building bailey found a slip of paper handed it to pellam thats the insurance agency where ettie got the policy the woman who sold it is a florence epstein whatd she say bailey looked at pellam with a significance that escaped him completely im sorry pellam tried i cant talk to her im etties attorney of record oh i get it but i can bailey sighed well yes but but what you know sometimes well with that black outfit of yours you look a little intimidating and you dont smile a lot ill be charm itself pellam said as long as shes not lying if theres any hint of intimidation do i look like the sort who intimidates bailey was suddenly very uncomfortable and he changed the subject here i went to the library he set some clippings down in front of pellam you went yourself you didnt bribe some librarian to bring them to you ha bailey was too busy wrestling the seal off a new wine bottle to smile some backgrounders about roger mckennah pellam shuffled through the clippings business week offered the best part of the prior decade for mckennah was the late eighties when the market cindered the boom went bust and careers chappaquidicked a popular mckennahism throughout wall street yet that was when he had shone the brightest new york magazine roger mckennah the selfconfessed megalomaniac marched into thirdworld sections of the new york metro area and strewed them with affordable and profitable housing projects he is also credited with revitalizing real estate investment trusts and with prying a good portion of midtown out of foreign hands and returning it to local developers notable for his wit as well as his lifestyle and business acumen it was mckennah who coined the term vulturing spotting deals going bad and grabbing them out from under receivers and trustees from baroquely metaphorical people anyone a trump a zeckendorf a helmsley could ride the crest of prosperity but only a genius like roger mckennah dared answer the call of surfs up when the only place to hang ten was in the tunnel of the wave pellam put the articles aside makes him greedy and smart but hardly an arsonist bailey commented then i better tell you about my date last night the party at his place the caviar was a bit too warm but i had champagne with his wife bailey was delighted fraternizing with the enemy was probably an important technique for gearcloggers and she wants to sink him like the titanic pellam told the lawyer about mckennahs clandestine meetings and the calls to and from the law firm pillsbury millbank bailey asked im pretty sure thats what she said bailey pulled a huge volume of martindale hubbell lawyers directory off his shelf and flipped it open he found a listing of the firm he read carefully nodding i think i can get to somebody there can get pellam was reaching for his wallet not this time ive got another idea oh and ive got more good news something i forgot to tell you a friend of mine has a friend who plays cards with a senior fire marshal theres a poker game tonight and my buddys going to get his buddy to lose big and pour a bottle of macallan scotch very freely well get some inside dope on the case how old how old what bailey asked is the macallan i dont know twelve years probably maybe older im thinking louis pellam said maybe ill do a documentary about you ill call it greasing gears say did you really sue rockefeller oh well yes i did bailey gazed modestly down at his desk then he shrugged but it wasnt one of the rockefellers the footsteps were close behind him and moving in closer pellam spun around his hand slipping into the small of his back where the colt rested heavy and hot against his spine he looked down yo cuz where you been ismail was grinning hands on his scrawny hips

boys dormitory he looked at pellam i come see you its not a prison carol told him you come and go as you like ignoring carol he said to pellam we hang in the hood together cuz id like that ismails dark contracted eyes appraised the dim office okay he muttered but nobody better be dissing me you know what im saying nobodyll dis you here carol said he looked at pellam with eerily adult eyes and said later cuz later he disappeared into the back pushing through the door like a wild west gunfighter carol laughed so whatre you doing out on these mean streets aside from playing social worker she glanced down at her harvard sweatshirt brushed some dust off with her pudgy fingers the gesture made her seem both strong and vulnerable at the same time just walking around looking for camera angles looking for people to talk to you hear anything from alex nothing sorry he hasnt been back nobodys seen him i asked around neither of them said anything for a minute a teenage girl very pregnant walked through the lobby cradling a stuffed barney dinosaur toy in her arms carol poked her glasses up on her nose and exchanged a few words with the girl when she was gone pellam asked the social worker you interested in another cup of politically incorrect coffee a brief hesitation pellam thought she was pleasantly surprised but it might have been something else well sure if youre busy no just let me change give me two minutes i was schlepping boxes around all day she added pologetically shaking dust off her sleeves again no problem she vanished into the backroom a young latino woman appeared nodded to pellam and took over desk duty carol appeared a few moments later a loose green blouse had replaced her sweatshirt and black stretch pants the jeans she wore short black boots instead of the nikes the woman at the desk glanced at the outfit with surprise and muttered a indiscernible response when carol said shed be back later outside she asked you mind if we stop by my apartment its only four blocks i forgot to feed homer this morning cat boa constrictor or boyfriend siamese i named him homer simpson no not the one youre thinking of i was thinking of the character in day of the locust pellam responded well carol said surprised you know it pellam nodded i had my cat first then they came up with that cartoon show on tv and i wished id called him something else pellam felt one those little bursts in the gut when you find someone whos moved by the same obscure work of art as you are pellam had seen day of the locust twelve times and could see it another twelve so carol was a kindred soul donald sutherlands role great film waldo salt wrote the script oh carol said it was a movie i just read the book pellam had never gotten around to the book well they were distant kindred but that was all right too they turned south the rushhour traffic jammed the street the yellow cabs interspersed between the battered trucks and cars horns honked constantly the heat had unleashed tempers like geysers and occasionally one driver turned on another with rageful gestures no one seemed to have the energy though for any physical damage despite the prickly heat the sky was clear and crisp shadows stretched across the street before them two blocks away mckennah tower caught the last of the light and glowed like oiled ebony the sparks fell from the welders flames as if the sunlight was being sheared off by the slabs of black glass did you ever find corcoran she asked we had a chinwag like my mother used to say and you lived to tell about it hes a sensitive person deep down hes just misunderstood carol laughed i dont think he did it pellam said the arson you really think that old womans innocent i do unfortunately one thing ive learned is that innocence isnt always a defense not in the kitchen so im finding they continued slowly along bustling ninth avenue dodging the hoards of workers from the main post office and discount stores and fashion district warehouses and greasyspoon restaurants in la the streets were impassable at rush hour here it was the sidewalks he seemed smart ismail carol said after a moment had spirit its a crying shame its too late for him too late pellam laughed hes only ten way way way too late isnt there a program or something you can get him into carol apparently thought he was kidding and burst out laughing a program nope pellam no program no nothin they stopped in front of a store selling exotic gypsy dresses carol in her fathiding clothes looked wistfully at the outfits on the anorexic mannequins they walked on his fathers dead or gone right dead his mother he called her a cluckhead that means shes a crack addict no other relatives you showed some interest thats why he attached himself to you but you cant give him what he needs nobody can not now impossible hes making gang contacts now hell be jumped in in three years five years from now hell be a street dealer in ten hell be in attica pellam was angered by her cynicism i dont think its that bleak i know how you feel you wanted to let him stay with you right he nodded i used to be optimistic too but you cant take em all in dont even try itll only drive you crazy save the ones you can save the three fouryearolds write off the rest its sad but theres nothing you can do about it forces beyond our control racell be the death of this city i dont know pellam said making this film i see a lot of anger but not angry blacks or whites angry people people who cant pay their bills or get good jobs thats why theyre mad carol shook her head emphatically no youre wrong the irish italian poles west indians latinos they were all despised minorities too at one time but theres one insurmountable difference it may have been in steerage but their ancestors booked passage to the new world they didnt come on slave ships pellam wasnt convinced but he let it go this was her world not his i be his friend he was surprised at how bad he felt about the boy i hear so much rhetoric carol continued angrily ghettocentric fragmented family units what incredible bullshit you hear we dont need buzzwords we need somebody to get the fuck into these neighborhoods and be with the kids and that means getting to them in the nursery by the time theyre ismails age theyre set in concrete she looked at him and her eyes which had grown icy softened sorry sorry you poor guy another lecture the thing is youre an outsider youre entitled to a certain amount of optimism bet youve got a little left though to stay here i mean do what youre doing i really dont think im doing very much oh thats not what your neighbors say what carol laughed pellam tried to remember the name came to him jose garciaalvarez carol shook her head i taped him for my film just last week he spends every afternoon in clinton park shares his wonder bread with a thousand pigeons he said something about you that im a fiesty bitch probably that hes forever grateful you saved his son me he told the story carol had found the sixteenyearold boy strung out and unconscious in a tenement that was just about to be torn down to make way for mckennah tower if she hadnt called the police and medics the teenager mightve been crushed to death by the bulldozers oh him sure i remember that i wouldnt exactly call it heroic she seemed embarrassed yet part of her was pleased he could see she suddenly grabbed pellams arm to stop at a shoe store it was an upscale place doing no business whatsoever joan and david shoes kenneth cole a single pair probably cost a weeks paycheck for most of people walking past the owner was praying for gentrification and couldnt hold out much longer in my next life carol said though whether she was talking about being able to afford the svelte rhinestonestudded black heels she looked at or fit into a dress that would go with them pellam couldnt guess halfway down the street carol asked you married divorced kids nope going with anybody she asked havent been for a while eight months to be precise if you could call a lusty night in a snowbound winnebago going with you he didnt know if he should ask didnt know if he wanted to divorced too they dodged around a hawker in front of a discount cosmetics store yo beeutiful lady we make you mo beeutiful than you already be carol laughed blushing and continued quickly past him a block farther she nodded at a shabby tenement similar to pellams home sweet home she said carol gave a quarter to a panhandler she greeted as ernie they stopped at the deli exchanged a few words with the counterman and walked to the back of the store she held up a can of coffee and a six pack of beer which one she mouthed he pointed to the beer and he could see that that was her choice too not too distant kindred souls her apartment was next door a decrepit walkup with beige and brown paint slapped over dozens of generations of other layers they walked up the stairs he smelled old wood hot wallpaper grease and garlic another firetrap pellam thought in passing on the landing she abruptly halted stopping him on the step below a pause she was debating then she turned their faces were at the same height she kissed him hard his hands slid down her shoulders into the small of her back and he felt the ignition inside him pulled her even closer turiam pog she whispered kissing him hard he laughed and cocked an eyebrow gaelic guess what it means i better not kiss me she said okay and did now what does it mean no no she laughed that is what it means she giggled like a girl and stepped to the door closest to the stairs they kissed again she dug for her keys pellam found himself looking at her and as she bent forward glassesless squinting her bad eyes to open the lock he saw an image of a carol wyandotte very different from the stony hustling times square social worker he saw the sad pearls the sweatshirts an elasticshot cotton bra the fat at her throat that fibertrim would never melt away whose nights were filled with the tube in a room peppered with atlantic monthlys and diet pepsi empties dresser filled with more cotton socks than black pantyhose the archway cookies packages shed automatically tucked out of sight when guests walked into the kitchen a fat persons instinct dont do this for pity pellam thought to himself and in the end he didnt not at all eight months is after all eight months he kissed her hard and when the last deadbolt clicked he pushed the door eagerly open with his booted foot seventeen on the west side of manhattan near the river was a forlorn triangle of a tiny city block that contained seven or eight old buildings to the west where the sun was now setting were vacant weedy lots the highway and beyond the brown hudson river to the east across a cobblestoned street was a low row of apartments gay bar and a bodega in whose window was a display of filthy pastry sliced pork and custard this was the chelsea district of new york the bland harmless cousin of hells kitchen which was just to the north the tricorner building at the northernmost end of the block ended in a sharp prow it was a shabby place to call home but the residents had few complaints about their apartments and they didnt know that there was really only one major problem here building code violation gallons of gasoline fuel oil naphtha and acetone were stored in the basement the explosive force of these liquids was sufficient to level the building and to do so in a particularly unpleasant way this particular apartment was a spartan place and contained minimal furnishings a chair cot two tables and a battered desk covered with tools and rags there was neither an air conditioner nor a fan the tv however was a thirtytwoinch trinitron and it sported a remote control that was ten inches long on this screen at the moment was an mtv music video the sound off sitting immediately in front of the flickering screen which he paid little attention to sonny was slowly braiding his long blond hair without the benefit of a mirror the task was taking him longer than he wanted no damn mirror he thought angrily though the problem really was his shaking hands damn sweaty shaking hands at one point he looked up toward but not really at the tv screen and paused he leaned toward fiftyfive gallon drum filled with acetone and knocked several times listening to the sonar echo of the thump it calmed him somewhat but not enough no one was cooperating the incident at the gas station had scared him and fear was a feeling he wasnt used to arson is the safest crime there is for the perp its anonymous its secretive and most of the evidence is disposed of by gods own accomplice the laws of physics but now people knew what he looked like and on top of that hed heard that that little chicken fag from the building alex had seen him and had tried to deal him to the cops and there were still three more fires to go until the big one he removed the map now tattered from his back pocket he stared at it absently yeah the gas station was bad but the most troubling was the fire at the hospital because it had given him no pleasure fire had always calmed him down but that one hadnt not a bit as hed listened to the screams cocked his head and heard them mix with the rustling roar of the flames his hands had kept trembling his high forehead continued to sweat why he wondered why maybe because it was a small fire maybe because there was only one fire he truly cared about the one that would star him and the faggot joe pellam buck maybe because everybody was after him but he had a feeling there was more to the sweat and agitation than that his heart stuttered a bit more when he thought that he now had to spend even more time stopping his pursuers when he could be planning the big fire rockin and rollin with the antichrist knock ping knock ping like sonar in a submarine movie sonnys head of halfbraided hair leaned against the big drum he thumped it again with a knuckle knock ping a bit calmer now he thought so maybe yes sonny finished braiding his hair and spent a halfhour mixing soap and gas and oil the fumes were very strong as dangerous as the fire the juice produced and he could only work in small batches or else hed pass out when he was finished he took several incandescent light bulbs and put them on the table with a diamondbladed saw he carefully cut through the metal collar where the glass bulb met the screw base he heard the hiss of air filling the vacuum he sawed a wedge out just big enough to let him pour in his magic juice not too full that was the mistake a lot of amateur arsonists made you had to leave a little air in the bulb fire is oxidation like an animal it needs oxygen to live he sealed the vshaped hole with superglue he made three of these special bulbs caressing the smooth glass smooth as the skin on a young mans ass his hands began to tremble again and the sweat poured from his face like water from a shower nozzle sonny stood and paced frantically why cant i calm down why why whywhy his thoughts swirled they were all after him they wanted to kill him stop him tie him down take his fire away from him alex the fire marshal that old faggot lawyer that pellam kept hanging around pellam himself the antichrist why wasnt life ever simple sonny had to lie down on the cot and force himself to imagine what the last fire would be like the big fire that seemed to be the only thing now that relaxed him gave him any pleasure he pictured it a huge space filled with ten twenty thousand people it would be the worst fire in the history of this fiery city worse than triangle shirtwaist on washington square the worker girls trapped inside the sweatshop because the owners didnt want them to use the johns during working hours worse than the crystal palace worse than the general slocum burning in the east river killing over a thousand immigrant women and children on excursion in its aftermath the entire german population of the city too sorrowful to remain in their old neighborhood relocated en masse to yorkville on the upper east side his would outdo them all sonny pictured the flames rolling past him like glowing surf surrounding the masses caressing their toes flames rising to their heels then their ankles oh can you see the exquisite flames can you feel them with these questions in his thoughts he realized he hadnt calmed he realized that hed never be calm again the end was closer than hed thought he crawled into the living room pressed his head against one of the drums knock ping knock ping hed stayed the night pellam had been operating under wellestablished protocol which meant that after theyd wakened at ten last night starving thirsty they went out for omelettes at the empire diner on tenth avenue and then hed taken her back to her apartment where theyd made love once more and lain in bed listening to the sounds of new york at night sirens shouts pops of exhausts or guns which seemed to grow more and more urgent as the night grew later he never even thought of leaving without saying goodbye it was carol who broke the rules when he awoke to homer simpsons loud siamese wail she was gone a moment later the phone rang and through her tinny answering machine speaker he heard carols voice ask if he was still there and explain that shed had to be at work early shed call him later at his apartment he found the phone and snagged it but shed already hung up barefoot in his jeans pellam wandered over the scabby hardwood floors mindful of splinters toward the bathroom thinking that shed sounded pretty brusque on the phone but who could guess what that was about the aftermath of an evening like last nights was wholly unpredictable maybe shed already convinced herself that pellam wasnt going to call her again maybe she was seared with catholic guilt or maybe shed just been sitting across her desk from a hulking eighteenyearold murderer when shed called pellam tested the shower but the water was ice cold pass on that he dressed and stepped out into a gassy clear morning scalding hot took a cab to his place on twelfth street he climbed the steps of his apartment watching two energetic youngsters names razorcut in their hair streak past on skateboards he decided he wanted a bath and a cup of very hot black coffee just sit in the tub and forget arson pyros latino thugs irish gangsters and lovers with enigmatic attitudes climbing the dim stairs slowly thinking of the bath thinking of soapy water the mantra worked he found he could forget it all he could wipe all of hells kitchen out of his mind well almost all everything except for ettie washington he was thinking of all the flights of stairs ettie had climbed over the years shed never lived in an elevator building always walkups she climbed stairs for seven decades carrying her baby sister elizabeth helping grandma ledbetter up and down dim stairwells lugging food for her men until one left her and the other died drunk in the hudsons sooty waters then for her babies and children until they were taken from her or fled the city and then for herself thats a word for us here in the kitchen anonymous lord ignored is more like it nobody pays attention to us anymore you got that al sharpton fellow now hell go to bensonhurst hell go to crown heights and raise some hell and people hear bout it but nobody ever comes to the kitchen even with all the irish here the st paddys day parade doesnt even come over this way thats fine with me i like it nice and private keep the world out whats the world ever done for me answer me that ettie washington had told the glossy eye of pellams betacam that she dreamed of other cities she dreamed of owning stylish hats and gold necklaces and silk dresses she dreamed of being a cabaret singer the rich wife of billy doyle a highfalutin landlord but ettie recognized these hopes as illusions only to be examined from time to time with pleasure or sorrow or disdain then tucked away she didnt expect her life to change she was content here in the kitchen where most people cut their dreams to fit their lives and it seemed so unfair that the woman should have to lose even this minuscule corner shed been backed into breathing deeply he arrived at his own fourthfloor apartment a bath yessir when you live in a camper most of your life baths take on a great importance bubble baths particularly though that was a secret he kept to himself a bath and coffee heaven pellam dug the keys out of his black jeans and walked to the door his eyes narrowed he looked at the lock it was twisted sideways he pushed against the door it was open broken into he thought fleetingly that he ought to turn tail and use the downstairs neighbors phone to call but then his anger grabbed him he kicked the door in the empty rooms gaped his hand went to the switch on the lamp closest to the door oh shit he thought no dont not the light but he clicked it on before he could stop himself eighteen stupid he thought pellam pulled the colt from his waistband dropping into a crouch hitting the light switch had just announced to the burglar that pellam had returned shouldve left it out he remained frozen in the doorway for a long moment listening for footsteps for cocking pistols but he heard nothing making his way slowly through the ransacked apartment he opened closet doors and looked under the bed every conceivable hiding place the burglar was gone he surveyed the damage walking from room to room the discount vcr and tv were still there the betacam and deck too sitting out in plain view even the most lowtech thieves would have guessed the camerad be worth a bundle and when he saw the camera he understood what had happened he felt the shock and dismay like the blast of heat from the fire that destroyed etties building he dropped to his knees ripping open the canvas bag where he kept the master videos of west of eighth no he rummaged through the bag hit eject on the ampex deck attached to the betacam and surveyed the damage two tapes were gone the two most recent the one in the camera and the one containing footage hed shot last week and the week before the tapes whod known about them well practically everyone hed talked to about etties disappearance or whod seen him with the camera ramirez the elusive alex mckennah corcoran hell even ismail and the boys mother carol and louis bailey knew for that matter lomax and the entire fire marshals department probably the whole west side the word on the street faster than the internet who was one question but why was just as interesting had pellam inadvertently taped the pyro himself or maybe the man whod hired him or had there been some evidence hed recorded that had escaped lomax and the investigators he had no answers to these questions and as significant as they were to etties case there was another implication to the missing tapes in feature films all the exposed footage was insured not for the cost of the celluloid itself but for what it cost to shoot and process which could run to thousands of dollars a foot if a daily rough of a feature film is destroyed in a fire the muses may weep but at least the producers recoup their money pellam however hadnt been able to afford film completion insurance for west of eighth he couldnt recall what was on those twenty or so hours but the interviews might very well have been the heart of his film he sat for a moment in a squeaky chair staring out the window then lazily he punched in spoke to a dispatcher but the tone of the womans voice told him that a crime like this was low on the precincts priorities she asked if he wanted some detectives to come over shouldnt they be volunteering to do that themselves pellam wondered he said thats okay dont want to trouble anybody the woman missed the irony i mean they will she explained tell you what pellam said if he comes back ill let you know you be sure and do that now you have a good day ill try it was a dusty little office in the fifties west side not far from where hed sat beside otis balm and listened to the hundredandthreeyearold man tell him about the hells kitchen of long ago prohibition was the most fanciest the kitchen ever got i seen owney madden the gangster many times he was from england people dont know that wed follow him round the streets you know why not for the gangster stuff we was just hoping hed say something so we could hear how english people talked that was stupid of us cause he was also called owney the killer and a lot of people around him got shot but we was young then and dont you know it takes twenty thirty years of getting by in the world for death to start meaning anything to you pellam sized up the office prepared his mental script and then pushed into the office inside the bitter smell of paper filled the air a fat fly buzzed repeatedly into the dusty window trying to escape from the heat the air conditioner was a twin of louis baileys im looking for a flo epstein pellam asked a woman with serpentine cheeks hair pulled back in a sharp bun walked up to the counter thats me it was impossible to guess her age how you doing pellam asked fine thank you john pellam wearing his one and only suit tenyearold armani relic from former life held out a battered wallet which contained a special inspector badge gold colored sold at arcades on fortysecond street for novelty purposes only and let the woman look at it for as long as she liked which turned out not to be very long she gazed at him eagerly and he could see she was a woman who enjoyed playing the part of witness celebrity pellam knew is the most addictive of intoxicants that detective lomax was here last time i like him hes kind of sober wait i think i mean somber fire marshal pellam corrected theyre not detectives though they have full arrest powers and carry bigger guns and beat the crap out of you with rolls of us coins right right right ms epsteins forehead crinkled at the mistake when we interrogate people together pellam said i play good cop he plays bad cop well marshal now this is just a followup you identified the suspect didnt you you gotta be more buttoned up than that hows that ive learned enough so i could be a da myself ms epstein recited what i told marshal lomax was a black woman of approximately seventy years of age came to the premises here and asked for a tenant policy application i confirmed that the mug shot they showed me was of her thats all i didnt quote identify any suspects ive been through this a couple times i can tell pellam nodded we sure appreciate intelligent witnesses like you now how long was the woman in here three minutes thats all she shrugged it was three minutes you having sex its nothing you having a baby its an eternity depending on the partner and the baby id guess pellam jotted down meaningless scrawls she gave you a cash deposit right we sent it all on to the company and they issued the policy did she say anything else no pellam flipped closed his steno pad thats very helpful i appreciate your time the polaroid square appeared quickly i just want to confirm that this is the woman who came in here thats not the mug shot no this one was taken in the womens detention center ms epstein glanced at it and began to speak pellam help up a hand take your time be sure she studied the smooth black face the prison department shift the folded hands the stiff salt and pepper hair thats her youre positive absolutely she hesitated then laughed i was going to say that id swear to it in court but then i guess thats exactly what im going to do isnt it guess it is pellam confirmed and kept his face an emotionless mask the way all good law enforcers learn to do that evening a hot foggy dusk found pellam standing in an alley across from brownstone new york post in hand he wasnt paying much attention to the paper he was thinking geraniums the nondescript buffcolored tenement was like a thousand others in the city the flowers planted in front of it fiery orangered would have fit fine with any other building but there hed been standing in the alley for an hour when a door opened and the figure stepped outside looked up and down the street then started down the stairs he carried a large shoe box pellam tossed the paper aside and began walking as silently as he could along the hot asphalt he finally caught up with the young man without turning around ramirez said you been out there for fifty minutes and you got two guns aimed at your back right now so dont do nothing you know stupid thanks for the advice hector what the fuck you doing here man you crazy whats in the box its a shoe box what you thinks in it shoes pellam was walking abreast of ramirez now he had to move fast to keep up the pace so what you want the young man asked i want to know why you lied to me i no lie man im not like no white man not like you reporters telling white mans lies pellam laughed what is that crap the cubano lords creed youve gotta recite it to get jumped in your crew dont give me no shit been a long day they came to

look too impressed pellam continued you also forgot to tell me that she was one of how many was it eight hundred eyewitnesses who saw joe the thug kill that guy from corcorans crew spear driscoe and bobby frink so are we all agreed that corcoran didnt burn down the building because of your aunt thats not a white mans lie now is it just go away man im busy how well you get along with somebody

way that you rousted him last week cause hes selling hardware to corcoran ramirez blinked then broke into a huge laugh oh man true or not true both man what do you mean true and not true he started

and now about as dangerous and interesting as a suburban strip mall pellam asked wherere we going im doing a business deal and i dont want you around your crews in business not a crew man its a club

said i got no real good contacts i no say i dont have any ask around okay gracias nada theyd walked far north on ninth avenue almost out of the kitchen pellam leaned against a lamppost on the corner while ramirez disappeared into a tiny bodega when he came out he was carrying a thick envelope which he slipped into the pocket of his tight jeans there was sudden motion from the alley nearby shit ramirez spun around reaching into his jacket pellam dropped into a crouch and stepped toward a parked car for cover who the fuckre you ramirez said pellam squinted into the gloomy opening of the alley the intruder was ismail yo cuz the boy said glancing uncertainly at the latino the boy stepped forward uncertainly ramirez glanced at him like he was a roach man you come up on people like that i thinking i oughta cap you ass ismails cautious eyes swept the sidewalk to pellam he said you know him yeah hes a friend of mine a faint grin seemed to cross the boys face a friend of yours ramirez spat out why you want a little moyeto like that for a friend hes okay he okay ramirez muttered he come sneaking up on me again he gonna be one dead okay friend of yours hey ismail how come youre not at the outreach center dunno just hanging hear anything about your mother and sister he shook his head eyes slipping from ramirezs scowl to pellams face and for a moment ismail seemed just like any other child shy uneasy torn between fear and yearning it hurt pellam to see this vulnerability the street defiance was somehow easier to take he thought about carol wyandottes assessment she was wrong it wast too late for him there had to be some hope pellam crouched down do me favor go on back to the outreach center get some sleep you eat anything he shrugged did you pellam persisted i jacked some beer he said proudly me and a homie we drank that but pellam couldnt smell any liquor on the boys breath childish bravado pellam gave him five dollars go to mcdonalds yeah hey you come by and see me

big feet the round dark face stared up at him i ask you a question you got big feet dunno he looked down at his tattered sneakers here ramirez tossed the box of basketball shoes toward the boy he caught it awkwardly looked inside his eyes went wide shit be jordan air pumps shit they no fit now not too good ramirez said but maybe you dont sneak up on people you live long enough to grow inta them now you do what he tell you nodding at pellam get the fuck outa here when he was gone ramirez said to pellam lets go celebrate my deal he tapped the pocket where the fat white envelope rested you drink tequila mescal i drink sauza i drink margaritas re disgusting ramirez exhaled a derisive laugh as he always seemed to do when somebody stated the obvious and started off down the street impatiently gesturing pellam after him plans for the evening had apparently been made they split the worm ramirez hacked the poor thing apart with an honesttogod west side story switchblade as they sat in a smokey little cubanchinese restaurant near columbus circle pellam told him about location scouting in mexico where hed spent hours with the offduty gaffers and grips and stunt people bragging about their psychedelic experiences ingesting fat white mescal worms i never felt anything though no man ramirez protested these guys they fuck up you mind and downed his portion of the worm after they finished two plates of tamales each they strolled outside ramirez stopped at a package store and bought another fifth of mescal working their way downtown ramirez said man here its saturday night and i no got a woman that sucks that waitress at the bar she was flirting with you which one the hispanic one her he scoffed then he frowned hey pellam lemme give you some advice no say hispanic no

whatever country somebody come from thats what you say dominican puerto rican im cubano if you gotta use one word say latino ramirez took a hit from the bottle he began reciting apostol de la independencia de cuba guia de los pueblos americanos y paladin de la dignidad humana you speak spanish a little not enough to understand whatever the hell you just said those words they on the statute of jose marti on sixth avenue central park you ever seen it no ah he said sneering how you can miss it it thirtyfeet high his horse it up on two legs and marti is staring down sixth avenue he look

hector ramirez laughed loud who know maybe he in havana a bunch of tiny worms were taking tiedyed trips in pellams brain he hadnt had that much really five or six shots okay maybe more and okay maybe there was something psychedelic about the little critters as the two men plunged further into the dark heart of the kitchen he realized ramirez was talking to him what man i asked you what the fuck you really doing here what am i doing im drinking tequila with a criminal hey you think im a criminal i got a conviction im told you do he thought for a moment an who told you word on the street pellam muttered ominously you no answering my question whatre you doing here my father pellam answered surprising himself with his candor you father where you father he live here not any more pellam turned his eyes north where easily a million lights glimmered with different types of brightness he took the bottle back i worked on this film a few years ago to sleep in a shallow grave i never hear of it it was about a woman who comes home and finds her father may not have been her father i was just scouting locations but i rewrote part of the script too her mother she a puta no just had an

do when im there another sip then another we get out to the grave and shes crying they were deep into the kitchen now and turned into the stinking cobblestoned alleyway that led to ramirezs kickback shes got a confession to make she tells me it turns out she doesnt think her husband was my father after all man that was one big fucking surprise benjamin her husband the man i thought was my father was away a lot traveled all the time they had a fight about it he went off on a trip she took this lover after a while he leaves ben comes home they patch things up shes pregnant cant tell what day it

explained how hed found the mans last known address but hed left that building years before and there were no other leads pellam had contacted the vital statistics departments in the five boroughs of new york city and all the nearby counties of new york new jersey and connecticut no response gone huh just like my padre pellam nodded so why you stay i thought id do a movie about hells kitchen his neighborhood he lived here for a while pellam held up the bottle well heres to your padre the son of a bitch he drank from it heres to both of ours wherever the fuck they are pellam was just handed the bottle back when he felt for the second time in several days the chill of metal on his neck this time too it was a gun muzzle ramirez rated three thugs pellam only one fuck the latino spat out as two of them gripped his shoulders and the third frisked him carefully taking his automatic pistol and his knife another grabbed the mescal bottle and flung it into the alley only spic faggots drink this shit pellam heard the bottle crash grinning ramirez nodded to the man whod spoken said to pellam this is sean mccray i no know why he here most saturday nights he got a date at home with his dick which earned ramirez a fist it slammed into his jaw he staggered under the blow pellam recognized mccray from the table in corcorans bar the other day hed been sitting near jacko drugh i remember him pellam said which for some reason earned pellam a fist too though he got slugged in the belly he doubled over gasping breathless his minder large man in a black leather coat like drughs dragged him to the middle of the alley dropped him in a pile turned back to ramirez the young latino struggled tried to kick one of them but they just started beating him when they stopped ramirez gasped man you stupid fucking micks he seemed more exasperated than anything else by their behavior shut up mccray leaned close i had a little talk with oneil he told me you two were in business together which i cant say surprised me another one of the men said tell him what happened to oneil oh the swim offered pellams minder yeah mccray said oneil went for a fucking swim in the hudson next to the qe aint come up yet ramirez shook his head oh thats brilliant you cap the only gun dealer in the kitchen jimmy buys from him too you know now we all gonna go buy shit up in harlem and east new york and the niggers gonna rob you blind oh you soooo fucking smart jimmy dont know you did it i bet man you fuck this one up he spit blood a moments silence from the thugs one of them eyed mccray uneasily shit ramirez spat out you know what happens if you kill me sanchez takes over and fucking wipes you out weve got macs and uzis we got desert eagles oh were fucking scared and when corcoran find you started a war if sanchez dont nail your ass jimmy going to just get the fuck outa here man you got a mouth on you ramirez you fuck mccray swung hard and caught ramirezs jaw again with a glancing blow pellam struggled to get up and got a booted foot in the belly he dropped to the ground clutching his stomach moaning the irishmen laughed your girlfriend here hes not feeling so good hector pellams guard gripped his collar firmly and the three around ramirez wrestled him into an alcove whynt you piss on him one of them asked shut up mccray barked this aint a game pellam retching got up on his knees hes gonna puke his minder called laughing but they lost interest in pellam and concentrated on pounding on ramirez he fought hard but he was no match for the burly irishmen and finally he dropped to his knees mccray looked up and down the alley nodded to his lieutenant who pulled the hammer back on his pistol aimed it down at the latino the other two stepped away one squinted ramirez sighed and stopped struggling he gazed back at his killer calm shook his head cristos okay so go ahead and do it he smiled at mccray no choice pellam thought consoling himself no choice at all he gave up on the fake retching and rose into crouch knocked his minders hand away then swept the colt peacemaker from his back waistband cocking the singleaction gun with his thumb he fired toward the shooters leg which kicked out sideways under the impact of the large slug the man dropped his gun twisting away screaming in pain falling to the cobblestones pellams guard went for his own pistol but the barrel of the peacemaker caught him in the nose with a loud crack pellam ripped the glock from the screaming mans fingers as he backed away hands up no man no dont please mccray had leapt for cover sprinting for a dumpster the other irishman near ramirez started to turn but the latino decked him with a solid fist in the chest three fast blows he cried out and dropped onto his back gasping for breath and vomiting pellam slipped behind a corner and fired another shot toward but not at mccray aiming for the brick at his feet worried about bullets flying through the populated neighborhood the shot drove the irishman further behind the dumpster the thug with the gunshot was screaming oh god oh shit my leg my leg everybody ignored him pellams minder had vanished running down an offshoot of the alley mccray and the remaining irishman were firing blindly at ramirez who was pinned down looking for cover as best he could behind a pile of trash bags yo pellam called ducking as a bullet from mccray snapped past him he tossed the black automatic to ramirez who caught it onehanded pulled the slide and fired several covering shots the man whod been hit kept sobbing hands over his face crawling an inch at a time toward his comrades ramirez gave a whoop and laughed loud he was an excellent shot and the irishmen could only peek out for a second or two and fire a careless shot before ducking back the gunfire lasted for no more than thirty seconds pellam didnt fire again he was sure thered be sirens filling the night whipsawing lights a hundred cops but he heard nothing from the streets around them it was of course hells kitchen what was a little gunplay a hand reached out from behind the brick wall and grabbed the wounded man he disappeared a few minutes later the three irishmen were stumbling out of the alley a car started and squealed away pellam stood still struggling for breath ramirez too laughing he checked the clip in the gun and slipped it into his pocket retrieved his own automatic son of a bitch ramirez said lets get the gunshot was deafening pellam felt a hot searing pain on his cheek ramirez spun and fired from his hip three times four hitting the man pellams minder whod returned and fired from the shadows of the alley the man flew backwards hands shaking pellam watched the body twitch as he died ramirez asked urgently jesus man you okay pellam lifted his hand to his cheek touching a strip of exposed flesh looked at the blood on his fingers it stung like pure hell but that was good he remembered from his stuntman days that numbness was bad pain was good whenever a gag went bad and a stuntman complained of numbness the stunt coordinators got nervous in a big way in the distance the first siren listen pellam said desperately i cant be found here man it was selfdefense no you dont understand i cant be found with a gun ramirez frowned then nodded knowingly then looked toward ninth avenue heres what you do man just go out to the street walk slow like you out shopping cover up that he pointed toward the wounded cheek get some bandages or something stay on eighth or ninth go north remember walk slow you be invisible you walk slow gimme your piece we got a place to keep em pellam handed over the colt ramirez said i thought you said you werent carrying white mans lie pellam whispered and vanished down the alley nineteen louis pellam pushed into the office got something you might want to look at it was late morning close to ten and bailey the somewhatsober lawyer had not yet been replaced by bailey the somewhatdrunk apartment dweller the lights were out in the office portion of the rooms and he shuffled in from the bedroom in a bathrobe mismatched slippers on his feet despite the agonizing groan the air conditioner still wasnt doing anything but pushing hot dust around baileys office what happened to your face shaving pellam answered try a razor they work better than machetes the lawyer then added i heard there was a shooting last night somebody from jimmy corcorans gang was killed that right pellam i dont know anything about it louis there were supposedly two men involved one white one hispanic latino pellam corrected youre not supposed to say hispanic he dropped the polaroid onto the desk take a look the lawyers gaze remained on pellam for a moment longer yesterday i showed that picture to flo epstein at the insurance agency he held up his hands no intimidation just snapshots bailey examined the photo wine no you sure pellam continued i took a picture of ettie at the detention center i showed it to the epstein woman and asked if it was ettie and she said it was well bailey examined the picture squinted picked it up and laughed say this is very good howd you do it morphing computer graphics at my postproduction lab the photo was the polaroid that pellam had taken of ettie at wdc body hair hands dress the face however was that of ella fitzgerald pellam had had the two images assembled by computer and then had taken a polaroid of the result encouraging the lawyer said though pellam thought he wasnt as encouraged as he ought to be pellam pulled open the door of the tiny refrigerator jugs of wine no water no soft drinks no juice he looked up whats eating you louis that poker game i told you about with the fire marshal it didnt happen oh it did pellam took the slip of paper bailey offered with an unsteady hand dear louis i did what we talked about and got a game together with stan sobie fred and the mouse remember him been years i lost you sixty bucks but stan let me take a bottle of dewars almost full so ill drop it off sometime after its not so almost full any more heres what i found and i think you might not like it lomax found a passbook washington didnt tell any one about grand total inside of over ten thousand and guess what she took out gs the day before the fire also they say your a prick because you didnt list the on her financial disclosure statement for the bail motion but mostly theyre happy cause it gooses theyre case joey ten thousand pellam was stunned where on earth had ettie got that much money shed never mentioned any savings to him when baileyd asked what she could contribute to the bail bondsman she said maybe eight nine hundred tops he remembered the other day too shed said she couldnt have bought the insurance policy from flo epsteins agency because she didnt have the money he looked out the window watching the bulldozer demolishing what was left of etties building a worker with a sledgehammer was pounding a starpoint chisel into a scorched stone bulldog to break it apart he heard etties voice im trying and recall how many buildings were on this block im not sure they were all tenements like this one but theyre mostly gone now this one was built by an immigrant in heinrik deuter german man you know those bulldogs out front the ones on either side of the steps he had a stone carver come and carve those because he had a bulldog when he was a boy in germany i met his greatgrandson a few years back people say its sad they pull down these old places to build new ones well i say so what a hundred years ago they tore down other buildings to build these right things come and things go just like people in your life and thats just the way it works pellam said nothing for a long while he picked up a large skeleton key from baileys desk studied the brass intently then replaced it howd the police find out about the account i have no idea did the teller identify her as the woman who took out the money i have a call in to somebody in the department to find that out theyve frozen the account this is bad isnt it yep it sure is the phone rang it was an oldfashioned bell the sound jarring bailey picked it up pellam watched a car cruise slowly past again he heard the thump of bass notes from that hiphop song it must have been number one on the rap chart the man got a message just for you gonna smoke your brothers and your sisters too it faded when he looked back he saw that louis bailey was holding the phone absently he tried to replace it needed to do it twice to seat the receiver in its cradle my god he whispered my god what louis is it ettie there was a fire on the upper west side a half hour ago he took a deep breath the insurance agency two employees were killed flo epstein was one of them it was him pellam somebody recognized him it was that young man from the gas station he used that napalm of his he burned them both to death jesus lord pellam exhaled stunned at the news he was thinking the pyro had followed him there to the agency hed been to pellams apartment earlier and broken in stolen the tapes then hed followed him uptown thats probably why he hadnt killed pellam in his apartment he was using him to find witnesses it was three minutes you having sex its nothing you having a baby its an eternity and if youre burning to death bailey said shed signed an affidavit about identifying ettie thats admissible what she told you about the ginnedup picture isnt its hearsay pellam looked out baileys window at a square of earth near where etties building used to stand illuminated by sunlight shining ruddy and immaculate through a clear sky it occurred to pellam now that because the building was gone sunlight would shine on places that hadnt been lit for more than a hundred years this recaptured brilliance seemed to pellam to alter both the present and the past as if the ghosts of thousands of hells kitchen residents long gone to bullets and disease and hard lives were once again at risk you want to plead her dont you pellam asked the lawyer he nodded pellam said youve wanted to all along havent you bailey steepled his fingers his pale wrists jutting from dirty white cuffs a plea bargain is considered a win here in the kitchen what about the innocent ones this doesnt have a damn thing in the world to do with guilt or innocence its like social security or selling your blood for booze or food money pleading in exchange for a reduced sentence its just something that makes life a little easier in the kitchen if i hadnt been involved pellam said you wouldve gone ahead right and plead her a half hour after they arrested her bailey responded pellam nodded he said nothing as he walked outside and started down the sidewalk the backhoe lifted a shovelful of rubble from the wreckage of etties building chunks of the handcarved bulldog mostly and dropped it unceremoniously into the dumpster at the curb things come and things go and thats just the way it works there was nothing to do but ask straight out pellam watched ettie walk stiffly into the visitors room at the womans detention center her dim smile faded and she asked what is it john her eyes narrowed at the streak on his face what happened but her voice faded as she studied his expression the police found the bank account the the one in harlem the savings account with ten thousand in it the old woman shook her head vehemently and touched her temple with her good hand the ring finger of which had been broken long ago and had set badly her face shone with contrition for maybe a second then she spat out i didnt tell anybody about my savings how the fuckd they find it she was drawn and secretive now you didnt tell anyone you didnt tell the court or your bail bondsman you didnt tell louis that doesnt look good theres no reason for the world to know everything about a woman she snapped her man takes her things away her children take things away everybody takes and takes and takes howd they find out i dont know bitterly she asked well so what ive got some money ettie its my damn business not theirs they say that you or somebody made a withdrawal just a day before the fire what i didnt take anything out her eyes were wide with alarm and anger two thousand she rose and limped in a frantic circle as if she were about to charge into the streets in search of the stolen cash somebody robbed me my money somebody told em bout my money some judas did that the speech seemed too prepared as if shed planned an excuse if the money was found more conspiracies pellam thought wearily under etties shrunken frown pellam turned away and gazed out the window he wondered if she was accusing him was he the judas he asked finally wheres the passbook in my apartment it got burnt up i guess how can somebody take my money just like that what am i going to do the police froze the account what ettie cried nobody can take any more money out i cant get my money she whispered i need that i need every penny of my money why pellam wondered what for he asked you didnt use that money for bail dont look that way ettie im just telling you what theyre saying that its suspicious they think i paid it to the firebug man she gave a sour laugh reckon they do pellam said after a moment and you think that too no i dont ettie walked to the window somebody betrayed me somebody betrayed me good the words were bitter and she couldnt hold pellams eye when she said this again ettie remained still as stone then her head rose inches just enough for her to gaze at the dimly lit windowsill leave me alone now please id as soon not see anybody no dont say anything john please just leave when the got him this time they frisked him carefully oh man not now i dont need this now pellam had just walked into his apartment building lobby in the east village lost in his doubts about ettie and her secret money when six hands grabbed him from behind and slammed him against the wall last time with ramirez the irishmen had been content to slug him once and forgo a search for wild west pistols now they turned his pockets inside out and satisfied that he was unarmed spun him around little jacko drugh was accompanied by a tall man vaguely resembling jimmy corcoran and a third one a redhead the lobby wasnt that big a space but it offered plenty of room for three guys to beat the crap out of him the look in drughs eye told him this wasnt his idea and pellam had some sympathy for the young man lets see what scene would this be toward the end of act two in your standard hollywood actionadventure script the good gunfighter gets blindsided by the cattle barons boys the heroic reporter gets nailed by the oil company security guards the commando gets set up and kidnapped by the enemy score one for the bad guys setting up the hero for his triumphant return and audiences love it when their boy goes down hard id invite you up pellam said wincing at the vice grips on his arms but i dont really want to the taller of the thugs probably corcorans brother drew back a fist but drugh shook his head said to pellam jimmy heard what happened last night seany mccray taking it on himself to wax ramirez heard you were playing second for the spic anyway like you maya heard jimmy dont want no excitement too much attention in the kitchen right now so he aint going to kill you and ramirez like he probably ought but youse took out one of our boys so we gotta come and do something about it theres gotta be some you know payback wait why me pellam asked what about ramirez well what it is is jimmy dont want to start nothing no crew wars so he figured everybodyd be happier we play mike tyson on you not everybody pellam muttered im not real crazy about the idea yeah well thats how it goes doesnt it jacko dont make the rules and i just paid five cnotes to this guy damn look you want me to apologize i will im sorry redhead said sorry dont count for shit he stepped forward pellam turned to face him but drugh held up an arm to stop his fellow gangster hold up hes jackos isnt he now fivefoottwo drugh turned to face pellam who relaxed considerably he understood now thats why jackod volunteered itd be like oneil and ramirez a sham drughd pull punches pellamd take a fall and itd all be over with in three minutes he knew how to fakefight from his stuntman days pellam shook free of the other two irishmen and stepped forward okay you want some you got it he lifted his arms making fists drughs first swing nearly knocked him out the bony fist slammed viciously into pellams jaw he blinked and flew back his head slamming into the brass mailboxes drugh followed up with a left to the gut pellam went down on his knees retching goddamn shut the fuck up drugh muttered he joined his hands together and brought them down hard on pellams neck in two seconds pellam was flat on the filthy tiles drughs coup de grace was a workbooted foot slamming into his kidney and gut jesus you dont got no gun now you asshole drugh recited as if hed been working on the line all day he was a far worse actor than pellam had suspected youve fucked with the wrong people pellam rose to his knees swung at drugh missing completely and took three hard blows to the belly the little man whispered in pellams ear howm i doing pellam couldnt speak he was close to vomiting drugh whispered hit me back its looking too fake pellam crawled away from him struggled to his feet he spun around and swung hard he connected a weak glancing blow to the mans cheek drugh blinked in surprise and screamed you fucking prick redhead and the other one held pellam while drugh rained blows into his belly and face pellam simply gave up he held his hands over his face and dropped to the floor again not so hot shit now the redhead said he was laughing way to go jacko then drugh had his gun in his hand and he pressed the muzzle against pellams face pellam thinking how hed never really trusted the trigger cogs in guns they could be notoriously edgy the little bantam leaned closer whispered see you get me that part in a movie i can do my own fighting and everything i dont need no stuntmen an i got my own gun too pellam groaned shoot him in the foot or knee or something jacko yeah fuck up his hand boom boom drugh seemed to be debating naw hes had enough these fucking queers from hollywood they cant take shit drugh leaned forward once again whispered what it is that kid alex you wanted to know about hes staying at the eagleton hotel on ninth avenue room pellam mumbled something that drugh took to be thank you though the phrase shared only one word with that expression of gratitude drugh gave him a friendly kick in the ribs as a farewell and then vanished with the others hey tommy he said to redhead you remember that scene in that movie i was telling you about wht the fuck movie you think i mean the door swung shut pellam spit the loose tooth from his mouth it rattled around on the tile floor for what seemed like minutes before it finally spun to silence twenty it was just as a horde of bleary french tourists was checking into the tawdry hotel on the west side that the elevator returned as summoned to the ground floor and then it opened its doors mon dieu the flaming liquid inside the car melted through its plastic container and spilled like a fiery tidal wave into the lobby jesus somebody screamed oh shit the flames appeared almost magically as the liquid ran along the floor and ignited the carpet the chairs the goldflecked wallpaper the fake rubber trees the tables alarms begin detonating with harsh baritone ringing oldfashioned bells that make one think immediately of lifesaving systems vastly outdated screams filled the tattered halls people began to flee more frightening than the flames was the smoke which filled the hotel instantly as if it were pumped in under high pressure the electricity simply stopped and amid the palpable smoke nighttime filled the lobby and corridors even the ruby exit signs grew invisible and sounding above all of the screams and ringing and alarms was a frantic pedal tone the howl of fire the eagleton hotel was about to die the flames consumed the cheap carpet and turned it from green to black in seconds the flames boiled plastic as easily as it puckered skin the fire ran up the walls melting plaster like butter the flames spit out smoke thick as muddy water and suffocated a halfdozen foreign guests trapped in an alcove without an exit the flames kissed and the flames killed merde mon dieu allez allez giselle où es tu in the downstairs banquet room where three white jacketed busboys cowered there was a sudden flashover the whole space grew so hot it ignited like one huge match head upstairs a young man fully clothed leapt into a brimming bathtub thinking cleverly that this would protect him sickened rescue workers would find what was left of his body two hours from now in water still heated to a slow boil one woman in a frenzy of panic flung open the door of her room and with the inrush of oxygen an explosion engulfed her the last scream she uttered wasnt a human sound at all but a burst of flame popping from her mouth one man fled from searing wall of flames and hurtled through a fifthfloor window he cartwheeled elegantly in silence to the roof of a yellow taxi below the glass in the cabs six windows turned instantly opaque as if coated with winter frost another man stepped onto a fire escape so heated by flames that the metal rods of the stairs melted through his running shoes in seconds he climbed screaming on burnt bloody feet to the roof in rooms on the higher floors some of the guests believed they were safe from the fire itself they noticed only a faint haze of smoke around them they calmly read the incaseofemergency cards and as those reassuring words instructed soaked washclothes and held them over their faces then they sat down calmly on the floor to wait for help and died peacefully in the sleep of carbon monoxide poisoning in the lobby there was another flashover a sofa exploded in orange fire so did the body of a tourist lying on the carpet he contracted into the pugilistic attitude knees drawn up fists clenched and arms bent at the elbows in front of him a pepsi machine melted and exploding soda cans shot through the lobby the contents turning to steam before the aluminum hit the floor sonny caught glimpses of these vignettes because hed placed the jug of burning juice in the elevator on the sixth floor and then leisurely made his way down the fire escape lingering watching he told himself to flee to be more cautious but naturally he couldnt help himself his hands were no longer shaking he wasnt sweating the nyfd trucks began to roll up sonny slipped into an alley across the street and continued to watch observing with pleasure that it was an allhands blaze this was quite a feather in his cap there were ladders engines and trucks from number of companies my god it was a wholebattalion fire he hadnt set one of those for months he listened to his radio shack scanner and learned that it was a tenfortyfive code fatalities already but he knew that the apparatus kept arriving dozens of seagrave and mack fire trucks and engines and ladders some red some dayglo yellowgreen intersection horns blaring harshly ambulances police cars marked and unmarked men and women in heatproof gear with air tanks and masks hurried into the conflagration more ambulances more police lights and noise cascades of water steam everywhere like ghosts of the dead cars parked illegally were hacked open to make paths for the hoses crowds filled the streets looters sized up the risk the hotel became a storm of orange flame towering up to the eighthfloor penthouse when the flames were largely under control the ems medics started bringing out the bodies some were cyanotic bluishtinted due to lack of oxygen some were red as lobsters from the flames and heat some were charcoal colored and bore no resemblance whatsoever to the human beings they had once been more windows burst outward slivers of black glass rained to the street as rooster tails of water rose from the huge nozzles and converged on the weakening flames turning to scalding steam sonny watched it all from an alley nearby he watched it all until finally finally he saw what hed been waiting for his mother had told sonny that his father used to enjoy hunting flushing birds with a boisterous lab named bosco sonnys father had been a good hunter and hed spent a lot of time perfecting his skill though he probably shouldnt have sonny had concluded because when he and bosco were away his wife fucked anything that came to the door sonnys mothers last lover on the other hand never hunted for much of anything except a way out of his burning bedroom which he never did find of course thanks to sonny and a very handy spool of wire now in the smokey chaos of the dying eagleton hotel sonny saw the bird hed flushed using an allhands blaze rather than a cheerful black dog alex the fag with the chipped tooth and a mole like a tiny leaf on his right shoulder blade gasping for breath staring at the building the young man leaned against a lamppost probably thinking what people always thought at times like that i couldve been trapped in there i couldve died in there i true you little faggot sonny whispered you might have his head was close to the boys ear alex spun around you i what does that mean sonny asked him frowning you i say is that faggot talk skinny alex turned to run but sonny was on him like a mantis he clocked him on the side of the head with a pistol looked around and dragged him deeper into the deserted alley like listen sonny slipped the pistol behind the young mans ear whispered like youre dead pellam breathless from running paused leaning against the chainlink fence of a construction site across the street from the eagleton oh no no the hotel was gone you could see sky through some of the windows of the upper stories and gray brown smoke flowed from the dead heart of the building he said to a passing ems technician round man with a sweaty sootstained face im looking for a teenager a blond kid skinny he was in there name might be alex the weary technician said sorry mister i didnt treat anyone like that but we got eight bbrs pellam shook his head the tech explained burned beyond recognition walking through the numb crowds pellam asked about the boy somebody thought he might have seen the young man climb down the fire escape but he couldnt be sure somebody else a tourist asked him to take his picture in front of the building and held out his nikon pellam stared in silent disbelief and walked on closer to the building he stepped away from the crowd and nearly ran into fire marshal lomax the marshal glanced at pellam and didnt say a word his eyes returned to four bodies lying on the ground arms and legs drawn up in the pugilistic pose they were loosely covered with sheets his radio crackled and he spoke into his handitalkie battalion commander has advised fire is knocked down as of eighteen hundred hours say again marshal twofiveeight lomax repeated the message then added appears to be suspicious origin get the crime scene buses down here thats a roger marshal twofiveeight he put the radio back in his belt a rumpled man in general he was now a mess shirt sootstained drenched in sweat slacks torn there was a gash on his forehead he pulled on latex gloves bent down and tossed the sheet off one of the victims searched the horrible corpse pellam had to look away without glancing up lomax said in a calm voice let me tell you a story mr lucky i few years ago i was working in the bronx there was this club on southern boulevard social club you know what a social club is right just a place for people to hang out drink dance the name of the place was happy land one night there was maybe a hundred people inside having a good time it was a honduran neighborhood they were good people working people no drugs no guns just people having a good time pellam said nothing his eyes dipped to the macabre spectacle of the corpse he tried to look away but couldnt there was this guy lomax said in his eerie dead voice whod been going out with the coatcheck girl and shed dumped him he got drunk and went out and bought a bucks worth of gas came back and just poured it in the lobby lit it and went home just like that set a fire and went home i dont know maybe to watch tv maybe have some dinner i dont know i hope he got caught and went to jail pellam said oh yeah he did but thats not my point what im saying is there were eightyseven people killed in that fire the biggest arson murder in us history and i was on the id team see it was a problem because they were dancing dancing right most of the women didnt have purses on them and the mend left their jackets with their wallets hanging on the chairs so we didnt know who was who what we did was we laid all the bodies out and then were thinking jesus we cant have eightyseven families walk up and down the street and look at this so we took polaroids of them a couple shots of each body and put it in this notebook for the families to look at i was the one who handed the book to every mother or father or brother or sister whose kids were at happy land that night im never going to forget that he covered up the body and looked up one guy did all that one guy with a fucking dollars worth of gasoline i just wanted to tell you im putting a call to the da to move ettie washington out of protective isolation pellam began to speak but lomax fatigue in every move stood and walked to the second body he said she killed a kid every prisoner in detention knows that by now i give her a day or two at best he crouched down and pulled the sheet off twentyone the shades were down in baileys office maybe to stave off the heat pellam guessed then he realized that the blackout mustve been at the request of the nervous man who sat forward on a rickety chair across from the lawyer he was continually adjusting his position and looking around the room as if a hitman were sighting on his back from across the street pellam paid no attention to the visitor to the lawyer he said i found alex but the pyro got to him first the eagleton fire bailey asked nodding knowingly yep hes dead pellam shrugged maybe hes dead maybe he just took off i dont know there were unidentified bodies oh my god offered the visitor he looked like the sort whod be wringing his hands if they werent gripping the seat of the chair so desperately pellam then told the lawyer what lomax had said about protective custody no bailey whispered thats bad she wont last an hour in general population goddamn blackmail pellam muttered can you stop him from doing it i can delay it is all but theyll release her the dall agree in an instant if they think itll pressure her into giving up the arsonist he jotted a note on a piece of sunbleached foolscap and turned his attention to the nervous man who sat before him he was skinny middleaged and wore a clever toupee his pants had a slight flair a disco demon from the seventies the lawyer introduced the men newton clarke rose slightly and shook pellams hand with a sopping palm then deflated himself back to his cracked naugahyde roost he never held pellams eye for more than a second newton here has a few interesting things to tell us start over why dont you some wine pellam no youre such an abstainer okay newton talk to us tell us where you work pillsbury milbank hogue roger mckennahs law firm the one his wife told me about right newtons job it seemed was in the managing attorneys office bailey explained theyre the ones who handle scheduling make calendar calls and so on filings you get the picture theyre not lawyers newton could be right with everything you know about the law a glance at pellam but he wants an honest profession clarke smiled uneasily his eyes flicked to the window as a passerby cast a hurried shadow on the dusty blinds bailey swilled more wine give us your take on roger mckennah well for one thing he knows everything that goes on in the kitchen like santa claus is he making his list dont you worry newton your mission heres safe well give you bushy eyebrows and a fake nose when you leave clarke forced his shoulders back and sat up straight he offered a humorless laugh jesus louis his buildings right across the street we shouldve met someplace safe zurich grand cayman bailey asked with uncharacteristic acid now what about mckennah the man told his story newton indeed had a clerks personality organized precise detailed the kind of documentary interviewee pellam decided who seemed perfect but whose testimony he could use only in small doses for all his accuracy clarke spoke without a bit of passion or color well take robust lies over the pale truth any day pellam had come to believe should i from the beginning bailey said the very beginning okay okay well mr mckennah grew up in the kitchen he was poor crude when he was in his twenties he decided to remake himself he dumped the girl he was engaged to because she was jewish clarke glanced at pellams features to see how inappropriate this comment was then he continued he hired a speech and dress coach to help him improve his image and he started working his way through new york real estate he bought his first building in flatbush when he was twentythree then a building in prospect park then astoria then a couple in the heights and the slope he was twentynine he had nine buildings then he hocked all nine and came into manhattan one building on twentyfourth street nobody was in that part of town then it was a bum location the city the highclass commercial districts went south to the empire state building and it stopped until you got to w ll street but he bought this building and what happened but new york life bought it from him fast and with cash he took that money and bought two more buildings then three then six then he built one his first then he bought two more and kept going now hes got sixty or seventy throughout the northeast pellam was losing patience he asked was he ever connected with an arson thats my boy bailey said nodding toward pellam good moviemaker gets right to the proverbial chase scene clarke responded well but the words deflated as soon as they were spoken and bailey prompted come on newton pellams a friend okay okay well nobodys sure couldnt prove anything but recently thereve been some accidents some union men one of them went off the thirtieth floor of a building on lexington and a building inspector who hadnt been willing to pocket money got beaned by a stack of twobyfours none of this happened on a mckennah job site of course but they all were involved with mr mckennah one way or another suppliers who tried to extort him their trucks got hijacked and yeah a couple of places were firebombed sellers who set ridiculously high prices people who wouldnt deal that was mr mckennahs complaint he doesnt mind negotiations he doesnt even mind getting bested but he hates it when people wont even sit down with him thats the most important thing for mr mckennah you dont have to play fair but you have to play pellam recalled the steely eyes of the brunette at the developers party tough adversary playing the game howd you find out all of this pellams right to be suspicious newton bailey turned to him but we dont have to worry newtons sources are impeccable more wine sloshed and sos his motive for helping us out here isnt it pristine pellam explained what jolie had told him and asked exactly how desperate is he his casinos have failed big hes step away from bankruptcy and i mean complete bankruptcy apocalyptic bankruptcy now we come to the crux of it right newton the toupee was adjusted to quell an itching scalp mr mckennah needs the tower he nodded toward the shaded window on the other side of which the highrise soared into the sky its his last chance added the flatlined voice mckennah clarke explained had several tenants lined up for the tower when it was completed but there was only one lease he really cared about ras advertising and public relations was consolidating all of its many operations in one location fifteen floors in the tower under a tenyear lease with generous costofliving increases annually ras would be paying annual rent of more than million the ad agency employees however were upset about their move from midtown and were concerned that commuting through the streets of hells kitchen would be dangerous ras would sign the lease only if mckennah at his own expense built a fourblocklong tunnel connecting the building with the long island railroad commuter line in penn station which also had a subway stop the deal was signed and like a piranha mckennahs company began devouring underground rights to build the tunnel the company negotiated easements to every building on the planned route of the tunnel except one a small plot of land on thirtyseventh street directly behind the lot on which etties building had sat odd coincidence bailey explained wryly the land was bought by someone just three days before mckennahs company approached the old owner so somebody had inside information that mckennah needed it who jimmy corcoran bailey said how bout that corcoran pellam remembered jacko drughs telling him that jimmy and his brother were planning some kind of big deal and he recalled too what jolie had said the latenight meetings corcoran doing a deal with roger mckennah now that was a bizarre thought bailey continued and jimmys basically extorting mckennah cause without that parcel no tunnel no tunnel no lease and hello bankruptcy court heres what the deal is clarke said finally displaying some animation corcoran owns the land mr mckennah needs right well hes agreeing to lease it to mr mckennah only corcoran insisted on taking a cut of the profits not a flat fee he gets one percent of the revenues generated by the property thats brilliant for corcoran because it looks like mckennah towers going to be making close to a hundred twenty million in annual rents that psychotic punk is going to wind up with one point two million a year bailey said clarke continued mr mckennahs never given anybody a percent of the action before thats how desperate he is pellam considered this he said etties building the one that burned was right in between the tower and corcorans property right bailey confirmed so mckennah needs it to finish the tunnel its the last piece so it seems the lawyer said what about this pellam mused he cuts a deal with the owner the st augustus foundation so they let him build the tunnel only mckennah finds out he cant dig under the building maybe its too old maybe its not stressed right so he hires the pyro to burn the place down and make it look like ettie did it mckennah gets his tunnel and the foundation can put up a new building clarke shrugged all i can say is what i said before ive never seen him this desperate pellam asked what exactly happens if the tower fails a dozen banksll call mr mckennahs loans theyre personally guaranteed clarke whispered as if disclosing a social disease hell go bankrupt he owes a billion five more than hes got hate it when that happens pellam said bailey asked clarke you find anything at the office about granting underground rights to the property that burned nothing no but mckennah always plays things close to his chest the partnersre always complaining that he never keeps them informed bailey grimaced never easy is it well all right newton back you go to the salt mines clarke hesitated then eyes on the dusty scuffed floor what pellam asked him but when he spoke it was to bailey he said he hurts people mr mckennah does he screams at them and he fires them when they dont do exactly what he wants even if it turns out later he was wrong he has temper tantrums he gets even with people finally the eyes swung toward pellam momentarily just be careful hes a very vindictive man a bully cloaked as a warning the mans words meant something else they meant forget the name newton clarke he stood and left hurriedly his disco boots making virtually no noise on the linoleum so weve got a motive pellam said greed the old faithful of motives one of the best bailey refilled his glass he lifted the shade looked out at the construction site pellam said weve got to find out if mckennah has the underground rights to the land below etties building the head of the foundation could tell you father whatever his name is did he ever call you back no he didnt lets try him again but bailey was shaking his head i dont think we should trust him but i can find out cleg pellam asked the skinny horseman armed with his liquor bottles no bailey said reflecting ill do this one myself we should meet back here at say eight sure bailey looked up and found pellams eyes on him thought i treated him a little harshly newton pellam shrugged ive finally nailed down your secret how you clog up gears louis have you now you cultivate debts the lawyer sipped wine and chuckled nodding i learned a long time ago about the power of debt whats the one thing that makes a man powerful a president a king a corporate executive that people owe him their lives their jobs their freedom thats the secret a man who knows how to milk debt is the man who can keep power the longest of anyone the dull ice cubes clinked on the surface of the lemoncolored wine and what does clarke owe you newton oh in crass terms about thirtythousand dollars he used to be a broker he came to me with a real estate investment partnership idea a few years ago and i plunked down a chunk of my life savings i found out later it was all phoney the us attorney and the sec caught him and i lost the money and this is how hes paying you off as far as im concerned information is negotiable tender tough luck that none of his other creditors feel that way how long till he pays you off bailey laughed oh he probably has ages ago but he doesnt believe it of course and he never will thats the marvelous thing about debts even after you repay them they never really go away no one paid any attention to the young worker as he wheeled the gallon drum of cleaning fluid up the ramp to the apartment building it was seventhirty dusk but thirtysixth street was lit up like a carnival workers scurrying to get mckennah tower ready for the toppingoff ceremony wearing white overalls sonny rested the dolly carrying the drum on the floor and in front of the door he glanced at the tarnished sign louis bailey esq he listened and heard nothing then he knocked several times and when there was no answer he easily picked the lock a talent that he didnt possess when he entered juvenile detention but that he had with him when he left and then wheeled the drum inside sonny was a worried man now the eagleton fire had galvanized the police and fire department hed never seen so many cops and marshals on the west side they were practically stopping cars on the street and frisking drivers they were getting close and he had to stop them a rough drawing of him had made the dinnertime news shaking hands sweaty face and tears he was so frustrated and frightened that once or twice on the way over here wheeling the drum up ninth avenue from his apartment hed found himself crying walking into the office and parking the drum beside the lawyers desk the young man then sat down in the swivel chair fake leather he thought disdainfully agent scullery a bit shorter and a lot deader than shed been when she looked down at him like a squirrel had had much better taste in interior designs still the office pleased him there was plenty of paper hed never burned a lawyers office and he thought that it would go up very fast because there was sooo much paper sonny pulled a few books off the shelf flipped them open looked down at the gray blocks of type he had no idea what these particular words meant sonny used to read books all the time though he preferred his mothers reading to him but that was years ago and he realized now that they no longer interested him he wondered why that was he couldnt remember when hed last read a book years ago what was it the book drooped in his hand yes he remembered it was a true story about the ringling brothers circus fire in hartford in more than a hundred and fifty people were killed when the big top burned in a matter of minutes the bandleader played stars and stripes forever the traditional circus disaster march to warn all the performers and workers of the blaze but they hadnt been able to save that many people sonny remembered particularly the story of little miss who died in the crush of the audience trying to escape she was clearly recognizable but no one ever claimed the body why sonny thought when he finished the book didnt he feel the least bit bad about the girl he stopped brooding and returned to his task on the desk he noticed pellams name and phone number written on a piece of yellow paper the midnight cowboy joe buck faggot antichrist sonnys hands began to shake again the sweat was already peppering his forehead and he felt the urge to cry once more stop it stop it stopit stopstopstop itttttt he had to pause for a moment until he calmed get to work keep busy he unscrewed the lightbulb from the old lawyers desk lamp and carefully opened his knapsack taking out one of his special light bulbs heavy and fat with the slick milky juice he rested it carefully on the desk and then turned to the oil drum and took his wrench from his overall pocket he began to work the lid off twentytwo sparks flew high above his head cascading off the top of mckennah tower an eighth of a mile into the air he could see a dozen tiny suns of welders arcs thinking about carol wyandotte remembering how hed seen this same astonishing building on his way to her apartment the night hed stayed over hed just returned from the youth outreach center looking for her but shed already left for the night her assistant said that carole had been in court all day one of the kids staying at the yoc there had pulled a knife on an undercover cop during a buyandbust operation and carole had spent six hours with the ada trying to convince them that hed just been scared he hadnt really intended to murder the officer it hadnt been a good day for her and shed been pretty upset the assistant told him shed left no message for pellam at the yoc and thered been none on his machine at home pellam was returning to louis baileys office to meet the lawyer as planned he looked down from the crown of the tower and once again examined the billboard that hed seen at a dozen times on his way to interview ettie an ad for mckennah tower he noticed that beneath the slick picture of the building were bulletpoints of features the story structure would be computercontrolled a smart building would have a tenthousandsquarefoot public atrium utomated pneumatic waste removal custom landscaping a fivethousandseat broadway theater a gourmet restaurant boutiques highrvalue insulation waterconserving toilets selfprogramming elevators he was however less impressed with this than he was with the facts that werent quite so public the facts louis bailey had told him the labyrinthine deals mckennah had cut with city hall p z the board of assessment the landmark preservation commission the mta the department of revenue the unions the clinton community association the west side democratic club the deals in which every inch of the building had been bought sold or liened in exchange for tax abatements and promises of contracts and public works renovations and sidewalk improvements and employment and oh yes hard cash pressed into very eager hands call them contributions or call them what you will the actual construction of the monumental edifice was a dull anticlimax to the dealmaking that resulted in its building maybe someday hed do a documentary on a highrise like this skyscraper would be the title buy the companion book pellam turned away from the tower and walked into louis baileys building he was surprised to find the door unlocked and partway open the rooms inside he could see were dark pellam squinted and saw baileys form hunched over the desk the lawyers head was resting on a law book and pellam thought hell passed out drunk he smelled wine and something else what cleanser something strong and chemical hey louis pellam called rise and shine how bout a little light he flipped up the wall switch the explosion was very soft not much more than the pop of a plastic bag but the sphere of liquid flame that leapt out of the lamp was huge jesus the fiery liquid splashed over the desk and enveloped the lawyer who jerked back in a hideous writhing gesture his face and chest were masses of white flame and from his throat came an animals desperate scream he fell behind the desk and began to thrash his heels making loud thuds on the floor as his hands tried manically to beat the flames away looking for a blanket or towel to beat out the flames pellam ran into the bedroom by the time he found an old quilt smoke had completely filled the office thick vile smoke burntmeat smoke louis pellam flung the blanket over the lawyer but it ignited immediately and just added to the growing mass of fire pellam grabbed the phone and hit but the line went dead the flames had melted the cord pellam dropped the set and ran into the hallway hit the fire alarm on the wall and grabbed the oldfashioned canister extinguisher he charged back into the office and turned the tank upside down firing a hissing stream of water at the flames as he stood dousing the fire ghastly smoke encircled him slipped into pellams lungs he began choking and his vision filled with black pebbles he kept blasting away with the extinguisher covering the black mass of baileys quivering body with the gray water the desk and a bookcase were still on fire and pellam turned the extinguisher toward them the flames were shrinking but the room continued to grow black with the thick smoke pellam spit the black crud from his mouth dropped the empty extinguisher and staggered back toward the door to find another one outside a dozen people were fleeing the building he tried to call out to them but he couldnt he felt himself starting to suffocate he fell to the floor the air was a little better down here but it was still filled with smoke and the stench of broiling death his lungs began to give out he turned stumbled toward the door a fireman appeared in here pellam said and passed out on the floor pellam sucked hard on the mask the dizziness from smoke replaced by the dizziness from pure oxygen a dozen emergency lights flashed around him fire trucks ambulances police cars piercing white light and red and blue youre okay encouraged the ems attendant a young man with a faint blond moustache bulky medical equipment and supplies dangled from his belt and filled his pockets breathe it in come on big guy keep going the technician wrote on a clipboard then looked into pellams eyes with a thin flashlight and took his blood pressure looking good the high voice confirmed the memory of the horrible fire returned hes dead isnt he him fraid so didnt stand a chance but its a blessing believe me ive had burn cases before better for him tove gone fast than deal with sepsis and skin grafts he looked over at the body lying on the ground nearby a sheet draped over it the task of giving the bad news about louis bailey to ettie was looming in his mind when a hand descended to pellams shoulder and a figure crouched beside him how you feeling the man asked pellam wiped smoke tears from his eyes his vision was a blur finally the face came into focus in a shocked whisper he said youre here youre okay me louis bailey asked thats not you i thought it was you pellam nodded toward the body bailey said it was almost me but its him the pyro the arsonist the lawyer nodded the fire marshal said he was rigging a trap to get us both id imagine i turned the light switch on and set it off pellam whispered he coughed hard for a moment the son of a bitch shouldve unplugged the lamp first a voice growled it was lomax he walked up to the two men pyros eventually get careless like serial killers after a while the lust takes over and they stop worrying about details he nodded toward the bag he had all the windows in your office closed there was no ventilation and an open drum of that napalm crap he makes he passed out from the fumes then you got here mr lucky and turned on the light kaboom who was he pellam asked the fire marshal held up a badly scorched wallet in a plastic bag jonathan stillipo jr oh we heard about him goes by the nickname of sonny did juvenile time for torching his mothers house in upstate new york of course it just happened that his mothers boyfriend was locked in the bedroom upstairs fits the classic pyro mold mommas boy loner in school sexual conflicts did vanity fires in college you know sets a fire then puts it out for the heroics hes been burning for fun and profit ever since he was on our list to talk to about the recent fires but he went underground a while ago and we didnt have any leads we found this in his back pocket you can still read some of it pellam looked at a scorched map of the city circles around xs marked the sites of the recent fires the subway on eighth avenue the department store two of the xs werent circled and pellam assumed those were the targets to be one was baileys building and the other was the javits center my god bailey whispered the convention hall was new yorks largest lomax said theres a fashion exhibition scheduled for tomorrow twentytwo thousand people wouldve been inside would have been the worst arson in world history well hes dead pellam said he dded i guess he wont be able to testify about who hired him then he caught the glance that passed between bailey and the fire marshal what louis pellam asked lomax motioned to a uniformed policeman who walked up and handed him a plastic bag this was in his wallet too the bag contained a sheet of paper the plastic made a crinkling sound that pellam found disturbing it reminded him of the flames hed just doused he thought of sonnys shaking body of the smell pellam took the offered bag and read heres thousand like we agreed try and dont hurt any body ill leave the door open the one in the back ill give you the rest after i get the insurance money ettie twentythree pellam stood uneasily dropped the oxygen mask onto the sidewalk its a forgery pellam said quickly its all ive already talked to her pellam louis bailey explained ive been on the phone for ten minutes with ettie she confessed john bailey said softly pellam couldnt take his eyes off sonnys body somehow the sheet bedclothes of the merely sleeping made the sight more horrible than the burned flesh itself bailey continued she said she never thought anybodyd get hurt she never wanted anybody to die i believe her she confessed pellam whispered he hawked hard and spit coughed for a moment spit again struggled to catch his breath i want to see her louis i dont think thats a good idea pellam said they threatened her or blackmailed her he nodded toward lomax standing at the curb talking to his huge assistant the fire marshal had overheard pellam but he said nothing why should he he had his pyro he had the woman who hired him lomax seemed almost embarrassed for pellam at his desperate words wearily the old lawyer said john there was no coercion the bank teller when the money was withdrawn lets find him the teller identified etties picture did you try the ella fitzgerald trick bailey fell silent pellam asked what did you find at city hall about the tunnel bailey shrugged nothing no recorded easements or leases for underground rights beneath etties building mckennah mustve john its over with a blaring horn sounded across the street pellam wondered what it signified the workers paid no attention there were hundreds of them still on the job even at this hour let her do her time bailey continued shell be safe mediumsecurity prison protective seclusion which meant solitary confinement at least thats what it meant at the q san quentin according to the california department of corrections solitary the hardest time there is peoples souls die in solitary even if their bodies survive shell get out bailey continued and itll all be over with will it he asked shes seventytwo when will she be eligible for parole eight years probably jesus pellam the lawyer said why dont you take some time off go on a vacation well he was certainly going to be doing that though involuntarily west of eighth would never be made now have you told her daughter bailey cocked his head whose daughter etties why you looking at me that way pelham asked ettie hasnt heard from elizabeth for years she has no idea where the girl is no she talked to her a few days ago shes in miami pellam bailey rubbed his palms together slowly when etties mother died in the eighties elizabeth stole the old womans jewelry and all of etties savings she vanished took off with some guy from brooklyn they were headed for miami but nobody knows where they ended up ettie hasnt heard from her since ettie told me that elizabeth owned a bed and breakfast or that she was managing a chain of restaurants pellam watched hardhatted workers carrying fourbyeight sheets of drywall on their backs walk around to the back of the tower the sheetrock bent up and down like wings he said to bailey that she was a real estate broker oh ettie told that one too it wasnt true i thought you knew thats why her motive the insurance money troubled me so much ettie came to me last year and wanted to hire a private eye to find elizabeth she thought she was somewhere in the united states but didnt know where i told her it could cost fifteen thousand maybe more for a search like that she said shed get the money no matter what it took she was going to find her daughter so elizabeth isnt paying your bill my bill bailey laughed gently im not charging ettie for this of course not pellam massaged his stinging eyes he was remembering the day he met bailey in the bar his uptown branch you sure you want to get involved in this hed thought the lawyer was simply warning him how dangerous the kitchen was but apparently thered been more to his message bailey knew ettie better than pellam had guessed pellam wandered to the site of etties building looked over it the land was nearly level a battered pickup truck pulled to a stop at the curb and two men got out they walked over to the small pile of rubble and pulled out a chunk of limestone cornice a lions head they dusted it off and together carted it back to the truck it was probably on its way to an architectural relics shop downtown where itd be priced at a thousand bucks the men looked over the site saw nothing else of interest and drove off bailey called let it go pellam go on home let it go the eighth avenue subway line offers no service for the time being due to police action we are sorry for the inconvenience riders are advised john pellam considered waiting but like most passengers on the metropolitan transit authority he knew that fate was the essential motorman of his journeys he decided to walk downtown to a cross street where he could catch an eastbound bus to his apartment he disembarked from the grimy subway car and climbed up the stairs of the station into the city west of eighth avenue stores had closed and mesh gates covered windows dusk was long past and the sky was filled with a false sunset the radiance of city lights from river to river this fiery canopy would last until dawn yo honey how bout a date west of eighth children had been put to bed men had eaten their hot meals and were sitting in their scruffy armchairs still aching from the hard routine of their jobs at ups or the post office or warehouses or restaurants or they were groggy from their hours upon hours in bars where theyd squandered the day talking endlessly arguing laughing wondering how love and purpose had eluded them so completely throughout their lives some of them were in those bars again now having returned after an evening meal with a silent wife and noisy children in tiny apartments women washed plastic dishes and marshaled children and brooded about the cost of food and marveled with painful desire at the physiques and the clothing and the dilemmas of the people in tv shows it was a night like a hot stone but here the old buildings werent wired for air conditioners the hum of fans filled most apartment and some not even that im sick im tryin to get a job i am man west of eighth clusters of people sat on doorsteps dots of cigarettes moved to and from lips lights from passing cars reflected amber in quart beer bottles which rang against the concrete stoops with everchanging tones as their contents emptied conversation was just loud enough to rise above the rush of traffic on the west side highway thousands of cars fleeing the city even at this late hour give me quarter for some food got a cigarette have a good night anyway god bless in the windows of tenements lights flickered the emanations of tv and often the hue was not blue but the pale gray of blackandwhite sets many windows were dark in some there was only glaring light from a bare blub and a motionless head was framed in the window looking out you want rock ice meth scag sens blow you want you want you want you want a lotto ticket you got a quarter you got a dollar you want some pussy yo i got aids i homeless excuse me sir gimme your motherfucking wallet west of eighth young men loped down the street in their gangs they were invincible here theyd live forever here bullets would pass through their lean bodies and leave their hearts intact they glided along the sidewalk carrying with them their own soundtrack its a white mans world now dont be blind you open you eyes and whatta you find the man got a message just for you gonna smoke your brothers and your sisters too its a white mans world its a white mans world one crew saw another across the street boom boxes were turned down glances exchanged then signs flew back and forth palms up fingers spread at some point bravado would become dissing if that happened guns would appear and people would die west of eighth everyone was armed tonight though faces turned way the volume cranked up again and the crews moved in separate directions surrounded by a tempest of music its a white mans world its a white mans lovers grappled in cars and beside the sunken roadbed of the old new york central railroad near eleventh avenue men dropped to their knees before other men it was midnight now young dancers hurried home from the topless clubs and peep shows broadway actors and actresses too just as tired among the stoopsitters cigarettes were stubbed out good nights were said beer bottles were left on the sidewalk soon to be scavenged sirens wailed glass broke a voice called out in ornery madness time to be off the streets its a white mans world its a white mans world west of eighth men and women lay in their cheap beds listening to the song as it floated through the streets outside their window or thudded into their bedrooms from neighboring apartments the music was everywhere but most didnt pay it any attention they lay exhausted and hot staring at their murky ceilings as they thought my day begins again in so few hours let me get some sleep please just cool me off and let me get some sleep twentyfour you missin a tooth man dont you know how to fight it was three to one pellam told hector ramirez so noon the next day ramirez was sitting on the doorstep of the cubano lords kickback smoking its hot pellam said you got any beer man do i got beer what kind you want any kind long as its cold ramirez rose motioned him toward the front door of their apartment he nodded at his bruised face who did it some of corcorans boys they heard about us the other night with mccray and drew straws to see who itd be more fun to beat the crap out of you or me i won hey i ice somebody for you you want or do some kneecaps i do that for you man i got no problem doing that thats okay pellam said it no problem maybe next time ramirez shrugged as if pellam were crazy he pushed through the doorway pellam noticed a young latino man standing in the shadows of the alcove a gun in his belt he spoke in spanish to ramirez who barked a phrase back he looked at pellams face and laughed pellam wanted to believe it was in admiration ramirez knocked on the door to a ground floor apartment and when there was no answer unlocked and pushed it open he let pellam precede him the apartment was large and comfortable filled with new furniture a couch was still in its plastic wrapping in the kitchen were stacks of cases of food and bags of rice one bedroom was filled with five sheetcovered mattresses the other bedroom was packed with cartons of liquor and cigarettes pellam didnt bother to ask where the merchandise had come from so you want a dos tecate dos ramirez took two beers from the fridge rested them against the counter cracked the tops off with a single blow from his palm passed one to pellam who drank down nearly half the room was sweltering there were two air conditioners in the front and back windows but they werent running through the shaded windows blew hot dusty air and the heat was like a liquid ramirez found a shoe box sitting on a table in the kitchen he took out a pair of athletic shoes and began lacing them up they were similar to the pair hed given to ismail the other day hey man take one whats the penalty for receiving stolen pellam asked fuck i found em he bounced looking down with approval im not the runningshoe type no you the cowboyboot type man why you wear those fucking boots they no hurt you feet so what you doing here pellam why you come visit me im leaving town pellam said came to get my gun i hear that moyeta she say she do it man she your friend that gotta be tough for you but nobody oughta burn the old places here that no good ramirez was getting the shoelaces even the tautness just right he stood slowly savoring the feel of the shoes he bounced on his toes again then came down on his heels he feinted right then left then leapt into a layup his fingers knocking flakes of white paint off the ceiling pellam noticed a handlettered sign on the wall next to a poster advertising a corvette on which a bikiniclad model reclined your standing in the crib of the cubano lords either you be a friend or you be fucked ramirez followed his eyes he said yeah yeah you gonna say we spelled youre wrong no im gonna say thats a hell of a poster you play basketball ramirez asked a little pellams last games had been oneonone against a man in a wheelchair and pellam lost six won two it was a shame he wasnt going to have a chance to play with ismail he probably couldve beaten the boy i go down

heading back to the coast need some work got some people i owe money to gonna be knocking on my door in about sixty days you want me to talk to em i can pellam wagged a finger uhuh ramirez shrugged lifted the corner of the linoleum in the kitchen and pulled up a floorboard he lifted out pellams colt and tossed it to him man you crazy carry that old thing ill get you a nice taurus that a sweet piece you like that bam bam bam a man need a fifteenshot clip nowadays i dont have as much of a call for one as you do as he replaced the flooring ramirez said i no watch tv much but i turn on you movie pellam when it come on when that gonna be ill let you know pellam muttered the door pushed open and a young latino man stepped inside gazing suspiciously at pellam he walked over to ramirez and whispered in his ear the man nodded and his young associate left pellam started toward the door ramirez said hey maybe you dont wanna go so fast he got some news for you who is he my brother he nodded after the young man whod just left news yeah you wanna know who broke into you apartment i know who broke in the pyro the kid who got burnt up i figured i mustve got him on tape when i was shooting the building the day after the fire ramirez bounced again on his pristine shoes and shook his head you wrong man you dead wrong yo cuz hey ismail pellam stood in front of the youth outreach center the air was hot dusty filled with a glaring shaft of sunlight reflected off a nearby building wassup homes not much pellam answered wassup with you hangin you know how it is whatchu got there a present all right cuz the boy stared at the large shopping bag with huge eyes pellam handed it to him the boy opened it up and pulled out the basketball yo you all right pellam this be fine yo homes lookit two other young boys a little older came over and admired the ball they passed it back and forth how is it here pellam nodded at the yoc storefront aint so bad they dont dis you so much but what it is they make you sit an listen to these hatters like priests and counselors dont know shit they tell you stuff talking at you wearing yo ear off axing you things they dont know bout he offered an adult shrug but fuck that life aint it pellam couldnt argue with that an man that carol bitch he whispered looking around dont go messing with her she ax me why i be comin in at three this morning give me all kindsa shit i tell that bitch what she can do did you now hells yeah well i tried but there aint no talking to that woman cuz why were you out at three am i was just hangin that straight pellam he said to his homies lets get a game up they disappeared toward an alley happy as tenyearold boys the world over pellam pushed through the squeaking door carol looked up at him from the desk her wan smile faded as soon as she saw his expression hi she said howdy sorry ive been so hard to get a hold of she said weve been busy as hell here the words were leaden silence motes of dust floated between them amoeba caught in the brutal light all right she said at last i didnt call because i got scared its been a long time since i got involved with somebody and my history with men hasnt been so great pellam crossed his arms he looked down at what carol was working on a stack of papers government forms they seemed overwhelmingly dense and complicated carol sat back in her chair this isnt about that is it no so i just heard a few things i was curious about such as the day of the fire you were asking about me the word on the street hey cute guy wearing cowboy boots sure i was asking she laughed but she couldnt bring the levity off her hands rose to her pearl necklace then continued up to her glasses and compulsively kneaded the taped joint on the frame pellam said you found out where i lived and you broke into my apartment the morning i stayed over while i was asleep in your bed carol was nodding not to agree or protest or to convey any message at all it was a reflex she looked around set her pen down her face was a grim mask as she considered something can we go upstairs its more private they walked to the elevator inside carol leaned against the car wall looking somber she glanced down and brushed absently at some dust that marred the stalwart latin word for truth on her sweatshirt carol avoided pellams eyes as she made meaningless conversation she told him in a breezy voice that an elevator company was going to donate a new car to the yoc it would have a big compliments of plaque inside as if the kids would run out and buy elevators of their own crazy what peoplell do for publicity he gave no response and she fell silent the doors opened and carol led them down a deserted corridor oppressive with dirty tiles and murky in the weak fluorescent light here carol pushed the door open and pellam stepped in before he realized that it wasnt a lunch room or office as hed expected but a dim storeroom carol closed the door she had purpose in her movements and her eyes had grown chill in the back of the room she moved aside boxes bent down and rummaged for something im so sorry pellam she paused took a deep breath he couldnt see what she held in her hand his thoughts strayed to the colt in his back waistband ridiculous to think that shed hurt him but this was the kitchen youre walking past a little garden at noon in front of a tenement thinking hey thosere pretty flowers and the next thing you know youre on the ground and theres a bullet in your leg or an ice pick in your back and her eyes her cold pale eyes oh what a fucking mess carols mouth tightened then suddenly she turned her hand rising holding something dark pellam reached back for his gun but in her pudgy fingers were only the two videocassettes shed stolen from his apartment for the past week ive actually thought about running away going someplace else and starting a new life not saying a word just vanishing tell me that man who mentioned me about saving his son pellam nodded he remembered about the young man nearly dying inside a building about to be torn down how shed rescued him she said i was afraid you might have me on tape i cant afford any publicity he remembered her distrust of reporters why im not who you think i am a recurring motif in hells kitchen and who are you pellam snapped carol hung her arm around the riser of a shelf and lowered her head onto her biceps a few years ago i was released from prison after serving time for dealing in massachusetts i was also convicted her voice faltered convicted of endangering the welfare of a minor i sold to some fifteenyearolds one of them overdosed and nearly died what can i tell you pellam what happened to me was so boring so tvmovie i dropped out of school i met the wrong men street dealing basing smack fucking for dollars oh brother i did it all whats this got to do with the tapes he asked in a cold voice she compulsively ordered a stack of thin towels i knew you were making that movie about the kitchen and when i heard that man had mentioned me i thought youd include me in the story i thought somebody in boston might hear about it and word would get back to the outreach center board i couldnt risk any publicity look pellam ive ruined my life im so messed up from abortions i cant have kids im a felon carol laughed bitterly you know what i heard the other day this bank robber was released from attica and was having trouble getting work he was furious that somebody referred to him as an excon he said he was societally challenged pellam wasnt smiling well thats me societally challenged theres no way i can get a job with a government social agency no day care center in the world would give me the time of day but the youth outreach center board was so desperate for help they didnt have much of a screening process i showed them my social work license and a massaged resume and they hired me if they find out who i am theyll fire me in a second for the good of the children whyd you lie to me i didnt trust you i didnt know who you were all i know about reporters is that they look for the dirt thats all they fucking care about well well never know what i wouldve done will we you never gave me the chance please dont be angry pellam what i do here is so important to me its the only thing i have in my life i cant lose it i lied when i met you yes i wanted you to go away but i also wanted you to stay pellam glanced down at the cassettes im not interested in todays kitchen its an oral history of the old days i wasnt even going to mention the yoc if youd asked i would have told you no dont leave like this give me a chance but pellam pushed open the door slowly undramatic he walked down the stairs then continued through the lobby of the yoc and stepped outside into a midtown filled with a searing sun and the cacophony of engines and horns and shouting voices he thought carols might have been one of them but then decided he didnt care walking east toward the fashion district on the way to the subway crazy name for a neighborhood pellam was thinking the least fashionable of any neighborhood in the city trucks double and tripleparked tall grimy buildings dirty windows feisty workers in kidney belts and sleeveless tshirts pushing racks of next springs clothing a woman stood at a phone kiosk hanging up the receiver then tearing a slip of paper into a dozen shreds now theres a story pellam thought then he forgot the incident immediately he paused at a construction site on thirtyninth street to let a dump truck back out its urgent beepbeepbeep reverse warning jarring his nerves thirtyninth street that was battle row the headquarters of the gophers the worst place in the city grandpa ledbetter said the police wouldnt even come west of eighth a lot of the time they wouldnt have any part of it over here he had a boot with a streak across the toe where he got hit by a bullet from this shootout on battle row when he was a boy thats what he said to us children i never quite believed him but maybe it was true he kept that old boot till he died two shrill whistles rose from the pit of the construction site the sound brought more spectators to the viewing holes crudely cut in the plywood fence lining the sidewalk he paused and looked through one a huge explosion the ground leapt under pellams boots and the mesh dynamite blanket shifted as the explosive shattered another fifty tons of rock into gravel etties words wouldnt leave his mind they looped endlessly there was always construction going on here papa had an interesting job for a while he called himself a building undertaker he was in one of the crews thatd take the old demolished tenements out to doorknob grounds in brooklyn they dumped hundreds of old buildings in the water build up a shoal with the junk and the fishd love it there he always came back with bluefish or halibut to last for days i cant look at fish now for any money three loud whistles apparently the all clear from the demolition crew hardhatted workers appeared and a bulldozer moved forward pellam started back up the sidewalk something caught his eye and he glanced at yet another developers billboard he stopped feeling the shock thud within him like a replay of the explosion a moment before he read the sign carefully just to make sure then he started off at a slow walk but despite the overwhelming august heat by the time he was at the corner he was sprinting twentyfive its a construction site bailey asked what is the st augustus foundation i remembered the number five hundred west thirtyninth street its across the street from the church but its just a hole in the ground they were in baileys bedroom his temporary office because of the fire in the main room it didnt seem much different from his office the most noticeable difference was that the cooler for his wine rested beside the bed not the desk this room also sported a better used air conditioner than the office if not cold at least the air was less stifling the burnt smell was overwhelming but bailey didnt seem to mind maybe the foundation moved bailey said gets better pellam said i asked at the church office no one theres ever even heard of a st augustus foundation he walked to the dusty window which was momentarily darkened by the shadow of a crane that was lifting a large piece of sculpture into the open plaza in front of mckennah tower the statue was wrapped in thick kraft paper and it appeared to be in the shape of a fish the derrick moved very slowly and he guessed the piece of stone or bronze weighed many tons around it workmen cleaned the grounds and tacked up banners and bunting for the towers toppingoff ceremony but there is a st augustus foundation bailey said and shuffled through documents on the bed and found a stack of scorched photocopies bearing the seal of the attorney general of the state its been incorporated under the notforprofit corporation law it exists its got eight members on the board pellam looked over the list the men and women on the board all lived nearby he touched one name at an ddress on thirtyseventh street block away james kemper lets see what he has to say bailey picked up the phone but pellam touched his arm lets pay a surprise visit but there was no surprise not to pellam construction was scheduled to begin in two months on the vacant lot where the mr kemper supposedly lived its all fake bailey muttered as they returned to his office when you called the director that minister who did you get answering service how do we find out whos behind it pellam asked without tipping our hand from the movie business he knew the complexity of incestuous corporate entanglements its a notforprofit foundation whichll make tracing things a lot harder than with business corporation law companies in baileys bedroom again pellam happened to glance down at a paper also scorched sitting next to the corporate filings it was the experts report on the handwriting on the insurance application comparing etties to the sample hed asked ettie about letters she might have written lately thinking someone mightve stolen a sample of her handwriting but he and ettie both had forgotten about the waiver shed signed for mckennahs company giving permission for the tower to exceed the planning zoning height limit its mckennah pellam announced then seeing baileys expression he held up his hand i know you dont think a topoftheline developer like himd torch a tenement and he wouldnt for the insurance but he would if the whole success of the tower depends on the tunnel to penn station newton clarke and mckennahs wife too told us how desperate he was but bailey lifted his hands dismayed why are you bothering even if mckennahs behind the foundation ettie still confessed to the arson thats not pellam said going to be a problem but ill deal with that the big question is how do we prove a connection between mckennah and the foundation the lawyers face grew troubled developersre geniuses at this sort of thing and mckennahs top of the line well have to trace offshore corporations doingbusinessas statements itll take some time how long a couple of weeks whens ettie being sentenced a pause day after tomorrow then i guess we dont have a couple of weeks do we pellams eyes were on the construction site across the street the wrapped sculpture was seated as unceremoniously as a girder several passersby gazed at it intently wondering what it might be but the workers walked away without tearing off the paper wearing the armani again and crowned with a stolen hard hat cocked over his brow john pellam walked matteroffactly through the lobby of mckennah tower this part of the structure was virtually completed and was already occupied by several tenants including two of mckennahs development and operating companies and the real estate agency leasing future space in the building pellams saunter told everybody in the office that he belonged here and that no one better delay what was obviously an urgent mission and no one did clipboard in hand he passed a row of secretaries and walked boldly through a large oak door into an office that was so opulent it had to be that of roger mckennah whom hed seen leave five minutes earlier he had several explanations prepared and rehearsed for the developers minions but his acting skills werent required the room was unoccupied he strode to his desk on which were two framed pictures one of mckennahs wife and one of his two children jolie gazed out of the expensive frame with an artificial smile painted large on her face the boy and girl in the adjoining frame werent smiling at all pellam started on the file cabinets after fifteen minutes hed worked his way through hundreds of letters financial statements and legal documents but none of them mentioned the st augustus foundation or the buildings on thirtysixth street the credenza behind the desk was locked pellam chose the direct approach he looked for a letter opener to break the lock with hed just found one in the top righthand drawer when a booming voice filled the room nice suit there seemed to be a bit of a brogue in it pellam froze but its not exactly you you ask me youre more of a denim kind of guy pellam stood slowly roger mckennah stood in the doorway beside his unsmiling bodyguard whose hand rested inside his coat jacket pellam whod suspected metal detectors in the tower entryway had left the colt in baileys office his eyes flicked from one man to the other weve been looking for you mckennah said and what happens but you come to see me he nodded to the assistant who lifted something to a table it was pellams betacam as of a few hours ago it had been hidden away in the bedroom closet of pellams sublet in the village he wondered if the rest of his tapes were now destroyed mckennah said lets take a ride he opened a side door into the dark garage where sat the mercedes limo the assistant picked up the camera and gestured with his head toward the door pellam started to speak but mckennah held up a long index finger what could you possibly say that youre looking for the truth youre rubbing the places that feel good youve got answers for everything ill bet but i dont want to hear them just get in the car twentysix they drove in silence for eight blocks the limo pulled up in front of a dilapidated old building somewhere in the forties on the far west side the paint was scaling it looked like dirty white confetti the wood trim was rotten and piled up against a side door were a dozen trash bags mckennah gestured toward it artie the bodyguard opened the limo door took pellams arm firmly led him toward the side entrance he shoved open a door and pushed pellam forward they waited as mckennah entered down long dark corridor the developer went first pellam followed trailed by artie who carried the camera as if it were a machine gun pellam looked around squinting waiting for his eyes to adjust to the darkness he slipped his hand into his sleeve to grip the handle of the letter opener hed copped from mckennahs office it felt flimsy but pellam knew from prison what kind of damage even the most delicate of weapons could do the corridor was lit by only one lowwatt bare bulb he coughed at the smell of mold and urine a blur of motion at their feet mckennah whispered jesus as the huge rat passed indifferently in front of them pellam ignored it he gripped the letter opener again felt the point against his arm waited for reassurance he felt none then the noise pellam slowed at the sound of the faint highpitched wail it seemed to be a womans scream from tv no it was a live human voice pellam felt the hairs on his neck stir keep going mckennah ordered and they continued to the end of the corridor then stopped the chill keening grew louder and louder he shoved the horrible noise out of his thoughts and concentrated on what he was about to do his legs tensed this was the moment his right hand slipped to his left sleeve mckennah nodded to artie once more the wailing rose in volume two people maybe three were howling in pain the bodyguard pushed pellam forward roughly he set his teeth together and stepped forward pulling the letter opener from his sleeve artie pushed the door open stepped inside hed slash first at artie aiming for his eyes then try for the gun hed pellam stopped just over the threshold frozen gripping the letter opener what is this he glanced back at the developer and his thug mckennah impatiently motioned him forward and following the tacit order pellam began to walk forward but he did so very carefully it was hard to maneuver through the sea of babies across the room was a pale obese woman in a stained blue tank top and tan shorts who sat rocking the loudest of the screamers the infant theyd heard from the hall trying to feed the baby a frito the woman stared at them in angry shock who the fuckre you mckennah nodded toward pellam then said to his bodyguard okay give it to him the man handed pellam his betacam do it mckennah urged pellam shook his head not understanding half of the babies were in cardboard boxes and the rest wandered or crawled about playing with broken toys or blocks on the floor sat plastic bottles of orange diet soda and coke some had tipped over and spilled two of the children struggled to open one like young animals trying to crack open a coconut ammonia from dirty diapers wafted through the room who the fuck are you the woman repeated shouting you want me to call the cops roger mckennah said petulantly sure why dont you to pellam he said with irritation so go ahead whatre you waiting for he asked go ahead what well what do you think play charles kuralt start filming the developers temper was starting to fray fuck you the fat woman shouted you get out of here one of the babies crawled rapidly over the filthy floor and began playing with pellams boot he picked up the infant and dusted off his blackened hands and knees set him on a blanket why dont you take better care of these kids fuck you too okay well do it your way pellam lifted the betacam started the deck running say maam you mind repeating that im calling the cops but the woman remained seated ignoring the intruders and lost herself in an episode of the young and the restless on the small tv pellam panned slowly around the room having no idea what he would ever do with these shots the squirming infants the junk food and the raised middle finger of a fat woman hardly made the stuff of oral history looking through the eyepiece he asked mckennah you want to tell me what were doing thiss an unlicensed day care center most of the people in the kitchen cant afford a licensed one so they drop their kids off at pigsties like this its a disgrace but theres nothing parents can do if they want to work the woman tossed a handful of corn chips at the feet of one baby who had just started sobbing pellam shot the scene with robust approval mckennah said stonecold pulitzer go go go twenty minutes later they were outside deeply breathing fresher air pellam asked so what the hells going on he pointed at the building im trying to wipe those out of new york places like that theyre a disgrace excuse me do i see some cynicism wondering why roger mckennah wants to do a good deed oh im no mother teresa but that kind of crap doesnt help anybody its in my interest to have good cheap day care centers in this neighborhood day care and clean parks and pools i want parents who can feel safe dropping their kids off and then coming to work in my office buildings i want teenagers to play basketball on nice courts and swim in clean pools so they dont mug my tenants at night selfinterest sure say what you want i dont care i read ayn rand in college and never got over her why did you bring me here because i checked you out youre doing a documentary on the neighborhood and you were going to trash me like everybody else does thats what you think im tabloidmagnet and im fucking sick of it i want to make sure you tell the whole story nobody has an inkling what im doing for the neighborhood which is what how bout the public park im renovating at my personal fucking expense on fortyfifth street and the pool repairs for the department of parks and recreation that i guaranteell be finished by the time the schoolsre out next year and the new day care center on thirtysixth and the wait on thirtysixth and tenth on the corner louis baileys building the supposed harem for mckennahs mistresses yeah thats the place im turning three floors there into the best day care center in the country the parents show theyre gainfully employed or looking for work and their kids stay for five bucks a day everything included food games montessori tutors books and i suppose it was just a coincidence that the building next door burned down it didnt have anything to do with the tower mckennahs temper flared again listen you may be a hotshot in tinseltown but thats slander ill sue your goddamn ass i have never in my life torched a building you can check every one of my projects going back to day one ill go through the list building by building with you what about the tunnel you didnt torch the building to put it in mckennah frowned you know about the tunnel and i know about your deal with jimmy corcoran the developer blinked in surprise then said well you sure as hell dont know too much about it the tunnel doesnt go under the lot that burned theres a con ed substation under there it jogs west under the day care center building which i happen to own oh baileys building sure i leased subsurface rights from corcoran but i could care less about the other property if you know so damn much about deeds and public records why the hell didnt you just look up the owner and go spy on him pellam explained about the st augustus foundation its fake i thought you were the ultimate owner thats what i was looking for in your office some connection mckennah was no longer angry he nodded musing using a notforprofit to hide ownership thats damn clever theres no chance for passthrough profits so the attorney general wouldnt pay much attention to it he said this with admiration and seemed to file the idea away for future use the board members of the foundation are fake but the lawyer im working with said itd take weeks to trace who really runs the place mckennahs laugh was loud find yourself a new lawyer you can do better hell yes i could do it in a couple hours but why should i whats in it for me thats the most important thing for mr mckennah you dont have to play fair but you have to play lets do some horsetrading pellam said coyly keep talking youve got leaks in your company right i dont know do i well i knew all about your jimmy corcoran deal didnt i mckennah said nothing for a moment as he scrutinized pellam you can give me a name you deliver pellam said ill deliver they rose in silence to the velvet heaven of highrise new york on the seventyfirst floor of mckennahs flagship building on the upper east side the developer led him through a maze of offices and deposited him with a bushyhaired welldressed nervous man elmore pavone nodded an uneasy greeting realizing he was about to receive yet another burden upon his sloping shoulders but it was a burden being placed there by roger mckennah himself and would therefore remain firmly affixed until he had solved whatever problem it represented the developer explained to pavone about the arson and the st augustus foundation the adjutant too seemed impressed with this illicit use of nonprofit corporations pellam said i think its corcoran whos behind the foundation mckennah and pavone got a big laugh out of this the developer said thiss way way outa corcorans league hes a putz the phrase smalltime was invented for him pellam cocked his eyebrow yeah i heard he negotiated you under the table oh did you on the tunnel deal taking a cut of the action when he granted you the easement mckennah blinked in astonishment how the hell do you know all this stuff word on the street pellam said is it true or not the developer smiled yeah corcoran gets a cut of the profits but the way the contracts reads is that he gets one percent of the profit quote deriving from his property that means he gets a piece of the action from any money i make from the tunnel not the tower the deal with the city is that im leasing the tunnel to the transit authority for a token rental ten bucks a year so jimmy corcorans share is ten cents a year the developer added ill always be one step ahead of punks like jimmy corcoran i was in an irish gang in the kitchen too you know the difference is i graduated not a great guy to have as an enemy pellam pointed out corcoran mckennah laughed again you hear about the gophers pellam nodded the hells kitchen gang that so fascinated etties grandfather you know who finally broke their back enlighten me pellam said not the cops not the city lord knows the feds didnt do shit it was business that broke em up the new york central railroad they hired pinkerton and in six months the gang was history if corcoran hassles me ill tell you that little shit is going down hard pellam said well if its not him then whos behind the foundation pavone and mckennah conferred assuming the motive for torching the building was that it was landmarked pavone mused the only reason you would clear a landmarked building was to put up something new to build something new youd have to file applications for construction permits and p z variances and an environmental impact statement mckennah nodded and explained to pellam that builders often had to wait months before getting construction permits for major projects in the city planning and zoning variances which necessitated public hearings and epa and utility waivers were sometimes required too these applications would have to be filed as soon as possible to minimize the time the owner had to hold property that produced no income and yet on which steep taxes were levied there was some risk to the arsonist that the police or a fire marshal might find the applications but in a city bureaucracy as unwieldy as new yorks arson investigators would probably be content with checking only the ownership of record foregoing deeper scrutiny especially if they had a suspect in custody mckennah nodded to pavone who snatched up the phone and spoke in cryptic terms of art to an underling he jotted some notes in three minutes he hung up got it no p z but a white plains construction company applied for a building permit for west thirtysixth street the site of the fire two days ago morrone brothers on route mckennah nodded seemed to recognize the name pavone continued theyre going to put up a sevenstory parking garage on the lot that burned and the two lots next to it parking pellam whispered all this death and horror for a parking lot so john doe sets up the st augustus foundation buys the two vacant lots torches the property on the third and builds his garage i want john doe pellam said how do we find him whod do morrones steel work the developer asked pavone bronx superstructures giannelli no no mckennah barked in westchester in connecticut lets think tighter here elm come on whoever it iss got to keep some distance from the city youre right okay okay probably itd be bedford building and foundation no mckennah shook his head vehemently theyre doing the metro north job they dont have the capacity to do that and a garage come on think then how about hudson steel yonkers yes mckennah snapped his fingers and picked up the phone dialing from memory a few seconds later he muttered into the receiver roger mckennah here is he in in the time it took to drop another phone call like a redhot drill bit the contractor was on the line hi tony yeah yeah mckennahs rolling eyes suggested how eagerly the mans tail was wagging okay okay friend im in kind of a hurry heres what it is dont fuck with me okay you gimme answers and youll do our new dock in greenwich no bidding no nothing yeah pick yourself up off the floor yeah lucky you now i hear morrones the general on a garage in the city west thirtysixth st augustus foundations the owner what dyou mean its supposed to be hushhush therere no fucking secrets from me tony youre subbing the steel right you meet anybody from st augustus well check it out and call me and i mean in three minutes and tony did i tell you im budgeting one point three million for the dock job mckennah hung up hell call back so thats my part of the deal now its your turn whos the fucking spy whos leaking my secrets pellam said when i was over at the tower a little while ago taking that tour of your office tour the developer said wryly pellam continued i noticed one of the secretaries in the rental office kay haggerty i saw her nameplate the flash in mckennahs eyes explained that voluptuous miss haggerty was more than a secretary kay mckennah asked what about her shes a nice kid she may be but shes also your leak impossible shes a hard worker and ive he groped for a euphemism i trust her completely why dyou think shed be spying on me because shes jimmy corcorans girlfriend i saw her last week in the bar and grill she was sitting on his lap the location scout turned filmmaker paced high in the midtown sky looking out roger mckennahs perfectly clean windows his nokona boots silently pressed their narrow silhouettes into the lush blue carpet it seemed to him that here seventy stories above the streets the air was rarified he felt breathless but he supposed that wasnt altitude or corporate power but just the residue of smoke in his lungs from the fire at baileys flanked by a billionaire and his ruthless associate pellam paced minutes passed like days then finally the telephone chirped the developer dramatically snagged the phone from its cradle the way he probably always did when others were present he listened then put his palm over the mouthpiece and looked at pellam got em he jotted a note and hung up showed it to pellam this name mean anything to you pellam stared at the paper for a long moment im afraid it does he said twentyseven yo look man her she the bitch work at that place fo kids man dont be talking bout her that way she okay my brother he all fucked up and he stay there a month was a cluckhead got hisself off rock you know what im saying this nigger say she a bitch all yall think that be a okay place but all kinda shit go on there why you dissing me i aint dissing you i just saying she aint no bitch got a minda her own and look out for people is what im saying carol wyandotte sat on the pungent creosotesoaked pilings overlooking the murky hudson and listened to the young men lope past on their way south where were they headed it was impossible to tell to jobs as forklift operators to direct an independent film like john singleton or young spike lee to pull on throwaways take a box cutter and mug a tourist in times square when she heard the exchange she thought as shed said recently to john pellam oh he doesnt mean bitch that way but apparently he did anyway who was she to say anything carol had been wrong before about the people whose lives shed wedged her way into she sat on this pier under a torrid sun and looked at the ships cruising up and down the hudson tugs few pleasure boats a yacht a ubiquitous circle line cruise ship painted in the colors of the italian flag moved slowly past the tourists on board were still excited and eager for scenery but then their voyage had just begun how enthusiastic would they be hot and hungry in three hours one thing was different about carol wyandotte today she had pulled up the sleeves of her sweatshirt revealing rather pudgy arms she couldnt recall the last time shed appeared barearmed in public already a slight blush of sunburn covered her skin she looked down and turned her right arm over gazing at the terrible mass of scars she rubbed her hand absently over this ruined part of her body then buried her eyes in the crook of her arm and let the tears soak the skin the car door slammed some distance away and by the time she counted obsessively to fifty she heard footsteps rustling through the grass they hesitated then continued when she reached seventyeight in her count she heard the voice it was of course john pellams mind if i join you the property was willed to a charity years ago carol told him hugging her knees to her chest and then got transferred to the outreach center i was working in the main office then and saw those three lots on the books of the charity the ones at and thirtysixth then i noticed mckennahs surveying team working in the block where the tower is now i asked around and heard a rumor he was going to build that neighborhood was a nightmare then but i knew what was coming i knew the value of those three lotsd skyrocket in a couple of years of course none of the board of the charity would dare even set foot in the kitchen they had no clue what was going on so i went to them and said we had to dump them fast because thered been some reporters doing stories about teenage hookers and pushers and homeless squatting in the buildings and they believed you oh you bet all i had to say was that if the media got hold of the fact that the yoc owned them the publicityd be devastating they were horrified at the thought of bad press they all are rabbis priests philanthropists ceos doesnt matter theyre all cowards so the board dumped the lots at a sacrifice she laughed the broker called it a fire sale price you bought them yourself she nodded with drug money my ex and id stashed away i set up the phoney st augustus foundation learned how to do that when i was a legal secretary in boston i also knew i couldnt tear down the building because it was landmarked so i just held it then i met sonny how he stayed at the yoc for a couple years after his time in juvenile detention for burning down his mothers house and killing his mothers boyfriend and pellam continued you also knew ettie sure the woman confessed i was her landlord i had copies of her rent checks and of her handwriting i sent this black woman who looked sort of like her to get the insurance application paid her a few hundred dollars i used my master key to get into etties apartment while she was out shopping i found her passbook pellam looked over the flat grassy land around them and you took the money out of her account the same woman who got the insurance application made the withdrawals and the note they found on sonnys body about ettie he was just supposed to plant it at one of the fires so the police would find it i forged that too but why you cant take any money out of the foundation she laughed ah pellam youre so hollywood you think every crook has to steal ten million bucks worth of gold or a hundred million in bonds like in a bruce willis movie lifes more modest than that no with the garage the foundationd make a good profit and id hire myself as executive director i could make seventy eighty thousand a year without the attorney general batting an eye add some petty cash an expense account and thered still be enough money left to actually give some away to the poor folks in hells kitchen she offered a grim smile not contrite enough for you m i the wolf eyes were like pale ice pellam you know the only times ive cried i mean really cried in the past year five minutes ago thinking about you and the morning after we spent the night together after i stole those tapes from your apartment i took the subway to work i sat in the car and cried and cried i was almost hysterical i thought what kind of life i mightve had with somebody like you but it was too late then a car drove past and they heard powerful bass beat from the radios speakers that song again its a white mans world slowly the beat faded pellam stared at the womans horribly scarred arms he found himself saying but you didnt cry for ettie did you oh thats the point pellam carol said bitterly cry for ettie washington all she could ever be is a victim god gave her that role hell half the people in this city are victims and the other half are perpetrators thats never going to change pellam never never never havent you caught on yet it doesnt matter what happens to ettie if she didnt go to jail for this shed go to jail for something else or shed get evicted and move into the shelter or onto the street she wiped her eyes that boy whos following you around ismail the one you think you can save the one you think you have this connection with the minute he realizes youre no good to him alive hed knife you in the back steal your wallet and have the money spent by the time you died oh you look so placid staring at the grass there but youre pretty horrified to hear me say things like that arent you well im not a monster im realistic i see whats around me nothings going to change i thought it might once but no the only answers to get out get as far away with money or with miles as you can the tapes you stole whyd you give them back to me i thought by confessing to the smaller crime you wouldnt suspect me of the bigger one she moved her hand within a millimeter of pellams didnt touch him i didnt want anybody to die but it happened that way it always happens that way at least in places like hells kitchen it does cant you just let it go pellam said nothing moved his hand and touched the point of his nokona lifted off a dry curled leaf please she said pellam was silent she said ive never had a home all ive had are the wrong men and the wrong women her whisper was desperate when she saw pellam rise carol too stood no dont go please then she glanced toward the highway where the three police cars were parked she smiled faintly almost relieved it seemed as if shed finally received bad news long anticipated i had to pellam said he nodded at the cars carol slowly turned back to him you know poetry yeats some i guess easter pellam shook his head she said theres a line in it too long a sacrifice can make a stone of the heart its my theme song carol laughed hollowly the circleline was long out of sight hooking past battery park carol suddenly tensed and swayed closer as if about to embrace and kiss him for an instant compassion stirred in john pellam and it occurred to him that perhaps the harms carol had endured were just as deep and numerous as those she had inflicted but then he saw ettie washington betrayed by billy doyle and by so many others just like carol wyandotte he stepped coldly away a horn brayed over the water resonating from the moran tug that pushed a barge as long as a football field through the roiling current pellam glanced at the sunlight shattered on the waves the horn blared again the pilot was signaling to a fellow sailor steaming upriver carol whispered something pellam didnt hear a single word it seemed and her pale eyes turned to the skyline remaining on this vista as she stepped backward so placidly that she tumbled into the graygreen water and was swept deep into the barges undertow before he could take a single step toward her twentyeight the story was big the suicide of the youth center director whod hired the mad pyromaniac this was the classic stuff of the new york post and geraldo the live at five broadcast showed the coast guard cutters and the tiny blue police boats searching new york harbor for carol wyandottes body the associated press got the most dramatic shot which featured ellis and liberty islands in the background s they lifted the womans body from the water pellam saw the picture in the new york times her eyes were closed he remembered how pale they were as pale as her skin after all those hours in the cold water wolf eyes the charges against ettie were dropped that part of the story was almost nonnews except for a bite that brought the tabloids into play roger mckennah owned a piece of property right next to the building shed lived in the one that had burned everybody was eager to developerbash of course but even the most zealous scoophog couldnt find any tie linking him and the arson one network even ran a glowing story about mckennahs installing a hightech day care facility in the neighborhood the news account featuring a lurid videotape of an illegal day care center on twelfth avenue dramatic footage that mckennah himself had somehow procured the bulk of the reporting devoted itself to the gala toppingoff ceremony at mckennah tower on saturday good news although former president bush michael jackson and leonardo dicaprio would be unable to attend ed koch david dinkins rudolph guiliani madonna geena davis barbara walters and david letterman had rsvpd in the affirmative at fourfortyfive on friday afternoon john pellam pushed open one of the tall brass doors of the criminal courts building and helped ettie washington outside then down the few stairs to the wide sidewalk they stood on centre street under a clear sky the late afternoon unusually cool for august it was the end of the civil servants day and hundreds of government workers passed before them on their way home you doing okay he asked the gaunt woman fine john just fine though she still limped and occasionally winced at the pain from her broken arm when she adjusted her makeshift sling pellam noticed that his signature was still the only one on her cast the woman had been released from the lockup without ceremony she seemed even more frail than the last time pellam had seen her the guards were somewhat less antagonistic than on previous visits though pellam put that down to lethargy not contrition hey wait a minute the voice called from down the sidewalk they turned to see the rumpled man in windbreaker and jeans he was trotting toward them pellam mrs washington lomax pellam said his face an angry mask of all the batterings hed taken in the last few days bullet streaking across the cheek the fire the irish mafia it was the fire marshals skinny friend the man with the roll of quarters whod inflicted the most painful damage lomax paused hed stopped pellam and ettie as hed planned but now that he had their attention he wasnt sure what to do finally he extended his hand to ettie she took it cautiously he debated about doing the same with pellam but sensed correctly that the gesture would be rejected i dont guess anybody came by to apologize lomax said the president and the first lady just left pellam said i thought lois koepeld send flowers the fire marshal tried maybe ftd was closed ettie didnt participate in the uneasy banter we made a mistake he said im sorry for that and im sorry you lost your home ettie thanked him still wary as she probably had always been around cops and always would be they talked for a few minutes about how shocking it was that a youth director had been behind the arson was a time when nobody wouldve cared what happened in the kitchen lomax said lifes changing slowly but its changing ettie said nothing but pellam knew what her response would be he remembered almost verbatim one of her quotes that fancy building that tower across the street its a nice one but whoevers putting it up i hope for his sake he doesnt expect too much nothing lasts in the kitchen dont you know nothing changes but nothing lasts either lomax handed her a card saying if there was ever anything he could do some help finding a new place public assistance but louis bailey had already found ettie a new apartment she told lomax this and i dont really need anything she began but pellam shook his head and touched her shoulder meaning lets not be too hasty here bailey was perhaps a bad lawyer but pellam was confident he could toy with the citys gears well enough to negotiate a generous settlement then lomax was gone and pellam and ettie stepped to the curb several taxis seeing a black woman and anticipating a harlem or bronxbound fare sped past them this infuriated pellam though ettie took it in stride she winced in pain and pellam suggested lets sit for a minute he gestured toward a dark green bench you know what this part of town used to be john no idea five points dont think ive ever heard of that when the gophers were ruling hells kitchen this neighborhood was just as dangerous maybe worse grandpa ledbetter told me did i ever tell you about his gangster scrapbook he kept all kinds of clippings in it i dont think you ever mentioned that no pellam looked out over the parks and neoclassical courthouses the money you had saved up in your savings account it ws so you could find your daughter wasnt it louis told you about her pellam nodded i wasnt honest with you about that either john im sorry but the fact is i said id let you interview me because i thought maybe shed see me on tv down in florida or wherever she is shed see me and give me a call you know ettie that confession to lomax was a nice try the woman looked in her purse and extracted a handkerchief pellam remembered that she washed them in perfumed water and let them dry on a thin string above the bathtub she wiped her eye that was the one thing that hurt me so much that youd be thinking i lied to you or i tried to hurt you never thought that for a second you shouldve ettie scolded that was the whole point you shouldve gone home to california like you were supposed to and stayed out of harms way you shouldve gone and you shouldve stayed gone you thought that if you confessed then the killerd give up wouldnt try to hurt me again its the same thing billy doyle did confessing so your brother wouldnt get killed what he did gave me the idea she explained see i knew i wasnt the one who hired that psycho to burn down the building but somebody did and they were still out there and as long as you kept poking around that somebody was gonna try and hurt you ettie gazed at the elaborate verdigris crown of the woolworth building sprouting gargoyles finally she said they took so much away from me john my billy doyle got taken away by his own nature and some crazy man with a gun took my frankie and elizabeth got taken off by some fancy man even my neighborhood the developers and rich peoplere taking it i didnt want em to take you too i couldntve stood that i thought hell ill be out of jail in a few years then maybe youll still want to talk to me keep putting me on tape and listening to my stories oh maybe you wouldnt and idve understood that but id rather you were alive and well she laughed a frail laugh that was the little bit i wanted to save for myself see sometimes you can fool em oh yes yes sometimes you can im tired i think id like to be getting home now pellam strode into the street directly into the path of an empty cab which squealed to a halt a foot from him pellam escorted ettie forward past three burly men hurrying a manacled prisoner toward the courts the prisoner was the only one of the quartet who nodded respectfully at the elderly woman ettie nodded back they climbed into the cab the pakistani driver looked at pellam inquiring silently about their destination hells kitchen pellam answered he blinked pellam repeated it but the cabby just shook his head thirtyfourth street and ninth avenue pellam said his sunken eyes gazed at pellam a moment longer then he stabbed the meter and they clattered off madly through the busy streets twentynine the next evening pellam and louis bailey stood in the lawyers newly painted office they were in identical poses leaning out an open window squinting the governor bailey said no i dont think so pellam responded though it had been almost twenty years since pellam had been a resident of the empire state and he had only a vague idea of what any governor past or present looked like im sure ten bucks pellam bet it was hardly a lock but confidence he had it on good authority is everything uhm five they shook at the far end of the block the limo deposited its dignitary whoever it might be on the red carpet of mckennah towers main entrance and the tuxedoed gentleman and several bodyguards entered the building the plate bailey said read ny its probably a mets pitcher then it sure as hell wouldnt say number one bailey countered sadly the long black lincoln vanished around the corner bailey closed the window currently playing across the street was perhaps the only toppingoff ceremony that had ever been held on ground level not being able to fit mckennahs six thousand invitees on the roof of the tower the ceremony was taking place in the buildings theater a lavish place intended for fullproduction broadway musicals and plays tonight the placed rocked with mtv music lasers banks of video monitors dolby surroundsound computer graphics pouring a very small glass of the jug wine pellam tuned in again to louis bailey the man was ebullient and couldnt stop talking about the case while in a dim corner of the freshly painted office ismail in his tricolor windbreaker sat leafing through an old limp comic he was wearing his new nikes ive got to meet somebody he called to ismail and you should be getting back to the outreach center yo inaminute cuz one of mckennahs personal secretaries had called earlier and asked if pellam would like to attend the ceremony hed declined but agreed to stop by at nine mckennah it seemed had a memento the developer thought pellam might like pellam assumed it was something from historic hells kitchen maybe unearthed when the foundation for the tower had been dug pellam diehard winnebago dweller didnt have much interest in collectibles but he supposed there was also the chance it was a nice check for blowing the whistle on corcorans girlfriend or taking such stunning footage of the illegal daycare center he stood lets go ismail the boy yawned i aint tired time to go the boy stretched and walked to bailey slapped his palm yo homes holmes the perplexed lawyer asked well goodnight watson ismail frowned then said later yes well later to you too young man pellam and ismail stepped out into the darkness of thirtysixth street the crowds were inside the tower by now and the limos were parked elsewhere the sense of emptiness was strong baileys being the only remaining residential building between ninth and tenth avenues mckennahs choice to build his castle here hadnt magically turned this neighborhood into populated civilization across the street the construction site itself was obscured by bunting and banners which fluttered in the hot night breeze it was dark cordoned off the only sound was the faint music from the theater empty huh he asked whatcha say cuz the street empty straight up the boy yawned again they passed a large bulldozer parked where etties building had stood whatll happen to the block now he mused ismail shrugged dunno who care they walked toward the theater where mckennah or his assistant was going to meet him it was an attached building not part of the tower itself and it rose eighty feet into the air above a sleek glassy entranceway filled with marble and granite a sort of egyptian motif colors were sand maroon green the lobby was empty now the festivities were underway as he passed the construction site surrounding the theater he peered at the landscaping no grass had been planted yet but this evening the dirt was covered with astroturf and studded with redwood planters containing palms trees pellam paused whassup pellam you go on to the yoc ismail ive got to meet somebody naw he whined ima hang with you cuz uhuh time for bed shit pellam watch the language now get going his round face grimaced okay later cuz they slapped palms and the boy walked slowly east the toobig basketball shoes flopped loudly as he reluctantly headed toward the uptown street he looked back waved pellam slipped through a gap in the fence and walked over the spongy fake grass what is that he looked more closely at what hed seen from the sidewalk the workers had anchored the potted plants to the handles on the exit doors looping heavy rope through them he supposed this was to keep the locals from walking off with the vegetation but the effect of what theyd done was to tie the fire doors shut and to tie them shut pretty damn tight with coils and coils of thick rope of the twenty emergency doors only one wasnt tied closed it was slightly ajar from it came the mute sounds of applause and laughter and the solid thud of bass from the musicians he walked to it and looked inside the doors didnt open onto the theater itself but into a fire stairwell that pellam guessed led up to the theater and the loge and the balconies the corridor was dark except for the bulbs in the exit signs glowing eerily the interior doors were chocked open and he caught glimpses of red velvet seats and walls and maroon carpet then something on the wall of the corridor caught his eye stepped closer he saw that it was a rumpled sheet of paper a map of the west side of manhattan it looked familiar and a moment later pellam understood why it was similar to the one theyd found after the fire in baileys office the one on which sonny had marked all his fires only on this map the last target wasnt the javits center it was mckennah tower suddenly pellams eyes stung and he caught a whiff of astringent fumes like the cleanser in baileys office several days ago he remembered smelling it just before the light bulb exploded but of course it wasnt cleanser at all it was that homemade napalm and here was its source right in front of him four drums of the stuff they lined the wall the tops were off a noise behind him he turned abruptly the young blond man stood with his head cocked a mad smile was on his face and his eyes danced in the reflected light from the tower joe buck he whispered pellam pellam im sonny its so nice to meet you at last the colt had already cleared pellams belt and was halfcocked when sonny swung the long wrench and connected with pellams forearm the bone gave with a crack and the blow was so hard it laid open a large patch of skin blood flew and pellam eyes rolling back in his head collapsed back into the tunnel gasping hitting his head on the side of an oil drum which rang muted like a bell on a foggy day sonny set aside the wrench and slipped pellams gun into his waistband then from his pockets he took a pair of handcuffs and a cigarette lighter thirty pellams first thought theres no pain why doesnt it hurt its loose my arms loose blood flowed from the gash on his arm sonny a caste mark in pellams blood on his forehead bent down fishing in his pocket he emerged with a small silver key for the cuffs his hands shook his wispy hair floated around his head like water why no pain pellam thought staring at his shattered arm if youre wondering who was in that lawyers office the crazy young man said matteroffactly that was your friend alex the snitchbitch wheeled him from my place in an oil drum bent him nearly double now that was an unpleasant trip for him ill bet and left him under the tanning lamp had to get all you faggot cowboys off my back he opened one latch on the cuff sonny nodded toward the theater thisll be the last one come on front row seat sonny grabbed pellam by the collar and pulled him to his feet were going out together joe buck fucking antichrist you me and about five thousand other good folk he kicked an oil drum over and the soapy liquid flowed through the corridor and into the theater itself the second drum followed this is my juice he said matter of factly i invented it myself see you couldnt do this with gas alone gas is shitty low flashpoint big flare cool fire and then its over with i knew this pyro one time sonny began to unlatch the second ring of the cuff his hands shook badly he paused inhaled deeply while it nauseated pellam the smell of the liquid seemed to calm sonny down he began working on the cuff again he continued he used gasoline thought he was soooo cool one time he had this job on the third floor of an old tenement he takes two fivegallon cans up douses the place and breaks a lightbulb so when the guy comes in and flicks on the light up he goes then he starts going through the guys drawers looking for jewelry or something what he doesnt realize is that gas vaporsre heavier than air and while hes fucking around upstairs the gas fumes are flowing down to the basement where theres guess what tadah a pilot light in the water heater i think they found part of his skeleton pellam choked there was probably a hundred gallons of liquid flowing into the building pellam remembered what lomax had told him about the happy land fire a mere gallon of gas had turned the place into an inferno lets go midnight cowboy sonny touched pellams shattered arm the bone shifted and at last a searing jolt of pain shot up into pellams shoulder and neck and face in pure reaction he lashed out with his left palm catching sonny in the jaw it was a weak blow but it caught the young man by surprise and he stepped back a few feet you shit he shoved pellam against the wall on his knees pellam scooped up a handful of the napalm splashing it into sonnys face it missed his eyes but splashed on his mouth and nose and he stumbled backwards screaming in pain he dropped the cigarette lighter which pellam grabbed he started for the young man but sonny was madly pulling the colt from his belt why did you do that he cried he sounded incredulous his cheek was bright red his mouth was swollen but his eyes were clear and brimmed with madness he lifted the pistol pulled the trigger pellam turned and stumbled through the door sonny wouldnt have realized that the gun was single action you had to cock it before you could shoot in the delay pellam staggered outside and shouted for help there mightve been a person at the end of the block looking toward him he wasnt sure he tried to wave with his good arm but felt the gritty kiss of the ends of the broken bone in his other nearly fainted pellam shouted again but in his haze he couldnt tell if the person if anyone was actually there heard or noticed him sonny spit the chemical from his mouth and followed glancing back pellam had an image of a white face slits of blue eyes the white hand holding the black pistol white hair dancing like smoke oh man that hurts he gripped his arm tighter and stepped into the middle of the street the twin eyes of a car flicked toward him the vehicle approached and then paused choosing not to see him the driver stared ahead with the uncomfortable distraction of someone late for a dinner party and sped on pellam continued away from the theater back toward the tower itself a wave of pain flowed through him sweat flowed every jar of his boots multiplied the agony he wanted to pause just catch his breath dont stop keep going a glance behind sonny was stumbling too but he was gaining on him pellam assumed hed figured out how the gun worked in a minute or so hed be close enough to shoot pellam ran through an alley toward the back of the tower speeding over glints from bits of foil and bottles and syringes crack vials the sparkle of ground glass smoothed into asphalt the blond mans feet sounded behind him crack a bullet shattered the window of a deserted tenement another shot somebody might hear and call the police but no of course not whod pay any attention this was just the soundtrack to an average night in hells kitchen ignore it keep walking eyes down people would be telling themselves stay away from the window come back to bed lover its a white mans world thirtyone pellam staggered out of the alley turned into the middle of thirtyfifth street he was now a block away from the theater and its festivities and this street was even emptier than thirtysixth the only motion he could see was moths beating themselves to death on the heavy lenses of street lamps the sound of rock music was faint at least he thought hed led sonny away from the people in the theater the guests would smell the liquid and evacuate the building pellam cocked his head and found himself in the middle of the street on his knees looking back he saw sonny lips blood red and puffed up from the chemical getting closer the handcuff dangling from his wrist pellam stood and struggled again down the street which was in shadow like the boardedup tenements and the construction site and the alleys he came to the fence that surrounded the base of the tower and slipped through a gap in the chainlink gate here in the construction site hed be safe it was very dark sonnyd never find him mong the construction sheds stacks of lumber and plywood compressors equipment scaffoldings decorated with red white and blue bunting plenty of shadows in which he could lie plenty of vehicles to hide under places where he could stop running and lie down stop the terrible pain he staggered to a small metal shed and climbed into the murky space beneath sonny approached the chain link fence rattled once did the young man just test it and pass on or did he enter no no he slipped inside too his footsteps were nearby the steps passed very close hey joe buck whyre you running he sounded perplexed were going together the jingle of the handcuffs you and me pellam opened his eyes and saw feet in tattered white shoes moving slowly over the gravel and dirt one shoe was untied and the laces dangled gray and muddy he thought of hector ramirez and the stolen nikes sonny padded over the gravel my blood pellam realized hes following the trail of my blood to my hiding place but why hasnt he found me yet it was too dark he supposed metal grated on metal a resonating sound like a steel drum a bell then a gushing sound as liquid began flowing on the ground he clutched his arm more tightly what was sonny doing a second gush joined the first then another a pause then a gunshot sounded very nearby pellam jumped in shock there was a huge flash of light and pellam realized that sonny had opened drums of gas or diesel fuel in the construction site and set the liquid ablaze with the gun what had been dark now became dazzlingly bright ah pellam there clearly visible in the shocking yellow light was the trail of pellams blood leading to his cave still he remained where he was no way he thought can i outrun him in the fiery illumination he could now see sonny prowling madly in the far end of the construction site not far from the stillwrapped statue looking for pellam pellam felt heat from all around him the burning fuel was flowing into the scaffolding and piles of wood setting everything aflame and two no three of the wooden sheds then another a truck caught fire tires burst and melted amid vibrant orange flames and turbulent black smoke wood snapped like bullets and there were explosions as fuel tanks gas and propane cracked apart firing hissing buckshot through the night the whole site half block long was suddenly awash with fire more trucks ignited the sheds stacks of wood and rich dark paneling destined perhaps for roger mckennahs penthouse crackled and blazed he saw timbers spontaneously sprout flames and the roiling hot wind passed the fire to pallets resting against the shed where he hid pellam scrabbled into a corner away from the tempestuous inferno the noise of the fire was like a subway train at this moment when the entire lot was enveloped in flames when there was virtually nothing left untouched by the fire a small half moon of red white and blue bunting ignited unlike the massive tide of flame in the yard this scrap burned placidly the hot rising air carried it aloft and it was this shred of patriotic cloth not the gallons of fiery gasoline or stacks of blazing wood that finally ignited mckennah tower itself the burning scrap wafted onto a stack of cardboard boxes in the open atrium the cartons began to glow then burn brightly in a few minutes the flames were in the lobby rolling over artists conceptions of offices over the tall palm trees that had so astonished ettie washington when she watched them being delivered over piles of linoleum and wallpaper buckets of paint more propane tanks on parked forklifts and highclimbers exploded shooting shrapnel throughout the lobby and shattering the huge plate glass windows fire everywhere the paper wrapping of the statue burned away but pellam stumbling toward the gate still couldnt make out what it was finally he could wait no longer the flames were too close the heat too much he eased from his hiding space as the window of the shed popped out in a quiet burst and scattered scalding glass around him only one exit remained the way he entered though the chain link sonny knew about that but there was nowhere else to go the plaza and atrium were completely engulfed as he staggered out from his hiding place and made his way to the fence he saw a rich glow in windows on the second floor of the tower then the third then the sixth or eighth then higher the fire had been sucked quickly into the gullet of the building huge sheets of thermopane windows burst glass shards and black pellets of plastic rained down he stumbled to the chainlink and still could not see sonny a stone of the heart he managed to squeeze through the opening in the gate but one side sprung out of his grip and struck his broken arm for a moment he passe out completely and then found himself on his hands and knees he inhaled deeply and crawled away from the site into the middle of thirtyfifth street behind him was a tide of yellow flame and tornadoes of orange flame and spouts of hissing blue flame windows exploded and walls collapsed heavy bulldozers and sheds and dump trucks settled down to die then the hands got him sonnys snakelike grip ratcheted the cuff around his good wrist the young man began pulling him back into the job site come on come on sonny cried pellam expected to feel the blow of a gunshot but sonnyd tossed the colt aside he had something else in mind and was steering for a pit in the dirt near a contractors shed it was filled with flaming gasoline he dragged pellam toward it he fell against his shattered arm and fainted again momentarily when he came to he found that sonnys manic strength had pulled him to the brink of the pit isnt it beautiful isnt it lovely sonny called staring into the swirling fire and smoke at his feet he reached down just as pellam kicked out with a boot sonny slipped on the edge of the trough and fell up to his waist into the burning fuel he began to scream and in his crazed state jerking back and forth thrashing began to pull pellam after him blinded by the smoke seared by the flames pellam had no leverage he felt himself being tugged closer and closer to the inferno a memory of etties voice came to him sometimes my sister elsbeth and med go where they led the lambs along eleventh avenue over to the slaughterhouses on fortysecond street they had a judas lamb you know bout that itd lead the others to the slaughter we used to yell at the judas and throw rocks to lead him off but it never worked thats one lamb knew his business and then he heard pellam pellam pellam a high voice panicked a vague image through the smoke it was a person a thick coat of smoke enveloped him he dropped to the ground sonnys thrashing body pulled him closer pellam squinted looking through the smoke ismail tears running down his cheeks stood at the fence here he over here he was gesturing madly toward pellam then another figure they both eased through the chainlink get back pellam shouted jesus hector ramirez said and grabbed pellams wrist just before he slipped over the edge into the pool of flame ramirez pulled a black gun from his waistband pressed the muzzle against the links of the cuffs and fired five or six times he hardly heard the shots in fact he hardly heard the roar of the flames or ramirezs voice as he pulled pellam way from the fire the only sound in his ears was ismails voice saying you be okay you be okay you be okay thirtytwo the roles were reversed now it was ettie washingtons turn to visit pellam in the hospital unlike him shed had the foresight to bring a present not flowers or candy though something more appreciated she now poured the smuggled wine into two plastic cups and offered him one to your health she said yours he swallowed his in one gulp ettie as he remembered her doing when he gazed at her through the viewfinder of the betacam sipped hers judiciously she was the epitome of a frugal homemaker having learned those skills pellam recalled young from grandmother ledbetter the private room in which pellam now lay was below the one where ettied been arrested and above the room where juan torres the poor child had died where would sonnys body be he wondered the morgue was probably in the basement or maybe he was in the city morgue a routine autopsy then a final trip to potters field would be his fate people keep asking me what happened john asking me because i know you the police that fire marshal reporters too they want to know how you got away from that firebug fella they think you know but youre arent talking miracle pellam offered wryly but pellam wasnt going to complicate the lives of his improbable friends by telling anyone how ismail hadnt gone back to the yoc at all but had hung around waiting to spend more time with pellam had seen sonnys attack and had run up the street to summon hector ramirez well thats between you and the doorpost ettie said echoing a favorite expression of her grandfathers and that fire marshal said something else which i didnt exactly understand he was saying that you might want to think about leaving the city before your name becomes mr unlucky so that what you going to be doing john leaving not hardly weve got a film to finish that boy came by to see you when you were asleep ismail ettie nodded gone now has quite a mouth on him for a youngster i put him in his place though t lking to grownups that way he said hell be back pellam didnt doubt it i be your friend well i be yours ismail thats the marvelous thing about debts even after you repay them they never go away ettie had also brought him a post the huge headline towering inferno next to an equally huge photo of the flames consuming mckennah tower thered been no deaths fiftyeight people had been injured mostly from smoke inhalation the napalm in the theater had not ignited and the only injuries there were from crowds pushing their way out in panic the most serious was a broken leg received when bodyguards shoved a woman aside to make sure their dignitary escaped before the commoners the governor as it turned out costing pellam a fiver payable to louis bailey the king of gears both greased and clogged the tower was totaled burnt to the ground it was insured of course but the policy covered only the cost of the structure itself not lost profits without the rents from the advertising agency the developer would miss his fourth quarter interest payments on his worldwide loans mckennah and his companies were already preparing papers for the bankruptcy filing the sidebar in the paper read welcome to the club rog curiously none of the pictures of the developer showed anything but a matteroffact businessman who seemed completely blasé about the prospect of losing several billion dollars one shot showed him striding cheerfully into his lawyers office accompanied by an attractive young woman identified only as his personal assistant his eyes were on her hers on the camera the hospital room bristled around pellam and grew dark for a moment pellam slipped a merciful demerol into his mouth he washed it down with wine when he looked at ettie he noticed her face was stern but her expression had nothing to do with mixing alcohol with medicine she said john you did so much for me you almost got yourself killed you shouldve just took off you didnt owe me anything should he say it or not for the past several months pellam had been debating a dozen times hed been on the verge finally he said oh but i do ettie youre looking pretty funny john whatre you talking about i owe you a lot no you dont well its not exactly my debt its my fathers your father i dont even know your father you did you married him after a moment she whispered billy doyle he was my natural father pellam said ettie sat completely motionless it was the only time in all the months that hed known her that he couldnt find a trace of any emotion in her face but how she finally asked pellam told her what hed told to ramirez about his mothers confession her husband being away all the time her lover pellams suspect pedigree ettie nodded billy told me hed had a girlfriend upstate thatd be your mother oh my oh my she thought back her sumptuous memory unreeling he told me that he loved her but she wouldnt leave her husband so he left her and came down here to the kitchen she said she got one letter from him pellam said there was no return address but the postmark was from the general post office on eighth avenue thats why i came to the city to find him or at least to find out about him i wasnt sure whether i wanted to meet him or not i did some digging in public records and found his wedding license application to me to you and your marriage certificate it gave the address of the old tenement on thirtysixth the one we lived in after we got married sure got torn down a few years ago i know i asked around the neighborhood and found out that billy was long gone and that youd moved up the street to the building and you came acalling with that camera of yours why didnt you say anything to me john i was going to but then i found out that hed run out on you i figured it was the last thing youd want to do spend any time talking to me she squinted and looked at his face thats why you remind me of james when ettie had told him about her son a month ago pellam realized hed have to spend some time getting used to the idea that he was no longer an only child he had a sibling a halfbrother ettie she squeezed his arm that billy doyle lets see my husband and your father whats that make us you and me john orphans pellam suggested i was never one to chase after a man when he left i never thought about going after him never looked for him but im curious a coy smile you ever get any clue where he mightve gone off to pellam shook his head nothing ive tried all the recorders of deeds in the area no trace he talked about going back to ireland maybe he did who knows she added there are some of his old friends still around i see em sometimes in some of the taverns we could maybe talk to some of them if you want they mightve heard from him hed have to think about that he couldnt decide he looked out the window and saw gray and brown and buff tenements next to squat warehouses next to shimmering highrises next to the blackened bones of razed buildings west of eighth it occurred to pellam that hells kitchen was in some ways just like his search for billy doyle failure not wholly disappointing hope not wholly desired the white apparition of the southern nurse whod tended ettie last week floated into the room and told ettie she probably ought to leave hes lookin a bit tuckered out she said with that rasping texas drawl of hers pellam thought she had freckles but his vision was still pretty blurry she said honey dont you feel like restin for a bit not really pellam said or thought he did maybe not his eyes closed and the glass drooped in his hand he felt it being taken away smelled a breath of floral perfume and then surrendered to sleep authors note readers interesed in oral histories of manhattan and unable to find john pellams documentary west of eighth at their local video stores might wish to read jeff kisseloffs you must remember this this excellent oral history of manhattan contains a section on hells kitchen which pellam found immensely helpful in
