anne perry cain his brother the sixth book in the william monk series to the people of portmahomack for their great kindness we have read each other as cain his brother g k chesterton chapter mr monk she said then took a deep breath mr william monk he turned from the desk where he had been sitting and rose to his feet the landlady must have let her through the outer chamber yes maam he said inquiringly she took another step into the room ignoring her huge crinoline skirts as they touched against the table her clothes were well cut and fashionable without ostentation but she seemed to have donned them in some haste and without attention to detail the bodice did not quite match the skirt and the wide bow of her bonnet was knotted rather than tied her face with its short strong nose and brave mouth betrayed considerable nervousness but monk was used to that people who sought the services of an agent of inquiry were almost always in some predicament which was too serious or too embarrassing to have dealt with through the more ordinary channels my name is genevieve stonefield she began her voice quivered a little mrs angus stonefield she amended it is about my husband that i must consult you with a woman of her age which he placed between thirty and thirtyfive it most usually was or else a minor theft an unsatisfactory household servant occasionally a debt with older women it was an errant child or an unsuitable match in prospect but genevieve stonefield was a most attractive woman not only in her warm coloring and dignified deportment but in the frankness and humor suggested in her face he imagined most men would find her greatly appealing indeed his first instinct was to do so himself he squashed it knowing bitterly the cost of past misjudgments yes mrs stonefield he replied moving from the desk into the middle of the room which he had designed to make people feel at easeor more accurately hester latterly had persuaded him to do so please sit down he indicated one of the large padded armchairs across the redandblue turkey rug from his own it was a bitter january and there was a fire burning briskly in the hearth not only for warmth but for the sense of comfort it produced tell me what disturbs you and how you believe i may help he sat in the other chair opposite her as soon as courtesy permitted she did not bother to rearrange her skirts they billowed around her in exactly the way they had chanced to fall hoops awry and showing one slender highbooted ankle having steeled herself to take the plunge she had no need of further invitation but began straightaway leaning forward a little staring at him gravely mr monk in order for you to understand my anxiety i must tell you something of my husband and his circumstances i apologize for taking up your time in this manner but without this knowledge what i tell you will make little sense monk made an effort to appear as if he listened it was tedious and in all probability quite unnecessary but he had learned through error to allow people to say what they wished before reaching the purpose of their visit if nothing else it permitted them a certain element of selfrespect in a circumstance where they found themselves obliged to ask for help in an acutely private matter and of someone most of them regarded as socially inferior by dint of the very fact that he earned his living their reasons were usually painful and they would have preferred to have kept the secret when he had been a policeman such delicacy would have been irrelevant but now he had no authority and he would be paid only according to his clients estimate of his success mrs stonefield began in a low voice my husband and i have been married for fourteen years mr monk and i knew him for a year before that he was always the gentlest and most considerate of men without giving the im pression of being easily swayed no one has ever found him less than honorable in all his dealings both personal and professional and he has never sought to take advantage of others or gain by their misfortune she stopped realizingperhaps from monks facethat she was speaking too much his features had never concealed his feelings especially those of impatience anger or scorn it had served him ill at times do you suspect him of some breach in his otherwise excellent character mrs stonefield he asked with as much concern as he was able to pretend it was beginning to appear that her interesting face covered a most uninteresting mind no mr monk she said a little more sharply but the fear was dark in her eyes i am afraid he has been done to death i wish you to find out for me in spite of her desperate words she did not look up at him nothing you can do will help angus now she continued quietly but since he has disappeared and there is no trace of him he is presumed by the law simply to have deserted us i have five children mr monk and without angus his business will very rapidly cease to provide for us suddenly the matter became real and genuinely urgent he no longer saw her as an overwordy woman fussing over some fancied offense but one with a profound cause for the fear in her eyes have you reported his absence to the police he asked her eyes flickered up to his oh yes i spoke to a sergeant evan he was most kind but he could do nothing to help me because i have no proof that angus did not go of his own will it was sergeant evan who gave me your name i see john evan had been monks most loyal friend at the time of his own trouble and would not have dismissed this woman could he have helped her how long since you saw or heard from your husband mrs stonefield he asked gravely the shadow of a smile crossed her features and was gone perhaps it was a reflection in the change in his own expression three days mr monk she said quietly i know that is not long and he has been away from home often before and for longer sometimes up to a week but this is different always before he has informed me and left provision for us and of course he left instructions for mr arbuthnot at his place of business never before has he missed an appointment or failed to leave authority and direction so mr arbuthnot might act in his absence she leaned forward almost unaware of the charming tilting of the hoops of her skirt he did not expect to be gone mr monk and he has contacted no one he felt a considerable sympathy for her but the most practical way he could help was to learn as many of the facts as she was able to give him at what time of the day did you last see him he asked at breakfast about eight oclock in the morning she replied that was january the eighteenth it was now the twentyfirst did he say where he intended going mrs stonefield she took a deep breath and he saw her folded hands in her lap clasp each other more firmly in their neat white gloves yes mr monk he went from home to his place of business from there he told mr arbuthnot that he was going to see his brother did he call upon his brother often he asked it seemed an unremarkable occurrence he was in the habit of visiting him at irregular intervals she replied she looked up staring at him intently as if the meaning of this were so vital to her she could not believe it would not have the same impact on him as long as i have known him she added her voice dropping and becoming husky you see they are twins it is not uncommon for brothers to visit each other mrs stonefield he remarked it only because he could see no reason for her white face or her tense body as she sat uncomfortably on the edge of her chair of course you have been in touch with the other mr stonefield and asked if your husband arrived safely at what time and in what circumstances he left it was barely a question he had already assumed the answer no the word was no more than a whisper what no she repeated with despair her eyes wide blue gray and burningly direct anguss brother caleb is every thing he is not violent brutal dangerous an outcast even among the underworld along the river beyond limehouse where he lives she gave a shuddering sigh i used to beg angus not to keep seeing him but in spite of everything caleb did he felt that he could not abandon him a shadow crossed her face there is something very special about being a twin i suppose i confess it is not something i understand she shook her head a little as if denying her own anguish please mr monk will you find out what happened to my husband for me i she bit her lip but her eyes did not waver i shall need to know your terms in advance my resources are limited i will make inquiries mrs stonefield he spoke before he considered the implications for his own financial status then when i report their results to you we can make arrangements accordingly i shall need certain information from you in order to begin of course i understand i am sorry i do not have a picture of him to show you he did not care to sit for a portrait she smiled with a sudden tenderness that was desperate with pain i think he felt it a trifle vain she took a deep breath and steadied herself he was tall at least as tall as you are she was concentrating fiercely as if bitterly aware she might not see him again and all too soon would she find his appearance fading from its present clarity in her mind his hair was dark indeed his coloring was not unlike yours except that his eyes were not gray but a most beautiful shade of green he had very good features a strong nose and a generous mouth he was quite gentle in manner not at all arrogant but yet no one ever supposed him to be a person with whom one might take liberties he was aware that already she spoke of him in the past the room was full of her fear and the sense of grief to come he considered asking her of stonefields business affairs or the likelihood of his having another woman but he doubted he would receive an answer from her which would be accurate enough to be of any value it would only distress her unnecessarily it would be better to seek some tangible evidence and form his own judgment he rose to his feet and she rose also her face tight with apprehension her chin high ready to argue with him plead if necessary i shall begin inquiries mrs stonefield he promised immediately she relaxed coming as close to a smile as she was capable in her present mind thank you if you will give me your address he asked she fished in her reticule and brought out two cards offering them to him in her gloved hand im afraid i did not think of a letter of authority she looked embarrassed have you any paper he went to the desk opened it and took out a plain white sheet of notepaper a pen ink and blotting paper he pulled out the chair where she might sit while she was writing he glanced at the cards she had given him and saw that the home was on the borders of mayfair a very acceptable area for the gentry the business was south of the river on the waterloo road on the edge of lambeth she finished the letter signed it blotted it carefully and handed it to him looking up at him anxiously while he read it it is excellent thank you he folded it reached for an envelope and placed it inside to keep it from becoming soiled then put it in his pocket she rose to her feet again when shall you begin immediately he replied there is no time to be lost mr stonefield may be in some danger or difficulty but still able to be rescued from it do you think so for a moment hope flared in her eyes then reality returned and with it renewed pain she turned away to hide her emotion from him to save them both embarrassment thank you mr monk i know you mean to offer me comfort she went to the door and he only just reached it in time to open it for her i shall await news she went out and down the step into the street then walked away northwards without looking back monk closed the door and returned to his room he put more coal on the fire then sat down in his armchair and began to consider the problem and what he knew of it it was common enough for a man to desert his wife and children the possibilities were endless without even considering his having come to harmlet alone anything so bizarre and tragic as having been murdered by his own brother mrs stonefield had clearly wanted to believe that monk observed to himself that it was the solution least harmful to her without entirely dismissing it out of hand he was inclined to relegate it to the bottom of the list of possibilities the most obvious answers were that he had simply found his responsibilities overweighing him and run off or that he had fallen in love with another woman and decided to live with her the next most probable was some financial disaster either already occurred or pending in the near future he might have gambled and finally lost more than he could meet or borrowed from a usurer and been unable to repay the interest which would grow day by day monk had seen more than a few victims of such practice and he hated moneylenders with a cold and unremitting passion stonefield might have made some enemy he had good reason to fear or be the victim of blackmail for an indiscretion or even a crime he might be fleeing the law for some misappropriation not yet uncovered or any other offense an accident or a sudden violence not so far traced to him he might have suffered an accident and be lying in hospital or in a workhouse somewhere too ill to have sent his family word it was even conceivable that like monk himself he had been struck on the head with a blow which had obliterated his memory he broke out in a prickle of sweat which a moment after was cold on his skin as he remembered waking up two years before in what he had taken to be a workhouse without the slightest idea who or where he was his past had been an utter blank to him even his face in the glass had been unrecognizable slowly he had pieced together fragments here and there scenes of his youth his journey south from northumberland to london probably when he was nineteen or twentyroughly about the time of the accession of queen victoria although he could not remember it the coronation he knew only from pictures and other peoples descriptions even this much was deduced because he supposed himself to be now in his early forties and it was january of course it was absurd to suppose angus stonefield was in a similar situation such things must happen exceedingly rarely but then murder was fortunately not so common either it was far more probably some sad but ordinary domestic circumstance or a financial disaster he always disliked having to tell a woman such a thing in this case it would be harder than usual because already he had formed a certain respect for her there was a femininity to her which was charming and yet a defiant courage and in all she had told him in spite of her grief and thinly concealed desperation there was no selfpity she had asked for his professional services not begged his compassion if angus stonefield had left her for another woman he was a man whose taste monk did not under stand or share still turning the matter over in his mind he rose stoked the fire and set up the guard then put on his coat and hat and took a hansom cab south from his rooms in fitzroy street down tottenham court road chasing cross road then the strand right at wellington street and across waterloo bridge to the business address on the card mrs stonefield had given him he alighted paid the driver and dismissed him he turned to look at the building the outside appeared prosperous in a discreet fashion either from old money so well known it had no need to advertise or money newly earned but with the tact to remain unostentatious he pushed the front door which was open to the public and was greeted in the room inside by a smart young clerk dressed in stiff wing collar cutaway jacket and shining boots yes sir he inquired summing up monks sartorial elegance and concluding he was a gentleman may i be of service monk was too proud to introduce himself as an agent of inquiry it equated him with the policeman he had been until his irreparable quarrel with his superior only now he had not the authority good morning he replied mrs stonefield has requested me to be of what assistance i may in contacting her husband since he left last tuesday morning he allowed the ghost of a smile to cross his face i hope she is mistaken but she fears some harm may have come to him as he spoke he produced the letter of authority the clerk accepted it read it at a glance and returned it to him the anxiety which he had been holding in check now flooded his face and he looked at monk almost pleadingly i wish we could help you sir indeed i wish with all my heart we knew where he was we require him for the business his presence is essential his voice was rising in earnestness there are decisions to be made for which mr arbuthnot and myself have neither the legal power nor the professional knowledge he glanced around to make sure none of the three young ledger clerks were within earshot and moved a step closer we are at our wits end to know what to do next or how to put people off any longer without their guessing that something is most seriously amiss business is most competitive sir others will seize the chance to profit from our indecision his face grew pinker and he bit his lip do you think that he could have been kidnapped sir it was not among the possibilities that had occurred to monk it would be a most extreme step he replied watching the young mans face he saw nothing in it but fear and sympathy if he knew anything more he was an actor to rival henry living and had missed a career on the stage then he must have been taken ill the clerk said with concern and is even now lying in some hospital unable to contact us he would never wittingly leave us in this way he grew even pinker nor his family either of course that i need hardly say his expression indicated he knew he should have said it to begin with does he have business rivals who might think to profit if he were out of the way monk asked casting his eye discreetly around the tidy wellfurnished room with its desks and shelves of books and files of ledgers the winter sun came in through high narrow windows he still thought a domestic answer more likely oh yes sir the clerk replied with assurance mr stonefield is most successful sir a rare gift he has for knowing what will sell and for precisely how much made a profit where quite a few others would have burned their fingers and did there was a lift of pride in his voice then as he looked at monk a sudden anxiety but always strictly honest he added regarding monk gravely to make sure he understood that theres never been a whisper against him anywhere not in the city not on the exchange the stock exchange monk asked oh no sir the corn exchange he should have asked before he spoke these rivals of mr stonefields he said quickly his voice harder whose business in particular has he taken lately or whose does he threaten well the clerk hesitated unhappily for a moment there was no sound but the scratching of pens and someone shifting his feet i dont like to speak ill the clerk resumed if there is a possibility mr stonefield has been kidnapped then you will do him little service if you remain silent monk snapped the clerk colored yes i understand im sorry sir mr marchmont of marchmont and squires lost out to him rather badly last month but they are large enough they will ride that out he thought hard mr peabody of goodenough and jones took it very badly when we beat them to a very good price about six weeks ago but the only person i know who really suffered was poor mr niven he is no longer in business i am sorry to say took it like a gentleman but very hard for him it was especially with him and mr stonefield being acquaintances socially very sad he shook his head very slightly but having said that sir i cannot imagine mr niven wishing mr stonefield any harm hes not like that at all very decent sort of gentleman just not as clever as mr stonefield perhaps i shouldnt have said anything its its really very hard to know what to do for the best he looked at monk miserably seeking some kind of indication you have done quite the right thing monk assured him without information we cannot even make a judgment let alone pursue the best course as he was speaking he was looking beyond the young man and around the offices the place had every appearance of prosperity several clerks were busy with ledgers accounts business letters to other houses possibly overseas as well they were all smartly dressed with stiff white collars and tidy hair and they looked diligent and content enough in their work nothing was shabby or obviously mended there was no air of discouragement only anxiety a discreet glance one to another he returned his attention to the immediate when was the last occasion on which mr stonefield came into the office three days ago sir the morning of the last day in whichhe bit his lipon which he was seen he eased his neck in his rather tight collar but you will have to ask mr arbuthnot what transpired and he is not here at present i really do not feel able to tell you anything further it is well company business sir he was apologetic and obviously uncomfortable shifting his weight from one foot to the other monk doubted it would have any relevance anyway and was quite content to leave it for the time being but before he took his leave he obtained the address of mr titus niven now no longer in business because of the skill of angus stonefield monk left the offices and walked briskly back along the waterloo road in the sharp wind it still remained the strongest possibility that the answer to angus stonefields disappearance lay in his personal life therefore it was necessary for monk to learn as much about it as he was able however he had no possible grounds to call upon neighbors still less to question them as to stonefields habits or his comings and goings it would hardly be in the best interest of his client having her neighbors gossiping about the fact that her husband was missing and she had called in a person to try to find him was the very last thing she would wish but the fact that there was no crimein fact no acknowledged problem at all was extremely restricting the only course open to him in that direction would be to pursue servants chatter from nearby houses servants frequently knew a great deal more than their masters or mistresses supposed they were most often regarded in much the same light as a favorite piece of furniture without which one would be lost but in front of which discretion was not a consideration he was approaching the river it shone pale under the winter sky the mist rising in wreaths softening the dark shingles edges and carrying the raw smell of sewage on the outgoing tide dark barges and ferries moved up and down it was not the season for pleasure boats he wished he had john evan with him as he had had when he first returned to the police force after his accident and before he had quarreled finally and irreparably with runcorn storming out the instant before runcorn dismissed him evan with his charm and gentleness of manner was so much better at eliciting confidences from people they forgot their natural reticence and shared their thoughts but evan was still with the police so monk could not call upon him for help except when there was an investigation in which he too was involved and was prepared to disclose his information at great risk to himself runcorn would never forgive such an act he would see it as a personal and professional betrayal it had often crossed monks mind that he would like to offer evan a position as his assistant in some future day when he earned sufficient to support a second person but that was only a dream and perhaps a foolish one at present he did not always make enough even for himself there were weeks when he was profoundly grateful for his patroness lady callandra daviot who made up the difference in his income all she asked in return was that he share with her all those cases which had elements of interest for her and they were considerable she was a woman of high intelligence and curiosity decisive opinions and a consuming and generally tolerant interest in human nature in all its manifestations in the past monk had inquired into matters solely at her behest when she felt that an injustice was threatened or had been done to begin with he caught a cab to see mrs stonefield in her own home as he had said he would it would give him a clearer impression of her of the familys wellbeing both financial and social andif he were perceptive enoughalso of the relationships beneath the surface of what she had told him the house was on upper george street on the corner of seymour place just east of the edgware road it took him more than an hour in heavy traffic and a hard soaking rain from the far side of the river to arrive at the other side of mayfair alight and pay the driver it was nearly four oclock and the lamplighters were already out in the thickening dusk he turned his coat collar up and crossed the footpath to knock on the front door at this hour any formal callers would have been and gone if indeed she were receiving callers he shivered and turned to look back at the street it was quiet and eminently respectable rows of similar windows looked out onto neat front gardens areaways were swept clean behind closed back gates would be cellar chutes for coal dustbins scrubbed scullery steps and back door en trances for tradesmen and deliveries was this what angus stonefield wanted or had he become suffocated by its predictability and discretion had his soul yearned for something wilder more exhilarating something that challenged the mind and disturbed the heart and had he been prepared to sacrifice safety the warmth of family as its price had he grown to loathe being known by his neighbors relied upon by his dependents every day every year mapped out before him to a decent and uneventful old age monk felt a sharp sadness that it was such a vivid possibility stonefield would not be the first man to have run away from the reality of love and its responsibilities to grasp instead the illusion and excitement of lust and what might seem like freedom only later to realize it was loneliness another gust of rain soaked him just as he turned back to the door and it opened the fairhaired parlormaid looked at him inquiringly william monk to call upon mrs stonefield he announced dropping his card on the tray she held i believe she is expecting me yes sir if you care to wait in the morning room i shall see if mrs stonefield is at home she replied stepping back for him to enter monk walked through the pleasant hall behind her to wait in the room which he was shown it gave him an opportunity to glance around and make some estimate of stonefields character and circumstancesalthough if he were in difficulties the front rooms where guests were received would be the last to show it monk had known families to live without heat and eat little more than bread and gruel and yet keep up the facade of prosperity the moment visitors called generosity even extravagance was displayed to foster the pretense sometimes it aroused his contempt for the ridiculousness of it at others he was moved to a strange hurting pity that they found it necessary that they believed their worth to their friends lay in such things he stood in the small tidy room in which the maid had left him and looked around it to the outward eye it presented every sign of comfort and good taste it was a little overcrowded but that was the fashion and there was no fire lit in spite of the weather the furniture was solid and the upholstery of good quality and as far as he could see not overly worn he looked more closely at the antimacassars on the backs of the chairs but they were clean and unfaded or rubbed the gas mantles on the walls were immaculate the curtains unfaded in the folds the redandcream turkey carpet was only slightly worn in a passage from doorway to hearth there were no darker patches on the wallpaper to indicate a picture missing the fine china and glass ornaments were unchipped he could see no hairline cracks carefully glued together everything was of good quality and individual taste it reaffirmed the impression of genevieve stonefield he had already formed he was about to begin reading the titles of the books in the oak case when he was interrupted by the return of the maid to conduct him to the withdrawing room he had intended to make a discreet assessment of that room also but as soon as he was through the doorway his entire attention was taken by genevieve stonefield herself she was dressed in a smoky blue gown with darker stripes of velvet around the skirt perhaps it was an obvious choice for a woman of her warm skin and rich hair but nonetheless it was extraordinarily flattering she was not lovely in the classical mold and certainly she had not the pallor and childlike daintiness which was currently admired there was an earthy more immediate quality to her as if in other circumstances she would have been full of laughter imagi nation even hunger her features were those of a woman who threw herself wholeheartedly into whatever she espoused monk could not imagine what sort of a man angus stonefield could be to have won her love in the first place and then to have left her willingly it precluded his being any kind of coward or a retreater from life the room and its furnishings dissolved into irrelevance mr monk she said eagerly please do sit down thank you janet she lifted one hand in dismissal of the maid if anyone else should call i am not at home yes maam janet went out obediently closing the door behind her as soon as they were alone genevieve turned to monk then realized it was far too soon for him to have learned anything she attempted to disguise her disappointment and her foolishness for having allowed hope in the first place he wanted to tell her that his initial suspicions seemed less and less likely but to do so he would have to tell her what they were and he was not prepared to do that i have been to mr stonefields place of business he began only briefly as yet but i can see nothing out of order i shall return when mr arbuthnot is present and see what more he can tell me i doubt there will be anything she said sadly poor mr arbuthnot is as confused as i of course he does not know what i do of caleb her mouth tightened and she turned half away towards the very small fire glimmering in the hearth it is something i prefer not to make public unless i am left no alternative whatever one does not like to air ones family tragedies for all to know poor angus tried to keep it as discreet as he could and i dont believe his friends or colleagues were aware she lifted one shoulder very slightly in a gesture of despair it is most embarrassing that ones relatives are criminal she looked back at him as if it had been a kind of relief to her to speak the truth aloud perhaps she saw a shred of incredulity in his eyes i do not blame you for finding it hard to believe mr monk that two brothers could be so different i found it hard myself i used to fear angus had conceived some jealousy or fancy which made him see his brother in such a light but a little investigation will show you that far from painting caleb black angus was if anything too kind in his judgment he did not doubt her sincerity but he still held his reservations as to what caleb stonefield might really be like probably no more than a rake or a gambler someone angus did not wish to bring to his charming and comfortable home perhaps least of all leave in the company of his wife if caleb were a womanizer he could never resist trying to awaken in this woman the fires which might so easily lie nascent beneath her proper exterior monk himself could feel the temptation there was a richness in her mouth a daring in her eyes and strength in the angle at which she carried her head why do you believe your brotherinlaw might have harmed your husband mrs stonefield he said aloud after all the long years of relationship between them and your husbands loyalty why should he now hate so deeply as to commit violence against him what has changed nothing that i know she said unhappily staring now at the fire there was no doubt in her voice no lessening of the emotion did your husband threaten him in any way financially or professionally monk went on is it likely that he became aware of some misdemeanor or even crime that caleb may have been involved with and if he did would he have reported it her eyes flickered up quickly meeting his with sudden light i dont know mr monk you must think me very vague and most uncharitable to a man i dont even know of course what you suggest is possible caleb lives in a way which would make it likely he is involved in many crimes but it is not that which causes my fear had she said anything else he would have known she lied he had seen the spark of realization in her eyes and the doubt what is it he said with a gentleness unusual to him i wish i could tell you more precisely she answered with a tiny selfdeprecating smile then she looked up at him and her expression was startlingly intense my husband was not a cowardly man mr monk neither morally nor physically but he lived in dread of his brother for all that he pitied him and tried all the years i have known him to bridge the gulf between them he was deeply afraid monk waited for her to continue she looked into the distances within her own mind i have seen the change come over his face when he spoke of caleb how his eyes darkened and his mouth showed lines of pain she took a deep breath and he could see that she was shaking very slightly as if mastering a deep shock within herself i am not exaggerating mr monk please believe me caleb is both evil and dangerous my worst fear is that his hatred has finally driven him mad and he has killed angus of course i hope he is alive and yet i am terrified it is already too late my heart tells me one thing and my mind another at last she looked at him her eyes wide and direct i need to know please leave no effort untried for as long as i have any means with which to recompense you for my childrens sake as well as my own i have to know what has happened to angus she stopped she would not repeat herself or beg for pity beyond his labor that she could hire she stood very straight in the room he still merely observed only as a kind of elegance behind her he was unaware even of the ash settling in the fire not only for her but for the man whose wife and home this was he had no hesitation in accepting the task wholeheartedly i will do everything in my power mrs stonefield i promise you he answered may i continue by speaking to some of your servants who may have noticed letters or callers she looked puzzled and a flicker of disillusion shadowed her eyes how will that help it may not he conceded but without some kind of indication that some of the more obvious answers are untrue i cannot request the help i shall need from the river police to conduct a search of the docks or of the quarter where you say caleb lives if he has indeed killed his brother it will not be easy to prove oh she let out her breath in a jerky little sigh of course she was very pale i had not thought of that im sorry mr monk i shall not interfere again whom would you like to see first he spent the rest of the afternoon and early evening questioning the staff from the butler and the cook through to the betweenmaid and the bootboy and learned nothing to contradict his first impression that angus stonefield was a diligent and prosperous man of excellent taste and very ordinary habits with a wife to whom he was devoted and five children ranging in age from three to thirteen years the butler had heard of the brother caleb but had never seen him he knew only that mr stonefield would go quite regularly to the east end to meet with him that he seemed nervous and unhappy prior to going and sad on his return on almost every occasion he had sustained both personal injury and severe damage to his clothes sometimes beyond repair mr stonefield had refused to call a doctor insisting that the matter not be reported and mrs stonefield had cared for him herself none of it helped to explain where angus stonefield was now or what had happened to him even his effects and the few letters in the top drawer of his tallboy were precise each in its place and exactly what monk would have expected did you learn anything genevieve asked when he returned to the withdrawing room to take his leave he would have disliked disappointing her but there was no hope in her face no he confessed it was simply an avenue i dared not leave unexplored she looked down at her hands twisting together in front of her dress the only betrayal of the emotion within her i received a letter today from anguss guardian lord ravensbrook offering to assist us until we can until you might care to see if he can help with information i mean she looked up at him i have written his address for you i am sure he will receive you whenever you care to call you are going to accept his offer he said urgently the moment he asked he saw her face shadow and knew he had been intrusive it was not his concern she had promised to pay him and he wondered now if she assumed that concern for money was the reason he had asked no she said before he could apologize and find some excuse to moderate his discourtesy i would very much prefer not to beshe hesitatedindebted to him if it can be avoided he is a good man of course she went on quickly he raised angus and caleb when their own parents died they are only distant relatives he had no real obligation but he gave them every opportunity as if they were his own his first wife died very young he has married again now i am sure he would give you any assistance he can thank you he accepted grateful that she had apparently taken no more offense at his clumsiness as soon as i learn anything i promise i will let you know i am most obliged she said quietly she seemed about to add something then changed her mind he wondered if it had been about the depth of her fears for her husband or the urgency with which she needed an answer good evening mr monk it was not a courteous time to call upon lord and lady ravensbrook but genevieves plight struck deep into him and he was perfectly prepared to disturb them at dinner or draw them away from guests if need be and offer the truth as explanation as it was when the hansom dropped him at ravensbrook house in the rain and he splashed across the footpath through the are of the streetlight and up the marble steps he was prepared for whatever battle faced him but his forethought proved unnecessary the door was opened by a footman in livery who accepted his card and the letter genevieve had given him leaving him in the hall while he went to present them to his master ravensbrook house was magnificent monk judged it to date back to queen anne a far more elegant period of architecture than that of the present queen here nothing was overcrowded ornamentation was simple giving an air of space and perfect proportion there were rather good portraits presumably of the past ravensbrooks on three of the four walls they all either had been of handsome appearance or had been highly flattered by the various artists the staircase was gray marble like the front steps and swept in a curve up the righthand wall to a landing balustraded in the same stone a chandelier of at least eighty candles illuminated the whole and hothouse hyacinths flowered in a blue delft bowl scenting the air it occurred to monk that perhaps angus stonefield had been given an excellent start in his business both financially and socially it was a peculiar and rather harsh pride of genevieves that would not allow her to accept help now at least for her childrens sake if not her own or did she really believe in spite of what she said that angus would somehow return the footman came back showing only the mildest surprise by the lifting of an eyebrow and conducted monk to the library lord ravensbrook awaited him apparently having left his dinner to receive this unexpected guest the door closed behind the retreating footman i apologize my lord for the unseemliness of the hour monk said immediately ravensbrook dismissed it with a wave of his hand he was a tall man perhaps an inch or two taller than monk and extremely handsome his face was lean and narrow but with fine dark eyes a long nose and a chiseled mouth apart from his features there was a quickness of intelligence in him lines of wit and laughter around his mouth and a hint of temper between his brows it was the face of a proud man of unusual charm and monk guessed a considerable ability to command others however on this occasion he made no attempt to impress i gather from mrs stonefields letter that she has sought your help to discover what has happened he made it a statement not a question i admit i am close to my wits end to think what can have befallen him and would be glad of any assistance you can give thank you my lord monk acknowledged i have been to his offices and they appear to know nothing although i have not yet been able to question mr arbuthnot whom i am told is in charge and would have the authority to speak more frankly to me however if there is any financial hardship it is certainly not evident ravensbrooks black eyebrows rose fractionally financial hardship yesi suppose you have to consider that to one who does not know angus it would seem a possibility however he walked over to the mantelshelf where two exquisite georgian silver candlesticks sat on either end and an irish crystal vase a little to the left of center held a spray of golden winter jasmine as mrs stonefield will have told you he continued i have known angus since he was a child he was five when his parents died he has always been ambitious and prudent and he had the skill to bring dreams into reality he has never been one to seek shortcuts to success or easy paths he would not have gambled he turned to face monk his eyes very dark absolutely level he was of a nature which hated risks and was totally honest down to the slightest detail i happen to know that his business is flourishing of course if you wish to satisfy yourself in the matter it will be perfectly possible for you to examine the accounts but it will be a waste of time as far as finding him is concerned his voice was tight with emotion but his expression was unreadable mr monk it is of the utmost urgency that you learn the truth whatever it may be the business requires his presence his judgments he took a deep breath behind him the fire roared up the chimney when it becomes known that he is missing not merely on some journey then confidence will crumble for his familys sake if something appalling has happened to him the business must be sold or a new manager appointed before it is known and prestige and the value of his reputation are squandered i have already offered genevieve and her children my protection here in my home as i did angus before them but so far she has declined but the time will come and quite shortly when she can no longer manage monk made a rapid decision as to whether he should be candid he regarded ravensbrooks lean intelligent face the sophisticated taste in the room the slight drawl in his voice the steadiness of his gaze after financial difficulty the other most obvious possibility is another woman he said aloud of course ravensbrook agreed with a slight downturning of his lips and the barest flicker of distaste you have to consider it but you have met mrs stonefield she is not a woman a man would leave out of boredom i rather wish i could believe it was something forgive mea muscle twitched in his jawso pedestrian then you could find him bring him to his senses and return him home it would be most unpleasant but in the end it would make no permanent difference except perhaps to his wifes regard for him but she is a sensible woman she would get over it and of course she would be discreet no one else need know but you think it unlikely sir monk was not surprised he found it less easy to believe than he would were it any other woman than genevieve stonefield but then he did not know her the warmth and the imagination which seemed to lie behind her eyes might be an illusion and perhaps angus had gone seeking the reality ravensbrook shifted his weight the heart of the fire fell in with a shower of sparks and the heat from it grew more intense i do let me be frank mr monk this is not a time for euphemisms i fear some serious harm has come to him he has long been in the habit of going to the most in salubrious parts of the east end of the city down by the docks ide limehouse and blackwall regions if he has been attacked and robbed he may be lying injured insensible or worse his voice dropped it will take all your skill to find him he moved a step away from the fire but still did not invite monk to sit nor did he sit himself mrs stonefield says that he goes to visit his twin brother caleb monk continued who she says is of a totally different nature and both hates him and is uncontrollably jealous she believes that he may have murdered her husband he watched ravensbrooks face intensely he saw a fear cross it and deep distress he could not believe it was feigned i deeply regret having to admit mr monk that that is so i have no reason to believe there is any other cause which takes angus to the slums of the dockside i have long begged him to desist and leave caleb to his own devices it is quite futile to hope to change him he hates angus for his success but he has no wish to be like him only to have the profits of his labor anguss affection and loyalty towards him is in no way returned he drew in his breath and let it out in a slow sigh but there is something in angus which will not let go it was a painful subject it must be especially bitter for a man who had watched the two brothers since childhood but he did not equivocate or make excuses and monk admired him for that it must have taken an iron self discipline not to indulge in anger or a sense of injustice now do you believe mrs stonefield is right and caleb could have killed angus either intentionally or by accident in a struggle ravensbrook met his eyes with a long level stare yes he said quietly i am afraid i believe it is possible his lips tightened of course i should prefer to think it is an accident but murder is also believable i am sorry mr monk it is a bitter case we have given you and one which may take you into some personal danger you will not catch caleb easily there was a harsh twist of his mouth less than a smile nor will you easily prove what has happened whatever help i can be you have but to call upon me monk was about to thank him when there was a light rap on the door come ravensbrook said with surprise the door opened and a woman of extraordinary presence entered she was of little more than average height though her bearing made her seem taller but it was her face which commanded monks attention she had high wide cheekbones a short jutting aquiline nose and a wide beautifully shaped mouth she was not traditionally lovely yet the longer he looked at her the more she pleased him because of the balance and honesty in her she was every bit as candid as genevieve and more commanding it was the face of a woman born to power ravensbrook lifted his hand very slightly my dear this is mr monk whom genevieve has engaged to help us find outwhat has happened to poor angus from the way he touched her and his expression as he regarded her it was unnecessary to announce her identity how do you do lady ravensbrook monk bowed very slightly it was not something he normally did but it came to him without thought when he spoke to her i am very glad she regarded monk with interest it is time something was done i should like to think otherwise but i know caleb may be at the root of it i am sorry mr monk we have asked of you a most unpleasant task caleb is a violent man and will not welcome any attention from the police or any other authority and as you may already be aware there is also a serious outbreak of typhoid fever in the south area of limehouse at the moment we are most grateful that you should have accepted the case she turned to her husband milo i think we should offer to meet mr monks expenses rather than allow genevieve to do it she is hardly in a position the estate will be frozen she will have only whatever funds of course he stopped her with a gesture to speak of such things was indelicate in front of a hired person he returned his attention to monk naturally we shall do so if you submit whatever accounts you give we shall see that they are met is there anything else we can do do you have a likeness of mr stonefield lady ravensbrook frowned thinking on the subject no ravensbrook replied immediately unfortunately not childhood likenesses would be of little use and we have not seen caleb in fifteen years or more angus did not care to have pictures made of him he considered it vain and always preferred to have such portraits as there were made of genevieve or the children he meant to have one done one day but now it seems he may have left it too late im sorry i can make a sketch for you lady ravensbrook offered quickly then the color flushed up her cheeks it would not be of any artistic merit but it would give you some notion of his appearance thank you monk accepted before ravensbrook could interpose any objection that would be extremely helpful if i am to trace his movements it would make it inuneasurably easier she went to the bureau over at the far side of the room opened it and took out a pencil and a sheet of notepaper then sat down to draw after about five minutes during which time both monk and ravensbrook remained in silence she returned and proffered it to monk he took it and looked at it then stared more closely with surprise and considerable interest it was not the rough tentative impression he had expected but a face which leaped out at him executed in bold lines the nose was long and straight the brows winged the eyes narrow but bright with intelligence the jaw was broad under the ears but going to a pointed chin the mouth wide poised between humor and gravity suddenly angus stonefield was real a man of flesh and blood of dreams and passions someone he would grieve to find destroyed in a wanton act of violence and thrown into some dockyard sewer or passageway to the river thank you he said softly i shall begin again at first light tomorrow good night my lady my lord chapter monk spent a restless night and was up early the next morning to resume his search for angus stonefield although he realized grimly that he had already assumed genevieve was right in her fears and what he was truly seeking was proof of his death but whatever he found it was unlikely to bring her any happiness if angus had absconded with money or another woman that would not only rob her of the future but in a sense of the past as well of all that was good and she had believed to be true the hansom set him down on the waterloo road the rain had stopped and it was a brisk chilly day with fast scudding clouds a cutting east wind came up from the river with a smell of salt from the incoming tide and the soot and smoke of countless chimneys he stepped smartly out of the way of a carriage and leaped for the footpath he pulled his coat collar a little higher and strode out towards angus stonefields place of business the domestic servants yesterday evening had told him nothing of use no one had noticed any behavior out of the very ordinary routine of rising at seven and taking breakfast with his wife while his children ate in the nursery after reading the newspaper and any post that may have been delivered he left in sufficient time to arrive at his office by half past eight he did not keep a carriage but traveled by hansom cab the day of his disappearance he had followed exactly that pattern the mornings post had contained a couple of small household bills an invitation and a polite letter from an acquaintance no one had called at the house other than the usual tradesmen and a woman friend of genevieves who came for afternoon tea monk arrived at stonefields offices too early and was obliged to wait a quarter of an hour before mr arbuthnot appeared walking along the pavement from the north carrying an umbrella in his hand and looking hurried and unhappy he was a small man with thick gray hair and a gray immaculately trimmed mustache monk introduced himself ali arbuthnot said anxiously yes i suppose it was inevitable he took out a key from the pocket of his coat and inserted it into the outer door he turned it with some effort you believe so monk said with some surprise you foresaw such a thing arbuthnot pushed the door open well something has to be done he said sadly we cant go on like this do come in allow me to close this wretched door it needs oiling monk observed realizing arbuthnot was referring to his own inquiries as inevitable not his employers disappearance yes yes arbuthnot agreed i keep telling jenkins to do it but he doesnt listen he led the way into the main office empty still and dark before the lamps were lit the gray light through the windows being inadequate to work by monk followed him through the glasspaned doors and into his own more comfortably furnished room with a murmur of apology arbuthnot bent and put a match to the fire already carefully laid in the hearth then let out a sigh of satisfaction as the flames took hold he lit the lamps also then took off his coat and invited monk to do the same what can i tell you that may be of service he said knitting his brows together unhappily i have no idea what has happened or i should already have told the authorities and we should not now be in this terrible position monk sat in the rather uncomfortable upright chair opposite him i presume you have checked the accounts mr arbuthnot and any monies which may be kept here ffis is really very unpleasant sir arbuthnot said in a tight quiet voice but yes i felt obliged to do that even though i was quite certain i should find them in perfect order and did you monk pressed indeed sir to the farthing everything is accounted for and as it should be he did not hesitate nor did his eyes waver perhaps it was his perfect steadiness which made monk believe there was something else to add some qualification what time did mr stonefield arrive that morning he asked perhaps you would tell me everything you recall of that day in the order it happened yes er of course arbuthnot shivered a little and turned aside to pick up the poker from the hearth and prod at the fire he continued with his back to monk he arrived at quarter to nine as usual the first delivery of post was already here he took it into his office and read it do you know what was in it monk interrupted arbuthnot finished his administrations to the fire and laid the poker back on its rest orders delivery notices advice of shipments an application for a position as clerk he sighed a very promising young man but if mr stonefield does not return i doubt we should be able to keep those we have much less employ additional staff and that was all are you quite sure monk avoided the subject of stonefields return and the dismissing of staff there was nothing helpful he could say yes i am arbuthnot said firmly i asked young barton about it and he remembered precisely you can ask him yourself if you wish but there was nothing in the post to occasion mr stonefields departure of that i am quite certain visitors monk asked watching arbuthnots face ali he hesitated yes monk looked at him steadily arbuthnot was distinctly uncomfortable but monk had no way of knowing whether it was embarrassment guilt or just the general distress of talking about someone he had liked and respected and who was in all probability now dead and of course if the business had to be sold or closed down he too would lose his livelihood who monk prompted him arbuthnot gazed at the floor between them mr niven hes in a similar line of trade himself at least he he was and now arbuthnot took a deep breath i fear he is on hard times why did he come here i understood from your clerk when i was here yesterday that it was largely mr stonefields superior skill which was responsible for his misfortune arbuthnot looked up quickly his long face full of reproach if you think mr stonefield did him out of business on purpose sir you are quite wrong quite wrong indeed it was never his intention at all its just that you have to do the best you can if you want to survive yourself and mr stonefield was quicker in his judgment and more accurate never exactly took chanceshe shook his headif you understand me but he was very diligent in his studies of trends and well liked in the business people trusted him when they might not someone else there was a furrow of concern between his brows and he searched monks face to be certain he took his meaning exactly was his scrupulous honesty a safeguarding of his position in case stonefield should return after all or a protection for niven for any of a dozen reasons including some nature of collusion why did mr niven come monk repeated how was he dressed what was his demeanor as arbuthnot hesitated again he became impatient if you wish me to have any chance whatever of finding mr stonefield you must tell me the exact truth arbuthnot caught the hard edge of monks voice and his prevarication dropped like a mask to reveal acute pity and discomfort he came to see if we could put any work his way sir im afraid things are most difficult for him he knew mr stonefield would help him if he could but im afraid there was nothing at present he did give him a letter of commendation for his honesty and diligence though in case that might be of use to him he swallowed with an effort and his demeanor monk insisted distressed arbuthnot said quietly at the end of his strength poor man his eyes flicked up at monks again but a complete gentleman sir never for a moment did he indulge in selfpity or anger against mr stonefield the simple truth is he made an error of judgment in trade which mr stonefield avoided and at a juncture in the ebb and flow of business when it cost him very dear he understood that i believe and took it like a man monk was inclined to believe him but he would still see titus niven for himself was he the only visitor he asked arbuthnot colored painfully and took several moments to compose his answer his hands were clenched together in front of him and he looked anywhere but at monks eyes no sir there was also a lady at least a female person i dont know how to describe her honestly monk said tersely arbuthnot drew in his breath then let it out again monk waited arbuthnot took him very literally as if it were an escape from expressing a more personal judgment ordinary sort of height a trifle thin maybe but thats a matter of opinion i suppose quite well built really considering where she came from where did she come from monk interrupted the man was rambling oh limehouse way i should think from her speech unconsciously arbuthnot was widening his nostrils and tightening his lips as though he smelled something distasteful but then if he were correct and she had come from the slums of the east end dockside he may well have the damp overcrowded rooms the open middens and the sewage from the river made any alternative impossible handsome arbuthnot said sadly at least nature gave her that even if she did her best to hide it with paint and garish clothes very immodest a prostitute monk said bluntly arbuthnot winced i have no idea she said nothing to indicate so what did she say for heavens sake man dont make me draw answers from you like teeth who was she and what did she want not to buy or sell corn futures of course not arbuthnot blushed furiously she asked for mr stonefield and when i informed him of her presence he saw her immediately he took another deep breath she had been here before twice that i am aware of she gave her name as selina just that no surname thank you what did mr stonefield say about her did he explain her presence arbuthnots eyes widened no sir it was not our business to inquire into who she was and he felt no wish to tell you monk let his surprise show who did you suppose her to be dont say you did not think of it well yes arbuthnot admitted naturally we did won der who she was i assumed it was something to do with his brother since as you observe it could not be business the first flush of fire settled down now that the kindling was burned and arbuthnot put more coal on what was mr stonefields manner after she left monk pursued disturbed he was somewhat agitated arbuthnot answered unhappily he withdrew what money there was in the safefive pounds twelve shillings and sixpence he signed a receipt for it and then he left how long after selina was this as near as i can remember about ten or fifteen minutes did he say where he was going or when he expected to return lie watched arbuthnot closely no sir arbuthnot shook his head slowly his eyes sad and anxious he said some urgent matter needed his attention and i should see mr hurley in his stead mr hurley was a broker who was expected that afternoon i assumed he thought he might be out all day but i fully expected him the following morning he gave no instructions for the next day and there were most important matters to attend to he would not have forgotten suddenly his face filled with grief and an agonizing fear and bewilderment and monk realized with a jolt how arbuthnots own world had been damaged by stonefields disappearance one day everything had been safe and assured predictable if a little pedestrian the next it was overturned filled with mystery even his livelihood and perhaps his home were jeopardized there was uncertainty in every direction it was he who would have to tell genevieve that they could no longer continue and then he would have to dismiss all the rest of the staff and try to wind up the company and salvage what was left pay the debts and leave a name of honor behind if little else monk searched his mind for something comforting or helpful to say and found nothing what time did he leave as closely as you can recall he asked the question was dry and literal reflecting nothing of what he felt about half past ten arbuthnot said bleakly his mild eyes reflecting a dislike monk understood only too easily do you know how arbuthnot stared at him i beg your pardon do you know how monk repeated if i am to trace him it would be helpful to know if he went on foot or took a hansom what he was wearing if he turned left or right upon leaving i see yes i see arbuthnot looked relieved of course i beg your pardon i misunderstood you he was wearing an overcoat and carrying an umbrella it was a most inclement day he always wore a hat naturally a black high hat he took a hansom down towards the waterloo bridge he searched monks face do you think you have some chance of finding him a lie sprang to monks mind it would have been easier he would have liked to leave him with hope but habit was too strong not a great deal but i may learn what became of him which will be of practical use to mrs stonefield though of little comfort i am sorry a succession of emotions played across arbuthnots facepain resignation pity ending in a kind of grudging respect thank you for your candor sir if there is anything else i can do to be of assistance you have but to inform me he rose to his feet now there is a great deal i must attend to he gulped and coughed just in case mr stonefield should return things must be kept going monk nodded and said nothing he stood up and put on his coat arbuthnot showed him out through the office now filled with clerks busy with letters ledgers and messages the room was brightly lit every lamp burning neat heads bent over quills ink and paper there was no sound but the scratching of nibs and the gentle hissing of the gas no one looked up as he passed but he knew there would be whispers and the exchanging of glances the moment he was gone monk assumed stonefield had gone to the east end in answer to some message either directly from caleb or at least concerning him there was no other explanation suggested it did cross his mind as he went down the steps into the windy street fastening his coat again that the woman selina might have some relationship with stonefield which had nothing to do with caleb some eminently respectable men with faultless domestic lives still had a taste for the rougher charms of street women and kept a second estab lishment quite separate from and unknown to the first he discounted it because he did not believe stonefield would have been rash enough to allow such a woman if she existed to know of his business address it would be absurdly dangerous and completely unnecessary such arrangements survived only if total secrecy were observed he walked briskly down as far as the bridge perhaps it was unprofessional but he believed genevieve that angus stonefield had gone to see his brother and that this time the quarrel between them had ended in violence which had either injured angus so seriously he had been unable to return home or even to send a message or else he was dead and the best monk could do would be to find proof of it adequate to entitle his widow to his estate he must begin by finding the cabby who had picked angus up on the morning he disappeared it would most probably be one from the nearest stables if not he would move outward from there actually it took him five cold and exhausting hours and more than one false trail before he was certain he had the man he caught up with him at midafternoon in stamford street near the river lie was standing over a brazier thawing out his fingers and shifting from one foot to the other trying to keep warm behind him his horse was snorting breath into the cold air waiting impatiently head down for the next fare and the chance of movement goin somewhere guv the cabby asked hopefully depends monk replied stopping beside him did you pick up a fare on the waterloo road about half past ten in the morning last tuesday and take him probably east tall dark gentleman with an overcoat high hat and an umbrella he showed him lady ravensbrooks drawing wots it to yer if i did the cabby asked guardedly hot cup of tea laced with something stronger and a fare to wherever you set him off monk replied and a great deal of unpleasantness if you he to me the cabby swiveled around from the brazier and eyed monk narrowly well now if it int inspector monk he said with surprise left the rozzers ave we eard about that neither his voice nor his face gave any indication as to his feelings on the subject it was a sore one to monk his departure from the police force had been forced upon him by that final quarrel with runcorn the fact that he had been proved right and runcorn wrong had helped nothing with no livelihood anymore he had been obliged to take up private inquiries since detection was the only marketable skill he possessed but he no longer had either the authority of the police force nor the facilities of its vast network and specialist abilities as the cabby had so pertinently reminded him well why dyer want the poor geezer as i took then wots e done took the funds with im did e the cabby asked an if e did why do you care no he didnt monk said truthfully hes missing his wife is afraid some harm may have befallen him likely gorn off with some tart or other stupid sod the cabby said dismissively gorn private then ave yer chasin runaway usbands for women as ave lorst em he grinned showing gapped teeth bit of a comedown for yer int it hinspector monk warmer than driving a cab monk snapped then remembered he needed the mans goodwill the words choked in his throat to be civil sometimes he added between clenched jaws well now mr monk the cabby sniffed and wiped his nose on his sleeve looking at monk maliciously if yer asks me polite like i might tell yer were i took im mind i want me cup of char as well an me drop o brandy in it dont want no cheap gin an i can tell the diffrence so dont go fobbin me orff how shall i know if youre telling me the truth monk asked bluntly yer wont the cabby said with satisfaction ceptin i dont suppose as yerve changed all that dont want yer on my tail fer ever more right narsty yer can be ifn yer crorssed an no mistake best suits me if yer pays me fair an i tells yer fair good monk fished in his pocket and brought out a sixpence take me to where you let him off and ill get your tea and brandy at the nearest pub the cabby took the sixpence as earnest of his intent bit on it automatically to test its genuineness then slipped it into his pocket come on then he said cheerfully walking towards his horse and untying the reins as he mounted the box monk stepped up into the cab and took his seat they set off at a fast walk then a trot they crossed the blackfriars bridge then moved steadily eastwards through the city then whitechapel and into limehouse the streets became narrower and grimier the brick darker the windows smaller and the smell of midden and pigsty more pervasive drains overflowed into gutters and there had obviously been no crossing sweepers or dung carts near for weeks in bridge road cattle had passed on the way to the abattoir the smell brought back sharp memories to monks mind but of emotions not faces or events he remembered overwhelming anger and urgency but not the reasons for them he could recall his heart pounding and the smell sticking in his throat it could have been three years ago or twenty past time had no meaning nothing to relate to ere y are the cabby said loudly pulling his horse to a halt and tapping on the hatch monk returned his mind to the present and climbed out they were in a narrow dirty street running parallel to the river in an area known as limehouse reach he fished in his pocket and pulled out the fare adding it to the sixpence he had already given an me drink the cabby reminded him monk added another sixpence ta the cabby said cheerfully anyfink else as i can do for yer ever picked up the same man before monk asked couple o times why where did you take him once ere once up west oh an once ter someplace orff the edgware road to an ouse reckon as maybe e lived there rum innit i mean why do a proper sort o gent like that wanna come ere int nuffin ere as any bodyd want even got the typhus less than alf a mile away he gestured with his mittened thumb eastwards an someone told me as theyd got the cholera in whitechapel too or mebbe it were mile end or blackwall or summink i dont know monk replied it wants explaining i dont suppose you saw which way he went the cabby grinned wondered if yer d think o that yeah e went that way he jerked his thumb again long there wards the isle o dogs thank you monk closed the conversation and set out along the road the cabby had indicated if e went in there yer wont never find im the cabby called out poor sod he added under his breath monk feared he was right but he did not turn or alter his stride it was going to be difficult to trace angus except that dressed as he was he would have stood out from the regular inhabitants just as monk did now but he was unlikely to have stopped to purchase anything in the various shops that were spaced sporadically along the street there were no newspaper vendors people in limehouse reach had no spare money for such luxuries even supposing they could read they learned of such events that interested them by word of mouth or from the running patterers men whose trade was to put into endless doggerel whatever bulletin or gossip they heard and relay it in a kind of oneman musical sideshow from place to place collecting a few coppers from appreciative listeners here and there billboards were posted for the few who were literate but no one stood about selling even peddlers went farther west where custom was more likely he went into a grocers shop selling tea dried beans flour molasses and candles it was dark and smelled of dust tallow and camphor he produced the drawing of angus and received a blank stare of incomprehension he also tried an apothecary a pawnbroker a rag and bone merchant and an ironmonger all with similar results they stared at monks expensive clothes his warm wellcut overcoat and polished boots which kept out the wet and knew he was alien children in layers of rags some of them barefoot faces gaptoothed and dirty followed him begging for money alternately whistling and catcalling he gave what pennies he had but when he asked after caleb stonefield they fell silent and ran away on union road which sloped down towards the river with pavement so narrow he could hardly stand on it its cobbles chipped and uneven simply because he knew nothing else to do he tried a cobbler who made new shoes from old have you ever seen this man dressed in a good coat and high hat maybe carrying an umbrella he asked flatly the cobbler a narrowchested little man with a wheeze took the paper in one hand and squinted at it looks a bit like caleb stone ter me and i only seen im a couple o times an that were a couple too many but it int a face as yerd forget cept this gent looks sane enough and real tidy dressed like a toff yer said monk felt a leap of excitement in spite of all common sense telling him otherwise yes he said quickly thats only a drawing forget caleb stonefield stone the cobbler corrected sorry stone monk brushed it aside this man is related to him so there will be a resemblance have you ever seen him specifically did you see him four days ago he probably passed this way dressed like a toff an with an at an all yes didnt ave no at as i recall but yeah i reckon as i saw im monk sighed with relief he must not overpraise the man or he might be tempted to embroider the truth thank you he said as gravely as he could squashing the elation rising inside him im obliged to you he fished in his pocket and brought out threepence the price of a pint of ale remember me at the pub he offered the cobbler hesitated only a second ill do that guv he agreed and shot out a strong misshapen and callused hand before monk could change his mind which way did he go monk asked the final question west the cobbler replied instantly tward the south dock monk had already turned the handle of the door to leave when another question occurred to him perhaps the most obvious of all where does caleb stone live the cobbler turned pale under the layer of grime on his face i dunno mister an im real appy ter keep it that way an if yerd any sense yerd not ask neither were some folks is concerned iggerance is a blessin i see thank you anyway monk smiled at him briefly then turned and went out into the cold street and the stench of salt tide raw sewage and overloaded drains he tried for the rest of the day but by five oclock it was dark bitterly cold with a rime of ice forming on the slimy cobbles of the footpaths and he had achieved nothing further it was not safe to remain here alone and unarmed he walked rapidly head down and collar up back towards the west india dock road and regular street lamps and a hansom back home again he was stupid to have come here in good clothes hed never get the smell out of them another hole in his memory he should have thought of that before he set out it was not only the gaping voids in his lifean entire childhood youth and early manhood which were a mystery to him his triumphs and failures his loves if there had been any which were of lasting valueit was the stupid little pieces of practical knowledge he had forgotten the mistakes which were like splinters under the skin every day the cabby had been almost correct in his information about the fever in limehouse it was not the respiratory disease of typhus but the intestinal typhoid which raged through the tenements and rookeries carried from one inadequate and overflowing midden to the next hester latterly had been a nurse serving with florence nightingale in the scutari hospital in the crimea and on the battlefield she was more than used to disease cold filth and the sight of suffering she could not count the deaths she had seen from injury or fever but still the plight of the poor and the sick in limehouse touched her until the only way she could bear it and shut out the nightmares was to work with her close friend and monks patroness lady callandra daviot and dr kristian beck to do all she could both to relieve the distress in whatever small way was possible and to fight for some alleviation of the conditions which made these diseases endemic on the day that monk was searching the streets for someone who had seen angus stonefield hester was on her hands and knees scrubbing the floor of a warehouse which enid ravensbrook another woman of wealth and compassion had obtained at least temporarily so that it might be used as a fever hospital after the order of the military hospital in scutari hester had a feeling that the water she was using was as full of infection as any of the patients but she had added plenty of vinegar and hoped it might serve the purpose dr beck had also obtained half a dozen open braziers in which they were going to burn tobacco leaves a practice much followed in the navy to fumigate between decks and help to fight against yellow fever callandra had purchased several bottles of gin which were firmly locked in the medicine cabinet and which could be used to clean pans cups and any instruments since they had no others who were nurses by trade there was a diminished chance of it being drunk hester had just finished the last yard of floor and stood up easing her back from its stiffness by bending back and forth a few times when callandra came in she was a broadhipped woman well into middleage her hair was habitually untidy but today it had exceeded even its usual wildness it poked and looped in every direction several of its pins threatening to fall out completely even in her youth she could not have been thought beautiful but there was such intelligence and humor in her face it had a unique charm finished she asked cheerfully excellent im afraid were going to need every foot of space we can find and of course blankets she surveyed the room for a moment then proceeded to pace the floor out carefully measuring precisely how many people might lie on it without touching each other i would like to get pallets she went on her back to hester and pans or buckets of some type typhoid is such a beastly disease so much waste to dispose of and heaven only knows how we are going to do that she was now at the far end of the space and almost inaudible to hester she turned and started to pace the width there isnt a midden or a cesspit within miles of here that isnt overflowing already has dr beck spoken to the local council of authority yet hester asked picking up her bucket and going over to the window to tip it out there were no drains and the water was full of vinegar anyway so it would be more likely to improve the gutters than harm them callandra reached the far side and lost count she had loved kristian beck since before the wretched business at the royal free hospital the previous summer hester was aware of it but it was something they never discussed it was too delicate and too painful the depth of kristians feeling in return only added to the poignancy of the situation callandra was a widow but kristians wife was still alive she had long ceased to care for him if indeed she ever had in the manner he longed for but she clung to her rights and all the status and the comfort they afforded to callandra he could give nothing but an intense friendship humor warmth admiration and shared passions for causes in which they both believed with ardor and dedication even the mention of his name could still jar her concentration so vulnerable was she even now she turned and began to pace back beginning to count the width again hester looked out of the window to make sure no one was passing beneath then emptied the bucket i think we could get about ninety people in here callandra announced then her face pinched i wish to god i could think that was all we should need we have fortyseven cases already not counting seventeen dead and another thirteen too ill to move ill be surprised if they live the night her voice rose i feel so helpless its like fighting the incoming tide with a mop and bucket the door opened behind hester and a strikinglooking woman came in a bottle of gin under one arm and another in each hand it was enid ravensbrook i suppose its better than nothing she said with a tight smile ive sent mary out to get some clean straw she can try the ostler at the end of the lane his mothers one of the victims hell do what he can she set the gin down on the floor i dont know what to do about the well ive pumped the water but it smells like nextdoors pigsty probably with good reason hester said tightening her lips theres a well in phoebe street that smells all right but itll be an awful nuisance to carry water over and were desperately short of buckets well have to borrow them enid said resolutely if every family spared us one wed quickly have sufficient for all purposes they havent got them hester pointed out setting her bucket scrubbing brush and cloth away tidily most families around here have only one pan between them anyway one pan for what enid pressed perhaps they can use their night bucket for scrubbing the floor as well one pan for everything hester explained the same one for scrubbing the floor for bathing the baby for waste at night and for cooking in oh god enid stood still then blushed robbed of speech for an instant she took a deep breath im sorry i suppose im still very ignorant ill go out and buy some she turned on her heel and was about to leave when she almost bumped into kristian beck coming in his face was set in anger his cheeks burned with color which had nothing to do with the cold outside and his beautiful mouth was set in a tight line there was no need to ask if he had met with success or failure with the local authority callandra was the first to speak nothing she said softly no criticism in her voice nothing he conceded even in the single word there was a trace of some european accent very slight only an extra preciseness which marked english as not his mother tongue his voice was rich and very deep and at the moment expressive of his utter contempt they have a hundred prevarications but they all amount to the same thing they dont care enough what excuses enid demanded what could there possibly be people are dying scores of people and it could be hundreds before its over its monstrous hester had spent nearly two years as an army nurse she was used to the workings of the institutional mind no local authority could be worse than military command or in her opinion more stubborn or totally fossilized in its thinking callandras late husband had been an army surgeon she too was familiar with ritual and the almost insuperable force of precedent money kristian said with disgust he looked up and down at the length of the nowscrubbed warehouse with satisfaction it was cold and bare but it was clean to build proper drains would add at least a penny to the rates and none of them want that he added but dont they understand enid began only a penny callandra snorted at least half of the members are shopkeepers kristian explained with weary patience a penny on the rates will hurt their business half shopkeepers hester screwed up her face thats ridiculous why so many of one occupation where are the builders the cobblers or bakers or ordinary people working kristian said simply you cannot sit on the council unless you have money and time to spare ordinary men are at their jobs they cannot afford not to be hester drew in breath to argue kristian preempted her you cannot even vote for council members unless you own property worth over one thousand pounds he pointed out or rental of over one hundred a year that excludes the vast majority of the men and naturally all the women so only those with a vested interest can be elected anyway hester said her voice rising in fury thats right kristian agreed but it helps no one to waste your energy on what you cannot change rage is an emotional luxury for which we have no time to spare then we must change it callandra almost choked on the words her frustration was so consuming she swung around to stare at the empty barn of a place tears of impotence in her eyes we should never have to fill something like this with people we cant save because some damnable little shopkeepers wont pay an extra penny on the rates for us to get the sewage out of the streets kristian looked at her with an affection so naked that hester standing between them felt an intruder my dear he said patiently it is very much more complicated than that to begin with what should we do with it some people argue for a watercarried system but then it has to empty somewhere and what of the river it would become one vast cesspool and there are problems with water if it rains heavily may it not back up and peoples houses would become awash with everyones waste she stared at him as much of her emotion drinking in his face his eyes his mouth as thinking of the bitter problem but in the summer the dry middens blow all over the place she said the very air is filled with the dust of manure and worse i know he replied there was a noise on the staircase mary returned with an undersized little man in a shiny hat and a jacket several sizes too large for his narrow shoulders this is mr stabb she introduced him and he will rent us two dozen pots and pans at a penny a day each o course mr stabb put in quickly i got a family to feed but me ma died o the cholera back in fortyeight an i wouldnt want as not ter do me bit like hester drew in her breath to bargain with him thank you callandra said quickly cutting her off well have them immediately and if you know of any other tradesman who would be prepared to assist please send him to us yeah mr stabb agreed thoughtfully his face failing to mask a few rapid calculations further deliberations were prevented by the arrival of several bales of straw and canvas sheets old sails and sacking anything that might be used to form acceptable beds and blankets to cover them hester left to set about procuring fuel for the two potbellied black stoves which must be kept alight as much of the time as possible not only for warmth but in order to boil water and cook gruel or whatever other food was obtainable for anyone who might he well enough to take nourish ment typhoid being a disease of the intestines that might not be many but if any survived the worst of it they would need strengthening after the crisis and fluid of any sort was of the utmost importance frequently it was what made the difference between life and death meat milk and fruit were unobtainable as were green vegetables they might be fortunate with potatoes although it was a difficult season for them they would probably have to make do with bread dried peas and tea like everyone else in the area they might find a little bacon although one had to be very careful frequently meat of any sort came from animals which had died of disease but even then it was extremely scarce in most families it was only the working man who had such luxuries it was necessary for everyones survival that he maintain as much of his strength as he could patients were brought in over the next hours and indeed all through the night sometimes one at a time sometimes several there was little even kristian could do for them except try to keep them as clean and as comfortable as possible with such limited facilities to wash them with cool water and vinegar to keep the fever down several quite quickly lapsed into delirium all night hester callandra and enid ravensbrook walked between the makeshift pallets carrying bowls of water and cloths kristian had returned to the hospital where he practiced mary and another woman went back and forth emptying the ironmongers buckets into the cesspool and returning at about half past one there was some easing and hester took the opportunity to prepare a hot gruel and use half of one of the bottles of gin to clean some dishes and utensils there was a noise in the doorway and she looked up to see mary come limping in carrying two pails of water she had drawn from the well in the next street in the candlelight she looked like a grotesque milkmaid her shoulders bent her hair blowing over her face from the wind and rain outside her plain stuff dress was wet across the top and her skirts trailed in the mud she lived locally and had come to help because her sister was one of those afflicted she set the pails down with an involuntary grunt of relief then smiled at hester there yare miss bit o rain in em but i spose that dont urt none yer want them ot yes ill add them to this hester accepted indicating the cauldron she was stirring on top of one of the potbellied stoves were it like this in the crimea mary asked in a husky whisper just in case some poor creature should be sleeping rather than insensible yes a bit hester replied except of course we had gunshot wounds as well and amputations and gangrene but we had lots of fever too think id like to ave bin there mary said stretching and bending her back after the weight of the water gotta be better than ere nearly married a soljer once she smiled fleetingly at the memory of romance then i went and married ernie instead just a brickie e were but sort o gentle she sniffed ed a never made the army is legs was bad rickets wen e were a kid does that to yer rickets does she stretched again and moved closer to the stove her wet skirts slapping against her legs her boots squelching died o consumption e did e could read could ernie captain o the men o death e called it consumption i mean read that somewhere e did she eyed the gruel and lifted one of the pails to pour in a gallon of water to thin it thank you hester acknowledged he sounds special e were mary said stoically miss im i do poor bleeder me sister dora wanted to get out of ere never thought itd be in a coffin leastways not yet not that theres many as gets out ter anythink much different there were ginny motson pretty she were an smart as yer like dunno wot appened to er nor were she went but up west somewhere real bettered erself she did learned ter talk proper an wave like a lady or least summink like hester refrained from speculating that it was probably into a brothel the dream of freedom was too precious to destroy reckon as she got married mary went on ope so liked er i did dyer want more water miss not yet thank you ohtheres someone sick poor devil mary darted forward to pick up a pan and go to assist enid came out of the shadows on the far side her face white her thick and naturally wavy hair piled a little crooked and a long splash of candle tallow on the bosom of her dress the little boy at the end is very weak she said huskily i dont think hell last the night i almost wish hed go quickly to ease his suffering and yet when he does ill wish he hadnt she sniffed and pushed her hair out of her eyes isnt it ridiculous i first saw him only a few hours ago and yet i care so much it twists inside me ive never even heard him speak time has nothing to do with it hester replied in a whisper adding salt and sugar liberally to the gruel it was necessary to replenish what the body lost her own memories crowded her mind soldiers she had seen for perhaps only an hour or two and yet their agonized faces remained in her memory the courage with which some of them bore their wounds and the breaking of their own bodies one was sharp before her vision even now she could see his bloodsmeared features superimposed in the cauldron of gruel she was stirring the smile he forced on his lips his fair mustache and the mangled mass where his right shoulder had been he had bled to death and there had been nothing she could do to help him i suppose not enid picked up the dishes wrinkled her nose at the lingering odor of the gin and began to ladle out a little gruel into about six of them i dont know who can eat but wed better try she regarded it unhappily its very thin havent we any more oatmeal its better thin hester answered they cant take much nourishment its just the liquid thats of value enid drew in her breath then perhaps realized why they did not simply use water she would have gagged to drink it herself more especially knowing where it came from in silence she took the dishes and spoons and began the slow distressing task of helping one person after another to swallow a mouthful and try to keep it the night wore on slowly the smells and sounds of illness filled the huge room shadows passed to and fro in the flickering candlelight as the tallow burned down about three in the morning kristian returned callandra came over to hester there were dark smudges of weariness under her eyes and her skirts were soiled where she had been helping someone in extreme distress go and take a few hours sleep she said quietly kristian and i can manage she said it so naturally and yet hester knew what it meant to her to be able to speak their names together in such a way well call you towards morning a couple of hours hester insisted call me about five what about enid ive persuaded her callandra smiled faintly now go on you cant stay up indefinitely if you dont rest youll be no use youve told me that often enough hester gave a rueful little shrug there was no honesty or purpose in denial watch the boy over there on the left she gestured towards a figure lying crumpled half on one side about twenty feet away hes got a dislocated shoulder ive put it back but it slips out if he leans on it when he sits up to retch poor little creature callandra sighed he looks no more than ten or twelve but its hard to tell he said he was sixteen hester replied but i dont suppose he can count did it happen recently the shoulder i mean i asked him he said he got across caleb stone and got beaten for his cheek callandra winced theres a woman on the far end with a knife scar on her face she said that was caleb stone too she didnt say why he seems to be a very violent man she sounded still afraid of him well i dont suppose well see him in here hester said dryly unless he gets typhoid nobody comes to pesthouses to collect debts however largeor to exact revenge either she glanced down the dark cavern of the warehouse no revenge could be worse than this she said softly go and rest callandra ordered or you wont be fit to work when i sleep hester obeyed gratefully she had not dared to think how tired she was or she could not have continued now at last she was free to go into the small outer room where there was a pile of extra straw and let herself sink into it in the darkness away from duty the sounds of distress and the constant awareness of other peoples suffering for a moment she could forget it all and let exhaustion and oblivion overtake her but the straw prickled it had been a long time since scutari and she had forgotten the feeling of overwhelming helplessness in the face of such enormity of pain and she could not so easily blank it from her mind her ears still strained for the sounds and her body tensed as if in spite of everything callandra could say she really ought to go and do what she could to help that would be futile she would become too worn out to take her turn when callandra and kristian needed to sleep she must fill her mind with something else deliberately force herself to think of some subject which would overtake even this it came unbidden to her mind in spite of all her intentions to the contrary perhaps it was the fact that she was lying awkwardly in a small strange room close to the end of her strength both physically and emotionally but thoughts of monk filled her almost as if she could feel the warmth of his body beside her smell his skin and for once in their lives know that there was no quarrel no gulf no barrier between them she flushed hot to remember how utterly she had given herself to him in that one consuming kiss all her heart and mind and will had been in it all the things she could never ever have said to him she had not seen him since the end of the farraline case they had continued in the heat of that desperate conclusion so involved in it that there had been no time to feel more than a glancing moment of awkwardness now if they met again it would be different there would be memories neither of them could ever discard or forget whatever he might say whatever his manner now she knew that for that moment when they had faced death in the closed room he had left behind all pretense all his precious and careful selfprotection and had admitted in touch of aching and desperate tenderness that he too knew what it was to love not that she deluded herself the barriers would not return of course they would rescue and a taking up of life again had brought back all the differences the shadows which kept them apart she was not the kind of woman who excited him she was too quarrelsome too independent too direct she did not even know how to flirt or to charm to make him feel gallant and protective let alone romantic and he was too often illtempered he was certainly ruthless highly critical and his past was full of darkness and fears and ties which even he did not know perhaps of violence he only half thought in nightmare of cruelties he imagined but for which he had no proofexcept what others told him not in words but in the way they reacted to him the flicker of old pain humiliations from his keener faster mind and his sharper tongue she knew all the arguments just like the prickling straw ends poking into her arms now scratching her cheek and spearing through the thin stuff of her dress and yet just like the sweet oblivion closing around her the memory of his touch obliterated it all until she was so tired she could sleep chapter monk was confused by the stonefield case it was not that he seriously doubted what had happened to angus stonefield he very much feared that genevieve was correct and he had indeed received some kind of summons from caleb and had gone immediately to meet him in all probability that was why he had taken the five pounds twelve shillings and sixpence that arbuthnot had spoken of and for which he had left the receipt monks difficulty was now to prove his death so that the authorities would grant genevieve the legal status of widow and allow her to inherit his estate then she might sell the business before it was ruined by speculation and neglect and no doubt the advantage his rivals would take of his absence it would be good to talk to callandra it was part of their bargain that he share with her any case which was difficult or of particular interest he was not sure if this one would catch her emotions or not but he knew from experience that even the act of explaining it to her would clarify it in his own mind it had happened that way more often than not she asked pertinent questions and allowed him to escape with no generalizations or inexactitudes her understanding of people especially women was often far more acute than his she had a perception of relationships which made him realize with some pain and a new sense of loneliness how little he knew of the emotions of interdependence and the closeness of daily friendship and family ties there were so many gaps in his life and he did not know if those things had never existed for him or if it was simply that his memory of them was gone and if he had lived such a narrow and solitary life was that of his own choosing or had some circumstance forced it upon him what had happened to himand more urgently by far what had he donein all those lost years of course he had learned fragments flashes of recollection prompted by some present sight or sound the glimpse of a face some things he had deduced but there were still vast empty reaches only a glimmer of light here and there and he did not always like what it showed he had been cruel of tongue harsh of judgment but clever always clever but if he had not truly loved anyone or been loved why not what ghosts walked in that darkness what injuries might there be and would he ever know might they return to horrify him with guilt or offer him a chance to repay might he after all discover acts of generosity and warmth companionship he would want to recall sweetness that was precious even in hindsight but no matter how hard he searched nothing returned there was no shred of memory there not a face a smell or sound that was familiar the only friends he knew were those of the present the rest was a void perhaps that was why when he reached callandras house he was absurdly disappointed to be told by the maid that she was not in when will she return he demanded i couldnt say sir the maid replied gravely maybe tonight but more likely not maybe tomorrow but i couldnt say so for sure thats ridiculous monk snapped you must know for heavens sake be honest with me im not some social climbing lady friend she doesnt want either to see or to offend the maid drew in her breath and let it out in a sigh of politeness she knew monk from many previous visits theres an outbreak of the typhoid in limehouse sir shes gone there to help with dr beck and i expect a good few others i really couldnt say when shell be back no one can typhoid monk had no personal knowledge that he could recall but he had heard the fear and the pity in other peoples voices and saw both in the maids face now limehouse it must have been typhoid the cabby had meant not typhus he knew where it was down by the river along the reach thank you he turned to leave oh yes sir is there anything i could take for her a change of clothes perhaps well yes sir if youre going that way im sure itd be appreciated and peraps for miss hester too miss hester yes sir miss hester went as well of course he should have known she would be there it was an admirable thing to do and obvious with her professional training so why was he angry and he was he stood in the porch entrance while the maid went to fetch the articles and put them in a softsided bag for him to carry and his body was stiff and his hands clenched almost to fists she rushed into things without thought her own opinions were all that mattered she never listened to anyone else or took advice she was the most willful and arbi trary person he knew vacillating where she should be firm and dogmatic where she should be flexible he had tried to reason with her but she only argued he could not count the quarrels they had had over one issue or another the maid returned with the bag and he took it from her smartly with a brief word of thanks a moment later he was back in the street striding out towards the square where he knew there would be a hansom in limehouse it did not take him long to trace the warehouse on park street now converted into a fever hospital he could see the fear of it in peoples faces and the drop in the tone of voice as they spoke of it he spent all the change he had on half a dozen hot meat pies he went in the wide door and up the shallow steps with the pies wrapped in newspaper under his arm and the softsided case in the other hand the smells of human waste wet wood coal smoke and vinegar met him before he was into the main room which must originally have been designed to accommodate bales of wool cotton or other similar merchandise now it was ill lit with tallow candles and the entire floor was covered with straw and blankets under which he could make out the forms of at least eighty people lying in various states of exhaustion and distress yer got them buckets what he turned around sharply to see a woman with a tired smutdirtied face staring at him she could have been any age from eighteen to forty her fair hair was greasy and screwed into a knot somewhere at the back of her head her figure was broadchested and broadhipped but her shoulders sagged it was impossible to tell whether it was from habit or weariness her expression was almost blank she had seen too much to invest emotion in anything but hope or grief a stranger who might or might not have buckets was not worth the effort disappointments were expected ave yer got the buckets she repeated her voice dropping as she knew already that the answer was negative no i came to see lady callandra daviot im sorry he let the case drop to the floor do you want a hot pie her eyes widened a little he unrolled the newspaper and handed her one it was still warm and the pastry was crisp a tiny piece flaked off and fell to the floor she hesitated only a moment her nostrils widening as she caught the aroma yeah i do she took it and bit into it quickly before he could change his mind she could not remember the last time she had had such a delicacy let alone a whole one to herself is lady callandra here he asked yeah she said with her mouth full ill get er for yer she did not ask his name anyone who brought meat pies needed no further credentials he smiled in spite of himself a moment later callandra came down the length of the room also tired and dirty but a lift in her step and a quickening in her face william she said softly when she reached him what is it why have you come here hot pie he offered she took it with thanks wiping her hands briefly on her apron her eyes searched his waiting for him to explain himself i have a difficult case he answered have you time to listen it wont take more than ten or fifteen minutes you have to rest sometime come and sit down while you eat the pie have you one for kristian she asked still having taken only a bite from the one he had given her and hester and enid and mary of course i dont know enid or mary he answered but i gave one to a young woman with straight hair who expected me to have buckets mary good the poor soul has worked herself to dropping have you any more if not ill share this one yes i have he proffered the rolledup newspaper there are another four in there callandra took them with a quick smile and carried them back up the dim room to pass them to figures monk could recognize only with difficulty the thin very upright one with the square shoulders and uplifted chin was hester he would have known her outline anywhere no one else held her head at quite that angle the masculine one had to be kristian beck barely average height slimshouldered and strong the third looked reminiscent of someone he had seen only lately but in the poor light and the smoke from the stoves and the smell stinging his eyes he did not know whom callandra returned eating her own pie before it got cold she led him into a small room to the side which presumably had once been an office when the building was used for its original purpose now it boasted a table piled with blankets four bottles of gin three unopened and one half empty several casks of vinegar a flagon of hungarian wine and a candle two very rickety chairs were also piled with blankets callandra cleared them off and offered him a seat whats the gin for he asked desperation it wouldnt be sitting there unopened if it were she replied grimly tell me about your case he hesitated uncertain how much to say about genevieve perhaps he should give callandra only facts and omit his own impressions to clean things with she answered his question alcohol is better than water especially from the wells around here not the floors of course the vinegars for that i mean plates and spoons he acknowledged the explanation the case she prompted sitting heavily on one of the chairs which rocked tilted and righted itself at an angle he sat on the other gingerly but it supported his weight albeit with an alarming creak a man has disappeared a businessman comfortably off and eminently respectable he began he seems happily married with five children it was his wife who came to me callandra was watching him so far without interest his wife says he has a twin brother monk continued with a ghost of a smile who is in every way opposite he is violent ruthless and lives alone somewhere in this area limehouse callandra said in surprise why here apparently choice he lives by his wits and occasional gifts from angus the missing brother in spite of their differences angus insisted on keeping in touch although his wife says he was afraid of caleb and it is angus who has disappeared the candle on the table flickered for a moment it was stuck in the top of an empty bottle and the tallow ran down the side yes his wife is deeply afraid that caleb has murdered him in fact i think she is convinced of it she frowned did you say caleb she reached out absently and righted the candle yes why he asked its an unusual name she replied not unknown but not common i heard only a few hours ago of a brutal man in this area named caleb stone he injured a youth and slashed the face of a woman the same man he said quickly leaning forward a little the brother is angus stonefield but caleb may well have dropped the second half of his name it fits with what genevieve said of him he realized as he spoke how he had been hoping inside himself that it was not true that perhaps her view of caleb was exaggerated now in a sentence that was ended callandra shook her head i am afraid if that is so then you have not only a greater task ahead of you but perhaps an exceedingly difficult one caleb stone may be guilty but it will be very hard to prove there is little love lost for him around here but fear may hold people silent i assume you have already inquired into the more usual explanations for the brothers absence how delicately put he said with a sharp edge to his voice he was not angry with her only with the circumstances and his own helplessness you mean debt theft or another woman something like that i havent proved them impossible simply unlikely i traced him the last day he was seen he came as far as union road about a mile from here before he could add anything further he caught a movement out of the comer of his eye and turned to see hester standing in the doorway even though he had already seen her dimly in the main room it had not prepared him for meeting her facetoface he had thought a dozen times exactly what he was going to say how casual he was going to be as if nothing had changed between them since the conclusion of the trial in edinburgh on reflection that was about the best time to go back to they could hardly pretend that had not occurred if she referred to the farralines that was acceptable although the subject might be sensitive to her and he would respect that she would not mention the small room in which they had been trapped or anything that had happened between them there that would be so indelicate as to be inexcusable she knew it had been occasioned by what had seemed the knowledge of certain death and not an emotion which could be carried into their succeeding lives to refer to it would be both clumsy and painful but women were peculiar where emotions were concerned especially emotions that had anything to do with love they were unpredictable and illogical how did he know that was that some submerged memory or simply assumption not that hester was very feminine he would find her more appealing if she were she had no art to charm or the kind of subtle flattery that is only a selection and amplification of the truth she was much too direct almost to the point of challenge she had no idea when to keep her own counsel and defer to others intellectual women were remarkably unattractive it was not a pleasing quality to be right all the time most particularly in matters of logic judgment and military history she was at once very clever and remarkably stupid is something wrong her voice interrupted his thoughts she looked from callandra to monk and back again does something have to be wrong for me to come here he said defensively rising to his feet here her eyebrows rose yes then youve answered your own question havent you he said tardy she was quite right no one would come to a pesthouse in the east end without a desperate reason apart from the physical unpleasantness of the smell the cold the drab damp surroundings and the sounds of pain it was the best way in the world to contract the disease yourself he looked at her face she must be exhausted she was so pale her skin was almost gray her hair was filthy and her clothes too thin for the barely heated room she would not have the strength to resist illness she bit her lip in irritation it always annoyed her to be verbally outmaneuvered youve come for callandras help her tone was waspish or mine he knew that was meant sarcastically he was also aware how often she had helped him sometimes as in the first occasion they had met when he was truly desperate and his life hung in the balance he had never been able to forget how it was her courage and her belief in him which had given him the strength to fight several answers flashed through his head most of them offensive in the end largely for callandras sake he settled for the truth or close to it i have a case which seems to fade out two streets away he said looking at her coldly but since the man i am trying to trace was the brother of a wellknown local character and presumably on his way to see him i thought you might be of assistance whatever other thoughts were in her mindand she looked both irritable and unhappy beneath the wearinessshe chose to acknowledge the interest who is the local character we havent had much time for conversation but we could ask she sat down on the chair he had vacated not bothering to rearrange her skirts caleb stone or stonefield i dont suppose he stopped he had been about to say that she would know nothing of him but the changed expression in her face made it perfectly obvious that she did know and that it was ill what he demanded only that he is violent she replied callandra will already have told you that we were discussing it last night who are you looking for angus stonefield who is his brother why because hes disappeared he said tartly it was absurd to allow her to make him feel so uncomfortable almost guilty as if he were denying part of himself and it was not so he liked and admired many of her qualities but there were others which he deplored and which were a constant source of annoyance to him and he had always been perfectly frank about it as indeed so had she there were certain debts of honor between them on both sides but that was all and for heavens sake that was all she wished also but perhaps part of that obligation was to tell her of the dangers she faced spending her time in a pesthouse like this is he wanted for something she said interrupting his thoughts his temper broke of course hes wanted he said his wife wants him his children his employees want him thats an idiotic question the color washed up her pale cheeks as she sat hunched a little with cold her shoulders rigid i had meant was he required by the law she said icily i had temporarily forgotten that you also chase after errant husbands for their wives sakes he is not errant he responded with equal venom the poor devil is almost certainly dead and i would do that for anybody his wife is out of her mind with grief and worry she has every bit as much right to be pitied as any of your unfortunates here he jabbed angrily with his finger towards the great hall filled with its straw and blankets although even as he said it pity of afar harsher sort twisted inside him for its occupants not many of them would live through it and he knew that he was angry with hester not with them if her husband is dead william there is nothing you can do to help her except find proof of it callandra interposed calmly even if caleb killed him you may never find evidence of that what will the police require to accept death do they have to see a corpse not if we can find witnesses adequate to assume death he replied they know perfectly well that the tide may carry bodies out and they are never seen again he faced callandra ignoring hester the dim lights the smells of tallow gin vinegar and damp stone permeating through everything were sickening and through it all the consciousness of illness was making him even more tense he was not afraid in his brain he would despise that in himself callandra and hester were here day and night but his body knew it and all his instinct told him to go quickly before it could reach out and touch him hesters courage awoke emotions in him he did not want they were painful contradictory and frightening and he loathed her for making him vulnerable if we learn anything we shall let you know callandra promised rising to her feet with something of an effort i am afraid caleb stones reputation makes your theories more than possible im sorry monk had not said all he intended he would like to have spent longer in her company but this was not the time he thanked her a little stiffly nodded to hester but could think of nothing he wanted to say he took his leave feeling as if he had left something undone that would matter to him later he had found none of the easing of his mind that he had hoped on leaving the warehouse monk steeled himself to go to the river police at the thames police station by wapping stairs and ask if they had recovered any bodies in the last five days which might answer the description of angus stonefield the sergeant looked at him patiently as always monk did not recognize him but had no knowledge of whether the man knew him or not more than once he had realized he was familiar and disliked at first he had been at a loss as to why gradually he had learned his own quick brain and hard tongue had earned the fear of men less gifted less able to defend themselves or retaliate with words it had not been pleasant now he regarded the sergeant steadily hiding his own misgivings behind a steady unblinking gaze description the sergeant said with a sigh if he had ever seen monk before he did not seem to remember it of course monk would have been in uniform then that might make all the difference monk would not remind him about my height he replied quietly dark hair strong features green eyes his clothes would be good quality well cut expensive cloth the sergeant blinked relative sir a quiet flicker of sympathy crossed his blunt face and monk realized with a start how close the description was to his own except for the color of the eyes and yet he did not look like the picture enid ravensbrook had drawn there was a rakishness in that face which set it at odds with what both genevieve and arbuthnot had said of angus stonefield but not of his brother caleb had enid unintentionally caught more of the spirit of caleb or was angus not the sedate man his family and employees supposed had he a secret other life the sergeant was waiting no monk answered i am inquiring on behalf of his wife this is not something a woman should have to do the sergeant winced he had seen too many palefaced frightened women doing exactly that wives mothers even daughters standing as monk was now afraid and yet half hoping the long agony of uncertainty was over ow old the sergeant asked fortyone the sergeant shook his head no sir no one answering to that got two men one not moren twenty the other fat wi ginger air though ed be late thirties or thereabouts poor devil thank you monk was suddenly relieved which was absurd he was no further forward if angus stonefield was dead he needed to find proof of it for genevieve if he had simply absconded that would be a worse blow for her leaving her both destitute and robbed even of the comfort of the past thank you he repeated his voice grimmer the sergeant frowned at a loss to understand monk did not owe him an explanation on the other hand he might very well need him again a friend was more valuable than an enemy he winced at his own stupidity in the past arrogance was selfdefeating he bit his lip and smiled dourly at the sergeant i think the poor man is dead to have found his body would be a relief in a way of course i would like to hope he is alive but it is not realistic i see the sergeant sniffed monk had no doubt from the expression in his mild eyes that he did indeed understand he had probably met many similar cases before ill come back monk said briefly he may yet turn up if yer like the sergeant agreed monk left the east end and traveled west again to resume investigation into other possibilities the more he thought of the face enid ravensbrook had drawn the more he thought he would be remiss simply to accept genevieves word for anguss probity and almost boringly respectable life the sergeant of the river police had thought him for a moment to be a relative of monks because of the similarity of description what words would monk have used of his own face how did you convey anything of the essence of a man not by the color of his eyes or hair his age his height or weight there was something reckless in his own face he remembered the shock with which he had first seen it in the glass after his return from hospital then it had been the face of a stranger a man about whom he knew nothing but the strength had been there in the nose the smooth cheeks the thin mouth the steadiness of the eyes in what way was angus stonefield different that they could not be brothers it was there but he could not place it it was something elusive something he thought was vulnerable was it in the man or only in enid ravensbrooks sketch he spent a further day and a half trying to establish a clearer picture of angus what emerged was an eminently decent man not only respected by all who knew him but also quite genuinely liked if he had offended anyone monk could not find him he was a regular attender at church his employees thought him generous his business rivals considered him fair in every respect even those whom he had beaten to a good deal could find no serious fault with him if anyone had a criticism it lay in the fact that his sense of humor was a little slow and he was overformal with women which probably sprang from shyness on occasion he spoiled his children and lacked the type of discipline considered proper all the faults of a careful and gentle man monk went to see titus niven he didnt know what he expected to learn but it was an avenue which should not be overlooked possibly niven might have some insight into angus stonefield that no one else had felt comfortable to speak genevieve had supplied him with nivens address about a mile away off the marylebone road she had looked somewhat anxious but she refrained from asking him if he expected to learn anything the first time monk called there was no one at home except one small maidofallwork who said mr niven was out but she had no idea where or at what time he might he back monk could see the strain of poverty staring at him from every surface the girls face the hemp mat on the floor the unheated air smelling of damp and soot it was not a poor neighborhood it was a very comfortable one in which this individual house had fallen upon greatly reduced circumstances it stirred memories in him but they were indistinct emotions of anger and pity rather than fear when he called in the evening titus niven himself opened the door he was a tall man slender with a longnosed sensitive face full of humor and at the moment a mixture of selfdeprecation and hope struggling against de spair monks instinct was to like the man but his intelligence told him to be suspicious he was the one person known to have a grudge against angus stonefield perhaps a legitimate one certainly one that was very real how successful he had been previously monk could not estimate until he was inside the house but he certainly was in dire straits now good evening sir niven said tentatively his eyes on monks face mr titus niven monk inquired although he was in no doubt yes sir my name is monk i have been retained by mrs stonefield to inquire into mr stonefields present whereabouts there was no point in evasion any longer to ask only such questions as would leave it concealed would be a waste of time which was short enough and he had ac complished nothing so far it was already seven days since angus had last been seen come in sir niven opened the door wide and stood back to allow monk to pass it is a cruel night to stand on the step thank you monk went into the house and almost immediately was aware just how far titus niven had fallen the architecture was gracious and designed for better times it had been decorated within the last year or two and was in excellent condition the curtains were splendid and pre sumably would be the last things to be sacrificed to necessity for the privacy they offered when drawn but even more for their warmth across the cold rainstreaked glass but there were no pictures on the walls although he could see with a practiced eye where the picture hooks had been there were no ornaments except a simple cheap clockto judge from the curtains not nivens taste at all the furniture was of good quality but there was far too little of it there were bare spaces which leaped to the eye and the fire in the large hearth was a mere smoldering of a couple of pieces of coal a gesture rather than a warmth monk looked at niven and saw from his face that words were unnecessary niven had seen that he understood neither comment nor excuse would serve purpose only add weight to the pain that was real enough monk stood in the center of the room it would somehow be a presumption to sit down before he was invited as if the mans poverty reduced his status as host i daresay you are aware he began or have deduced that angus stonefield is missing no one knows why it is now of some urgency for his familys sake that he is found quite naturally mrs stonefield is alarmed that he may have been taken ill attacked or in some other way met with harm niven looked genuinely concerned if it was spurious he was a master actor but that was possible monk had seen such before im sorry niven said quietly poor mrs stonefield i wish i were in a position to offer her help he shrugged and smiled but as you can see i can scarcely help myself i have not seen angus sinceohthe eighteenth i went to his place of business but i daresay you know that yes mr arbuthnot told me how did mr stonefield seem to you then what was his manner niven waved towards the sofa and himself sat in one of the two remaining large chairs just as usual he answered as soon as monk was seated quite composed courteous very much in command of himself and of his af fairs he frowned and regarded monk anxiously you understand i do not mean that in any critical sense i do not intend to imply he was arbitrary far from it he was always most courteous and his staff will have told you he was a generous master and neither an unreasonable man nor given to rudeness what did you mean mr niven monk watched him closely but he saw no embarrassment no hint of deviousness only a searching for words and the same glint of humor and selfmockery i meant i suppose that angus ordered his life very well he hardly ever made mistakes nor lost his ability to govern himself and much of what happened around him he never seemed out of his depth did you know his brother monk was suddenly very curious his brother niven was surprised i didnt know he had a brother in the same line of business surely not i would have known genevieve mrs stonefield he colored slightly and was instantly aware that he had given himself away mrs stonefield never mentioned any relative other than his childhood guardian lord ravensbrook he went on and as tar as i can recollect she spoke of him only once or twice they seemed a family very sufficient unto themselves there was the faintest shadow of pain in his face or was it envy monk was reminded again sharply how very attractive genevieve was how alive she did not talk a great deal or move vivaciously yet there was a quality of emotion in her which made other women seem dull in comparison yes monk replied watching him closely he had a twin brother caleb who is violent and disreputable a waster bordering on the criminal if not actually so that was something of an understatement but he wanted to see what niven made of it i think you are mistaken sir niven said softly if there were such a man the city would know of it anguss reputation would be compromised by the existence of another with his name and whose character was so unfortu nate i have been in the city for fifteen years word would have spread whoever told you this is misleading you or you have misunderstood and why do you say had is this brother supposed to be dead in which case why raise the fellows name when it can only hurt angus his body tensed where he sat in the large chair beside the cold hearth or do you also fear angus may have met with some profound harm it was a slip of the tongue monk confessed i allowed mrs stonefields anxieties to influence me i am afraid she is concerned that he is no longer alive or he would have returned home or at the very least sent some message to her of his whereabouts niven remained silent for several moments deep in thought monk waited why did you mention this brother mr monk niven asked at length is he a fabrication or do you believe him to be real oh he is real monk affirmed there is no doubt of that you have not encountered him because he neither works in the city nor lives in the suburbs he occupies himself entirely in the east end and calls himself stone rather than stonefield but angus kept in touch with him it seems the old loyalties died hard niven smiled that sounds like angus he could not abandon a friend much less a brother i assume you have been in touch with this man and he can tell you nothing i have not found him yet monk replied he is elusive and i fear he may be at the heart of the problem even perhaps responsible for it i am investigating all other possibilities as well regrettable as it is others do come to mind one is frequently surprised by people niven agreed nevertheless i think you will not find that angus had financial problems nor will you discover that he has a mistress or a bigamous wife somewhere else if you had known him as i did none of these thoughts would come to your mind nivens face was earnest in concentration angus was the most honest of men not only in deed but even in thought i have learned much from him mr monk his integrity was something i admired intensely and i wished to pattern myself upon it he was truly a man to whom true goodness was the highest aim above wealth or status or the pleasures of his success he leaned towards monk and he understood goodness he did not mistake it for some new absence of outward vice he knew it for honor generosity loyalty tolerance of others and the gift of gratitude without a shred of arrogance monk was surprised not only by what he said but by the depth of his emotion you speak very well of him mr niven considering that he is largely responsible for your present misfortune he said rising to his feet niven stood also his face flushed pink i have lost my wealth and my position sir but not my honor what i say is no less than i have observed that is apparent monk acknowledged with an inclination of his head thank you for your time i fear i have been of little service niven moved towards the door monk did not explain that he had not expected to learn anything of angus from him but only to make some estimate as to the likelihood of nivens having harmed angus himself niven was a man of quick intelligence but also a certain naivete it would be an unnecessary cruelty to suggest that now monk expended some further effort trying to learn more of angus from various social and professional acquaintances but nothing varied from the picture already painted the stonefields had enjoyed several pleasant friendships but entertained little enjoyment seemed to be within the family with the exception of the occasional evenings at concerts or the theater certainly their manner of living was very well within their means although those means must now be growing considerably thinner as she was unable to draw from the business and since he was nominally still in charge genevieve was unable to exercise any jurisdiction herself or to claim any inheritance what am i to do she said desperately when monk called on her at the end of along and fruitless day now nine days since anguss disappearance what if you never find anguss body there was a crack in her voice and she was keeping her composure only with a visible effort monk longed to comfort her and yet he could not lie he toyed with it he turned over in his mind all the possibilities seriously considering each and yet he could not force the words out there are other ways of satisfying the authorities of death mrs stonefield he answered her especially where a tidal river like the thames is concerned but they will require that all other avenues are explored as well you will not find anything mr monk she said flatly they were standing in the withdrawing room it was cold the fire was not lit nor were the lamps i understand why you must do it but it is a waste of your time and mine she continued and i have less and less left as each day goes by she turned away i dare not spend money on anything but necessities food and coal i do not know how long that will last i cannot think of things like boots and james is growing out of his already his toes press against the leather i was about to purchase them she did not add the rest it was obvious and she did not wish to say it again will you not consider accepting lord ravensbrooks offer at least temporarily monk asked he could understand her reluctance to be dependent upon someone elses kindness but this was not a time to allow pride to dictate she took a deep breath the muscles tightened in her neck and shoulders pulling the fabric of her blue checked dress till he could see the line of stitches at the seam i dont believe it is what angus would have wished she said so quietly he barely heard her she seemed to be speaking as much to herself as to him on the other hand she went on scowling in concentration he would not wish us to be in want she shivered as if the thought made her cold and not the room it is only just over a week mrs stonefield he pointed out as gently as he could i am sure lord ravensbrook would advance you sufficient funds for immediate necessities against the estate if you do not wish to accept a gift there cannot be much else that will not wait if the boots have served until now she swung around to him her eyes frightened her hands clenched you dont understand her voice rose with a high pitch of fear in it she was accusing angry with him angus isnt going to come back caleb has finally mur dered him and we shall be left on our own with nothing today it is just a matter of being a little careful with food no meat except on sundays a little herring or bloater onions oatmeal sometimes cheese apples if we are lucky she glanced at the fire then back at him be careful with the coal sit in the kitchen where the stove is instead of lighting the parlor fire use tallow candles instead of wax dont burn the lights until you absolutely cannot see patch your clothes pass from the elder children to the younger never buy new her voice was growing harsher as panic rose inside her but it will get a lot worse i have no family to help me it will come to selling the house while i can still afford to bargain and get a fair price move to lodgings two rooms if we are fortunate live on bread and tea and maybe a pigs head or a sheeps head once a month if we are lucky or a little tripe or offal the children wont have school anymoretheyll have to work at whatever they can as will i she swallowed convulsively i cannot even reasonably hope they will all live to grow up in poverty one doesnt one or two may and that will be a blessing at least for me to have them with me only god knows what awaits them he looked at her in amazement her imagination had carried her close to hysteria he could see it in her eyes and in her body part of him was moved by pity for her her grief was real and she had cause for anxiety but the wildness in her was out of character and he was surprised how it repelled him you are leaping too far ahead mrs stonefield he said without the gentleness he had intended you i wont let it happen she interrupted him furiously i wont he saw the tears in her eyes and glimpsed how fragile she was under the mask of courage he had never had to be responsible for other people for children who trusted and were so vulnerable at least as far as he knew he had not even the idea of it had no familiarity to him he realized it only partially as a stranger might catch sight through a window the situation need never arise he said softly taking a step closer to her i shall do everything i can to find out what happened to your husband and to prove it to the authorities satisfaction then either your husband will be returned to you or you will inherit the business which is doing well in that case you may appoint someone to manage it for you and at least your financial welfare will be taken care of that was an overstatement but he made it without compunction until then lord ravensbrook will care for you as he did for angus and caleb when they were left to misfortune after all you are by his own choice family your children are his only grandchildren it is natural he should wish to provide for them she made a visible effort to control herself straightening her back and lifting her chin she took a deep breath and swallowed of course she said more steadily i am sure you will do all you can mr monk and i pray god it will be sufficient although you do not know calebs cunning or his cruelty or you would not be so confident as for lord ravensbrook i expect i must steel myself to accept his charity she tried to smile and failed you must think me very ungrateful but i do not care for his ways a great deal and i am not prepared lightly to give the upbringing of my children into his hands she looked at him very steadily when one lives in someone elses house mr monk one loses a great deal of the rights of decision one is used to it is a hundred small things each of which are trivial in themselves but together they amount to a loss of freedom which is very hard he tried to imagine it and could not he had never lived with anyone else except in childhood at least as far as he knew to him home was a solitary place a retreat but also an isolation its freedom had never occurred to him she gave a little shrug you think it is foolish of me i can see it in your face perhaps it is but i dislike not being able to decide whether to have the window open or closed what time to rise or retire at what hour i shall eat and that is absurd when the alternative may be not to eat at all i know that but the things that matter are how i shall discipline my children what they shall be permitted to do and what not whether my girls may learn what they wish or if it must be music and painting and how to sew and above all i care to choose for myself what i shall read i care very much this house is mine here i am my own mis tress the anger was back in her face and the spirit he had seen the first day he met her he smiled that is not absurd mrs stonefield we should be poor creatures if we did not care about such things perhaps lord ravensbrook may be prevailed upon to make you an allowance you could remain here albeit in straitened circumstances but with autonomy she smiled patiently and made no reply but her silence and the tension in her face were eloquent enough monk continued to eliminate the possibilities other than violence at the hands of caleb he began to trace anguss actions over the weeks immediately previous to his disappearance arbuthnot had a business diary and allowed monk free access to it and assisted him with all his own recollections from genevieve monk learned of anguss comings and goings from the home they had dined once with friends and been to the theater twice there were also events to which angus had gone alone mostly as a matter of improving his professional alliances monk pieced all his information together carefully and found one or two periods of time still unaccounted for had he indeed gone to see caleb as genevieve believed or had he led some alternate existence of which she knew nothing a vice of which he was so ashamed he kept it an utterly separate life the most obvious thought was another woman although even the most scrupulous examination of the accounts revealed not a farthings discrepancy whatever it was it apparently cost him nothing in terms of money monk grew more and more puzzled and unhappier it was while pursuing angus stonefields path over the previous month that he went to the geographic society in sackville street angus had said he attended but there was no record of him there monk was leaving somewhat preoccupied with his thoughts when he bumped into a young woman who was just mounting the steps her companions had gone on ahead of her and were already inside he looked up absentmindedly to apologize then found his attention grasped most firmly she was quite small and delicately shaped but there was a fire and charm in her face unlike any other and she was staring at him intently searching his features im sorry he said with a sincerity which surprised him i was not looking where i was going i beg your pardon maam she smiled with what seemed genuine amusement you were a little preoccupied with your thoughts sir i hope they were not as gloomy as they seemed her voice was rich and a little husky im afraid they were why on earth had he said that he should have been cautious instead of so frank was it too late to retreat i was on an unpleasant errand he added by way of explanation im sorry her face filled with concern i hope at least you can now say it is concluded it was midafternoon he could not abandon the chase for the day although he was enjoying it less and less there were certainly gaps in angus stonefields life whether he was as blameless as his wife believed or not some of them might have been accounted for by visits to caleb but were they all not concluded he replied unhappily simply come to another blind alley she did not move she made a delightful picture standing on the steps in the winter sun her hair was the color of warm honey and thickly coiled it looked as if it would be soft to the touch and he imagined it would smell sweet perhaps faintly of flowers or musk her eyes were wide and hazelbrown her nose straight and strong enough to speak of character her mouth fulllipped a stout gentleman with a rubicund face came down the steps and tipped his hat to her she smiled back then turned to monk again you are seeking something she asked with quick perception he might as well tell her the truth did you ever meet a man named angus stonefield her winged eyebrows rose here is he a member he changed his mind rapidly i believe so what was he like she countered about my height dark hair green eyes he was about to add that he was probably well dressed and sober of temperament then he realized that possibly he was denying himself an entire avenue of exploration instead he fished in his pocket and brought out enid ravensbrooks drawing and passed it to her she accepted it with a slender hand delicately gloved and inspected it with considerable thought what an interesting face she said at last looking up at monk why do you want to know or is that a tactless question he has been absent from his home and his family are concerned he said noncommittally have you seen him he found himself hoping that she had not only for his investigation but because it would allow him further time in her company i am not sure she said slowly there is something familiar about him but i cannot think from where isnt it odd how one can think one knows a face but cannot tell from where do you have that happen to you i am sorry to be so vague i promise i will search my memory mr monk he said quickly william monk he inclined his head in something resembling a bow drusilla wyndham she replied with a smile which touched not only her lips but her eyes she was beautiful and she could not be unaware of it but neither did it make her arrogant or cold indeed there was a warmth in her and an ability to laugh which he found not only attractive but eminently comfortable she was sure of herself she would not need constant flattery and small attentions nor would she be simplemindedly focused upon marriage with her beauty she could afford to pick and choose and await her fancy how do you do miss wyndham he replied a gentleman wearing a dark suit and carrying a newspaper brushed past them his mustache bristling without knowing why monk glanced at drusilla wyndham and saw amusement flash in her eyes and they both smiled as if un derstanding some secret joke are you about to keep some appointment inside he asked hoping fervently that she was not already his mind turned over plans to meet her again in less hasty circumstances yes but it is not of the slightest importance she replied airily then dropped her lashes quite deliberately laughing at both herself and him then would it be acceptable for me to invite you to accompany me for a cup of coffee or hot chocolate he said impulsively it is damnably cold out here and there is a most respectable coffeehouse about a hundred yards along the street and we might sit near the window so as to be well observed her gaiety and charm were so infectious they reached out to him like the aroma of food to a hungry man he was ineffably weary of the smell and sound of distress of knowing everything he pursued would end in someones misery whatever he found out about angus stonefield it was going to be wretched for genevieve and her children there was no happy ending and the last thing he wanted to think of was hester laboring in the makeshift fever hospital trying to relieve some tiny measure of the sea of agony around her they would not alter the dirt or the despair of people if typhoid did not kill them poverty hunger or some other disease would even turning it over in his mind made him angry and vulnerable he did not even like hester she was certainly little enough pleasure to be with every encounter ended in a quarrel except of course the last one in edinburgh but that was only brought about by impending disaster it held no truth in it should i not be taking you out of your way mr monk drusilla said cheerfully yes he agreed and i should be delighted to be out of it it is a most unhappy and unrewarding way at the moment then let us go out of it she swung around her huge smartly checked crinoline skirts brushing the steps he offered his arm and she took it they walked together along the footpath in the brisk wind he on the outside sheltering her from the splashes of the passing carriages he walked slowly to keep pace with her easily i wish i could remember where i have seen that man she said with a little shake of her head do you know him well mr monk several answers flashed through his mind that would impress her cut before her the figure he would wish but lies would catch up with him and he wanted to know her for more than a few hours anything but the truth would jeopardize the future not at all he replied his wife asked me to help her i used to be with the police you left she asked with extraordinary interest why was that what do you do now a hansom bowled past them the draught of its passage sending his coattails flying and making her bend her head and turn a little aside a disagreement of principle he said briefly she looked at him with fascination her face reflecting amusement and disbelief please dont tantalize me so over what she begged prosecuting an innocent man he answered well i never she said quietly her face reflecting a dozen different and conflicting emotions that concerned you and did your resignation save him no she walked in silence for about twenty yards she seemed to be thinking deeply then suddenly she turned to face him and her eyes were bright her expression relaxed and what is it you do now mr monk you didnt tell me you help ladies in distress because their husbands are missing she had a most attractive and individual voice among other things he stopped and indicated the coffeehouse stepping ahead and opening the door for her inside was warm and noisy and smelled of the delicious aroma of coffee beans grinding the sweetness of chocolate and the close clinging odor of damp coats wool and fur and wet leather boots they were shown straightaway to a table he asked her what she wished and on her reply ordered them both hot coffee when it came the conversation was resumed although in truth she was such a pleasure to look at he would not have minded silence he was also aware of the slight hush around them and the admiring glances of many of the other guests if drusilla noticed she was so accustomed to it it had no effect upon her it must be a most interesting occupation you have she said sipping at her coffee i suppose you meet all sorts of people of course you do it is a foolish question she sipped again i dont suppose you even remember them all when a case is over it must be like a magic lantern slide of life all passions and mysteries and then it is solved and you leave it and begin the next i am not sure that i would have phrased it like that he replied smiling at her over the rim of his own cup of course you would it is fascinating and so unlike my life where i know the same tedious people year after year now please tell me more of this man who is missing what manner of person is he quite unwillingly he told her all he knew that was not in confidence and watched with pleasure both her intelligence and the smooth unharassed expression of her face as if her mind were engaged but she was not going to permit another womans tragedy to spoil the pleasure or ease of their encounter it seems to me she said thoughtfully drinking the last of her coffee that the first thing you need to determine is whether he has a secret habit of some sort be it another woman or some vice or other or if he did as his wife feared and went to visit his brother in the east end and met with violence quite he agreed that is why i am pursuing all i can in an effort to trace him during the last two or three weeks before his disappearance hence the geographical society she nodded where else might you try perhaps i may be of some assistance she bit her lip this is if i am not being too presumptuous she looked at him candidly with her wide hazel eyes but there was amusement and confidence in them he knew that if he had refused her she would not have been hurt or offended simply philosophical and turned her attention to something else not for a moment did he hesitate thank you the matter is urgent for mrs stonefields sake so i should be grateful for any help at all as you say the first thing is to eliminate the most obvious alternative his business affairs seem to be in excellent order and his personal finances so i cannot believe he gambled or indulged in any other vice which cost him money would you care for more coffee thank you i should like it very much she accepted it took him a moment to attract the waiters attention then when the man weaved his way through the tables to them he ordered and paid when the coffee came it was as steaming and fragrant as the first perhaps he was a successful gambler drusilla raised her eyebrows then why disappear he countered oh yes i see she wrinkled her nose at him well naughty theater peep shows some forbidden religion seances or black magic he started to laugh it was wonderful to be able to wander into the realms of the absurd and forget poverty disease and all the wretchedness he had seen i cant see the man ive discovered so far indulging in anything so frivolous he said candidly she was laughing too is black magic frivolous i dont honestly know he confessed it sounds pretty irrelevant to reality to me a sort of escape from responsibility and the daily round of duties particularly for a man who spends his working hours considering the price of corn and other commodities and leads family prayers she added for a good wife and five children and however many servants they have not to mention goes to church every sunday and observes the sabbath with all diligence there was a burst of laughter from the next table and they both ignored it did you find out if they eat cold meals only dont permit singing whistling games of any nature and reading of fiction taking of sugar in his tea or the eating of sweets or chocolates in case it causes inappropriate love of luxury and of course no laughing he groaned it was not the picture he had formed of genevieve but he had not asked perhaps angus was as sober and worthy as that she had certainly spoken of him in glowing but rather formal and reverent words poor devil he said aloud if he lived like that there would be little wonder if he took leave of reality on occasion and did something totally bizarre it might save his sanity she finished her coffee the second time and sat back then permit me to discover what i can of such societies and if anyone i know has met this angus stonefield her eyes flickered down and then up again and of course there is the other possibility which seems indelicate to mention but we are speaking to each other without pretensei do get so tired of pretense all the time dont you he may have met another woman one who offers him laughter and affection without demanding anything from him at all except the same in return he may long for the freedom from the responsibility of children and the sobriety and decorum of family life many men find a liberty to express themselves to another woman in a way they cannot to their wives if nothing else simply because they do not have to face her every day across the breakfast table if they make a fool of themselves they may walk away and never meet again he looked at her where she sat smiling at him her slender shoulders so feminine and delicate her thick shining hair her lively face with its wide eyes and always the air of composed amusement about her as if she knew some secret happiness he could well understand if angus stonefield or any other man found such a woman irresistible a blazing delicious freedom from the restrictions of the domestic round the wife who was harassed by the duties of household and children who did not feel it proper to laugh too easily or too loudly who was conscious of her duty to him and her dependence and very probably who also knew him too well and had expectations of what he should be and how it was proper for him to behave yes perhaps angus stonefield had done precisely that and if he had monk for one would not entirely blame him on the other hand he also felt a very sharp spur of envy which took him completely by surprise was drusilla speaking from supposition or had she been that exquisite delightful other woman for stonefield or for someone else he would resent it profoundly if she hadwhich was both painful and absurd but if he were as honest with himself as he was with others still real of course he said at last finishing his coffee also i shall look into that as well chapter every hour or two brought more cases of fever to the makeshift hospital in limehouse the only blessing was that it also brought more volunteers to help with what little practical nursing could be done and willing hands to help with the endless tasks of emptying cleaning laundering what sheets and blankets they had and changing the soiled straw and fetching in new local men came and carried away the bodies of the dead where do they take them enid ravensbrook asked as they sat together in the small room where monk had spoken with callandra and hester it was late afternoon dark and cold three people had died the previous night kristian had been there since the previous evening and he had taken a short break to go home wash and change his clothes and get a few hours of sleep before going back to his own hospital there was little enough he could do at the best of times there was no known medicine against typhoid only constant nursing to ease the distress keep the temperature down and some fluid in the body and the will of the victim to live callandra looked up with surprise i dont know she said i admit i hadnt thought about it i suppose toshe stopped no thats ridiculous no undertakers going to handle fever victims anyway there are too many of them theyve got to be buried enid pointed out sitting in the rickety chair where monk had sat callandra was on the other hester on the floor if not undertakers then who you cant expect gravediggers to lay out bodies properly and observe the decencies all they know is to bury coffins coffin makers will be the only people profiting out of this she took a deep breath and let it out slowly at least it has got warmer or is it just that we have more fuel in the stove im frozen callandra shivered and hugged her arms around herself hester have you put more on the fires no hester shook her head i darent or well run out weve only got enough for two more days anyway i meant to speak to bert about that and i forgot ill ask him next time i see him callandra dismissed it i dont know where hes gone enid was staring at her she looked very pate except for spots of color in her cheeks she must be exhausted she had not been home for two days just sleeping on the floor in this room when she had the chance he went out over two hours ago she added i asked him about going to the undertaker but i dont think he heard me hester glanced at callandra there must be so many funerals enid went on speaking more to herself than to either of them her face was very pale and there was a gleam of sweat across her brow and upper lip she looked up what graveyard are they putting them in do you know she turned first to callandra then to hester i dont know callandra said quietly i should find out enid sighed and pushed her hand across her brow brushing away her falling hair it doesnt matter callandra said looking past her to hester yes it does enid insisted people may ask relations may they are not burying them separately anymore hester gave the answer callandra had been avoiding what enid swiveled around she looked bleached of all color but for a feverish stain on her cheeks and her eyes were hollow as though bruised they are in common graves hester explained quietly dont grieve over it she reached over and touched enids arm very lightly on the table the candle flickered almost went out then burned up again the dead wont mind what about the living enid protested what about when all this is over and they need to grieve need a place to remember those they lost there isnt one hester answered it happens in war all you can say to the family of a soldier is that he died bravely and if it was in hospital that there was someone there to care for him there isnt anything more yes there is callandra said quickly you can tell them he died fighting for a cause serving his country here all you can say is they died because the damnable council would not build sewers and they were too poor to do it themselves thats hardly a comfort to anyone she looked across at enid and frowned they also died because they are half starved and cold all winter half of them have rickets or tuberculosis or are stunted by some other childhood disease but you can hardly put on a tombstone if you had one that they died of having been born in the wrong time and place are you all right you dont look well i have a headache enid confessed i thought i was just tired but i do feel rather worse now than i did before i sat down i thought i was hot but perhaps im cold im sorryi sound ridiculous hester stood up and crossed the short space between them bending down in front of enid searching her face her eyes she reached up her hand and placed it on her brow it was burning is it enid whispered the question too dreadful to ask hester nodded come on ill take you home but enid began then realized it was pointless she clambered to her feet swayed and buckled at the knees hester and callandra only just caught her in time to ease her back down into the chair you must go home callandra said firmly we can manage here but i cant just leave enid argued theres so much to do i yes you can callandra forced a smile there was tiredness patience and a deep grief in it she touched enid very gently but without the least indecision you will only distract us here because we cant look after you as we would wish hester will take you but enid swallowed hard and began to writhe deeply gasping and in obvious distress im sorry i think i may be sick callandra looked across and met hesters eyes fetch a pail she ordered then go and tell mary youd better find a hansom and bring it back here of course there was nothing to discuss or with which to take issue she went into the main room and returned within seconds with a pail then went to find mary who was up at the far end of the room sponging down a woman who was almost insensible with fever the rush torches on the walls threw shifting shadows over the straw and the dim shapes of bodies under the blankets there were no sounds but the rustling of feverish movement and the murmurs and cries of delirium and close to the windows the thrumming of the rain outside i fink shes a little better mary said hopefully when she realized hester was beside her good hester did not argue lady ravensbrooks got the fever now im going to find a hansom to take her home lady callandra will stay here and dr beck will be back later this evening see what you can do about some more wood alf said there was some rotten timber on the dockside itll be wet but if we stick it in here it may dry out a bit it will spark badly but in the stoves that wont matter yes miss i what im sorry about lady ravensbrook marys face was pinched with concern hester could see it even in this uncertain light thats a real shame mary shook her head didnt think a strong lady like thatd catch it you take care miss int much ter you neither she looked up and down hesters rather thin figure with kindly honesty yer aint got much ter fight agin it wif you lose alf yer weight an there wont be nuffink left hester did not agree with that piece of logic but she did not argue she pulled her shawl closer around herself and retraced her steps back between the straw beds and the entrance and went down the stairs to the outside door and the street outside was pitchdark and gusting rain on the blustery wind the solitary gas lamp just around the corner shed a haze of light through the rain guiding her towards park place she would probably have to round the narrow limehouse causeway up to the west india dock road before she could find a hansom she pulled her shawl tighter around herself and bent her head against the rain it was less than half a mile she passed several people it was still early evening and men were returning from work in factories dockyards and warehouses one or two nodded to her as their paths crossed in the misty arc of a streetlight she had become a familiar figure to far too many who knew or loved someone stricken with typhoid but to most she was just another drab woman about her business the west india dock road was busier there was plenty of general traffic goods carts drays wagons laden with bales for the docks or warehouses loads taken off barges or ready to go on in the morning horsedrawn omnibuses an ambulance and all manner of coach and carriage of the more ordinary type there were no hansoms broughams or fashionable pairs it was ten minutes before she managed to stop a hansom looking for a fare the corner of park street and gill street please she requested its less n five minutes away the cabby protested seeing her wet shawl worn boots and dull dress lost the use o yer legs ave yer look luv put worth your money you can walk it an sure as ells a waitin yer int goin ter get any wetter than yare i know thank you she forced herself to smile at him ive got a friend there who needs to go up west all the way to mayfair thats what i need you for mayfair he said with disbelief whatd anybody from ere be doin in mayfair she debated whether to tell him to mind his own business and decided swiftly against it she needed him too much enid was too ill to wait until she found another cabby who was less skeptical or inquisitive she lives there shes been helping us organize the hospital for the fever she said it in her own most cultured accent ad enough o limehouse as she he said dryly but there was no unkindness in his voice and she could not see his face since he had his back to the light for a while she replied change of clothes and some more money it was a lie but one to serve a better purpose if she told him the truth he might well whip up his horse and shed never see him again get in he said agreeably she climbed in without hesitation ignoring her wet skirts slapping around her ankles and immediately the cab lurched forward as he had said it was less than five minutes before they were outside the fever hospital and she went inside to fetch enid who was by now so dizzy and faint she was unable to walk unaided hester and callandra were obliged to come one on either side of her to support her and hester thanked god in a silent prayer that the street lamp was around the corner and the cabby could see only the lurching figures of three women and not how ghostly the center one looked with her ashen face and halfclosed eyes and the sweat streaming off her making her skin wetter even than the fine rain of the night could explain he peered at them in the gloom and snorted he had seen gentry drunk before but the sight of a drunken woman always disturbed him somehow it was worse for a woman than a man and the quality had not the same excuses still if she gave money for the sick he would reserve judgment this once yal in he said holding the horse steady as it smelled fear and threw its head up and took a step sideways old ard he ordered pulling the rein tighter come on he turned back to his passengers again ill take yer ome the journey was a nightmare by the time they reached ravensbrook house enid was hot and cold by turns and seemed unable to keep her body from shaking violently her mind wandered as if she were half waking and half in dream as soon as they drew up hester threw open the door and almost fell to the pavement calling out commands to the cabby to wait exactly where he was she rushed up the steps and rang the bell violently then again and then a third time she heard it jingling in the hall a footman came to the door his expression fixed in furious disapproval when he saw a whitefaced bedraggled young woman with wild eyes and no hat his offense knew no bounds he was a good six feet tall as a footman should be and with excellent legs and a suitably supercilious mouth lady ravensbrook is extremely ill in that hansom hester said curtly will you please assist me to carry her inside and then send for her maid and anyone else necessary to make her comfortable and who are you may i ask he was shaken but not to be stampeded by anyone hester latterly she snapped back i am a nurse lady ravensbrook is very ill will you please hurry instead of standing there like a doorpost he knew where she had been and why he wavered on the edge of argument are you hard of hearing she demanded more loudly go and fetch your mistress before she falls insensible faint and may injure herself yes maam he galvanized into action striding past her down the steps and across the pavement gleaming wet in the lamplight to the hansom where the cabby was fingering the reins nervously staring down at the doorway as if it were an open grave the footman flung the door open and with the expression of a man about to spur his horse into battle poked his head and shoulders inside to lift enid who was now fallen sideways and almost unconscious as soon as he had grasped her which even for a man of his strength was not easy he pulled her out and straightened up bearing her in his arms back across the footpath towards the door hester took a step down fishing in her reticule for money to pay the cabby but he stood up in his urgency to get his horse going flicking the long whip over its ears and was already away from the curb and increasing pace before she could go any farther she was surprised only for a moment he knew where he had picked up his fare and seeing the address to which he brought her and the liveried footman he had guessed the truth he did not want her close enough to touch or to take anything even money from her hand hester sighed and followed the footman closing the door behind her he was standing in the center of the hall helplessly enid in his arms as lifeless as a rag doll hester looked for a bell rope to pull bell she asked sharply he indicated with his head to where the ornamental rope hung no other staff had come because presumably they knew it was his duty to answer the door she strode over and yanked the rope more roughly than she had intended almost immediately a parlormaid appeared saw the footman then enid and her face went white an accident she said with a slight stammer fever hester answered going towards her she should go straight to bed i am a nurse if lord ravensbrook is willing i shall stay and look after her is he at home no maam i think you should send for him she is very ill you should have brought her sooner the footman said critically you had no right to leave her till she was in this state it came on very suddenly hester held her tongue with difficulty she was too tired and too distressed for enid to have patience to argue with anyone least of all a footman for heavens sake dont stand there take her upstairs and show me where i can find clean water a nightgown for her and plenty of towels and cloths and a basinin fact two basins get on with it man ill get dingle the parlormaid said hastily and without explaining who that was she turned on her heel and left going back through the green baize door and leaving it swinging hester followed the footman up the broad curved staircase and across the landing to the door of enids bedroom she opened it for him and he went inside and laid enid on the bed it was a beautiful room full of pinks and greens and with several chinese paintings of flowers on the walls but there was no time to observe anything but the necessities the ewer of water on the dresser the china bowl and two towels fill it with tepid water hester ordered we have hot i dont want hot im trying to bring her fever down not send it up and another bowl any sort will do and please hurry up with a flash of irritation at her manner he took the ewer and left with the door ajar behind him he had been gone only long enough for hester to sit on the bed beside enid and regard her anxiously as she began to toss and turn when the door swung wide again and a woman of about forty came in she was plain and dowdy and wore a gray stuff dress of rigid design but extremely well cut to show an upright and wellshaped figure at the present she looked in a state of considerable distress i am dingle lady ravensbrooks maid she announced staring not at hester but at enid what has happened to her is it the typhoid yes im afraid so can you help me to undress her and make her as comfortable as possible they worked together but it was not an easy task enid now ached all over her bones her joints even her skin was painful to the touch and she had such a headache she could not bear to open her eyes she seemed to be drifting in and out of consciousness suffocatingly hot one moment and shivering the next there was nothing to be done for her except bathe her in cool water at regular intervals to moderate the fever at least to some degree there were moments when she was aware of them but much of the time she was not as if the room swayed ballooned and disappeared like some ghastly vision in mirrors distorted beyond reality it was nearly two hours before there was a knock at the door and a small and very frightened maid standing well back informed hester that his lordship was home and would miss please attend on him in the library straightaway leaving dingle with enid until she returned when it would be necessary to do the first laundry hester followed the maid as she was bid the library was downstairs and at the far side of the hall around a corner it was a quiet room comfortably furnished lined with oak bookcases and with a large fire burning in the hearth it took barely a glance to notice the polished wood the warmth the faint smell of lavender beeswax and leather to know its luxury milo ravensbrook was standing by the window but he turned the moment he heard hesters step close the door miss latterly yes miss latterly he waited while she did so he was a tall man extraordinarily handsome in a dark highly patrician way his was a face in which both temper and charm were equally balanced he might be an excellent friend entertaining intelligent and quick to understand but also she judged he would be an implacable enemy i understand you brought lady ravensbrook home having observed she was taken ill he said allowing it to be half a question yes my lord she waited for him to continue watching his expression to see the fear or the pity in it it was not a mobile face there was a stiffness in him both of nature and of a rigid upbringing of selfmastery extending perhaps as far back as the nursery she had known many such men before both in the aristocracy and in the army they were born into families used to power and its responsibilities as much as its privileges they took for granted the respect and obedience of others and expected to pay for them in the selfdiscipline taught from the nursery onwards the mastery of indulgence to the softer things either emotional or physical he stood to attention like a soldier in the warm library surrounded by the deep color of the old wood velvet and leather and she could judge nothing of him at all if he was racked by pity for his wife he masked it in front of her if he was wary of hiring her or afraid of catching the illness himself it was too well hidden for her to see my footman said you are a nurse is that correct he moved his lips so very slightly it was barely discernible but there was an inflexion in his voice when he spoke the word nurse that betrayed his feelings nurses were generally women of the roughest sort very often they were drunken dishonest and of a physical appearance where the more lucrative occupation of prostitute was not open to them their duties were largely those of scrubbing emptying slops and on occasion disposing of dressings or rolling new bandages and tending to linen actual care of patients lay with doctors and most certainly all decisions attention to wounds or giving of medicines of course since florence nightingales fame in the crimea many people were aware that a nurse could be much more but it was very far from the normal case lord ravensbrook was obviously among the skeptics he would not be openly offensive without provocation but his view of her was the same as his view would have been of mary or any of the other east end women who helped in the pesthouse hester found her body stiffening and her jaws tight with anger for all her ignorance and dirt mary had a compassion which was eminently worthy of his respect she made an effort to stand even straighter yes i am she did not add sir i learned my craft in the crimea with miss nightingale my family did not approve which was not unexpected they considered i should remain at home and many someone suitable but that was not the path i wished she saw in his face that he was not in the slightest interested in her life or the reasons for her choice but reluctantly he had a certain respect the mention of the crimea held a credit he could not deny i see presumably you have tended fever before other than in limehouse regrettablyyes he raised black eyebrows straight and level above deep set eyes regrettably does that not give you an advantage of experience it is not pleasant i saw too many men die who need not have his expression closed over i am not concerned with your political opinions miss erlatterly my only interest is in your ability to nurse my wife and your willingness of course i am willing and i have as much ability as anyone then it remains only to discuss your remuneration i consider lady ravensbrook my friend she said icily i do not require remuneration she could regret that later she most assuredly required funds from somewhere but she had enormous satisfaction in denying him now it would be worth a little chill or hunger he was taken aback she could see it in his face he regarded her soiled and crumpled clothes of very mediocre quality and her weary face and straggly hair and a minuscule flicker of amusement crossed his mouth and vanished im obliged to you he accepted dingle will attend to any laundry that may be necessary and prepare and bring to you whatever food you desire but since she will be in the company of other servants she will not enter the sickroom i have a responsibility to do what i can to keep the fever from spreading throughout the household and then god knows where of course she said levelly wondering how much he was thinking of himself whether he would visit the sickroom or not we will have a cot put into the dressing room where you may rest he went on may we send to your home for any change of clothes you require if that is not suitable i am sure dingle could find you something you look not dissimilar in build remembering dingles scrubbed middleaged face and meticulously plain clothes hester found it not a flattering thought but then on the other hand she was of a surprisingly comely figure for such a dour woman so perhaps she should not be downhearted about it thank you she said briefly i am afraid i have little available at home i have been in limehouse for so many days i have had no opportunity to launder just so at the mention of limehouse his face tightened and his disapproval of enids participation was plain enough not to need words not that he would have spoken them in front of her then it is agreed you will remain here as long as it is required it was an assumption and as far as he was concerned the matter was finished she may need nursing all the time she pointed out night as well as day when the crisis comes is that more than you can cope with misslatterly she dimly heard someones footsteps crossing the hall behind her and fading away as they went into another room yes it is she said decisively especially since i still have some moral commitment to the hospital in limehouse i cannot leave lady callandra totally without experienced assistance a flash of temper crossed his face and he drew in his breath sharply my wife is a great deal more important to me miss latterly than a score of paupers in the east end who will almost assuredly die anyway if not of this then of something else if you require some remuneration then please say so it is not dishonorable to be rewarded for ones labor she curbed the answer that rose to her lips although with difficulty she was too tired to be bothered with such trivialities of arrogance and misjudgment she is also personally more important to me my lord she met his eyes very levelly but matters of duty can exceed ones own emotional ties and certainly ones individual wishes i imagine you believe that as thoroughly as i do i am a nurse and i do not abandon one patient for another no matter what my personal feelings might be a dull color flushed up his face and his eyes looked hot and angry but she had shamed him and they both knew it have you some friend or relative who could watch while i am absent she asked quietly i can show them what is to be done he thought for a moment i imagine that will be possible i will not have dingle coming and going spreading it through the house but genevieve may be willing to spend the necessary time here she can bring her children with her and they can be cared for by the staff that will serve very well it will benefit her for the time being and she will know she is of service and not feel obliged she is a very proud woman genevieve it did not really matter who he was referring to but she would like to know a relative he replied coldly by marriage an agreeable young woman who is presently in a difficult circumstance it is an excellent solution i shall attend to it and so it was that by that evening hester was established in ravensbrook house with the promised cot in the dressing room and changes of clothes from dingle which fitted adequately enid was extremely ill her entire body ached so se verely it was painful to the touch she was running so high a fever she seemed unsure of where she was and did not recognize hester even when she spoke to her gently held a cool cloth on her brow and called her by name she was perpetually thirsty and so weak she could not sit up suffi ciently to drink without assistance but she did manage to keep on her stomach the boiled water mixed with honey and salt which hester gave her from her face it was obvious that the taste of it was most unpleasant but hester knew from experience that plain water did not give the body some element it needed and so she insisted in spite of enids whispered protest at about half past nine in the evening there was a knock on the bedroom door and when she went to open it she found on the threshold a woman perhaps a year or two older than herself but with a face she knew to be far prettier than her own with a frank and earthy openness to it which she could not but like yes she inquired the woman was plainly dressed but both the cut and fabric were excellent and the style was more flattering than any servant would be permitted she knew before she spoke that this must be the relative lord ravensbrook had promised im genevieve stonefield the woman introduced herself ive come to help you nurse aunt enid i hear she is dreadfully ill hester opened the doors wider yes im afraid she is im very grateful you have come mrsstonefield did you say the name was familiar but for the moment she could not place it yes she came in through the door nervously almost immediately glancing across to the big bed where enid lay whitefaced her hair wet and straggling over her brow the room was lit only by the gas bracket on the farther wall hissing gently casting long shadows from the bedside chair and the jug on the table what can i do to help she asked iive never nursed anyone before except my own children and that was only for colds and chillsnothing like this robert once had tonsillitis but that is hardly the same hester could see that she was profoundly afraid and she could not blame her only experience made it tolerable for her she could well remember her first night in the wards in scutari she had felt so inadequate so aware of each moan or rustle of movement the minutes had dragged by as if daylight would never come the next night had been even worse because she had known in advance how long and desperate it would be if she could have run away she would have only pity for the men and shame for herself kept her there there is nothing you can give her that will help except the water from that jug hester closed the door and indicated the small blue china jug on the side table the other is just clear water for the cloths to keep her as cool as you can wash her brow and hands and neck as often as you please every ten minutes if it seems it may help she has not vomited since the very beginning but if she should seem distressed in that way be prepared for it there is a dish over there again she pointed thank you genevieve said huskily she looked alarmed youre not going just yet are you no hester assured her and when i do i will simply be in the next room to sleep for a few hours she indicated the dressing room door i cant remember when i last lay down but it seems like the day before yesterday although i dont suppose it can be i didnt know she had been ill so long genevieve was aghast why did lord ravensbrook not send for me before oh no she was only taken ill today we have been down in limehouse with the typhoid outbreak there hester replied leading the way to the bed im sorry im not being very clear genevieve swallowed her throat tight as if she would choke limehouse yes there is a very bad outbreak there at the moment we have converted a disused warehouse into a temporary hospital oh that is very good of you i believe it is not a pleasant area at all not that i know it of course she added hastily no hester agreed she could not imagine how any relative of lord ravensbrook would know limehouse or anywhere else in the east end before i go we should change the bed linen it will be much easier with two of us dingle will take the soiled sheets and attend to them together they changed the bed hester had said good night and was almost at the dressing room door when genevieves voice stopped her miss latterly whatwhat can you do for them in limehouse it isnt like this is it and wont there bewelllots of them ill yes and no it isnt like this genevieve with her charming face and wellcut gowns could not have any conception of the makeshift fever hospital in limehouse the stench of it the suffering the stupid unnecessary dirt the overflowing middens the hunger and the hopelessness there was no point in trying to tell her and no kindness we do what we can she said briefly it does help even someone there to try to keep you cool and clean and feed you a little gruel is better than nothing yes of course she seemed to want to discuss the subject but as if she regretted asking good night good night mrs stonefield it was only when hester was washing her face in the bowl of water which had been left for her that she suddenly remembered the name stonefield it was the name of the man monk was searching for in limehouse he had said he was a respectable man who had suddenly disappeared for no apparent reason other than to visit his brother in the east end and his wife feared him dead surely enid would have said something if she had overheard monk but enid had not been in the room only monk callandra and herself she was too tired now to turn it over in her mind any further all she wished was to wash the grit out of her eyes feel the warm clean water on her skin and then lie down and at last stop fighting exhaustion and allow it to overcome her she was wakened by a persistent rocking and a voice in her ear whispering her name over and over she struggled to consciousness to find a gray light seeping into the room and genevieve stonefields white and anxious face only a foot from hers yes the mumbled fighting to clear her mind and free herself from the shreds of sleep surely it couldnt be morning already it seemed she had just lain down miss latterly aunt enid seemsworse i dare not leave calling you any longer i know how tired you must bebut hester hauled herself up reaching out blindly for her robe then remembered she did not have one even her nightgown was dingles ignoring the coldthere was no fire in the dressing room although there was a fireplaceshe went past genevieve into the bedroom enid was tossing and turning and crying out with pain in a soft almost childlike whimpering as if she were completely unaware of her surroundings she seemed completely delirious the perspiration stood out on her skin even though the jug of water and a cloth were on the bedside table and the cloth was still cool and damp when hester picked it up a good deal of the sugar water was gone what can we do genevieve asked desperately from just behind her there was little enough but hester heard the fear and the grief in her voice and felt a quick pity for her if she was indeed monks client then she had enough tragedy to contend with without this bereavement added to it just try to bring the fever down she replied ring for some more water at least two jugs of it and cool no more than hand heat at the most and perhaps wed better have clean cloths and towels as well genevieve went to obey glad to have something specific to do the relief was naked in her face when the water and towels came hester put them on the table and pulled back the bedcovers ready to begin enids nightgown was soaked with perspiration and clung to her body well change her into a shift i think hester suggested and change that lower sheet again its very rumpled she reached out her hand and damp ill get the clean ones genevieve said instantly and before hester could agree or disagree she darted away and started opening the drawers of the linen press and searching she brought the shift and then went back straightaway to find a sheet leaving hester holding enid and trying alone to take off the soiled nightgown enid did what she could but she was barely conscious and it was only too apparent that every touch hurt her and every movement sent pain right through her bones and joints added to which her vision was so distorted by fever she could not focus on anything and kept misjudging where her hands could grasp hester was intent upon causing her as little additional distress as possible genevieve she called please help me here never mind the sheet yet genevieve turned around from the drawers where she was standing her face was white her hair straggling out of its pins she looked desperately tired please hester said again genevieve hesitated the silence hung between them as if she had not heard or not understood what was said then as if with a great effort she came over and stood at the far side of the bed leaned forward her head down and took enids limp body in her arms thank you hester acknowledged and pulled the nightgown off and put it away quickly and as gently as she could she bathed enid all over with cool water genevieve stood back again taking the used cloths from her and rinsing them out and wringing them then passing them back over and over she washed her own hands once or twice right up to the elbows ill get the clean sheet she offered as soon as the task was completed help me put the shift on her first will you hester asked genevieve took a deep breath gulping awkwardly but she did as she was bid she stretched out her arms and hester saw the muscles tense and saw that her hands were shaking it was only then that she realized how terrified genevieve was of catching the disease herself she was trembling and almost sick with the sheer fear of it hester was not sure how she felt a tangle of emotions rose in her she could understand it easily she had felt the same overwhelming horror in her own early experiences now time had taught her a more philosophical view she had seen hundreds of cases by far the majority of them dying of it and yet she had never been touched by it herself she had suffered the occasional chest fever or chill but nothing worse although they could certainly make one feel badly enough at the time you are not likely to get it she said aloud i never have the color burned hot up genevieves face iim ashamed to be so afraid she said haltingly its not for myselfits my children there is no one to care for them if anything happened to me you are a widow hester asked more gently perhaps in her place she would have felt the same it was more than natural it would be hard to understand any other feeling i genevieve took a deep breath i dont know i know that sounds absurd but i am not sure my husband is missing im sorry hester meant it profoundly that must be dreadful for youthe uncertainty and the loneliness yes genevieve took a deep breath and steadied herself very deliberately she slid the clean cotton shift over enids body watching every movement in her attempt not to jolt or bump her how long hester asked as they took off the old sheet twelve days genevieve replied ii know this sounds as if i have given up all faith but i believe he is dead because i know where he went and he would have been back long ago if he were able hester went over to the linen press and fetched the clean sheet together they put it on the bed moving enid gently as they did so where did he go hester asked to limehouse to see his brother genevieve answered caleb stone hester said slowly ive heard of him genevieves eyes widened then you know i am not foolish in my fear no hester agreed honestly from the little i have learned he is a violent man are you sure that is where he went yes there was no hesitation in genevieves voice he went quite often i know it seems hard to understand when caleb was so dreadful he seems to have nothing to commend him at all but you see they were twins their parents died when they were very young and they grew up together she smoothed the blanket and tucked it in with quick careful hands lord ravensbrook took them in but he is only a distant cousin and that was before he married aunt enid they were cared for by servants they had only each other to show any kind of affection to any laughteror tears if they were ill or afraid they had no one else caleb was different then angus doesnt say a great deal i think he finds it too hurtful her face was pinched with imagination of pain and the child she could not comfort within the man she loved now even the man was beyond her reach and there was nothing she could do except wait hester longed to offer her some ease or hope but there was none and to invent it would be cruel it would force her through the agony of realization acceptance and grief twice instead of once you must be tired she said instead have dingle bring us some breakfast then you should change your clothes and go to your room and sleep they had barely finished eating when there was a brisk tap on the door and before either of them could answer it opened and milo ravensbrook came in he closed it behind him and stepped a couple of yards inside he spared only a glance at hester and genevieve staring past them to enid his face bleak from his pallor and the red rims to his eyes he could have lain awake most of the night how is she he asked looking at neither of them genevieve said nothing she is very ill hester answered gently but the fact that she is still alive gives good cause for hope he swung around to her his face tight and hard you dont mince with words do you i hope you are kinder with your patients than you are with their families hester had seen fear lead to anger too often to respond with anger herself i told you the truth my lord would you rather i had told you she was better when she is not it is not what you say maam it is your manner in saying it he retorted he would not retreat he had criticized her therefore she must be wrong he would forgive her in his own time i will have the physician attend as soon as possiblewithin the hour i shall be obliged if you will remain on duty until he has been thereafter if he deems it acceptable you may go back to your patients in limehouse for a spell providing he is not of the opinion you may return further infection here with you i am sure you yourself would not wish to do that she was about to argue but he gave her no opportunity he turned instead to genevieve i am delighted you saw fit to come my dear not only are you of the greatest help to poor enid but it gives me the chance to offer you some measure of assistance in your present difficulty his face softened a fraction a tenderness above the mouth there and then gone again and as family we should be together in this anxiety and support each other should it come to be a bereavement his expression flickered unreadily i sincerely hope it will not we may yet discover there has been some form of accidentretrievable caleb is violentindeed he has lost almost every redeeming feature of his youthbut i fmd it hard to believe he would willfully injure angus he hates him genevieve said her voice thick with an inner exhaustion far deeper than the one night nursing enid the sleeplessness or the fear of disease you dont know how much nor do you my dear he said without making any move towards her all you have heard is anguss fear speaking and his very natural grief at the situation and the degradation he has seen in his brothers nature i refuse to believe it is irredeemable thank you she whispered for an instant her face was bright with gratitude and vulnerable as a childs with sudden new hope hester did not know whether to be furious with him for wakening such thoughts again in her or to pity him because of his own need she imagined the young man he must have been taking in two orphaned boys and learning to think of them as his own clothing them in his dreams teaching them the arts and truths of life sharing his experiences and beliefs and then must have come the disillusion as one of them slowly became bitter vicious and began step by tragic step to destroy himself he had burned out all that was good all the gentleness and the aspiration towards virtue until at last he had cut himself off completely and given way to a kind of despair surely such a man as caleb stone had become could only result from despair no wonder milo ravensbrook stood in his wifes sickroom and refused to believe one son could have murdered the other he was facing the loss of all those he loved except genevieve and her children who through angus were his last blood left he turned slowly and looked at enid then palefaced stiffbacked he walked out unable to bring himself to speak by midday the doctor had been and gone offering little more than sympathy hester was about to leave for limehouse when she almost ran into monk in the hallway of ravensbrook house she stopped abruptly the instant after he also had seen her what are you doing here he demanded but his face was full of relief in spite of all her intentions she felt a surge of pleasure inside her she refused to explain or excuse it to herself lady ravensbrook is ill i am caring for her she replied there was a flicker of black humor in him almost a kind of perverse satisfaction you got tired of limehouse rather quickly didnt you what about callandra is she there all by herself now that you and lady ravensbrook have left im on my way there she said tartly anger welling up inside her very intelligent monk said sarcastically then you can bring the typhoid back here with you to add to whatever lady ravensbrook already has i hadnt thought you so stupid does lord ravensbrook know perhaps he doesnt realize but i would have thought better of you it is typhoid she has she replied looking him straight in the eyes it is a risk one runs nursing fever patients but as you also pointed out callandra has very little other help except a few local women who are willing but have no experience the only other one there is kristian they have to get some rest so i imagine they are taking turns they need someone else to help for a while even if only so they can leave to buy more supplies his face was pale and he looked considerably shaken as if what she had said distressed him is she going to recover he asked after a moment i hope so shell be very tired of course but kristian will do all he can to not callandra you fool he cut across her lady ravensbrook you said she has typhoid yes you seem very slow to grasp the point but that is why i am here looking after her so why are you leaving her then he jerked his head towards the front door where she had been going is she well enough to be left alone for heavens sake shes not alone she snapped furiously genevieve stonefield is here while i am gone we are taking turns to do all we can do you think i would walk out and leave a patient i am used to you being gratuitously offensive but even you know better than that genevieve he was surprised that is what i said presumably she is your client have you proceeded any further you seemed to have had no success at all when i last saw you i have considerably more information he answered in other words no she interpreted do you really think you have time and talent enough to spare to do your own work and mine too he asked with a lift of sarcasm you rate yourself higher than the evidence supports if you want genevieve she retorted you will have to wait she cannot leave lady ravensbrook until i return and with that she brushed past him and strode towards the front door yanking it open and leaving it swinging behind her for the footman to close i came to see lord ravensbrook monk said between his teeth you monumentally stupid woman nevertheless on the evening of the day after tired as she was hester went to monks rooms in fitzroy street to give him the general information she had learned about angus and caleb stonefield from her time in ravensbrook house it was not a great deal but it might help she was not concerned so much for him as for genevieve it was a wintry night and she held the collar of her cloak up around her neck and chin as she crossed the pavement and mounted the step she rapped smartly on the door before she could change her mind she stepped back and was about to decide that he was not in and she had done all duty demanded of her when the latch turned and the door swung open monk stood just inside outlined by the light behind him from what she could see of his face he was tired and discouraged he did not hide his surprise at seeing her she felt sorry for him and was suddenly glad she had come i thought i should tell you the little i have learned about angus and caleb she explained her presence youve learned something he said quickly stepping back for her to enter perhaps she had overstated it and given him unjustified hope she felt foolish only a few facts or perhaps i should more correctly say a few peoples opinions whose opinions for heavens sake come in i dont want to stand here on the step even if you dont mind he pulled the door wider and then as she passed him closed it behind her why are you so angry she decided to stop retreating and attack instead it was more in her nature she should not allow him to make her feel as if she had to justify herself all the time if your case is going badly that is unfortunate she continued walking past him through the outer chamber to the inner one but being offensive will not help it and it is very childish you should learn to control yourself have you come all the way at this time of the evening to tell me that he said incredulously following her in you interfering opinionated monumentally arrogant woman treating the sick has gone to your brain even in your futile field surely you must have something more useful to do go and empty some slops or scrub a floor stoke a fire somewhere comfort someone if you have the faintest idea how she took off her wet cloak and handed it to him do you want to know about angus and caleb or not it was almost a relief to be just as rude in return she had guarded her tongue for so long all sorts of emotions were knotted up inside her memories of loneliness and fear of horror and exhaustion in the past pain she could not ease deaths she had been helpless to prevent all of it came back to her so much more vividly and easily than she had expected and she did not want to care about monk it was nice almost like a familiar pleasure to quarrel with him are you actually interested in helping poor genevieve or are you just taking her money his face went white she had hurt him with that last suggestion for all his faults she knew with absolute certainty he would never have done that perhaps she should not have said it but then he had insulted her professionally just as much im sorry he said tightly i had not realized that this time you had something useful to say what is it he put her cloak absentmindedly over the back of one of the chairs now she felt foolish it was not truly useful maybe he knew that too she took a deep breath and faced him his gray eyes were cold and level full of anger lord ravensbrook does not think caleb would have harmed angus she began because for all his violence they are brothers and grew up together sharing their loneliness and grief when they lost their parents but he thinks that because he loves them and cannot bear to think otherwise he has already lost his first wife and then the boys parents and now enid is terribly ill and angus is missing he was staring at her waiting for her to conclude her voice sounded thin even in her own ears but genevieve is convinced caleb has killed him she told me that in the past angus has come home with knife scars that no one else knows about he would not call a doctor he was ashamed of them i think that is why she did not tell you she does not wish anyone to think angus was not able to stand up for himself or that he was a coward angus she did not know how to phrase what she thought and make it seem sensible she could almost hear monks sarcastic dismissal even before she spoke angus loved caleb she went on hastily they were very close as children perhaps that bond still existed for him and he could never believe caleb would hurt him maybe he could even have felt guilty for his own success when caleb had so little that could be why he kept going backto try to help himfor his own consciences sake and pity can be a very hard thing to take it can eat more deeply into the soul than being hated or ignored he looked at her in silence for a long time she did not look away but stared back perhaps he conceded at length for the first time his imagination could conceive of the emotions within caleb the explosion of rage which could end in such violence it could explain both why angus did not simply leave him to rot which is what it would seem he both wanted and deserved and why caleb was stupid enough to kill the one man on the earth who still cared about him but it doesnt help me find angus well if it was caleb who killed him at least you have some idea where to look she pointed out you can stop wasting your time trying to find out if angus had a secret mistress or gambling debts he was probably just as decent as he seemed but even if he wasnt you dont need to find out and you certainly dont need to tell genevieveor lord ravensbrook they are both convinced he was an extraordinarily good man everything they knew of him was honorable generous patient loyal and innately decent he read stories to his children brought his wife flowers liked to sing around the piano and was good at flying a kite if he is dead isnt that loss enough you dont have to find his weaknesses too do you simply in the name of truth im not doing it in the name of truth he said his face screwed up with irritation and pain at the thought i want in the name of truth to find out what happened to him he went to the east end to see his twin brother who in a fit of violence which he is prone to killed him ask the people of limehousethey are terrified of him she went on urgently ive seen two of his victims myself a boy and a woman angus crossed him one time too many and caleb killed himeither by accident or on purpose you have to prove it for the sake of justice and so genevieve can know what happened and find some peace of heartand know what to do next i know what i have to do he said curtly it is a great deal harder to know how can you be as quick to tell me that she would have loved to reply succinctly and brilliantly but nothing came to her mind and before she had time to consider the matter for long there was a sharp light rap on the door monk looked surprised but he went straight over to answer it and returned a moment later accompanied by a woman who was beautifully dressed and quite charming everything about her was feminine in a casual and unaffected way from her soft honeycolored hair under her bonnet to her small gloved hands and dainty boots her face was beautiful her large hazel eyes under winged brows looked at monk with pleasure and at hester with surprise am i intruding upon you with a client she said apologetically i am so sorry i can quite easily wait somehow the suggestion was painful why had the woman automatically assumed that hester could not be a friend no i am not a client hester said more sharply than she would have wished the moment she heard her own voice i called to give mr monk some information i thought might be of assistance how kind of you miss latterly hester supplied drusilla wyndham the woman introduced herself before monk had the opportunity how do you do hester stared at her she seemed very composed and her attitude made it apparent that in spite of the fact that this was monks office her call was social monk had never mentioned her before but there was no question that he knew her and every evidence he also liked her it was there in his expression the way he stood with his shoulders straight the very slight smile on his lips unlike the hardeyed look of the moment before she came perhaps he had known her in the past she seemed extraordinarily comfortable with him hester felt a sudden awful sinking in her stomach as if there were nothing inside her of course he must have known women in the past probably loved them for heavens sake it was not impossible he had been married could a man forget such a thing if he had really loved but would monk really love anybody had he that capacity in him to love utterly and totally sharing all of himself yes for a few moments in that closed room in edinburgh he had it was precious like a brilliant star inside her memory and yet it hurt because she could not forget or dismiss it she could never think of him as she had before that never completely believe the anger or the coldness and never tell herself with any honesty that there was nothing in him she really wanted drusilla wyndham stopped talking to monk and had swung around to look at hester again her lovely eyes wide and inquiring would you care for me to wait somewhere else while you conclude your business miss latterly she asked politely i do not wish to intrude or to hold you from what else you plan for this evening i am sure you must have friends to call upon or family awaiting you it was a remark not a question it was also a very plain dismissal hester felt her neck and shoulders tighten in anger and a bitter resentment how dare this woman take charge like this as if in some way she owned monk hester knew him far better than she ever could she had shared desperate battles with him hope and courage pity and fear victory and defeat they had stood beside each other when both honor and life were threatened drusilla wyndham knew nothing of that but she might know all manner of other things perhaps she could even tell monk his lost past and if hester loved himno that was absurd if she was a true friend an honorable person she could not wish to deny him that of course she said coldly but there is no need to retire miss wyndham all that is confidential has already been said she must let her know that there were confidential things i wish you a pleasant evening she turned to monk and saw amusement in his face which infuriated her and sent the color burning up her cheeks drusilla smiled perhaps she too had read hester more accurately than she wished she felt horribly naked good night mr monk she said with a forced smile in return i hope you have more success in the future than you have found so far and she went to the door and opened it before he could get there and do it for her she stepped out into the cold street and left him to close the door after her as soon as hester had gone drusilla turned to monk i do hope my calling was not inopportune i did not mean to embarrass her the poor creature looked quite disconcerted she said it was not a personal matter but was she simply being polite her words were concerned but there was a sparkle in her eyes that looked close to laughter and a glow in her face not at all monk said firmly although he knew hester had been upset it was quite extraordinary he would never have suspected her of being vulnerable to such a feminine emotion as jealousy he was angry on her behalf it was such a gap in her armor it was uncharacteristic and yet he was also undeniably pleased she had given me the information he said to drusilla stepping back so she could come closer to the fire she had no call and no desire to remain she was about to leave when you arrived he did not add that he was delighted to see her but it was plain in his manner and he meant it to be are you working on another case beside the one you told me of she inquired no may i offer you some refreshment a cup of tea or a cup of hot chocolate it is a cold evening thank you she accepted that would be most welcome i admit i became very chilled in the hansom it was a rash thing to do to come here when i did not even know if you would be at home let alone prepared to receive company i blushed for myself when it was rather late and i was already halfway here thank you she handed him her cape and took off her bonnet running her fingers delicately through the soft curls at the edge of her brow i admit to being interested in a most unladylike fashion in the story you told me of your investigation of the unfortunate man who has been missing she looked at him with a smile i have asked among the few acquaintances i have in the geographical society and also in a musical society i know and a debating association but i learned nothing except that mr stonefield attended the geographical society once as a guest and seemed a quiet and charming man who claimed too many family and business obligations on his time to attend more often her glance strayed around the room taking in the gracious but wellworn furnishings the polished wood the rich dark colors of the eastern carpet the absolute lack of any photographs or personal mementos the others did not know him at all she continued except by repute and as a most honorable man very upright given to charitable donations of a modest sort a regular attender at church and in every way a pillar of the community there was a vividness in her eyes and a faint flush in her cheeks it is very strange is it not i fear greatly that his poor wife is correct and he has met with some harm yes monk agreed gravely he stood by the mantelshelf close to the fire she sat in the chair opposite her wide skirts almost touching the fender almost absently he rang the bell for his landlady yes i am afraid it looks more and more as if that is so what are you going to do next she asked looking up at him surely you will try to prove it how else can any sort of justice be done yes of course i will there was a sharp knock on the door and his landlady appeared she was a cheerful soul who had overcome her scruples at having an agent of inquiry in the establishment and now took a certain kind of pride in it suggesting all kinds of intrigue and glamour to other less fortunate keep ers of similar establishments in the neighborhood whose lodgers followed more pedestrian callings yes mr monk and what can i do for you she eyed drusilla with interest a lady of such beauty must either be in a marvelous distress or be a very wicked woman and highly dangerous either way it was of the utmost interest not that she would repeat a word of it of course should she chance to overhear anything two cups of hot chocolate if you please mrs mundy he replied it is a very inclement evening indeed it is that mrs mundy agreed only one in dire need would be out at this hour of a winters evening two cups of hot chocolate it is mr monk and she withdrew to set about preparing them her imagination whirling what are you going to do next drusilla asked the moment the door was closed how will you set about finding where he went and finding caleb stone that surely must be the answer mustnt it i think so he agreed amused by her eagerness and in spite of himself somewhat flattered she was attracted to him no matter how modest he might want to be that much was apparent he found himself responding because he too found her everything which appealed to him in a woman charming intelligent confident amusing and feminine with just the hint of vulnerability which complimented him it was not a completely unfamiliar feeling he had no specific memory but he responded by instinct with assurance and quite definite pleasure so you will go to the east end she urged her eyes shining yes he said looking at her with amusement baiting her gently he knew she was bored looking for adventure something utterly different from anything her friends could boast she had courage that he did not doubt and possibly even a desire to broaden her experience and to help someone for whom she felt a certain pity he knew what she was going to say ill help you she offered i am a very good judge of whether someone is lying or telling the truth and together we can speak to twice as many people as you could alone you cant come dressed like that he looked her up and down with open appreciation she was delightful to the eye a perfect blend of spirit and good taste enough beauty displayed to hold any mans attention and yet sufficiently modest and with that measure of dignity and selfpossession to make it plain she was her own person and there was immeasurably more concealed than any man could learn unless he gave a great deal of himself in return he found he most definitely wanted her to come whether she was of the slightest use or not her company would be delightful i shall borrow my maids clothing she promised when may we begin tomorrow morning he answered with no more than a hint of a smile his eyebrows raised is eight oclock too early for you not in the slightest she rejoined her chin high i shall be here at eight oclock on the dot he grinned excellent mrs mundy knocked on the door and brought in the hot chocolate monk accepted it as if it were champagne chapter in bloomsbury where they set off the next morning it was a still cold morning but as they went east and drew nearer to the river they came into fog it grew thick in the throat and sour with the smell of smoke from house and factory chimneys eventually short of the isle of dogs they could go at no greater pace than a careful walk the hansom stopped in three colt street monk paid the cabby and held out his hand to help drusilla down as she had promised she was dressed in her maids clothes a darkcolored skirt and pale undistinguished blouse under a jacket top and a cloak which could have been either brown or gray in the thin halflight of the fog it was impossible to tell she had put a shawl over her bright hair and even one or two smuts and smears on her cheeks but nothing could mask her natural beauty or the white evenness of her teeth when she smiled the cab moved off into the gloom and with a little shiver she linked her arm in his and they began the long task at first she stood well back as monk spoke to peddlers a running patterer and a ragandbone man and learned nothing of use he was not surprised that she found them alien and frightening their accents must have been hard for her to follow and their faces matted under the grime were haunted by a permanent wariness a mixture of anger and fear within a hundred yards a troop of children now joined them thinfaced wideeyed several of them barefoot even in the bitter cold of the wet cobbles they were inquisitive and eager for any odd halfpenny or farthing that might be given dirty little hands plucked at monks sleeves and at drusillas skirts which were less than half the size of her usual crinoline gradually they moved eastward in ropemakers field monk tried several shopkeepers drusilla even plucked up courage to make several suggestions herself but still they met with nothing useful there were references to caleb stone few of them flattering many of them spoken with overt fear emmett street was the same the fog from the river was even denser here hanging in thick curtains blocking out the light there was no color to drain from the drab streets with their high narrow walls sooty and damp stained the chimneys dribbling out thin wreaths of smoke middens ran out into the gutters and the smell was choking the fog deadened sound even other footsteps on the wet stones were hardly audible now and then the wail of a foghorn came from the river a street away several times drusilla looked at monk question and horror in her eyes do you want to go back he asked knowing the pity and the dismay she must feel a woman who had never seen or imagined such things before it said much for her courage that she had come this far we havent learned anything yet she said doggedly gritting her teeth thank you but i can continue he smiled at her with a warmth he had no need to affect he held her arm a little closer as they went on past the west india docks towards the isle of dogs on west ferry road monk stopped a woman with a large bosom and short very bowed legs she was carrying a bundle of rags and was about to go through a doorway which emitted a smell of burned fat and blocked drains hey monk called out the woman stopped and turned too tired for curiosity yeah im looking for someone monk began as he had so many times before its worth something to me to find him oh yeah there was a slight flicker across the impassivity of the womans face oo yer lookin fer then drusilla passed her enids drawing of angus she peered at it in the gray light then her face tightened and she thrust the drawing back at monk anger harsh in her voice if yer wants caleb stone yerll find im wivaht my elp stuff yer money int no use ter mie in me grave it isnt caleb stone monk said quickly yeah tis the woman thrust the picture back at him wotcha take me fer i know caleb stone wen i sees imp it isnt caleb drusilla said urgently stepping forward for the first time he is related to him thats why there is such a resemblance but look more closely she took the picture back from monk and passed it to the woman look at his face again look at his expression does he appear the sort of man caleb stone is the woman screwed up her face in concentration looks like caleb stone ter me all got up like a toff but got them same eyes an nose but he isnt the same drusilla insisted this is his brother garn e int got no bruvver yes he has well the woman said dubiously mebbe e do look a bit different abaht the marf particlar but i int seen im hed be welldressed and wellspoken drusilla added i toljer i int seen im an wots more i don wanter she shoved the picture back but before drusilla could take it the door swung open and a lean man with a swarthy unshaven face poked his head out int yer ever goin ter stop yer yappin yer fat cow weres me dinner i don work me guts aht ter come ome an listen ter yer yap yap yap in the street wi some tart get in ere shut yer face an come an look at this pikcher will yer the woman yelled back no particular venom in her voice at being thus spoken to still worf money ter yer she asked monk yes monk agreed the man came out reluctantly his face creased with suspicion he glared at drusilla looked at monk narrowly then finally at the picture yeah he said finally i seen im so wots it ter yer ad a pint down the artichoke then went dahn towards the river wy it wasnt caleb stone you saw monk said doubtfully no it wasnt caleb stone i saw the man mimicked his voice viciously i know the difference atween caleb stone an some geezer wi fancy manners an dressed like a toff when was this monk asked ow do i know the man said irritably las week or week afore monk put both hands harder into his pockets course yer knows yer stupid sod the woman said sharply fink an it will come back ter yer wot day was it was it afore or arter aunt give yer them socks it were the same day he said sullenly or the day afore he belched it were the day afore which makes it two weeks ago zacly an all i kin tell yer he turned to go back inside the woman shot out her hand and monk gave her a shilling that was the day angus stonefield had disappeared it was worth a shilling thank you he said graciously she grasped the money hid it in her voluminous skirts and followed her husband inside slamming the door monk turned to drusilla there was a look of triumph in her face her eyes were bright her skin glowing delighted as he was with having traced angus to the isle of dogs on the day of his disappearance even to a specific tavern his foremost emotion was pleasure in her company a lift of ex citement as he looked at her and he thought how lovely she was shall we adjourn to the artichoke and take some luncheon he said with a wide smile i think we deserve it indeed we do she agreed heartily taking his arm the very best they have to offer they ate at the artichoke and monk attempted to question the landlord a burly man with a red face and a magnificent nose squashed sideways from some ancient injury but he was busy and highly disinclined to answer any questions that were not to do with the bill of fare monk learned nothing except that it would be an excellent place in which two men might meet unnoticed afterwards they tried a few more shops and passersby there were few idlers in the thick fog and darkening afternoon by three oclock monk offered to take her home it was bitterly cold with a rawness that chilled to the bone and she must be weary thank you but you dont need to come with me she said with a smile i know you want to go on until darkness of course i shall take you he persisted you should not be alone anywhere near here nonsense she said briskly we are equals in this courtesy i accept but i refuse to be treated as an incompetent call me a hansom and i shall be home within the hour if you make me feel a burden to you you will rob me of all the pleasure i feel now she smiled at him dazzlingly laughter in her voice and the very considerable feeling of accomplishment please william she had not used his name before he found it peculiarly pleasing to hear it on her lips and the argument was telling he conceded and took her to the nearest main thoroughfare where he stopped a hansom and helped her in paid the driver and watched it retreat into the looming fog it was quickly swallowed even its lights engulfed within minutes then he turned back and spent one more hour asking probing seeking but he learned nothing more only fear and rumor of caleb stone all of it ugly he seemed an elusive man appearing and disappearing at will always angry always on the edge of violence everything that he knew convinced him the more that angus stonefield was indeed dead and that caleb had murdered him when the hatred and jealousy of years had finally exploded but how to prove it to a jury how to create more than a moral certainty a crushing sense of injustice of wrong done and all answer for it defied there was no corpse maybe there never would be everything he knew of caleb depicted him as a man of cruelty and absolute selfishness but also of considerable cunning with many friends along the waterfront who would hide himwho did whenever he was threatened but surely monk had the intelligence and the imagination to outwit him he was walking slowly almost feeling his way as the fog turned to darkness he could barely hear the muffled footsteps of others returning home in the late afternoon carriage lamps hung like moons suspended in the shrouds of mist the sound of horses hooves had no sharpness on the freezing cobbles there was so much of himself he did not know but at least since the accident he had never been permanently defeated in a case that really mattereda few thefts never a murder before the accident he knew only from what he had read of his own case notes in the police files but every case he read showed a man of relentless tenacity broad imagination and a passion for truth there had been other adversaries as harsh and violent as caleb stone and none of them had beaten him he had walked a mile and a half along the west india dock road before he finally found a hansom and directed it to take him home to fitzroy street he was expecting genevieve stonefield he had promised her some report of his progress and he must be there when she arrived he settled back in the seat and closed his eyes for the long slow journey it would be well over an hour at this time of night and in this weather even as far as bloomsbury by the time he had changed his clothes and had a hot cup of tea and genevieve had arrived he was set in his determination not only to find the truth but to prove it come in mrs stonefield he closed the door behind her and helped her with her wet cloak and bonnet she looked extremely tired there were fine lines in her face which had not been there a few days earlier thank you she accepted sitting down reluctantly perched on the edge of the chair as if to relax would somehow leave her vulnerable how is lady ravensbrook he asked ill she answered her eyes dark with distress very ill we do not know if she will live miss latterly is doing everything for her that can be done but it may not be enough mr monk have you learned anything about my husband my situation is growing desperate i am very sorry about lady ravensbrook monk said quietly and he meant it he had liked her in the brief moment they had met her face had had courage and intelligence it hurt to think of her dying so pointlessly he looked at genevieve how much more must she feel a helpless sense of loss she was sitting rigidly on the edge of her chair face earnest waiting for him to answer her questions i am afraid it begins to look increasingly as if you are right he said gravely i wish i could hold out a more helpful answer but i have traced him into limehouse on the day of his disappearance and there seems no reason to doubt he went to see caleb as he had so often before she bit her lip and her hands tightened in her lap but she did not interrupt him i am still looking but i have not yet found anyone who has seen him since then he went on but mr monk what i need is proof she took a deep breath i know in my heart what has happened i have known since he did not return home at the time he said he would i have feared it for long enough but i could not dissuade him but the authorities will not accept that her voice was rising in desperation as she could not make him understand without proof i am simply an abandoned woman and god knows london is full of them she shook her head as if in despair i cannot make any decisions i cannot dispose of property because as long as he is legally supposed to be alive it is his not mine or my childrens we cannot even appoint a new person to manage the business and willing as mr arbuthnot is he has neither the confidence nor the experience to do it adequately himself mr monk i must have proof he stared at her earnest anguished face and saw the fear in it that was all he could see it was so sharp and urgent did it mask grief she could not bear to allow herself least of all now when there was so much to be done and she was not alone where she could weep in private or was something less attractive behind ita driving concern for money property a very thriving business which would be hers alone as a widow perhaps if monk were doing his duty to angus as well as to her he would look a little closer at genevieve as well it was an ugly thought and he would far rather it had not entered his head but now that it was there he could not ignore it previously you spoke of selling the business while it is still profitable and of excellent reputation he pointed out it was irrelevantshe could do neitherbut he was interested in her change of mind have you a manager in mind i dont know she leaned forward and her full skirts touched and spilled over the fender she seemed not to notice perhaps it would be better than selling then all our present employees could remain there is that to consider she was ardent to convince him and it would be a continued source of security for us something for my sons to inherit that is better than a sum of money which can disappear alarmingly quickly a piece of misguided advice a young man willful unwilling to be counseled by those who are older and he considers staid and unimaginative i have heard of it happening he bent over and moved her skirt in case a coal should fall or spark and set it alight she barely noticed arent you looking rather far ahead he said a little coolly i have to mr monk there is no one to take care of me but myself i have five children they must be provided for there is lord ravensbrook he reminded her he has both means and influence and seems more than willing to be of every assistance i think your anxiety is greater than it need be mrs stonefield he hated it but his suspicions were wakened perhaps the relationship between herself and her husband was not as ideal as she had said possibly it was she whose affections had wandered elsewhere not he she was an extremely attractive woman there was in her an element of passion and daring far deeper than mere physical charm he found himself drawn to her watching her with fascination even while his mind was weighing and judging facts and i have already tried to explain mr monk that i do not wish to forfeit my freedom and become dependent upon the goodwill of lord ravensbrook she went on her voice thick with emotion she could not hide i wont have that mr monk as long as i have any way at all of preventing it i am growing more afraid day by day but i am not yet beyond my wits end and whether you believe it or not i am doing what my husband would have wished i knew him well for all that you may think perhaps i did not i dont doubt you did mrs stonefield it was quite out of character for him to lie he barely knew why he did it except some need to comfort her he could hardly touch her and he had no instinct to it did not come to him naturally to express himself by touch whether it ever had he could not know yes you do she said with a pinched smile a bitter humor of knowledge you have explored every other possibility than the one that caleb killed him because you think it more likely she leaned back in her chair again and finally became aware of her skirt near the fender and almost automatically tweaked it away and i suppose i cannot blame you every day i daresay some man deserts his wife and children either for money or another woman but i knew angus he was a man to whom dishonor was not only abhorrent it was frightening he avoided it as another might have the touch of leprosy or the plague her voice at last lost its steadiness and cracked with the effort of control he was a truly good man mr monk a man who knew evil for the ugliness and the ruin it is it had no disguise of charm for him his intelligence told him it was a bereaved woman speaking with the hindsight of love and his instinct told him it was the truth this is how he had always looked in her eyes and although she admired it wholeheartedly it also exasperated or oppressed her at times now so many days have passed she said very quietly i fear it may be beyond anyones ability to prove what has happened to him he felt guilty which was unreasonable even if he had followed angus on the very day he disappeared he might still not have been able to prove murder against caleb there were enough ways of disposing of a body in limehouse the river was deep there with its ebb tide to carry flotsam out and its cargo boats coming and going at the moment there were also the common graves for the victims of typhoid to name only a few he put half a dozen more coals on the fire you do not always need a body to presume death he said carefully watching her face although it may be a good deal harder to prove murder and calebs guilt i dont care about calebs guilt her eyes did not deviate from his face god will take care of him but not of you he asked i would have thought you a great deal more deserving and more urgent i cannot wait for charity mr monk she answered with some asperity he smiled i apologize of course not but i should like to deal with caleb before waiting for god i am doing all i can and i am much closer than i was last time we spoke i have found a witness who saw angus in limehouse on the day of his disappearance in a tavern where he might easily have met caleb ill find others it takes time but people will talk it is just a matter of finding the right ones and persuading them to speak ill get caleb himself in the end will you she was on the edge of hope but not allowing herself to grasp it i really dont care if you cannot prove it was caleb the shadow of a smile touched her mouth i dont even know what angus would want isnt that absurd for all that they were so utterly different and caleb hated him he still loved caleb it seemed as if he would not forget the child he had been and the good times they had spent together before they quarreled it hurt him every time he went to limehouse after caleb yet he would not give up she looked away sometimes it would be weeks especially after a particularly wretched visit but then he would relent and go back again on those times hed be gone even longer as if it were necessary to make up the difference i suppose childhood bonds are very deep did he tell you much of his visits to caleb monk asked did he give you any indication of where they met or where they might have been if you can think of any description at all it might help no she said with a slight frown as though it puzzled her on recollection he never spoke of it at all i think perhaps it was his silence which made me wonder if it was as much guilt as love which took him guilt there was a gentle pride in her face when she replied a very slight unconscious lift of her chin angus had made a success of everything his profession his family and his place in society caleb had nothing he was feared and hated where angus was loved and respected he lived from hand to mouth never knowing where the next meal would come from he had no home no family nothing in his whole life of which to be proud it was a grim picture suddenly with a jolt as if he had opened a door into a different icy world monk perceived the loneliness of caleb stone the failure that ate at his soul every time he saw his brother the happy smooth successful mirror image of what he might have been and anguss pity and his guilt would only make it worse and yet for angus too perhaps the memory of love and trust the times when all things were equal for them and the divisions and griefs of the future still unknown held a kind of sweetness that bound them together why should it boil over into violence now what had happened to change it he looked at genevieve the strain was clearly marked in her face now there were tiny lines in the skin around her mouth and eyes visible even in the gaslight angus had been gone fifteen days she was also using at least half her time nursing enid ravensbrook no wonder she was tired and riven with fear have you someone in mind you can appoint to manage the business in mr stonefields absence he asked it was hardly relevant to him and yet he found himself waiting for the answer willing that she had not it seemed so coldly practical for a woman not yet surely a widow i thought mr niven she answered frankly in spite of the error of judgment which brought him to his present state he is of absolute honesty and of unusual skill and knowledge in the business i think he would not be so rash or so lenient in anothers cause mr arbuthnot has always thought well of him and might not be averse to continuing with us if it was in mr nivens service mr niven is also very agreeable and i should not mind thinking of him in anguss place since there needs must be someone he has no family of his own and would not be seeking to put me or my sons from their place it should have made no difference whatever and yet he found himself chilled by the readiness of her reply i had not realized you knew him personally he said of course he and angus had a most cordial relationship he has dined with us on many occasions he is one of the few people we entertain in our home the shadow crossed her features again but naturally i cannot approach him yet it would be quite improper until i have some proof of anguss fate that will satisfy the law she sat very straight and sighed as if controlling herself with an effort he wondered exactly what emotion it was that lay so powerfully just beneath the surface of her composure there was a strength in her at odds with her gentle very womanly appearance the aura of obedient wife and devoted mother some depth to her far out of the ordinary it troubled him because he had liked what he had first believed of her even her quiet strength was appealing he did not want to think of it as ruthlessness i will do all i can mrs stonefield he promised his tone of voice unwittingly putting some distance between them as you suggest i shall concentrate my efforts upon satisfying the authorities that your husband is dead and leave the manner of his death for others to worry about in the meantime since it may not be an easy task or a quick one i advise you to consider lord ravensbrooks offer of a home for yourself and your family even if it is upon temporary terms she sensed his thoughts and stood up gracefully gathering her cape around her with a quick movement but her face registered distaste and a hardening stubbornness of resistance it will be a last resort mr monk and i am not yet come to that pass i think i shall call upon mr niven and test his feelings in the matter before i return to lady ravensbrook good day to you the next few hours passed with agonizing slowness for hester she sat by enids bedside watching her haggard face which was white sweatsoaked with two blotches of hectic color on the cheekbones her hair was tangled her body tensed turning and shivering with pain too sore to touch hester could do little but keep patting her softly with cool cloths but still her fever rose she was delirious seldom wholly aware of where she was genevieve returned some time in the evening and looked in for a few moments she was not due to take her turn until morning when hester would go to the dressing room for a few hours sleep they exchanged glances genevieve was flushed hester presumed it to be from the chill outside until she spoke i have just been to see mr monk i am afraid he does not understand my urgency to know of anguss fate she stopped just inside the door her voice low in case she should disturb enid sometimes i think the suspense is more than i can bear then i went to call upon mr niven titus niven he used to prosper in the same business as my husband until very lately he was also a friend even though she had spoken so softly enid started and tried to sit up quickly hester eased her down again smoothing her hair off her brow and speaking softly to her although she was uncertain if enid heard her or not genevieve looked at hester her face tight with fear the question was so plain it needed no speech she was afraid the crisis was coming and enid might not survive the night hester had no answer anything she could say would be only a guess and a hope genevieve let out her breath slowly the ghost of a smile returned to her face but it was only a reaching across pain in a moments closeness there was no happiness in it whatever comfort or ray of light titus niven had been able to give it was gone again even the gentleness with which she had spoken his name seemed forgotten there is no point in your remaining hester told her honestly it might be tonight it might not be until tomorrow theres nothing you can do except be ready to take over in the morning she tried to smile and failed i will genevieve promised touching her lightly on the shoulder then she turned and went out of the door closing it behind her with barely a click the early evening was dark rain battering against the windows behind the thick drawn curtains the clock on the mantel was the only other sound except for the soft hissing of the gas and every now and again a moan or whimper from enid a little after half past seven lord ravensbrook knocked on the door and immediately came in he looked worn and there was a flicker of fear in the back of his eyes thinly masked by pride how is she he asked perhaps it was a pointless question but he knew of nothing else to say and it was expected he needed to say something i think the crisis may be tonight she answered she saw his face pinch almost as if she had struck him she regretted for a moment that she had been so forthright maybe it was brutal but what if enid died tonight and she had not told him there was nothing he could do for her but afterwards his grief would be allied with guilt she would have treated him as if he were a child not able to stand the truth not worthy to be told it the healing would be harder and perhaps never completed i see he stood still in the middle of the room with its shadows and florals its femininity isolated by his inability to speak the social conventions that bound them to their separate roles he was a peer of the realm a man expected to have courage both physical and moral absolute mastery of his emotions she was a woman the weaker vessel expected to weep to lean on others and above all she was an employee the fact that he did not actually pay her was irrelevant he was as incapable of crossing the chasm between them as she very possibly it had not even occurred to him he simply stood still and suffered when he turned slowly his eyes were very dark and there was almost an opaque look in them as if he could not focus his gaze he took a deep breath you mean would i like to be here at the end yes yes of course i would you must send for me he stopped uncertain whether to offer to remain now he looked across the bed it had been changed only two hours ago but it was badly rumpled now in spite of hesters frequent straightening of it he drew in his breath sharply does does she know i am here i dont know hester said honestly even if she doesnt seem to she may please dont think it is futile she might be much comforted his hands were clenched by his sides should i remain he did not move towards the bed but looked at hester it is not necessary she said with instant certainty better to rest then you will have the strength when it is needed he breathed out slowly you will call me yes as soon as there is any change i promise you she inclined her head towards the bell rope near the bed as long as there is someone awake to answer they will come to you within moments thank you im most obliged miss latterly he went to the door and turned again you you do a very fine work and before she had time to respond he was gone some twenty minutes later enid began to be more troubled she tossed and turned in the bed crying out in pain hester touched her brow it was burning hot even hotter than before her eyes were open although she did not seem to be aware of the room but stared beyond hester as if there were someone behind her gerald she said huskily not here she gasped and was silent for a moment my dear you really must not comepapa will she gave a little gasp and then tried to smile you know mama favors alexander hester wrung out the cloth in cool water again and laid it across enids brow then moved the sheet and put it gently on her throat and chest she had tried to get her to drink and failed she must at least do all she could to reduce her temperature she seemed now completely delirious all right enid said suddenly dont tell papa he is such a she tossed and pulled away then suddenly seemed overtaken by sadness poor george but i simply couldnt such a bore dont understand that do you she was quiet for several minutes then tried to sit up peering at hester milo dont be so angry with him he didnt mean hush hester put her arms around enid hes not angry i promise you lie down again rest but enids body was rigid and she was breathing heavily gasping with distress milo my dear im so sorry i know it hurt you but you really shouldnt he isnt hester repeated he isnt upset he only wants you to rest and get better she held enid closer her body was burning shivering her clothes sodden with perspiration through the thin cotton she felt light as if the flesh had already shrunken and her bones were brittle only days ago she had been a strong woman so angry enid cried her voice now harsh with distress why why milo hester held her gently hes not angry my dear he really isnt if he was it was a long time ago its all over now lie still and rest for several minutes there was peace enid seemed to be easy hester had seen many people in delirium and she knew that past and present became muddled in the mind sometimes people seemed to retreat as far as childhood the delusions of fever were terrifying huge faces ballooned then retreated features were distorted became hideous and threatening full of deformities she ached to be able to help to relieve any of the anguish even to avert the crises but there was nothing she knew to do there was no medicine no treatment all anyone could do was wait and hope the gas hissed gently in the single light that was still burning the clock ticked on the mantel the fire was so low in the grate the coals were hot and red but there was no flame whickering no sound of collapsing embers enid stirred again milo she whispered shall i send for him hester asked hes only a few rooms away hell come i know it troubles you my dear enid went on as if she had not heard hesters question but you really must let it go it was only a letter he shouldnt have written there was worry in her voice and something that could even have been pity i shouldnt have laughed she trailed off and her words were lost in a mumble and then suddenly she gave a giggle of pure delight before she fell silent hester wrung out the cloth again it was time she pulled the bell and had it changed to new water clean and cool but to reach it she would have to let go of enid very gently she tried to ease herself out but enid suddenly clung to her her hand weak but desperate milo dont go of course it hurts it was shameful of him i understand my dear but again her words became jumbled and made no more sense her mind began to wander she seemed to be a young woman again men tioning dancing parties sometimes her words were indistinguishable but occasionally one or two would come through clearly a mans name a word of endearment a chiding or a farewell it seemed that either in imagination or reality enid had had many admirers and from the intimacy of her voice and the snatched references here and there some had loved her very much milos name was spoken once with a cry of frustration almost despair and then again later two or three times in a row as if she were fascinated by it and it was both tenderness and exasperation to her towards midnight she became quieter and hester feared she was slipping away she was very weak and the fever seemed if anything worse she left her for a moment to pull the bell rope dingle came almost immediately still fully dressed her face pale with distress eyes wide hester asked her to fetch lord ravensbrook and take away the water and bring fresh clean towels is it dingle started then changed her mind is it time to change the bed linen do you think before his lordship comes no thank you hester declined ill not disturb her ill help you miss it wont make any difference now is it the end dingle forced the words between stiff lips she looked very close to weeping hester wondered how long she had been with enid possibly all her adult life maybe thirty years or more if she were fortunate lord ravensbrook would have allowed enid to make provisions for her or he would do so himself otherwise she would be without a positionalthough from her white face and brimming eyes that was far from her thoughts now i think it is the crisis hester answered but she is a strong woman and she has courage it may not be the end course she has dingle said with intensity never knowd anybody like her for spirit but typhoids a terrible illness its took so many on the bed enid gave a little moan then lay perfectly still dingle gasped its all right hester said quickly seeing the faint rise and fall of enids breast but you had better fetch his lordship without delay then dont forget the waterand cool not hot just take the chill off it thats all dingle hesitated i know you done all the nursing but ill lay her out if you please of course hester agreed if its necessary but the battle isnt lost yet now please send for the water it may make a difference dingle whirled around and almost ran to the door perhaps she had thought it simply cosmetic now her feet flew along the passage and she returned in less than five minutes with a great ewer full of water barely off the chill and a clean towel over her arm thank you hester took the ewer with the briefest smile and immediately dipped the towel then she laid it still wet across enids brow and her throat then sponged her hands and lower arms help me hold her up a little she asked and ill place it on the back of her neck for a moment or two dingle obliged instantly lord ravensbrook is taking a long time hester murmured laying enid back again was he very deeply asleep oh dingle stared at her aghast i forgot im oh dearid better go and fetch him now she did not ask hester to keep silent about the omission but her eyes made the plea for her the water was more important hester said by way of agreement ill get im now dingle was already on her way to the door an id better tell miss genevieve milo ravensbrook came in within moments he had dressed but little more his hair was uncombed and lay in thick untidy curls most women would have envied with a passion his eyes were hollow and his cheeks pinched and dark with stubble he looked angry frightened and extraordinarily vulnerable he ignored hester and went up to the bed and stood staring at his wife the clock on the mantelshelf gave a faint chime of quarter past midnight its cold in here he said without turning accusation flaring in his voice youve let it get cold stoke the fire she did not bother to argue it probably did not matter now and he was not in a mood to listen obediently she went to the coal bucket picked up the tongs and placed two pieces on the hot embers they were slow to ignite use the bellows he commanded she had seen grief take people in many different ways sometimes it was dread of the loneliness which would follow the long days and years of no one with whom to share their inner thoughts the feelings which could not be explained the belief that no one else would love them as that person had and accept and understand their faults as well as their virtues for some it was guilt that somehow or other they had not said or done all that they might and now it was already too late the minutes were slipping by and still they could think of nothing adequate to say to make up for all the mistakes and missed opportunities thank you or i love you was too hard to say and too simple and for many it was the fear of death itself the absolute knowledge that one day they must face it too and in spite of even profound religious faith they did not really know what lay beyond an hour a week of formal ritual was no comfort to the mind or the soul when faced with reality faith must be part of the daily web of life a trust tested in a myriad of smaller things before it can be a bridge over the chasm of such a passage from the known to the unknown if milo ravensbrook was afraid for himself she did not blame him you can speak to her she said to him from the end of the bed to where he stood beside it still looking down at enid without touching her even if she does not respond she may hear you he raised his head his expression impatient almost accusatory it may comfort her she added suddenly the anger drained out of him he looked at hester steadily not so much at her face as at her gray dress and white apron which were not dingles clothes but her own again she realized how used he must be to women in such attire she probably did not appear very different from the nursery maid or the nanny who would have brought him up told him stories given him his food and sat with him at mealtimes and made sure he ate what was put before him disciplined him nursed him when he was sick accompanied him when he went out for walks in the park or for rides in the carriage there was a lifetimes association with the gray starched dress and a score of others like it he turned away again and obeyed her sitting on the bed his back to her enid he said a little awkwardly enid for several minutes there was no response he shifted and seemed about to move away again when she muttered something he leaned forward enid milo her voice was barely audible a whisper with a dry wheeze in the middle dont be so angry you frighten me im not angry my dear he said gently you are dreaming im not angry in the slightest he didnt mean to she sighed and was silent for several minutes ravensbrook turned to look at hester his eyes demanding an answer hester moved to the other side of the bed enid was very white her skin stretched over her cheekbones her eyes far back in her head as if the sockets were too large for them but she was still breathing barely visibly perhaps too lightly for ravensbrook to be certain it hasnt comforted her at all he choked on the words its made it worse she thinks im angry it was a charge a blame against hester for her misjudgment and you have assured her you are not surely that must be of comfort hester replied he looked away impatiently temper darkening his face angus enid said suddenly you must forgive him milo however hard it is he tried i swear he tried i know he tried ravensbrook said quickly turning towards her his own fear of the disease temporarily forgotten it is all past i promise you enid let out her breath in a long sigh and the faintest shadow of a smile touched her lips and then faded away enid he cried out taking her hand roughly hester picked up the damp cloth again and wiped enids brow then her cheeks then her lips and throat thats bloody useless woman ravensbrook said loudly lurching backwards and standing up dont go through your damned rituals in front of me cant you at least have the decency to wait until i am out of the room she was my wife for gods sake hester held her hand on enids throat high under the chin and pressed hard she felt the skin cooler the pulse weak but steady shes asleep she said with certainty i dont want your bloody euphemisms his voice was cracking but close to a shout and filled with helpless rage i wont be treated like a child by some damn servant and in my own house she is asleep hester repeated firmly the fever has broken when she wakens she will begin to get better it may take some time she has been very ill but with care she will make a full recovery that is if you dont distress her now and break her rest with your temper what he said still angry confused do you wish me to repeat it she asked no no he stood perfectly still just inside the door are you sure do you know what you are talking about yes i have seen a great deal of typhoid fever before in the east end he said derisively theyre dying like flies in the crimea she corrected him and hundreds of the men died there too but not all oh his face ironed out yes i forgot about the crimea you wouldnt had you been there she snapped he made no remark nor did he thank her but went out closing the door behind him she rang the bell to tell dingle that enid was past the crisis and have her take away the bowl of used water she also asked for a cup of tea until that moment she had not realized how devastatingly tired she was dingle brought her tea hot buttered toast a fresh stone hot water bottle and a blanket warmed next to the kitchen fire but you will stay with her wont you she asked urgently just in case yes i will hester promised for the first time since hester had arrived dingles face relaxed into a smile thank you miss god bless you monk was now certain in his own mind that there was no other course but to find caleb stone none of his doubts about genevieve warranted any delay or gave rise to anything more than a suspicion at the back of his mind an awareness haunting and painful of other possibilities but whatever they might be they still led back to caleb there would be both time and need to apportion guilt once anguss fate was known or so deeply implicated that the authorities were obliged to investigate it he dressed in old clothes which he must have purchased some time ago for such a task his own wardrobe was immaculate he had the tailors bills from past years as testament to that and to his vanity the quality and cut of it the perfectly fitting shoulders the smooth flat lapels made him wince at the expense at the same time as giving him an acute satisfaction the feel of the cloth pleased him every time he dressed as did his elegant reflection in the glass however today he was bound for limehouse and possibly the isle of dogs in search of caleb stone and he did not wish to be obvious as a stranger as such he would be both disliked and despised and most certainly lied to therefore he put on a torn striped shirt without a collar then baggy illfitting brownishblack trousers and grimaced at the figure he cut then a stained waistcoat largely for warmth and an outer jacket of brown wool with several moth holes in it he crowned it with a tall hat and refusing to look at himself againhe set out into the light drizzle of early morning he took a cab as far as the end of commercial road east in the heart of limehouse then continued on foot he already knew it was going to be difficult to find caleb he had tried tentatively before no one was eager to talk about him he turned his coat collar up and walked across britannia bridge over the dark water of limehouse cut past the town hall and onto the west india dock road then turned sharp right down three colt street towards the river and gun lane he had several places in mind to pursue the serious quest for caleb from what he had already learned of him his life was a precarious balance on the edge of survival he had been involved in various acts of violence and duplicity he had a razoredge temper and was spoken of in anxious and whispered tones but so far monk had not been able to learn exactly how he made his money nor where he lived except most approximately that it was east downriver from the west india dock he began with the pawnbroker in gun lane he had been there before he could not remember anything about either the man himself or the small room no doubt crowded with domestic objects of every kind grim reminders of the degree of poverty in the area but the mans expression of alarm when he stood over the counter and the light from the oil lamps caught his face was proof that some time in the past they had met before and monk had had the best of it of course he no longer had the power of the police to use and wiggins the proprietor was a hard man he could not have plied his trade for long if he were taken advantage of often yes he said guardedly as monk came in emptyhanded then he recognized him i dunno nuffink ter tell yer he said defensively i int got nuffin ot an i don do no bisness wi thieves he set his fat jaw hard it was a lie and they both knew it proving it was the issue monk had already decided his course i dont believe you but then on the other hand i dont care either yeah since when wigginss face registered profound disbelief since youre more use to me in business than in gaol monk replied oh yeah he leaned over the counter in the space between two stone jars on one side and a pile of pans and kettles on the other gore inter a bit o tradin on the side ave yer it was meant as an insult then as monk failed to be angry his expression suddenly changed to one of amazement gorn a bit bent ave we well i never ood a thought mr monk an all reduced ter a bit on the side urts does it not gettin a reglar wage fer ounding folks ungry are we an cold now an agin must say as yer don look the dandy as yer used ter right come down in the world we ave his smile grew with each new thought if yer wanter ock some o that fancy rig o yours i daresay as i could see me way ter a fair price sell em up west i could for a nice penny o course thats if yer don wanna be seen doin it yerself like catches yet pride do it monk made a powerful effort to control his temper he considered returning at a later date in the very best clothes he had and giving wiggins a gold sovereign just to make the point im a bad enemy when im hardpressed he replied between his teeth and im hardpressed now you was always a bad enemy wiggins said sourly an a bad friend too for all i know djer wanna ock summink or not i want to do a little business monk said carefully not with you with caleb stone wigginss face tightened ive got a job for him monk lied one ill pay him for and from what i hear he could use the money i need to know where to find him and you seem a good place to start i dunno were ter find im nor i wouldnt tell you if i did wigginss eyes were cold and hard they did not flinch a fraction as they met monks the door opened and an undersized woman came in a thin shawl held around her hunched shoulders a pair of boots in her hand she peered at monk anxiously to determine whether to wait for him to finish his affairs or not wotcher want maisie wiggins asked cutting across monk them your billys boots agin ill give yer sixpence ifn i gives yer more yerll not raise enough ter get em back ell get paid friday she said tentatively as if she were saying it more in hope than belief es got a bit o work but i gotter feed the kids gimme a shilling mr wiggins ill get it back to yet they int worth a shillin wiggins said immediately got oles in em i know them boots like the back o me and sevenpence thats the lot take it or leave it what work does billy do monk asked suddenly wiggins drew in his breath to interrupt but the woman was too quick ell do anyfink mister yer got summink as yer wants done my billyll do it for yer her thin face was full of hope i want to find caleb stone monk replied i just want to know where he lives thats all ill speak to him myself his brother has died and i want to inform him officially they were close even though his brother lived up in the west end i kin tell yer were selina lives she said after taking a deep breath shes is woman like monk fished in his pocket and brought out a shilling thats for you now and theres another when you take me to her doorstep keep the boots she grasped the shilling in a thin dirty hand shot wiggins a look halfway between triumph and the knowledge that she would certainly need him again then led the way out of the door with monk close behind her wiggins swore and spat into a brass cuspidor on the floor monk was led through lined and grimy streets down to the river and eastward as he had expected towards the isle of dogs a raw wind blew up from the water carrying the smell of salt stale fish the overspill of sewage and the cold dampness of the outgoing tide sweeping down from the pool of london towards the estuary and the sea across the gray water endless strings of barges made their heavy way downstream laden with merchandise for half the earth ships passed them outward bound down towards the docks of greenwich and beyond a brewers dray kept pace with them along the road its wheels rumbling over the uneven cobbles a ragandbone man called out dolefully as if expecting an answer two women on the corner launched into a fierce quarrel and a cat scuttered across an alleyway with a rat in its mouth they were going down bridge street with limehouse reach on one side and the west india docks on the other tall masts broke the skyline barely moving against the clouds chimneys belched thin streams of smoke up into the air maisie kept walking on past cuba street then at manilla street she stopped fird ouse along ere she said huskily dahn ve steps ony one door vats er selina er name is she held out her hand tentatively not sure if she would get the second shilling or not what does she look like he wanted to see if her description tallied with mr arbuthnots if it did he would trust her for a shilling a tart she said quickly then bit her lip quite andsome really in a flashy sort o way thin i suppose sharp nose but good eyes real good eyes she looked at monk to see if that was sufficient and saw that it was not sort o brownish air good an thick always kind o sure of erself least wen i sees er walks cocky wi a swing to er ips like i says a tart she sniffed but shes got guts ill give er that never eard er moan not like some put a good face on it no matter wot an she cant ave an easy time wi caleb stone bein like e is thank you monk gave her the shilling have you seen caleb stone me i dont go looking fer folks like that i got enough o me own troubles i reckon as mebbe i seen im once though ill deny it if yer asks in front o anyone i never saw you before monk said easily and if i were to see you again i dont suppose i should know you whats your name she smiled conspiratorially showing chipped teeth int got no name thats what i thought third house along yeah he turned and walked down the narrow footpath barely wide enough to keep his feet out of the gutter and at the third house went down the steps to the door which led off the small rubbishfilled areaway he knocked sharply and had just raised his hand to repeat it when a window covered with sacking opened above him and an old woman stuck her head out she int there come back later ifn yer want er monk leaned back to look up how much later i dunno middle o the day mebbe she ducked back in again without closing the window and monk stepped away only just in time to avoid being drenched by a pail of bedroom slops he waited in the street about twenty yards along half sheltered by an overhanging wall but from where he could still see the steps down to selinas rooms he grew steadily colder and towards noon it began to rain many people passed him perhaps taking him for a beggar or simply someone with nowhere else to be one of the thousands who lived on scraps and slept in doorways the workhouse provided food of a sort a shelter but little heat and the rigid rules were almost as harsh as those in prison there were some who thought it an even worse place no one regarded him with more than a passing observation not even curiosity and he avoided the challenge of meeting their eyes paupers such as he was pretending to be cast their glances down wary ashamed and frightened of everything shortly after noon he saw a woman approaching from west ferry road where bridge street swept around the curve of the river which formed the isle of dogs she was of average height but she strode with her head high and a kind of swing in her step even across the street he could see that her face was highly individual her cheekbones were high giving her eyes a slanted look her nose well formed if a little sharp and her mouth generous he had no doubt that this was selina her face had the courage and the originality to hold the attention of men like caleb stone who might be violent and degraded now but who had been born to better things he moved from his position his legs aching joints locked from having maintained his stillness for so long he almost stumbled off the curb his feet were so cold he had lost sensation in them he made his way across the street stepping in the filth and regaining his balance by flailing his arms furious with himself he caught up with her just as she started down the steps she swung around when he was a yard away from her a knife in her hand you watch yerself mister she warned try anyfink an ill cut yer gizzard out i warn yer monk stood his ground though she had taken him by surprise if he backed away she would tell him nothing i dont pay for women he said with a tight smile and ive never had to take one who wasnt willing i want to talk to you oh yeah disbelief was plain in her face and yet she was looking at him squarely there was no broken spirit behind her dark eyes and her fear was only physical ive come from your sisterinlaw well thats a new one she arched her fine brows with amusement i int got no sisterinlaw so thats a lie best try again i was being polite he said between his teeth the benefit of the doubt she is certainly married to angus i thought it possible you might be married to caleb her body tightened her slim hands on the broken railing were grasping it till the knuckles were white but her face barely changed did yer so wot if i are oo are yet i told you i represent anguss wife no yer dont she looked him up and down with immeasurable scorn she wouldnt give yer ouse room shed call the rozzers if summink like you even spoke to er lessn it were to ask her for an alfpennys charity monk enunciated very carefully in his best diction and if i were to come here in my usual clothes i would be as obvious its you would be dressed like that at a presentation to the queen young ladies wear white for such occasions he added an o course yer invited ter such frogs so youd know she said sarcastically but her eyes were searching his face and the disbelief was waning he put out a strong clean hand slimfingered immaculatenailed and grasped the railing near hers but did not touch her she looked at his hand a moment then back at his face wotcher want she said slowly do you want to discuss it on the step youve got nosy neighborsupstairs if nowhere else fanny bragg jealous of cow yeah shed love the chance ter throw a bucket o slops over me come on inside and she took out a key and inserted it in the door turned it and led him in the room was dark being lit by only one window and that below street level but it was larger than he would have guessed from outside and surprisingly clean the black potbellied stove gave out a considerable warmth and there was a rug of knotted rags on the floor there were three chairs of various colors and in different states of repair but all of them comfortable enough and the large bed in the shadows at the farther end was made up and covered with a ragged quilt he closed the door behind him and looked at her with a new regard whatever else she was she had done her best to make a home of this well she demanded so yer come from anguss wife wot abaht it why wot does she want wi me her lips tightened into an unreadable grimace her voice altered tone or is it caleb yer wants there was a world of emotion behind the simple pronunciation of his name she was afraid of it and yet her tongue lingered over it as if it were precious and she wanted an excuse to say it again yes caleb too he agreed she would not have believed him had he denied it why she did not move she never bothered wi me afore why now angus comes ere now an agin but she never come but angus does he said gently she stared at him there was fear in the back of her eyes but also defiance she would not betray caleb whether from love of him selfinterest because in some way he provided for her or because she knew the violence in him and what he might do to her if she let him down monk had no way of knowing and he would like to have known in spite of the contempt with which he had begun he found himself regarding her as more than just a means to find caleb or a woman who had attached herself to a bestial man simply to survive he had assumed she was not going to answer when finally she spoke e int got no love for angus she said carefully e don understand im there was something in her inflexion the lack of anger in it which made him think that she did not include herself in the feeling but it was too subtle to press and far too delicate does he ever go uptown to see him he said instead caleb her eyes widened no not im caleb never goes uptown least never that i knows look mister caleb dont live ere e just comes ere wen e feels like it i int is keeper but you are his woman suddenly there was a softness in her face the harsh lines of anger and defense melted taking years away from her leaving her for an instant in the uncertain light the twentyfiveyearold woman she should have been would have been in genevieves place or drusillas yeah she agreed lifting her chin a fraction so when he asks you you go uptown to see angus he made it a conclusion not a question again she was guarded yeah e told me ter go if hes short on the rent but i int never bin ter is ouse wouldnt know were to look fer it but you know his place of business yeah so you went on the eighteenth of january in the morning she hesitated only fractionally her eyes never left his and she knew he must have spoken to arbuthnot so wot if i did e int complainin caleb asked you like i told yer i goes up if the rents up an caleb or i int got it so you go and ask angus for it and he pays why when caleb despises him so much her jaw tightened again caleb don tell me int my business jus waned ter see is bruvver theys twins yer know that int like ordinary bruvvers is wife wont never stop that not if she tries till er dyin day caleb int got no love for angus like angus as for caleb come if caleb snaps is fingers e does she said it with a kind of pride and something towards angus which could almost have been pity were her loyalties not so plainly defined and angus came this time yeah why i tol yer she wont stop im did you see him that day yeahþþ i dont mean in the office i mean here in the isle of dogs not ere i saw im in limeouse but e were comin this way i spose e went over the west india docks twards blackwall an the river again she bent and put a piece of rotten wood into the stove and closed the door with a clatter but you saw him he persisted i jus said i saw im dont yer ear good did you see him with caleb she tipped some water out of a pail into a kettle and set it on the stove to boil i tol jer i saw im goin inter the docks twards blackwall an thats were caleb said e were goin ter be int that enough for yer is that where caleb said to meet him he asked what instructions did you give angus or did they always meet in the same place down by the cattle wharf at coldarbour often as not she replied anyow thats wot e said that time why she looked back at him oo cares e int there now why yer askin me all these things ask im e knows were e went maybe he is still there monk said raising his eyebrows she drew breath to mock him then saw the seriousness beneath his tone and suddenly doubt entered her wot jer mean yer talkin daft she put her hands on her hips look wot jer come ere fer anyway wot jer want if yer want caleb the more fool you go look fer im if angus sent yer then tell me wot fer an ill tell caleb ell come if e wants ter and not if e dont there was no point in trying to trick her no one has seen angus since you did he looked her straight in the eyeslarge dark eyes with long lashes he never returned home e never went her face paled under its dirt and paint wotcher sayin e never ran orff es got everyfink ere as e done summink is e on the run from the rozzers then a flicker of both amusement and pity touched her mouth i think it very unlikely he replied with an answering gleam of black laughter although even as he did so he realized it was not a total impossibility though it had never occurred to him before far more probable that he is dead dead her face blanched why would e be dead ask caleb caleb her eyes widened and she gulped hard thats wot yer ere fer her voice rose shrilly you fink as caleb murdered im e never why whyd e kill im arter all these years it dont make no sense but her mouth was dry and there was terror in her eyes she stared at him searching for some argument to convince him but even as she did so the hope faded and disappeared she knew from his face that he had seen the knowledge in her caleb could very easily have killed his brother and they both knew itshe from knowing caleb he from her eyes the kettle started to jiggle from the heat of the stove yerll never get im she said desperately fear and protection equal in her now yerll never take caleb stone perhaps not im more interested in proving angus is dead why she demanded that wont prove it were caleb an it sure as ellfire wont catch im or ang im her face was stricken and her voice had a thickness of emotion in it so his wife can be treated like a widow he replied and his children be fed she let out her breath well int nuffin i can do even if i were minded to she was struggling to convince him and herself she put too much certainty into it torn by loyalties you already have he replied i knew angus was last seen here going towards blackwall reach no one ever saw him after that ill deny it of course you will calebs your man even if he werent you wouldnt dare say it if he didnt want you to i int afraid o caleb she said defiantly e wouldnt urt me he did not bother to argue it was another thing they both knew was a lie thank you he said quietly goodbye for the moment she did not answer on the stove the kettle started to steam monk left manilla street and went east through the west india docks the way angus stonefield must have gone and spent all afternoon combing the docks and slums along the isle of dogs and the blackwall reach caleb stone was known well enough but no one was willing to say where he was most of them would not even commit themselves to when they had last seen him a knife grinder admitted to having spoken with him two days before a chandler to having sold him rope a week ago the keeper of the folly house tavern to seeing him regularly but none of them knew where he was to be found at any specific time and all spoke his name carefully not necessarily with fear but not lightly monk had no doubt whose side they would be on if there were ever a necessity to choose he left blackwall at dusk and was pleased to get back to fitzroy street to wash and change into his more customary attire he would go to ravensbrook house to report to genevieve after all he had something to say this time then he had a dinner engagement with drusilla wyndham the very thought of it made him smile it was like a sweet smell after the dirt and stench of the isle of dogs like laughter and bright colors after the gray misery he wore his very best jacket perhaps partly because of the memory of selina and her opinion of him but mostly it was the mood he felt every time he thought of drusilla he could see her face in his minds eye the wide hazel eyes the delicate brows the soft mass of honeyshaded hair the way her cheeks dimpled when she smiled she had grace and charm assurance wit she took nothing too seriously she was a joy to the eye and to the ear to the mind and the emotions she seemed to have the perfect judgment of exactly what to say and even when to remain silent he looked at himself in the glass adjusting his cravat to perfection then taking his overcoat and his hat he went out of the door and walked smartly to find a hansom humming a little tune to himself of course hester was likely to be at ravensbrook house but that was something he could not avoid he would almost certainly not run into her she would be in the sickroom where he would not be permitted even had he wished to go which he certainly did not he tipped his hat to a woman he passed in the arc of the street lamp the knowledge that he would not see hester was an instant relief he was in no mood to have his pres ent happiness spoiled by her criticism her constant re minder of the pain and injustices of life she was so onesided about everything she had no sense of proportion it was a fault possessed by many women they took every thing both literally and personally those like drusilla who could see the realities and yet had the courage to laugh and carry herself with consummate grace were rare indeed he was extraordinarily fortunate that she was so obviously enjoying his company every bit as much as he did hers unconsciously he increased his pace striding out over the wet pavement he was quite aware that women found him attractive he did not have to work at it there was an element in his nature which drew their fascination perhaps it was a sense of danger of emotions suppressed beneath the surface it was of no importance he simply realized it was there and from time to time had taken some slight advantage of it to use it fully would be stupid the last thing he wanted was some woman pursuing him thinking of romance even marriage he could marry no one he had no idea what lay in his past beyond the last couple of years and perhaps even more frightening than that what lay in his character he had very nearly killed one man in a blinding rage that he knew beyond question memories of those awful moments were still there buried in his mind sometimes troubling his dreams the fact that the man was one of the worst blackguards he had ever known was immaterial it was not the evil in the man he feared he was dead now killed by another hand it was the darkness within himself but drusilla knew nothing of that which was part of her allure hester did of course but then he did not want the thought of hester in his mind especially tonight or of the typhoid fever its anguish or its bitter realities he would tell genevieve stonefleld he had made a considerable stride forward today then he would leave and spend a bright witty and elegant evening with drusilla he stepped off the curb and hailed a hansom cab his voice bright with anticipation chapter the next morning monk woke with a smile and arose early the february morning was dark and windy and there was a hard frost in the sheltered hollows of the streets but he set out before eight for the east end again and the blackwall reach he meant to find caleb stone and he would not cease until he did today tomorrow or the day after if the man were alive he was too angry too distinctive and too well known to disappear by nine he was standing in thin daylight on the banks of the blackwall reach on the isle of dogs this time he did not bother with pawnbrokers or street peddlers but went straight to the places where caleb might have eaten or slept he tried hot pie sellers alehouses and taverns other vagrants who slept rough in old packing cases and discarded sails or awnings piles of rotting rope with timbers rigged to make some kind of shelter yes one old man had seen him the night before last striding down coldharbour towards the blackwall stairs he had been wearing a huge coat and the tails of it had flapped wide around his legs like broken wings was he sure it was caleb the answer was a hollow laugh he did not ask anyone else if they were sure their faces told it for them a young woman perhaps eighteen or nineteen simply ran away a onelegged man sitting awkwardly splicing ropes with horny hands said he had seen him yesterday going toward the folly house tavern he was walking rapidly against the wind and looked pleased with himself monk took himself to the folly house tavern a surprisingly clean establishment full of dark oak paneling and the smell of tallow candles whose flickering lights reflected in a mirror over the bar even at this hour of the morning there were a dozen people about either drinking ale or busy with some chore of fetching or cleaning yeah the landlord inquired cautiously monk looked ordinary enough but he was a stranger ale monk leaned against the bar casually the landlord pulled it and presented him with the tankard monk handed over threepence and a penny for the landlord who took it without comment do you know caleb stone monk said after a few minutes i might the landlord said guardedly think hell be in today monk went on dunno the landlord replied expressionlessly monk took half a crown out of his pocket and played with it in his fingers along the bar counter several other drinkers ceased moving and the dull background chatter stopped pity monk took another sip of his ale dont never know wiv im the landlord said carefully e comes wen e suits an goes wen e suits he was here yesterday monk made it a statement so wot if e were e comes ere now an then did you see him when he was here two weeks ago last tuesday ow do i know the landlord said in amazement dyer fink i write down everyone wot comes in ere every day fink i got nuftink better ter do e were another little man leaned forward bright gray eyes in a narrow face lm an is bruvver both gars ow jer know a short man said derisively ow jer know it were tuesday cos it were same day as of winnie fell orff the dray an broke is ead the little man replied with triumph that were tuesday an it were tuesday as caleb an is bruvver were ere lookin at each other fit to kill they was both of em blazin mad faces like death they ad monk could hardly believe his luck thank you mr bickerstaff the man replied pleased with the attention thank you mr bickerstaff monk amended have a drink sir you have been of great assistance to me he passed over the half crown and bickerstaff grabbed it before such largesse could prove a mirage i will he said magniloquently mr putney hif you please well ave drinks all round for them gents as is me friends an fer me new friend ere too an fer yerself o course not forgettin yerself the landlord obliged monk stayed another half hour but even in the conviviality of freeflowing beer he learned nothing further of use except a more detailed description of precisely where bickerstaff had seen caleb and angus and their obvious quarrel the early afternoon found him pursuing an ephemeral trail downriver towards the east india docks and canning town twice it seemed he was almost on calebs heels then the trail petered out and he was left in the gray winddriven rain staring at an empty dockside darkmounded barges moved silently up the river through the haze voices calling across the water in strange echoing singsong and the incoming tide whispering in the shingle he started again coat collar turned up feet soaked face set caleb stone would not escape him if he combed every rookery and tenement along the rivers edge every rickety overlapping wooden house every dock and wharf every flight of dark water slimed and sodden steps down to the incoming tide he questioned bullied argued and bribed by half past three the light was beginning to weaken and he was standing on the canal dock yard looking across the river at the chemical works and the greenwich marshes beyond veiled in misty rain he had just missed caleb again this time by no more than half an hour he swore long and viciously a bargee broadchested and bowlegged swayed along the path towards him chewing on the stem of a clay pipe gonna throw yourself in are ye he said cheerfully wi a face like that it wouldna surprise me yell find it powerful cold take yer breath away it will its bloody cold out here monk said ungraciously int nothing compared with the water the bargee said still with a smile he fished in the pocket of his blue coat and brought out a bottle ave a drop o this it dont cure much but the cold but thats somethin monk hesitated it could be any rotgut but he was frozen and bitterly angry he had come so close not if yer goin to jump mind the bargee said pulling a face waste o good rum jamaickey that is nothin else like it ever bin ter jamaickey no no i havent it was probably true and it hardly mattered the man held out the bottle again monk took it and put it to his lips it was rum a good rum too he took a swig and felt the fire go down his throat he passed it back thank you why dont ye come away from the water an have a bite ter eat i got a pie ye can have half monk knew how precious the pie was a whole pie the mans kindness made him feel suddenly vulnerable again there was too much that was worth caring about thats good of you he said gently but i have to catch up with a man and i keep just missing him what sort of a man the bargee said doubtfully although he must have heard the change in monks voice even if he could not see his expression in the waning light caleb stone monk replied a violent sort of man who almost certainly murdered his brother i dont suppose i can prove that not when the body could be anywhere but i want to know if hes dead for the widows sake i dont give a damn about caleb dont ye he murdered his brother and ye dont care the bargee said with a sideways squint id prove it if i could monk admitted but im hired to prove the brothers dead so she can at least have whats hers and feed his children i think shed sooner have that than revenge wouldnt you aye the bargee agreed aye i would that so ye want caleb yes monk stared fixedly at the darkening river was it worth trying to get across to the other side now he had no idea where to start looking or even if caleb might have doubled back and by now be safe in some comfortable public house in the isle of dogs ill take ye the bargee offered suddenly i know where es gone leastways i know where vs likely gone i dont do wi leavin baims without a father hes a bad one caleb thank you monk accepted before the man had time to change his mind whats your name mines monk oh aye dont suit ye less it be one o them inquisitor monks what used to burn folks mines archie mcleish yed better come wi me ive a boat a few paces along not much cold and wet but itll get us across and he turned and ambled off walking on the sides of his feet with a sway as if the dockside were moving monk caught up with him the inquisitors burned peo ple for their beliefs he said waspishly i dont give a sod what people believe only what they do to each other ye have the face o a man who cares archie replied without looking at him i wouldna want ye after me id as soon have the deil himself he stopped at the top of a narrow flight of steps leading down to the water where a very small boat was rising gently as the tide rose its a hard thing to care he added monk was about to deny that he cared but archie was not listening to him he had bent his broad back and was loosening the moorings which seemed to be in an extraordinarily complicated knot monk climbed in and archie settled to the oars he pulled out skillfully twisting the boat around propelling it and steering it at the same time the bank and the steps disappeared into the gray rain within yards the thought crossed monks mind that no one knew where he was he had accepted the offer without taking the slightest precaution archie mcleish could have been paid by caleb to do precisely this he must know monk was after him monk could go overboard in the darkness and mist of the river and be swept out with the ebb tide his body washed up days later or never caleb stone might be blamed but no one could prove it it would be one more accident maybe archie mcleish would even say monk threw himself in he sat gripping the gunwales determined if it came to that he would make a damned good fight of it archie mcleish would go over with him they passed barges moving steadily dark mounds in the mist riding lights to port and starboard hundreds of tons of cargo making them juggernauts on the tide if they were caught in front of one of those they would be splintered like matchwood there was no sound but the water the dismal hoot far off of a foghorn and now and then someone shouting they passed a squarerigger coming down from the pool of london its bare spars looming above them in the mist reminding monk of a row of gibbets it was growing perceptibly colder the raw wind blew through his coat as if it had been cotton shoddy and touched his bones afraid o caleb stone then are ye archie mcleish said cheerfully no monk snapped well ye look it archie pulled hard on the oars leaning his weight into them feel like i was rowing a man to is anging wi a face like that an grippin me boat like itd escape ye if ye let it go monk realized grimly how he must look and made an effort to smile it might well be worse goin ter kill im are ye archie said conversationally itd surely be one way then yed have a corpse ter pass off i daresay no oned know it wasnt his brother alike as two peas they say monk laughed abruptly i hadnt thought of itbut it sounds like a good idea in fact a brilliant one accomplish justice for everyone in one blow only trouble is i dont know if angus is dead he might not be angusd be the brother archie said with wide eyes well i dont know either im glad to say so ill not be havin to take ye back because ill no be party to murder even o the likes o caleb stone monk started to laugh and whyll that be so funny archie asked crossly i may be a rough man and not the gentleman ye seem to be although god knows ye look hard enough but ive me standards same as ye maybe better monk granted it had just occurred to me you might murder me out here in the middle of this godforsaken waste of water on calebs account archie grunted but his anger appeared to evaporate oh aye he said quietly well i could have an all he rowed in silence for several minutes the shadows of the chemical works on the farther shore loomed through the mist and archie had to change course with a wrench of the oars to avoid a barge moving out from the dim wharves as the rain drove in their faces yell be needing a spot o help then archie said after several more minutes yell no catch the like o caleb on your own possibly monk conceded but im not trying to take him into custody only to speak with him oh aye archie said skeptically an ye suppose hell believe that do ye on the face of it it was unlikely and monk was indisposed to attempt explanation partly because it was unclear in his mind anyway he simply had no alternative but to pursue caleb if you are offering to help im obliged he said tartly what do you want for it it wont be easy or pleasant not necessarily even safe archie grunted with disgust think im a fool i know what itll be a sight better than you do laddie ill come for the satisfaction o it i dinna need payin for every damn thing i do monk smiled although in the darkness he was not sure if archie could see him thank you he said graciously archie grunted they came ashore on the mudflats and moored the boat to a post sticking up like a broken tooth then archie led the way up the bank to the rough grass tussock and mud now heavily shrouded in lessening rain and near darkness there were lights ahead of them across the fields if one could call them such although from the squelch and suck on his boots monk thought it was bogland where are we he asked quietly headin for blackwall lane archie answered keep quiet sound travels even when ye dont think it hes here aye he came this way not ten minutes before us why whats here monk struggled to keep up with him feeling the ground cling to his feet and the freezing rain drift against his face is it him yere after or summat else archie asked from just ahead of him in the gloom him t dont care what else is going on monk replied then be quiet an follow me for what seemed like a quarter of an hour monk trudged through the darkness first from marshland to the road then along harder surface towards the lights of small cottages huddled on the black landscape marked out only by the dim eye of oil lamps in windows archie knocked at one door and when it was opened spoke for a few moments but so quietly monk heard no words he withdrew and the door closed leaving them in the bitter night archie waited a few minutes until his eyes grew accustomed again then led the way towards the other side of the neck of land and the far curve of the river monk opened his mouth to ask where they were going then changed his mind it was pointless he pulled his collar even closer jammed his hat down again and thrust his hands into his coat pockets and trudged on the raw fog tasted of salt sewage and the sour water that lies stagnant in fens and pools beyond the tides reach the cold seemed to penetrate the bone at last they came to the dry dock at the farthest end and archie put out his hand in warning monk caught the smell of wood smoke ahead of them was a leanto made of planking and patched with canvas archie pointed to it and then stepped aside making for the far end disappearing into the darkness almost instantly swallowed up monk took a deep breath steadying himself he had no weapon then he flung open the woodandcanvas flap inside was about a dozen square yards of space bare but for wooden boxes piled against all of the walls except the farther one where there was another doorway it was impossible to tell what the boxes contained there was a pile of rope forming a rough seat and more unraveled hemp for a bed in the center a fire was burning briskly sending smoke and flames up a roughly made chimney it was blessedly warm after the raw night outside and monk was aware of it on the front of his body even as he looked at the one man who squatted beside the fire a coal in his blackgloved hand clutched like a weapon he was tall loosely built agile but it was his face that commanded the attention it was enid ravensbrooks drawing come to life and yet it was not the bones were the same the wide jaw and pointed chin the strong nose the high cheekbones even the green eyes but the flesh of the face was different the mouth the lines from nose to corner of lips the ex pression was one of anger and mockery and at this instant poised on the edge of violence it was unnecessary to ask if he were caleb stone genevieve sent me looking for angus monk said simply standing square in the entrance blocking it caleb rose very slowly to his feet looking for angus are you he said the words as if they were curious and amusing but he was balanced to move suddenly monk watched him aware of his weight the coal in his hand he hasnt returned home caleb laughed jerkily oh hasnt he then and does genevieve think i dont know that she thinks you know it very well monk said levelly she thinks you are responsible for it kept him here have i calebs smile was derisive full of rage thieving and brawling along the river is that what she thinks he almost spat the words it was odd to see him dressed in clothes so old and soiled they had lost all color and most of their shape and yet he wore leather gloves his hair was curly and overlong matted with dirt a stubble on his chin and yet for all his hatred his words were pronounced with the clarity and diction of his youth and the education milo ravensbrook had given him monk was aware even through the contempt he felt for him of the dual nature of the man and how the promise of his youth had ended in such utter ruin had he not destroyed angus monk could have pitied him even seen some dim different reflection of himself he understood both the rage and the helplessness have you monk asked i hadnt thought so i rather thought youd killed him killed him caleb smiled this time showing fine teeth he weighed the coal in his hand without taking his eyes off monk killed angus he laughed again a hard almost choking sound yesi suppose shes right i killed angus he started to laugh harder throwing back his head and letting the noise tear out of him rising almost hysterically as if letting go of it hurt monk took a step forward caleb stopped laughing instantly cut off as if someone had put a hand over his face he glanced at monk his hand raised a little higher monk froze caleb had already murdered his brother if he were to kill monk here in these desolate marshes his body might not be found till it was rotted and unrecognizable if ever he would fight hard but caleb was strong and used to violence perhaps even to killing and he had nothing to lose without the slightest warning caleb spun around on his heel and lunged for the farther end of the hut crashing through the makeshift door and sending archie sprawling in the mud by the time monk had pushed his way through archie was scrambling to his feet again and caleb had disappeared into the rain and the darkness they could hear the squelching sound of his feet and another burst of laughter then nothing at all oliver rathbone was one of the most outstanding barristers of the decade he had eloquence discernment and an excellent sense of timing and better than that he had the kind of courage which enabled him to take up controversial and desperate cases he was at his office in vere street off lincolns inn fields when his clerk announced with a dubious expression that mr monk was here to see him on a matter of some urgency of course rathbone said with only the faintest of smiles on his lips nothing ordinary would bring monk here you had better show him in yes mr rathbone the clerk retreated and closed the door behind him rathbone folded away the papers he had been reading and tied the file they had come from he had mixed feelings himself he had always admired monks professional abilitiesthey were beyond questionand also his courage in dealing with his loss of memory and the identity that went with it but he also found his manner difficult abrasive to say the least and there was the matter of hester latterly her fondness for monk irritated rathbone although he was loath to admit it monk did not treat her with anything like the respect or regard she warranted monk brought out the worst in rathbone the greatest intolerance shortest temper and most illconsidered judgment the door opened and monk came in he was immaculately dressed as usual but he looked tired and harassed the skin under his eyes was shadowed and his muscles tense good morning monk rathbone rose as an automatic gesture of courtesy what may i do for you monk closed the door behind himself not bothering with the trivialities he began to speak as he moved to sit down in the chair opposite the desk crossing his legs i have a case upon which i need your advice he did not hesitate for rathbone to make any comment but continued straight on taking for granted that he would accept a woman consulted me concerning her husband who is missing i have traced him as far as blackwall on the isle of dogs where he was last seen in the company of his twin brother who lives there more or less just a moment rathbone held up his hand i do not deal in cases of desertion or divorce neither do i monk said tersely although rathbone knew that if that were true at all it was only so of the last few months if you permit me to finish monk continued i will reach the point a great deal sooner rathbone sighed and let his hand fall from the expression on monks face he was going to continue anyway it crossed rathbones mind to remark that if monk were taking clients from the isle of dogs he had no occasion to be supercilious but it would serve no purpose conceivably the case could still be of interest the brothers have long hated each other monk said staring at rathbone caleb the one who lives in the blackwall area survives by theft intimidation and violence angus my clients husband lives on the edge of mayfair and is a pillar of respectability and orderly family life he kept in touch with his brother out of loyalty a feeling which was not returned caleb was furiously jealous deliberately rathbone said nothing monk had hesitated only a second after the silence he swept on the wife is convinced caleb has murdered angus he has often attacked him before i tracked caleb to the greenwich marshes and he admitted having killed an gus but i can find no corpse his face was hard and tight with anger there are a dozen ways it could have been disposed of down the river is one of the most obvious buried and left to rot in the marshes stuffed in the hold of some outgoing ship or even taken to sea by caleb himself as far as the estuary and put overboard or he could be buried in a common grave with the typhoid victims in limehouse nobodys going to dig them up for a count and identification rathbone sat back in his large comfortable chair and made a steeple out of his fingers i assume no one else heard this confession of calebs of course not and what evidence have you that it may be true apart from the wifes conviction rathbone asked him she is not an impartial witness by the way how was he placed financially and what other interests might his wife have a look of contempt crossed monks face he is doing nicely as long as he is present in his business it depends upon his personal judgment it will fall into decline very rapidly if he remains absent and the estate cannot be resolved and as for the other question as far as i can determine she seems a most virtuous woman and handsome but now very anxious for the welfare of her children the irritation in monks voice might mean that he resented having his judgment questioned on the other hand rathbone thought from the level of intensity in monks eyes that he felt some pity for the woman and believed her plight but then he was uncertain that monk who was an excellent judge of men was equally as good a judge of women witness to quarrels he asked returning to the immediate issue some specific contention between the two brothers over possessions a woman an inheritance an old injury a witness who saw them together on the day angus disappeared monk replied they were quarreling then hardly damning rathbone said dryly what do i have to have legally monks face was like ice something of the weariness and frustration showed in it and rathbone guessed he had been pursuing the case profitlessly for many days and knew his chances were slight if any not necessarily a corpse rathbone leaned forward a little granting monk the seriousness he wished if you can prove angus went to the isle of dogs that there was ill feeling between the two that they were in the habit of quarreling or fighting that they were seen together that day and no one at all has seen angus since then it may be sufficient to cause the police to institute a search it will be highly unlikely to convict anyone of murder it is conceivable angus may have had an accident and fallen in the river and the body been carried out to sea he may even deliberately have lost himself taken a boat elsewhere i assume you have checked all his private and business finances of course there is nothing whatever amiss then you had better see if you can find some evidence of a quarrel and much tighter witnesses as to angus not leaving the scene of their last meeting so far you have insufficient to warrant the police investigating im sorry monk swore and rose to his feet his face set in anger and misery thank you he said grimly and went to the door leaving without turning around or looking at rathbone again rathbone sat motionless for nearly a quarter of an hour before reopening the tied file it was a delicate problem and in spite of himself monks dilemma intrigued him monk seemed morally certain that murder had been committed he knew who was killed by whom where and why and yet he could prove nothing it was legally correctand ethically monstrous rathbone racked his brain how he might help he lay awake that night and still nothing came to his mind monk was furious he had never felt more desperately frustrated he knew caleb had murdered angushe had admitted as muchand yet he was powerless to do anything about it he could not even prove death to help genevieve it was a most appalling injustice and it burned like acid inside him but he must report to genevieve she deserved to know at least as much as he did she was not at ravensbrook house a prim maid in a crisp apron and cap informed him mrs stonefield had returned home and now came only during the day then lady ravensbrook is better monk said quickly and with a pleasure that surprised him yes sir she is past the worst thank the lord miss latterly is still here would you care to speak to her he hesitated only a moment hesters face coming to his mind with such clarity it startled him nothank you my business is with mrs stonefield i shall try her home good day genevieves door was opened by a betweenmaid who looked about fifteen years old roundfaced and harassed monk gave his name and asked for genevieve he was shown into the front parlor and requested to wait a moment later the maid returned and he was taken to the small neat withdrawing room with its portrait of the queen a pianoforte legs decently skirted some embroidered samplers and a few watercolors of the bay of naples what took him aback completely was titus niven standing in front of it his coat as elegantly cut as before and as threadbare his boots polished and paper thin his face still with the same expression of wry selfdeprecating humor genevieve was close beside him as if they had been in conversation until the moment the door had opened monk had the powerful feeling that he had intruded genevieve came forward her face full of interest and concern she was still pale and the marks of strain were still visible around her eyes and lips but there was less tension in her less overwhelming sense of desperation she was an extremely attractive woman had he not met drusilla wyndham his mind might have dwelt on that fact longer good morning mr monk have you some news for me not what i would have wished mrs stonefield but yes i found caleb down in the greenwich marshes she swallowed hastily her eyes wide as if almost unconsciously titus niven moved a step closer to her also staring at monk fear flickering across his face and then resolution taking its place what did he say genevieve asked that he had killed angus but i would never prove it he hesitated im sorry he wished there were more he could add but there was nothing which was either true or would be of any help or comfort all his news offered was an end to the exhaustion of veering between hope and terror there was no justice in it nothing fair titus niven reached out his hand and touched genevieve very gently on the arm and as if hardly aware of it her hand sought his you mean there is no more you can do she said in a whisper struggling to keep her voice level and under control no that isnt what i mean monk replied thinking carefully what he said so he did not mislead her his mind was racing away with ugly thoughts about titus niven barely yet taking shape i dont hold great hope of proving his guilt although it is not impossible but i shall certainly continue to try to prove anguss deathif not directly then indirectly assuming of course that that is still what you wish there was an instants silence so intense monk could hear the gentle settling of ash in the fireplace yes genevieve said very quietly yes i wish you to continue at least for the present although i dont know how long lord ravensbrook will be willing to pay you and i would be obliged if you would keep the financial account ancy up to date i regret to ask you such a thing it seems so tasteless but i am obliged by circumstances to do so monk thought of callandra daviot and wondered if she would be prepared to support him if he continued the case without payment from genevieve or lord ravensbrook he deternuned at the first possible moment to ask her he must know the truth if caleb stone had murdered his brother out of jealousy genevieve deserved to have it proven and monk could almost taste his own keenness to see caleb answer first and if there were some other resolution even one that involved titus niven monk wanted to know it or perhaps it would be more honest to say that monk wanted to prove that it was not so the possibility haunted his mind too nebulous to grasp too ugly to forget of course i will mrs stonefield he said aloud it may be possible for one to offer sufficient proof or at least a serious case for the police to take over the investigation then there will naturally be no private cost i see i understand lady ravensbrook is past the worst and is expected to recover he went on she smiled and titus niven also relaxed although he remained close to her yes indeed thank the good lord she was most dreadfully ill and it will take her a long time to be back to herself again but at least she is alive and two days ago i had not dared hope for that and you have moved out of ravensbrook house her face tightened a shadow crossed over her eyes my presence is no longer necessary all the time miss latterly is most competent and naturally there are maids to take care of the domestic duties i go every day but it is far better for my children to be at home monk was about to argue the issue thinking of the expense of heating food even the retention of her own servants but titus niven cut across him it is good of you to be concerned mr monk but with mr stonetields disappearance there has been more than enough distress and disturbance in their lives to leave home again i am sure you agree is a trial that is best avoided as long as that is possible many answers flashed in monks mind the comfort of ravensbrook house particularly in the middle of winter the warmth the excellent food the absence of a hundred worries and responsibilities and on the other hand the lack of privacy for genevieve to receive titus niven whenever she chose perhaps it would even make it easier for her in time to move him into anguss business or install him as its new manager yes i suppose it is he conceded somewhat ungraciously i will continue to pursue such evidence as i can find can you recall mrs stonefield any remark your husband may have made about where he met his brother any comment upon surroundings circumstances which may help me to find further proof he watched her face closely for the slightest flicker of forethought guarding her tongue or feeding him information which she knew but should not have were she innocent i dont understand you mr monk she blinked he saw nothing but confusion in her did they eat together take a pint of ale for example he elaborated did they meet inside or outside on the river or ashore in company with others or alone yes i see understanding was quick in her face then distress you want to know where to look for a body titus niven winced and his sensitive mouth was pulled crooked with distaste he shot monk a look of pleading but he did not interrupt though the effort obviously cost him or a witness monk amended i am afraid he didnt or i should have told you she shook her head he never discussed his meetings with caleb it always upset him but once or twice his clothes were damp and smelled of salt and fish she took a breath and other things i cannot identify for you but most unpleasant i see thank you he had wondered if she would gently lead him to where angus was if she knew then sooner or later she would she needed his death proved standing in this gracious room knowing it to be slowly de nuded of its treasures seeing the tiny heap of coals glowing in the hearth her pale face smudged with weariness and anxiety he found it almost impossible to believe she harbored any deceit at all but he had been wrong before and the fact that he liked niven meant nothing either he must pursue it then i shall take my leave good day maam mr niven he followed his hunch diligently for the rest of that day and half of the next and learned nothing at all according to even the most critical of neighborhood gossip genevieve was as worthy as her husband a virtuous woman in every outward regard even to the point of being a trifle tedious if she had any failings they were a carefulness with money an extreme regard for it and a rather unreliable sense of humor she had been known to laugh more often than was entirely suitable and on quite inappropriate occasions titus niven was a friend of the family at least as much of anguss as hers and no no one knew any occasion when he had called at the house when angus was not also present if there had been any secret relationship then it was hidden superbly well titus niven had cause to be envious of angus stonefield both professionally and personally perhaps even to hate him but there was no evidence that indeed he did so in the early afternoon monk went back to the east end to limehouse and the makeshift typhoid hospital to see callandra daviot he wanted to see her for several reasons but paramount in his mind was the matter of funds it was obvious to monk that if lord ravensbrook withdrew his funds genevieve could not afford to employ him and the hope of being able to find proof was slight yet he was determined to follow the case to the bitter end also he needed help and the fever hospital was a good place to begin seeking more detailed local knowledge he cursed his own inadequacy if he had his memory he would probably know all kinds of people he could call upon he trudged along gill street collar up against the wind the stink of soot and middens thick in his nose the massive outline of the old warehouse was ahead of him gray against a gray sky he increased his pace just as it began to rain and was inside the entrance before he got wet the smell of illness caught in his nostrils and his throat immediately different from the usual sour rank smell outside which he was now accustomed to this was harsher and more intimate and in spite of all the will he could exercise it frightened him this was not the business of life it was pain death and the closeness of death it closed around him like a fog and he had to grit his teeth and master his body not to turn and run back out of the door into the air again he was ashamed of it and despised himself he saw the woman mary coming towards him a covered pail in her hand he knew what would be in it and his stomach knotted is lady callandra here he asked her his voice sounded brittle yeah her hair was plastered to her head with rain and sweat and her skin was pasty with exhaustion she had no strength left for politeness or even for awe of authority in there she jerked her head sideways indicating the vast space of the warehouse floor then continued on her way thank you monk went reluctantly into the cavern of the room it looked exactly the same dimly lit by candles floor covered with straw and canvas the humps of bodies visible under blankets at either end the black potbellied stoves gave off heat and the odor of coal and steam from cauldrons there was also a sharp catch in his throat from the burning tobacco leaves he remembered hester saying something about using it in the army for fumigation it took a moment for his eyes to adjust then he saw callandra standing close to one of the hunched figures on the straw kristian beck was opposite her and they were absorbed in conversation he was aware of movement to his left and turned to see hester coming towards him she seemed even thinner in the candlelight and the severe gray dress her hair screwed back unflatteringly her eyes looked larger than he had remembered her mouth softer and more capable of passion or pain he wished intensely that he had not come he did not want to see her especially here enid ravensbrook had caught typhoid here and nearly died that thought crushed his mind closing out almost everything else has something happened in your case she asked as soon as she was close enough to him to speak without being overheard nothing conclusive he replied ive found caleb but not angus what happened her expression was sharp with interest he did not want to tell her because he did not want to stand here in this fearful place talking to her if he had had any luck she would have been at ravensbrook house why arent you with lady ravensbrook he said curtly she cant be fully recovered yet its genevieves turn she said with surprise callandra needs help here i would have thought you might see that for yourself i assume from your temper that your conversation with caleb stone was unsatisfactory i dont know what else you expected he was hardly going to confess and lead you to the body on the contrary he said impatiently he did confess she raised her eyebrows and led you to the body no then confession wasnt much use was it did he tell you how he killed him or where no or even why he was thoroughly annoyed it would not be so infuriating if she were always so obstructive and unintelligent but memories kept coming to his mind of other times when she had been so different full of perception and courage he should make some allowance she must be very tired perhaps it was only natural that she should be a little slowwitted in the circumstances but then he wished intensely that she was not here anyway he hated having to admire her for it it was like gall in his mouth and the hotter taste of fear in fact perhaps that was what it wasfear and that was natural it was hard to lose a friend even one you only partially liked no decent man could view it with equanimity did he tell you why she demanded cutting across his thoughts it might be some help the dim hump of the body nearest them groaned and moved restlessly in the straw no monk said abruptly no he didnt i suppose it doesnt matter except insofar as it might have been a clue to she stopped i dont know what of course it matters he contradicted her instantly he might not have acted alone maybe genevieve put him up to it she was startled genevieve thats ridiculous why would she she has everything to lose and nothing to gain from anguss death she has a tidy inheritance to gain he pointed out and the freedom after a decent period to marry again whatever makes you think she wants to she demanded hotly it was apparent the idea was new to her and repugnant there is every evidence she loved her husband deeply what makes you think otherwise that was a challenge it was quick in her eyes and her voice he responded with a similar sharpness her close friendship with titus niven which is quite remarkable for a woman hardly on the brink of widowhood her husband is not even pronounced dead yet never mind in his grave you have a vicious mind she looked at him witheringly mr niven is a family friend for most people it is very natural to comfort a friend in time of bereavement im surprised you havent observed it in others even if you wouldnt have thought it yourself if i had just lost my wife i wouldnt turn to the most attractive woman i could find he retorted i would turn to another man her contempt only increased dont be naive if you were a woman you would turn to a man rather than a woman for the practical matters not that they are any better at it simply that they are taken seriously by others people always assume women are incompetent whether they are or not and of course they have no legal standing anyway before he could make exactly the right crushing remark callandra came over to them she too looked tired and untidy her clothes soiled but there was a look of pleasure in her face at seeing him hello william how is your case progressing i assume that is why you are here she brushed her hair out of her eyes absently at the same time smearing her face with soot from the stove but there was a lift in her voice and a calmness in her eyes as of some inner radiance she met his glance absolutely squarely is there something with which we can help you we have heard quite a lot more about this wretched man caleb stone i am not sure of what use it could be it might be of much use he said quickly i found him myself and he admitted having killed angus but i still have no corpse even if i can never prove calebs guilt much as i would like to the important thing is that the authorities will assume anguss death for the widows sake yes of course i understand is there somewhere we can talk more privately he asked looking away from hester callandra hid the faintest smile then excused herself and led monk to the small storeroom where they had spoken earlier leaving hester to return to her duties you look in an ill temper william she observed as soon as the door was closed she sat on the only chair and he sat half sideways on the bench is it the frustration of your case or have you been quarreling with hester again she gets more arbitrary and set in her ways every time i see her he responded and unbearably selfrighteous it is an extraordinarily unattractive quality especially in a woman she seems to be utterly without humor or the ability to charm which is a womans greatest asset i see callandra nodded poking the last stray end of hair into a pin behind her ear how fortunate that you feel that way now if she should catch typhoid like poor enid ravensbrook you will not be so distressed as if you were fond of her or found her pleasing it was a monstrous thing to say the idea of hester as desperately ill as enid ravensbrook or these poor souls around him was appalling it chilled his flesh as if he were frozen from the inside and she would not be cared for in luxury as enid had been there would be no one to sit with her day and night to nurse her with the skill and dedication to keep her alive he could try of course and he would but he had not the knowledge how could callandra speak so utterly heartlessly now about this case she said cheerfully ignoring his feelings altogether it sounds most frustrating what do you propose to do next or have you abandoned it he was about to make an extremely tart reply when he realized there was humor in her eyes and suddenly he felt foolish and had a brilliant memory barely a second long of standing at the kitchen table resting his chin on it watching his mother rolling pastry she had just told him something which made him realize that she knew almost everything and he knew nothing at all it had been a revelation both humiliating and at the same time comforting no i have not abandoned it he said and his voice sounded far more meek than he had intended i will continue it as long as i am able to until i find proof at the very least that angus is dead i would dearly like to prove caleb murdered him but that may be impossible her rather erratic eyebrows rose has mrs stonefield got funds for that i gathered she was in some difficulty or expected to be very shortly no she hasnt and though lord ravensbrook has agreed to pay for the investigation mrs stonefield seems worried that he will not continue to do so should he ask her she had taken very little part in the investigation she might consider the typhoid outbreak to be a more pressing need and perhaps she was right he had only the haziest idea how much disposable income she had for such things then i shall be happy to take care of the fee for as long as you believe there is purpose in continuing she looked at him steadily purpose with advantage to mrs stonefield that is or to her children thank you he said humbly did i overhear you say something about learning more of caleb stone she asked curiously and where he lives when he can be said to live anywhere from what i have heard he spends a great deal of time moving from one place to another presumably to avoid his enemies whom rumor would have to be legion yes anything you know or have heard might be helpful he accepted i need to know where they might have been seen together that day if i could produce a witness who saw them and then caleb alone i should know where to search for a body even if i did not find one it might be sufficient to make the police take up the case angus stonefield was a wellrespected man i realize why you wish it william she rose to her feet heavily i may have spent the last week nursing the sick but i have not lost my wits i shall send hester to you she has spent more time with the people than i have especially with mary i have been fighting with the frightened bitter men at the local council and all that they have said at enormous length and with enough words to fill a library providing every book were the same amounts to nothing whatever of the slightest use to man or beast and before he could argue she sailed out and he was left alone sitting on the bench in the light of one tallow candle looking at the waterstained walls and waiting for hester she was several minutes in coming and by the time she did he was thoroughly uncomfortable she arrived and closed the door he stood up automatically until she seated herself in the chair she began straightaway so obviously callandra had explained his purpose everyone seems afraid of caleb she said gravely he seems to inhabit an area stretching from the east india dock road to the river the isle of dogs he interrupted i know that much on both sides she continued ignoring him and the greenwich marshes as far as bugsbys reach a great deal of the time no one knows precisely where he is he sleeps in the dockyards on barges and sometimes with selina herries which you already know yes i do he said impatiently i need to prove he was with angus on the day he was last seen and when and where i know what you want she was unruffled but you wont prove anything unless you can persuade someone to speak to you i dont think anyone is going to betray caleb unless they can be sure he wont take his revenge on them for it and selina wont regardless she may be frightened but she loves him in her own way there was a sound of buckets clanging on the far side of the door but no one opened it he leaned forward how do you know do you know her it was foolish to get excited by the thought but it would be the last chance if he could find a way to gain her trust she may only be afraid as well hester smiled it lit her face not removing the tiredness but overriding it i dont doubt she is afraid of him she agreed and i dont doubt she has cause now and then but by all accounts she also loves him in her way and is rather proud of him proud of him in gods name what for the mans a failure in every way as soon as he had said it he wished he had not put it in such words it was a damnation and calebs vivid face with its rage and its intelligence was sharp in his mind he could have been so much more he could have been everything that angus was instead jealousy had corroded his soul until in a passion of hatred he had committed murder and destroyed not only his brother but what was left of himself the pity in monk was tight and painful fraught with loathing and yet he knew rage himself it was the grace of god that he had not killed could angus conceivably have been a hypocrite too a charming predatory blackguard too clever for anyone to catch hester did not interrupt his thoughts he wished she would instead she simply sat staring at him waiting she knew him too intimately it was uncomfortable well he demanded what could she be proud of him for because no one cheats him or abuses him she answered her voice suggesting that it was obvious hes strong everyone knows his name the fact that he chooses her makes her important people dont dare to take advantage of her either he stood up and turned away thrusting his hands into his pockets and thats the height of her ambition to be owned by the most hated and feared man in the isle of dogs god what a life he remembered selinas beautifully boned face with its wide mouth and bold eyes the proud swaying way she walked she was worth more than that its better than most women around here hester said quietly she isnt often cold or hungry and no one knocks her around except caleb he said thats something she replied calmly its many peoples dream to escape but few ever do except to the whorehouses up in the haymarket or worse he wincedat her language not at the truth mary says one pretty girl did ginny something she went on though he was not interested got married she thought but thats probably more a hope than a fact gentlemen dont marry girls they pick up in limehouse it was a bare reality and if he had said it himself he would have said it was simply the truth from her lips it had a coarseness and a finality he resented do you know anything useful he said abruptly that selina wont betray him doesnt help me you asked me she pointed out but i can tell you the names of a few of his enemies who would be delighted to see his downfall if they can do it safely can you he could not hide his eagerness he had not managed to turn up anything so definite himself of course she was trusted in a way he never could be she was living and working among these people risking her life daily to tend to them in their extremity he pushed that thought away who where do i find them she gave him a list of five namesone man three women and a youthand in all cases where he could find them thank you he said sincerely that is excellent if any one of them can tell me something we may yet help mrs stonefield i shall begin immediately but he did not that evening he had arranged to see drusilla and it was a pleasure he longed for not even to help genevieve stonefield could he forgo it and creep around the slums and rookeries of limehouse in the dark and the cold it could wait until tomorrow when it would be both easier and safer caleb had to be aware monk was still pursuing him he was not a man to wait idly to be caught the weather had cleared and it was a dry chilly evening with only the everpresent pall of smoke hiding the stars half past seven found monk superbly dressed stepping out of a hansom cab to meet drusilla on the steps of the british archaeological association in sackville street she had requested that he meet her there because she had said she had promised to accompany a friend for dinner which was a great bore she had cancelled the arrangement but in order to avoid lengthy and unnecessarily dishonest explanations she could not be at home she appeared at exactly half past as she had said she would she wore a wideskirted gown of silk the color of candlelight through brandy and it complimented her marvelously she seemed to glow in golds and tawny bronzes and her skin had a delicacy and a warmth unlike any he had seen before is something amiss she said laughingly you look terribly serious william the sound of his name from her lips was acutely pleasing he collected his attention with an effort no nothing at all i even have news which may help me eventually to find where poor angus stonefield met his death have you she said eagerly taking his arm and falling into step as he matched his pace to hers it does seem terribly tragic did he do it merely from jealousy do you suppose why now he must have been jealous of him for years she gave a little shiver i wonder what happened which suddenly made such a difference i dont suppose it really matters but dont you long to know she turned to look at him curiously dont you think it is one of the most interesting subjects in the world why people do what they do yes of course it is she could not know the nerve her question had struck in him how many of his own acts he had learned from the evidences left of his life and yet could not remember so did not know why he had done them so much can be understood even excused when one understands you look sad she was searching his face with her wide hazel eyes where shall we go so i can cheer you up do you still think the widow is innocent do you think she may have known caleb recently the idea was funny he could not imagine the socially correct moneycareful domestic genevieve having the slightest thing in common with the violent lonely caleb who lived from hand to mouth never knowing what he would eat next or where he would sleep no i dont why not she pursued after all he must look very much like her husband there must have been something in him which could have attracted her she smiled her eyes close to laughter i know you say angus was very worthy and virtuous in every way she shrugged her shoulders but perhaps he was just the slightest bit tedious some of the most worthy people are you know he said nothing dont you know some very worthy women who are crashingly dull she looked at him sideways a little through her lashes he smiled back if he had denied it she would not have believed him for a moment and perhaps angus was everything genevieve wanted and needed in a husband but he could indeed have been a bore if it were so where do you suppose they might meet she asked thoughtfully where would a respectable woman with a limited knowledge of the less salubrious sides of society go in order to meet a lover that would depend upon whether the lover were titus niven or caleb he replied not taking the idea seriously but thinking it would be fun to humor drusilla it would be a far more entertaining evening than sitting in some musical concert or listening to a lecture however profound the sub ject they crossed the road and he held her arm a trifle more tightly it was a pleasing feeling a warmth even in the raw wind that was blowing down the street and funneling between the buildings carrying the smell of a thousand smoking chimneys he entered into the spirit of it she could want something that was fun he said cheerfully if angus were a bore then definitely she would seek something he would not do a music hall she said with a laugh a penny arcade a marionette show maybe punch and judy a band or a street musician there are so many things that a stuffy man wouldnt do which could be marvelousdont you think how about a hurdygurdy a bazaar she gave a little giggle a peep show a bareknuckle fight what do you know about bareknuckle fights he asked in surprise it was such a brutal sport as well as illegal she waved a hand oh nothing i was thinking of her doing something really daring where angus would never think of looking for her and none of his social circle would ever see her either she reasoned after all it would have to be somewhere where no one she knew would ever see her they might talk and she couldnt afford that the more especially if she was party to his murder it wouldnt matter if she was seen with caleb he pointed out in the lamplight and shadow halfdecently dressed anyone would simply assume it was angus oh she bit her lip yes of course id forgotten that she was silent for a space of about fifty yards or so they came to a crossroad and he guided her around piccadilly circus and along the far side towards the haymarket most of the possibilities they mentioned were offered here in great windmill street or shaftesbury avenue already in the glare of the gas lamps and the illumination of shop windows among the theater crowds and sightseers they noticed women walking slowly with an arrogant set to their shoulders and swinging their hips in invitation skirts swayed and now and then an ankle was visible they were all sorts of women young and freshfaced from the country pale and sophisticated those who had been milliners or dressmakers or in domestic service and lost their positions through seduction older women some already riddled with venereal disease young gentlemen sauntered by welldressed taking their pick others were older even silverhaired every now and again two would disappear arm inarm into a doorway to some house of accommodation carriages passed hooves clattering occupants laughing gaudy theater signs advertised melodrama and titillation monk and drusilla passed a brazier roasting chestnuts and the wave of heat engulfed them for a moment would you like some he asked oh yes yes id love some she accepted quickly i havent tasted them for ages he bought threepence worth and they shared them nibbling carefully not to burn their lips or tongues now and then glancing at each other the chestnuts were delicious the more so for being a touch charred on the outside and too hot in the bitter evening around them swirled laughter and a spice of danger some men hurried by with coat collars drawn up and hats pulled down over their brows bent on pleasures for which they preferred to be anonymous others were quite open and swaggered brazenly calling out comments drusilla moved closer to monk her eyes bright her face smooth and glowing with an inner excitement which gave her skin a kind of radiance and made her even lovelier she was full of laughter as if she were on the edge of some wonderful joke they passed a peep show it rose to his mind to point out that they could not actually accomplish anything because they had no way of learning if genevieve had ever been here or with whom he had no likeness of her to show but to say so would have spoiled their fun and that was what actually mattered it was conceivable that genevieve had connived at anguss death but he did not believe it without a body she had nothing to gain and everything to lose an hour later as they walked up greek street towards soho square the subject arose and he was obliged to answer it but maybe the body will turn up she said stepping up the pavement from the road she swaggered a couple of steps mimicking the prostitutes and burst into laughter again im sorry she said happily but its such fun not to care a fig for an evening not to worry if everything is correct who is looking at you or listening to you if old lady soandso will disapprove and who she will repeat it to such freedom is terribly sweet thank you william for a unique evening and before he could reply she hurried on perhaps they are keeping it hidden for a reason what reason he asked amusedly he was enjoying himself too much to care about the illogicality of it all tomorrow would be time enough to pursue the real tonight was his own and drusillas ah she stopped suddenly and swung around her eyes wide and dancing with excitement i have it what if angus turns up again alive and well saying he was hurt in a terrible fight with caleb in which he was injured perhaps knocked on the head and was unable to contact anyone he was insensible delirious he thinks caleb is dead but hes alive monk pointed out ive seen him and he admitted having killed angus in no no she interrupted eagerly wait dont keep stopping me of course he isand he did dont you see the angus who turns up is really caleb he and genevieve have done away with angus and when it is too late to tell them apart and the body hasshe wrinkled her nosedecomposed sufficiently all the doctors can say is that it was one of the brothers by that time there will be no firm flesh in the face to recognize no uncallused hands clean fingernails anything like that if she says the man who returns is angus who will argue with her her hand tightened on his arm william its brilliant it explains everything he searched for a flaw in it and could not see one he did not believe it but it was perfectly possible the longer he thought about it the more possible it grew doesnt it she demanded eagerly tell me im a brilliant detective william you must take me into partnershipill find the theories to fit all your cases then you can go and find the evidence to prove them a wonderful idea he said with a laugh would you like dinner on it yes yes i would with champagne she looked around at the brightly lit street with its inviting windows where shall we dine please let us make it somewhere exciting disreputable and utterly delicious im sure you must know such a place he probably had before his accident now he could only guess he must not take her where she could be bored or where anything would happen which would embarrass or disgust her and of course he could hardly expect callandra to pay the bill for this for a start she would disapprove she would consider it a betrayal of hester no matter how absurd that was and it was absurd his relationship with hester was not one of choice but of circumstances which had thrown them together there was no romance in it only a kind of cooperation in certain areasalmost a business relationship one might say drusilla was waiting her face full of expectancy of course he agreed not daring to expose his ignorance a little further along with any luck he would see something within the next two or three hundred yards it was an excellent area for cafes taverns and coffeehouses wonderful she said happily turning to walk forward again you know i am really hungry how unladylike of me to admit it thats another thing about this evening i enjoy so much i can be hungry i can even drink what i please perhaps i shant have champagne perhaps i shall have stout or porter they had an excellent meal at a tavern where the landlord told mildly bawdy jokes and laughed uproariously and one of the regular customers lampooned various politicians and members of the royal family the atmosphere was homely and warm and a multitude of odors almost all of them pleasant wrapped them round in an island from all the daytoday reality of their separate worlds afterwards they walked nearly to the end of the street back to soho square before picking up a hansom to take her home and from there he could take it on to fitzroy street himself he realized with surprise he had no idea where she lived and he was interested when she gave the driver an address on the edge of mayfair they sat close together in the alternating darkness and light as they bowled along oxford street westwards then turned left down north audley street he could not remember having felt more perfectly at ease in anyones company and yet never for an instant bored or irritated he looked forward intensely to the next time he should see her he must think of other things to do which would entertain her when the business of angus stonefield was concluded they were passing a large house where some kind of party was coming to an end the street was full of carriages and they were obliged to slow their pace there were lights everywhere torches and carriage lamps the blaze of chandeliers from the open doors at least a dozen people stood around on the footpath and five or six more in the street liveried footmen assisted a woman to get her massive skirts into her carriage grooms held horses heads coachmen steadied the reins suddenly drusilla lurched forward her face had changed utterly there was a blind hatred in her which made her almost unrecognizable her hands went to the bosom of her gown and with a convulsive movement she tore it open ripping the fabric exposing her pale flesh and gashing it with her fingernails till it smeared blood she screamed again and again piercingly as if in mortal terror she beat her fists against his chest forcing her way past him then plunged headlong into the street landing in a heap in the road immediately she clambered to her feet still screaming and ran towards the astonished footman now trying to control a startled horse which was taking fright at the commotion monk was too stunned even to comprehend what was happening it was not until another footman tried to climb into the hansom his face contorted with outrage shouting blackguard beast that monk electrified into life he lifted his foot and sent the man sprawling backwards then yelled at the cabby to drive the cab lurched forward the driver perhaps more frightened than obedient hurling monk hard back against the seat it was a moment before he regained his balance and they were going at a very smart pace southwards fitzroy street he shouted at the driver as fast as you can do you hear me the driver shouted something back and a moment later they turned monks mind was numb it was inconceivable it was as if he had suddenly taken leave of his wits and plunged into some total insanity one moment they had been the closest of companions happy and at ease the next she had changed as if she had ripped off a mask and exposed something hideous a creature filled with hatred and consumed by it deranged prepared to risk injury by falling out of a moving carriage and the accusation she had made against him could ruin him only as he reached fitzroy street and the cab stopped did he realize the implications of what she had done it was there in the cabbys face the horror and the contempt he opened his mouth to protest his innocence and saw the uselessness of it he thrust his hand into his pocket and paid the man then strode across the footpath up the steps and in the front door he was cold to the bone chapter monk woke the next morning and memory returned like a cold tide almost choking him he gasped for breath and sat up his body shaking the evening had been wonderful full of laughter and companionship then sud denly without the slightest warning whatever drusilla had changed from the caring intimate friend she had been and became a screaming accuser her face contorted with hate he could remember it with fearful clarity as if it were still in front of him the lips drawn back the ugliness in mouth and eyes the triumph but why he hardly knew her and everything they had shared had been of the greatest pleasure she was a sophisticated delightful woman of society dabbling in a few hours amusement rather more daring than usual she was bored with her own circle she had chosen monk to take her out of it briefly and she had chosen him her interest had been perfectly plain from the moment they had met on the geographical society steps looking back on it now she had bumped into him every bit as much as he into her perhaps he should have wondered then why she was so willing to court his company most women would have been more cautious more circumspect but he had assumed that she was bored with the restrictions society placed on her and longed for the freedom he represented was she mad her behavior was more than unstable it was unbalanced this charge would ruin him but if she insisted that he attempted to force his attentions on her which she could not possibly believe then she stood to be at best the subject of speculation as well as sympathy and at worst the butt of less than charitable gossip perhaps she had escaped from bedlam or some other asylum for the insane he lay on his back staring at the ceiling no that was stupid if she were demented then it would be a private matter cared for by her family that must be it she had temporarily escaped her keepers when she was found again it would all be explained they would understand quite probably she had behaved wildly before per haps she had even done the same thing to some other unfortunate man he rose washed and shaved it was while he was staring at his face in the glass its lean planes the level gray eyes hard and clever the wide lips with the faint scar beneath that he remembered seeing the same face when he first came back from hospital he had not known it then not found it even faintly familiar he had searched it then as he might a strangers looking for character the weaknesses and the strengths the marks of appetite the signs of gentleness or humor or pity the next question was obvious was drusilla wyndham mad or had she known him before and hated him had he done her some injury which she could never forgive and this was her revenge he did not know slowly he cleaned his shaving things and put them away his hands moving automatically but if he had known her then she must surely have expected him also to know her now how had she dared approach him as if they were strangers had she changed so much she had assumed he would never recognize her that was ridiculous she was a remarkable woman not merely beautiful but most unusual her carriage her dignity and her wit were unique how could she expect any man to see her and then forget her so completely that in meeting again seeing her repeatedly speaking with her hearing her laugh he would still not remember he walked over to the window and stared out at the gray morning carriages passing below with lamps still lit she must know of the loss of his memory but how who could have told her no one knew except his personal friends hester callandra oliver rathbone and of course john evan the young policeman who had been so loyal during that first terrible case after the accident why did she hate him enough to do this it was no sudden impulse she had lied and connived from the beginning sought him out charmed him and deliberately placed him where he could be accused and had no defense they were alone her reputation was intact it was a situation in which it was quite justifiable to be he could imaginably have assaulted her and she had witnesses at least to her distress and escape who would believe his account no one it made no sense at all he could hardly believe it himself he dressed and forced himself to eat the breakfast his landlady brought you dont look well mr monk she said with a shake of her head do ope as yer not coming down wi summink ot mustard poultice me ma always used to say swear by it she did anyow tell me if yer needs one an ill make it for yer thank you he said absently think im just tired dont worry well you mind yerself then she nodded gets yerself ter some funny parts you do wouldnt be surprised if yer picked up summink nasty he mumbled a noncommittal reply and she busied herself clearing away there was a knock on the outside door and monk rose to answer it the blast of cold air chilled him the daylight was damp and gray letter for you mister a small boy said smiling at him from beneath an oversized cap fer mr monk thats you innit i knows yer i seen yer abaht who gave it to you monk demanded as a glance at the writing showed it unfamiliar it was elegant feminine and not hesters callandras or genevieve stonefields lady in a carriage guv dunno her name give me threepence ter give it yer his stomach leaped perhaps this was some explanation it would all make sense it was a mistake lady with fair hair and brown eyes he demanded fair air dunno about eyes the boy shook his head thank you monk tore the letter open it was dated that morning mr william monk i had never assumed you to be a gentleman of my own station but i had imagined you to have the rudiments of decency or i should never have consented to spend a moments time in your company other than as ordinary courtesy demanded i found your differences entertaining no more i am bored with the narrow confines of my own place in society stifled by the rules and conventions you offered a stimulating view of another level of life i cannot believe you so misunderstood my courtesy that you imagined i was willing to allow our acquaintance to be more the only explanation for your behaviour lies in your disregard for the feelings of others and your willingness to use people to achieve your own satisfactions regardless of the cost to them i can never forgive you for what you have done to me and i shall do all in my power to see that you pay to the uttermost farthing i shall pursue this through the law by word of mouth and through the civil courts if need be you shall know with every breath you take that i am your enemy and you will rue the day you chose to use me as you have such betrayal will always find its punishment drusilla wyndham he read it again his hands were shaking it was incredible but on second reading it was exactly the same y all right mister the boy said anxiously yes monk lied yes thank you he fished in his pocket and took out threepence he would not have her pay more than he the boy took it with thanks then changed his mind painfully she already gimme i know monk breathed in trying to steady himself keep it fank yer guv and before his good fortune could vanish the boy turned and ran down the street his boots clattering on the cold pavement monk closed the door and went back to his inner room his landlady had gone he sat down the letter still in his hand although he did not look at it anymore it could not possibly refer to last night or any other time over the last week she could only mean some acquaintance they had had in the past it always came back to the past and that great void in his memory the darkness where anything might exist she had used the word betrayal that implied trust was he really a man to do such a thing he had never betrayed anyone since the accident honor was one virtue he possessed he had never broken his word he would not let himself down by such an act could he have changed so much had the blow to his head not only obliterated all the past from his mind but also altered his nature was that possible he paced the floor back and forth trying to think of all the things he had pieced together about himself from before the accident the fragments that had come back to him the flashes from his childhood in the north glimpses of the sea its violence and its beauty he recalled his eagerness to learn fleeting impressions a face a sense of injustice and desperation the man who had been his mentor and who had been deceived and ruined and monk had been unable to help nothing he could do had saved him that was when he had abandoned commerce and dedicated himself to the police that was not a man who would betray in the police he had risen quickly he knew from a dozen minor evidences peoples faces when he met them again remarks half heard he had been cruel of tongue critical at times ruthless runcorn his old superior had hated him and little by little monk had learned it was not without cause monk had contributed to runcorns failures and inadequacies he had undermined him steadily even if runcorn had at least in part brought it upon himself with his petty hatreds and his personal ambitions which he was prepared to achieve on the backs of others was that a kind of betrayal no it was cruelty but it was not dishonest betrayal was always eventually a kind of deceit he knew almost nothing about his relationships with women the only one of whom he had any recollection was hermione whom he had thought he loved and in that he was the loser if anyone was betrayed it was he it was hermione who had been so much less than she promised she who had been too shallow to grasp at love who had preferred the comfortable the unchallenging the safe he could still feel the hollowness of loss when he had found her again so full of hope and then the disillusion the utter emptiness but he must have known drusilla that hatred on her face had some terrible reason some foundation in a relationship where she felt so wronged she had been prepared to do even this to be revenged he had already read through all the letters and the bills he could find when he first returned home from the accident trying then to reconstruct some framework to his life there was little enough he was careful with money but extravagant as far as personal appearance was concerned his tailors bills were high as were his shirtmakers and bootmakers even his barbers there had been no personal letters except from his sister beth and he had obviously been remiss in writing back to her now he searched through them again but there was nothing in the same hand as drusillas letter admittedly there was nothing else personal he put them all back it was a sparse record for a lifetime there was no sense of identity in it no feeling for the nature and personality of a man there must be so much that he did not know and probably never would there must have been loves and hates generosities injuries hopes humiliations and triumphs they were all wiped out as if they had never happened except that for everyone else they were still there sharp and real still carrying all their emotion and pain how could he have known a woman like drusilla with her vitality beauty wit and charm and simply have forgotten her so totally that even on seeing her again being so happy with her he still had no hint of memory nothing was familiar rack his brain as he might there was no chord no flash of even momentary recollection he stared out of the window at the street it was still gray but the carriage lamps were no longer lit it would be a delusion to think she would not proceed of course she could prove nothing nothing had happened but that was immaterial she could make the charge and it would be sufficient to ruin him his livelihood depended on his reputation on trust he had no other skills perhaps she knew that what had he done to her what manner of man was hehad he been hester was still taking her turn nursing enid ravensbrook who was now beginning the long slow journey to recovery but still needed constant attention or she could slip into relapse the same morning that monk received his letter from drusilla hester returned from the makeshift hospital to ravensbrook house tired and thoroughly miserable she ached from lack of sleep her eyes stung as if she had grit or dust in them and she was heartsick of the sights and sounds and smells of distress so many people had died the bare few who had recovered gave it all meaning but it was small in the sight of so much loss and no matter how hard kristian tried what arguments he put up in the local government council nothing was done they were frightened of the disease frightened of the cost of new sewers frightened of innovation or change of new inventions which might not work of old ones which had already failed and of blame no matter what they did it was an exhausting struggle and almost certainly doomed to failure but neither he nor callandra could give up hester had watched them day after day marshaling new arguments and returning to battle each evening they had retired defeated the only good to come of it was the tenderness they shared with each other and even that was fraught with pain after the fever they would part again to see each other only occasionally formally perhaps in meetings of the board of governors of the hospital where kristian worked and callandra gave her help voluntarily these meetings would be in front of all the other governors or if they were fortunate perhaps a chance encounter in a corridor with the constant expectation of interruption they would speak of anything and everything but themselves in all probability it would always be so hester was welcomed in by the parlormaid and told that a supper was prepared if she wished it after she had seen lady ravensbrook and mrs stonefield she thanked the girl and went upstairs enid was propped up in bed leaning against a pile of pillows she looked gaunt as if she had not eaten or slept in days there were bruised hollows around her eyes and her skin looked discolored and paperfragile her hair hung in lank strings around her shoulders and she was so thin the bones seemed in danger of hurting the flesh stretched across them but she smiled as soon as she saw hester how are they she asked her voice still weak only lifted by the eagerness inside her is it easing at all how about callandra is she all right and mary and kristian hester felt some of the tension slip away from her the room was warm and comfortable there was a fire in the hearth it was a different world from the coldness and the dirt of the hospital the guttering candles and the smell of too many people unwashed close together in their pain hester sat on the edge of the bed callandra and mary are still well though very tired she replied and kristian is still fighting the council but i dont think he has won a yard of ground and yes i think the fever is lessening a little certainly there are fewer deaths we sent two people home today both well enough to leave who are they did i know them yes hester said with a broad smile one is the little boy you were so fond of the one you thought could never survive hes all right enid said in amazement her eyes lighting hes recovered yes he went home today i dont know what gave him the strength but he survived enid leaned back against her pillows a great sweetness in her face almost a radiance and the other she asked a woman with four children hester answered she went home to them today as well but how are you thats what i came to know it was a question only of friendship she would make her own determination the improvement in enid was great her eyes were clearer her temperature down to normal but the fever had wasted her and she looked at the very end of her strength enid smiled very impatient to feel better she confessed i hate feeling so weak i can barely lift my hands to feed myself much less comb my hair its absurd i lie here uselessly there is so much to do and i am spending three quarters of my life asleep it is the best thing hester assured her dont fight against it it is natures way of healing you you will be better the faster if you submit to it enid clenched her teeth i hate to surrender military tactics hester leaned forward conspiratorially never fight when you know your enemy has the advantage pick a time dont let him do it for you retreat now and return when the advantage is yours ever thought of being a soldier enid asked with a giggle which turned into a cough frequently hester replied i think i could make a better fist of it than many who do it now certainly i could barely do worse dont let my husband hear you say that enid warned happily hesters reply was cut off by genevieves appearance she looked less harassed than when hester had seen her last although she must have been tired and hester knew from monks remark that there had been no good news she greeted her and after an exchange of necessary information regarding enid they both left to partake of the meal which had been set for them in the housekeepers sitting room the fever is definitely abating in limehouse hester said conversationally i only wish we could do something to prevent it coming back again what could anyone do genevieve asked with a frown the way people live it is bound to arise every so often change the way they live hester replied genevieve smiled bitterness and a kind of revulsion in it not untouched by both anger and pity youd have more luck trying to stop the tide from turning she speared a piece of meat in her steak and kidney pudding and put it in her mouth then spoke again the moment after she had swallowed it you cant change people oh one or two maybe but never thousands theyve lived like that for generations never enough to eat the breads full of alum the milks half water she gave a sharp laugh even the tea is better for poisoning the rats than for humans drinking only working men get things like pigs trotters or kippers the rest of the family does without nobody has fruit or vegetables everybody in the street in two streets has to queue with pails for water from the wells and half of them are contaminated by sewers cesspits or middens even if they didnt use the one pail for everything her voice was angry bitter and racked with emotion theyre born with disease and they die with it a few sewage pipes arent going to change that yes they can hester said slowly her mind dizzy with the force of genevieves passion bewildered by its suddenness and ringing sincerity its the drains and the middens where the problem lies genevieves lip curled its the same thing no it isnt hester argued leaning forward across the table if there were proper watercarrying sewers built then water genevieve looked amazed and horrified then it would go everywhere no it wouldnt yes it would ive seen that when the tide turns or theres a heavy rain it all backs up the middens overflow the gutters run sewage even when it goes down again what it leaves behind sits in piles on the pavements you can shovel it off where hester said slowly an incredible idea taking form in her mind something so ludicrous it could even be true wild and absurd as it seemed what genevieves face colored painfully she fumbled for words and found none wellperhaps i havent seen i should have said i had heard she bent as if to resume eating her food but only toyed with it pushing it around with her fork caleb lives in limehouse doesnt he rester remembered i believe so genevieves body tensed and her hands stopped moving her fork why i certainly havent heard it from him i only met him once or twice i barely even knew him the fear and the horror were sharp in her face and a loathing too great for words hester felt ashamed for having brought up the name of the man who had taken so much from her instinctively she put out her hand and touched genevieves where it lay on the table im sorry i wish i had not spoken of him there must be pleasant things for us to discuss i met mr niven in the hall yesterday as i was leaving he seems a very gentle man and a good friend to you genevieve flushed yes he is she admitted he was very fond of angus in spite of the the business misfortunes which befell him because of anguss greater skill he really is quite able you know he has learned from his incautious judgments im glad hester said sincerely she had liked nivens face and she certainly liked genevieve perhaps he will yet find a position where he can mend his situation genevieve looked down there was an awkwardness in her but her short chin was set in determination and there was tenderness and grief in her wide mouth i i am considering offering him the management of my business that is that is of course if i am permitted to she gazed at hester you must think me very cold no one has yet proved what happened to my husband although i know in my heart and here i am discussing who i will put in his place she leaned forward pushing her unfinished plate out of the way i cannot help angus anymore i tried everything i knew to persuade him not to go to caleb but he wouldnt listen to me now i have to think of my children and what will happen to them the world wont wait while i grieve her eyes were steady and gazing back at her hester realized some of the strength in her the power of the resolve which had made her what she was and which now drove her on to rein in her own pain guard and control it for the sake of her children perhaps some of her admiration was plain in her expression because the defensiveness eased out of genevieve and she smiled ruefully a little at herself genevieve seemed such a formal name for such a woman almost an earthy woman one with such a vivid reality in the lamplight hester could see the shadow her lashes cast on her cheek and the very faint down on the skin had angus called her genny genny ginny was that where it all came from the explanation for her acutely observed understanding of the people of limehouse and their like and the terror of poverty was it a dreadful familiarity which set her determination that at almost any cost she would not allow her children ever to be cold hungry frightened and ashamed as she had been the squalor and despair of the limehouse slums was huge in her memory and no present comfort would ever expunge it perhaps she was the girl mary had spoken of who had escaped limehouse to marriage yes hester said quietly yes i see i am sure monk will do everything he can to prove anguss death and he is extremely clever if he cannot do it one way he will find another dont despair genevieve looked at her hope in her eyes and curiosity do you know him well hester hesitated what was the answer to that she was not sure she even knew it herself much less that she was prepared to share it what did she know of him the areas she did not know were vast cavernous perhaps they were even areas he did not know himself only professionally she replied with a tight smile leaning back in her chair away from genevieve and the quick perception in her face her mind was filled suddenly with the memory of those few moments in the closed room in edinburgh of the feel of his arms around her and that one passionate sublime kiss i have seen him work in other cases she hurried on knowing her face was hot could genevieve see how she was lying she thought so do cling onto hope she was talking too much trying to turn the subject at least it seems he has learned the truth he will find a way to prove it sufficient for the authorities to she stopped genevieve was smiling she said nothing but her silence was eloquent and full of pleasure hester felt trapped not by genevieve but by herself you came from limehouse didnt you she said quietly as a matter of confidence not accusation half of her knew it was an attack to defend herself genevieve flushed but her eyes did not evade hesters nor was there anger in them yes it seems like another life now it was so different and so many years ago she moved a little and the lamp light changed on the planes of her face throwing the strength into relief but i wont let anything drive me back my children will not grow up there and i wont have lord ravensbrook feed them and clothe them and dictate what manner of people they shall be i wont let him hug them to fill anguss place would he do that hester said slowly picturing ravensbrooks dark patrician face in her mind with its arrogance and charm i dont know genevieve confessed but im afraid of it i feel terribly alone without angus you see he understood me he knew where i came from and he didnt mind my occasional mistakes a whole vision of fear and humiliation opened up in front of hester with a breathtaking vividness she perceived what it would be like for genevieve at ravensbrook house night and day watched at every meal observed and quite soon criticized not only would ravensbrook himself notice all the tiny errors in even the most carefully produced etiquette or grammar but perhaps even worse so would the staff the careful butler the supercilious housekeeper the giggling maids only possibly enid would not care of course she said with intense feeling you must keep your own home mr she was interrupted by a brisk knock at the door and the housekeeper walking in her face grim the keys at her belt jangling there is a person to see you miss latterly she announced you had better use the butlers pantry mr dolman says as he doesnt mind begging your pardon mrs stonefield what kind of a person hester asked the housekeepers face did not change in the slightest not a flicker of her expression moved a male person miss latterly more than that you will have to find out for yourself please be advised we do not allow the female staff to have followers and that also applies to you while you are resident here whatever your purpose hester was stunned but genevieve felt no such restrictions miss latterly is not a servant mrs gibbons she said smartly she is a professional person who has given her time freely out of regard for lady ravensbrook who might well have died if it had not been for her treatment if you can call nursing a profession mrs gibbons retorted with a sniff and it is the good lord who heals the sick not any of us mrs stonefield as a christian woman im sure you know that thoughts flashed across hesters mind about the virtues of christian women beginning with charity but this was not the time to enter into an argument she could not win thank you for bringing me the message mrs gibbons she said baring her teeth in a gesture that bore little resemblance to a smile how kind of you and with a nod to genevieve she rose to her feet and left the room the butlers pantry was two doors along the passage and she went in without knocking she was startled to see monk standing there looking almost haggard his face was pale and there were lines of strain unlike anything she had seen in him since the grey case what is it she asked closing the door behind her her stomach sinking with dread it cant be stonefield can it it its not callandra pain almost dizzied her has something happened to callandra no his voice was strident he controlled it with an effort no he repeated more calmly his face was full of emotion and he was obviously finding it extremely difficult to frame the words to tell her she forced back her impatience she had seen both shock and fear before and she knew the signs to have affected monk this way it must be something very dreadful indeed sit down and tell me she said gently what has happened temper flared in his eyes then died away replaced by the fear again the very fact that he did not retaliate chilled her even more she sat down on the drab overstuffed chair and folded her hands in her lap under her apron where he could not see that they were clenched together i have been accused of assault he said the words between his teeth not looking at her and are you guilty she asked levelly knowing his rage and his physical strength she had not forgotten the body in mecklenburg square beaten to death and that monk had once feared he had done it himself his eyes widened glaring at her his features twisted with outrage no he shouted god in heaven no how can you even ask the words choked him he looked as if he could never forgive her for the question he was shaking with fury his body so tensed he was even now at the edge of violence simply to release what was becoming unbearable because i know you she answered feeling increasingly that perhaps she did not if someone angered you enough you might a woman the cry strangled in his throat assault a woman force myself on her she was stunned it was so absurd it was almost funny except that he was obviously serious and profoundly frightened such a charge would ruin him she knew that only too well her own professional existence also rested on reputation and she knew how nearly she had once lost that it had been monk who had fought for her worked night and day to prove her innocence thats ridiculous she said gravely obviously she cannot prove it to be so but equally obviously you cannot prove it not to be or you would not be here who is she and what happened is she someone you rejected or has she some other reason for such a charge do you suppose she is with child and needs to blame someone for it to claim her own innocence in the matter i dont know at last he sat down as well staring at the patched carpet on the floor i dont know why she has done it except that it was deliberate we were in a hansom going home after an eveninghe hesitated still looking down an evening of mild entertainment a pleasant din ner she suddenly tore open the bodice of her dress then glared at me with the most violent hatred screamed and threw herself out of the carriage with it under way in front of a score of guests leaving a party in north audley street she felt a chill of fear touch her also such behavior held an element of madness the woman had risked not only monks reputation but a good deal of her own as well however innocent she claimed to be there would be talk speculation tongues willing to be unkind who is she she asked again drusilla wyndham he said very quietly still not looking at her she said nothing a curious mix of emotions filled her mind relief that after all he could not now love drusilla that drusilla had failed him in every way and her own hatred of drusilla of a quite different nature from before because now the woman threatened him there was also fear for the injury drusilla would do him and anger for the injustice of it she did not even think of curiosity as to why who is she she asked i mean socially where does she come from he looked up at her meeting her eyes for the first time i dont know more than i could judge from her manner and her speech which was enough but what does it matter whoever she is she can ruin me by the suggestion she doesnt have to be related to anyone important his voice rose again with impatience that she did not understand the point any woman making the charge except perhaps a servant or a prostitute i know that she cut across him just as sharply jerking her hand to dismiss the notion im not thinking of that im thinking how to fight her know your enemy i cant fight her his voice rose in fury and desperation if she takes it to court i can deny it but not if she simply does it by whisper and innuendo what do you suggest that i sue her for slander dont be absurd even if i could which i couldnt my reputation would still be ruined in fact the very act of calling her a liar would make it worse he looked like a man on the edge of an abyss staring destruction in the face of course not she said quietly whos your adviser lord cardigan what in the hell are you talking about the charge of the light brigade she answered bitterly she saw a glimmer of comprehension in his face so what do you suggest he said but without hope im not sure she replied rising to her feet and walking to the one small window but certainly not a headon charge at the enemys guns if they are dug into the high ground with breached cannons pointing at us then we must either move them out of it or come at them by some other means stop playing soldiers he said quietly just because you nursed in the crimea doesnt mean you know the first damn thing about warfare yes it does she said swinging around the first damn thing about warfare is that soldiers get killed ask anyone whos been there except the bloody incompetent generals of course he smiled in spite of himself but there was only the humor of the grave in it what a charming woman you are what do you suggest in this particular battle shall i shoot her besiege her poison her water or wait for the winter to freeze her out or hope that she contracts the typhoid call on another woman she answered wishing the moment she had said it that she had not she had no plans no ideas only a boiling determination to win he looked nonplussed another woman whatever for who me of course you fool she retorted you havent the slightest understanding of women or how they think you never have had obviously she hates you how did you meet her i bumped into her on the steps of the geographical society or perhaps she bumped into me you think she contrived it she said without great surprise women did such things far more often than most men realized i do now i didnt then a bitter amusement lit his eyes for a moment she must have been surprised when i did not recognize her she held me in conversation for several minutes she must have been waiting for me to remember and then realized that i didnt you dont remember anything at all she pressed not even an impression no of course i dont or i would have said so i have been through everything i can think of but i cant remember anything about her its a complete blank she had a glimpse of his utter helplessness the shadows and glimpses of cruelty within his memory and the fears that would always be part of him then it evaporated all she felt was tenderness and the determination to protect him whatever the cost it doesnt matter anyway she said moving over and touching his head gently just her fingers on his hair for a moment it is who she is now that matters ill think of a way to fight back dont worry just dont go anywhere near her again keep on looking for angus stonefield at least im not likely to run into any outraged high society face down in the mud round the isle of dogs he said savagely a little rape might add to my credibility with the locals i would mention it only if you intend to remain there she replied tartly turning to the door in the meantime keep your powder dry he saluted sarcastically yes general sir but when he left ravensbrook house monk did feel marginally better the anger was scalding inside him and the fear was just as real nothing had changed yet now he no longer stood alone that took the despair away the very worst of the pain he strode along the footpath ignoring those he passed by all but bumping into them even the smutladen rain driving in his face was hardly heeded he would find where caleb had murdered his brother he might not find the body but he would prove his death and he would see caleb hanged for it somewhere there was a piece of evidence a witness a chain of events which would damn him it was up to monk to persist until he did wherever it was whoever knew it whatever it took to uncover it it was midday by the time he got to the isle of dogs and went again to the house in manilla street to speak to selina at first she refused to see him she looked frightened and he guessed it was not long since caleb had been there her silence was a mixture of loyalty and fear the fear at least was probably well grounded he stood in front of her in the small cold wellkept room he killed angus and im going to prove it he said viciously one way or another ill see him swing for it whether you prove it with me or swing with him is up to you she said nothing she faced him defiantly her head held cockily as if she were sure of herself one hip jutting out but he saw her knuckles whiten and heard the terror beneath her voice you think hes a dangerous swine he said grimly cross me and youll think hes a model of the civilized man its his life she retorted with contempt looking him up and down seeing the beautifully cut coat and the polished boots you dont even know what dangerous is believe me i have little left to lose either he said passionately she stared at him looked into his eyes and slowly her face changed she saw something of the rage and despair in him and the contempt died i dont know where he is she said quietly i didnt expect you to i want to know where he met angus every place you know of that they went together or might have gone he murdered angus somebody somewhere knows about it they wont tell you her chin lifted again in defiance and a kind of pride yes they will he laughed bitterly whatever caleb can do to them the long wait of the last night the eight oclock walk in the morning to the hangmans rope is worse she swore at him and the hatred in her eyes reminded him of drusilla it robbed him of the pity he might have felt for her where did they meet he said again silence have you seen a corpse after its been hanged he looked at her slender throat at the artichoke along by the blackwall stairs but it wont do yer no good they wont tell yer nothin i ope yer rot in ell i ope they drown yer in a cesspool and feed yer body ter the rats is that what he did with angus gawd i dunno but beneath the paint her face was white and there was horror in her eyes nah gits aht monk went back along manilla street in the rain and turned east the landlord of the artichoke served him a slice of eel pie and a glass of ale but eyed him with suspicion men dressed as monk presently was did not frequent such taverns but money was money and he took it readily enough after monk had eaten he began his questions civilly at first but quickly gaining an undertone of menace he learned only one piece of information which if true might prove of worth and that was given as an incidental to an insult but that had many times been the way an angry man betrayed more than he knew the landlord let slip that caleb had several friends whether by choice or mutual advantage and one of them another dangerous and greedy man had a yard off coldharbour hard by the cattle wharf apparently he was a good friend one whom caleb could trust and who would according to the landlord avenge any wrong done caleb by the likes of monk fifteen minutes later found monk west again at coldharbour right on the bank of the river it was now running hard and gray carrying ships barges and all manner of detritus on the outgoing tide a dead rat floated by and half a dozen rotted timbers the smell of sewage clogged the nostrils a clipper halfrigged was making its way majestically down from the pool of london towards the open sea and the world beyond it was not hard to find the yard but it served only as a starting point if caleb had intended from the beginning to murder his brother he would have chosen a private place to do it he would certainly not have risked a witness there were far too many people up and down the river who would be only too happy to have the power to ruin caleb stone and if the act had arisen out of a quarrel which got out of control then he would equally have needed somewhere out of sight to think what to do with the body simply to tip it into the river was too much of a risk especially if it had been daylight it would have to be weighted and set in nudstream better still to take it to limehouse and bury it as a typhoid victim and all that took time there would be little purpose in being direct he yanked the collar of his coat even higher and strode past the yard he found all manner of laborers derelicts the hungry cold idle or sick huddled in doorways sheltering under sacking or canvas he questioned them all he walked from one end of coldharbour to the other and then across the bridge over the blackwall basin towards the stairs to the sibilant water he moved downriver slowly picking his way over slippery stones and wet timbers across patches of rotting shingle through loading and unloading yards he passed piles of merchandise hauls of fish lengths of rope and canvas he climbed up and down steps and across gangways over dark still water into a dozen larger or smaller slipways and docks always the stench was there the sound of dripping and slurping the creak of timber and straining ropes by dusk he was exhausted angry and cold to the bone but he refused to give up somewhere near here caleb had killed angus someone had seen or heard them quarreling shouting voices a cry of fury or pain and then caleb carrying the body perhaps there had been blood or a weapon they were the same size the same build if it had come to a battle they must have been fairly evenly matched even allowing for their different lives what angus lacked in physical exercise and the practice of fighting perhaps he would at least partially compensate for with better nourishment and health monk ate supper in a different tavern and set out into the dark the rain had stopped and it was even colder a mist was rising off the river hanging in thin wreaths across the streets and dimming the few lights the foghorns of barges drifted across the water disembodied and mournful on the corner of robinhood lane and the east india dock road two men were warming themselves by a brazier of roasting chestnuts monk was drawn towards it because it was a refuge from the biting cold it was human company and a light in the enveloping darkness the endless sound of the creeping tide and the fine beads of moisture that gathered on everything and fell with myriad tiny sounds as if the night were alive as he drew closer he saw that one of the men was wearing an old seamans jacket too narrow across the shoulders for him but at least waterproof the other had on what at a glance he would have taken to be a tailored wool coat had such a thing not been absurd in this place and as his eyes followed the line of it down the mans body he saw that it hung loosely even shapelessly when he moved his arm to poke the brazier it was obvious the coat was so badly torn it was open at the sides and there was a patch beneath one shoulder much darker it was probably wet poor devil monk was cold enough in his fine broadcloth overcoat twopence for some chestnuts he offered bluntly he did not want to stand out as too obviously a stranger the man in the coat held out his hand wordlessly monk put twopence in it the man picked out a dozen chestnuts expertly and left them in the ashes at the side to cool his coat was of beautiful cut the lapels set perfectly the rim of the collar had been stitched by a tailor who knew his job and monk was a connoisseur of such things the coat had been made for a man of monks height and breadth of shoulder angus stonefield he looked down at the mans trousers in the light of the braziers glow it was hard to see but he judged they matched a wild idea came into his mind it was a desperate throw ill swap clothes with you for a guinea what the man stared at him as if he could not believe what he had heard on the face of it it was ridiculous monk had not changed since he left ravensbrook house his coat had cost him several pounds he could not afford to replace it but then if drusilla went ahead with her intentions he could end up no better off than this wretched man anyway at least he would have the satisfaction of having caught caleb stone first that would be one case of justice served my coat for your jacket and trousers he repeated the man weighed up his chances an yer at he bargained the coat or nothing monk snapped whatll i do wi no trouser the man demanded int decent my jacket and trousers for yours and ill keep the coat monk offered and the hat it was a better deal anyway he had other suits les see the man was not going to take goods blindly monk opened his coat so the man could judge his suit done he said instantly yer daft yer are but a deals a deal solemnly in the fogshrouded darkness beside the brazier they exchanged clothes monk holding very firmly to his coat just in case the man had any ideas of theft daft the man repeated again as he pulled monks warm jacket around him it was too big but it was a great deal better than the ripped one he had parted with monk replaced his coat nodded to the other man who had watched the whole procedure with incredulity as if it had been some kind of drunken illusion then he turned and walked away back along the east india dock road to somewhere where he could find a hansom and go home monk woke the following morning with his head reeling and his body feeling stiff and chilled but also with a sense of anticipation as if some long sought success had finally been achieved then as he got out of bed and sneezed he remembered drusilla and the joy drained out of him as if he had slit a vein he washed shaved and dressed before bothering to look at the clothes he had acquired the previous night his landlady brought breakfast and he ate it without tasting it five minutes afterwards he could not even remember what it had been finally he picked up the clothes jacket first and examined it in the cold daylight near the window it was made of a fine woolen cloth with a distinctive weave beautifully cut in a conservative manner with no concessions to fashion simply quality the tailors name was stitched in the seam more importantly as evidence the sides were ripped as if someone had slashed it with a knife there was a bloodstain about four inches across and some ten inches down on the left shoulder roughly over where a mans heart would be except it was at the back there was also a small tear in the right elbow no more than an inch long and a scraping on the right forearm where several threads had been caught and pulled whoever had been wearing it had been involved in a serious fight possibly even a fatal one and as he had observed the night before the trousers matched the jacket one knee was torn out threads were pulled on both legs and there were stains of mud the waist at the back was heavily soaked in blood he had only one choice he must show them to genevieve stonefield without her identification of them they were useless as evidence the thought of subjecting her to such an ordeal was repellant but there was no alter native he could not protect her from it and if anyone found the body he would not be able to protect her from that either no one should face such an ordeal alone there should be someone to offer her support at least to care for her physically there could be no comfort that would temper the cruelty of the truth but who hester was too busy with the typhoid outbreak similarly callandra enid ravensbrook was still far too ill lord ravensbrook she did not care for or perhaps she was simply afraid of him arbuthnot was an employee and one whom she would in due course have to instruct in what remained of the business there was only titus niven monk had suspected ill of him at one time but he knew nothing to his discredit the man was gentle discreet and too familiar with pain himself to treat it unkindly titus niven it must be and if he were party to anguss death then the fine irony of this was only one more element to compound the tragedy monk wrapped the clothes in a bundle put them in a softsided traveling bag and set out niven was at home and received him with courtesy but did not conceal his surprise he was dressed in the same elegantly cut but slightly shabby clothes and there was no fire in the grate the room was bitterly cold he looked embarrassed but did not apologize for the temperature he offered hot coffee which monk knew he could ill affordeither the coffee itself or the gas to heat it thank you but i have only lately finished breakfast monk declined besides i have come on some business which would rob the pleasure of any refreshment at all i would be most obliged if you could help me to break it to mrs stonefield with as much gentleness as possible and to be with her to offer any comfort you may nivens face paled you have found anguss body no but i have found what i think may well be his clothes i need her to identify them is that necessary nivens voice was choked in his throat and his eyes pleaded with monk i wouldnt ask it if it were not monk said gently i think they are his but i cannot pursue the matter with the police until i am certain beyond doubt she is the only one whose word they would accept the valet niven asked thinly then bit his lip perhaps he already knew genevieve had dismissed all the servants but the childrens nurse and the housemaid so sure was she in her heart that angus would never return yes yes i suppose you are right he agreed do you wish me to come with you now if you please she should not be told when she is alone may i see them i knew angus well unless they are very new i may be familiar with them i do at least know his taste and style and the name of his tailor monk asked yes mr wicklow of wicklow and harper it was the name in the suit monk had worn back from the east india dock road a dead mans clothes he nodded tightening his lips and unrolled the package out of his bag nivens face was ashen he saw the blood the stains of mud and water and the torn and slashed fabric he swallowed with a convulsive movement of his throat and nodded his head he looked up at monk his blue eyes steady and filled with horror ill get my coat and he turned away monk noticed that his hands were shaking very slightly and his shoulders were rigidly straight as if he were making a deliberate effort to control himself and stand almost at attention they took a hansom and rode in silence there was nothing to say and neither of them made the pretense of conversation monk found himself hoping so profoundly that it was almost a prayer that niven had had no part in anguss death the more he saw of the man the more he both liked and admired him they alighted at genevieves home but told the cab to wait she might be at ravensbrook house and they might need to follow her there and very possibly bring her home immediately however that proved not to be necessary the housemaid who answered the door informed them that mrs stonefield was at home and when she recognized niven she had no hesitation in letting them in monk paid the cab and dismissed it following niven within moments what is it mr monk genevieve asked immediately dismissing the nursemaid and sending the two children with her one look at nivens face had told her the news was extremely serious youve found angus no he would tell her as quickly as possible drawing it out only added another dimension to the suffering i have found some clothes which i believe may be his if they are and you have no doubt it may be sufficient to cause the police to act i see imvcuralyhistner þ allnw me to her voice was ay u see them niven moved closer to her even at this anguished time monk noticed that he was not embarrassed he had no selfconsciousness perhaps it was because his thoughts were entirely upon her that he spared no part of his mind for himself it was curiously comforting a moments warmth in the icy cold monk opened his bag and took out the jacket there was no need for her to see the trousers as well and the blood soaking them he unrolled it and held it up he kept the shoulder towards himself away from her showing her only the inside and the tailors mark she drew in her breath sharply and her hands flew to her mouth is it his monk asked although he knew the answer she was incapable of speech but she nodded her head her eyes filled with tears she struggled against them and failed without a word niven put his arms around her and she turned and buried her head in his shoulder there was nothing for monk to say or do he repacked the jacket closed the bag and left without saying anything further not troubling the maid to open or close the door for him this time the police did not argue the sergeant regarded the jacket and trousers with a kind of vicious satisfaction a slow smile spreading across his thin features got im he said quietly he regarded the bloodstain on the jacket with a shake of his head poor sod he pushed them to one side of the desk and turned his head robinson he shouted robinson come ere were goin to get a party together an go after caleb stone i want alf a dozen men wot knows the river quick on their feet an ready for a fight got that from somewhere out of sight there was an answer in the affirmative the sergeant looked back at monk im obliged he said with a nod well get im this time cant say as well make it stick but well scare the ell out of im im coming with you monk stated the sergeant sucked in his breath then changed his mind perhaps an extra man would be useful especially one with such a marked interest in success and also perhaps monk deserved it right yare then he agreed well be off inhe consulted his pocket watch a handsome silver piece of considerable sizefifteen minutes half an hour later monk was walking down wharf road beside a constable benyon a lean young man with an eager face and a long straight nose the wind smelling of smoke damp and sewage blew in their faces they had be gun on the east side of the isle of dogs where the greenwich reach moves towards the blackwall reach with instructions to follow the river downstream on the north shore two others were taking limehouse two more greenwich and the south shore the sergeant himself was coordinating their efforts from a hansom moving from east to west a further constable was detailed to cross the river and meet the team from greenwich at the crown and sceptre tavern at two oclock unless they were hot on the trail in which case a message would be left reckon ell be downriver meself benyon said thoughtfully more like blackwall or the east india docks else ell be on tother side id a taken ter the marshes if id a bin im he doesnt think we can touch him monk replied hunching his shoulders against the chill coming up off the water told me himself wed never find the body mebbe we wont need one benyon said willing himself to believe it they turned off barque street onto manchester road passing a group of dockers going down towards the ferry on the corner a onelegged sailor was selling matches a running patterer jogged towards ship street corner turned and disappeared wastin our time ere benyon pulled a face ill ask at the cubitt town pier thats about the best place ter start they walked in silence past the rice mill and the seysall asphalt company and made an acute right down to the pier the cry of the gulls above the water came clearly over the rattle of wheels and the shouts of dockers handling bales of goods bargees calling to one another and the endless hiss and slap of the tide monk hung back not to intrude into benyons questioning this was his area and he knew the people and what to say what to avoid benyon came back after several minutes not bin ere terday he said as if it proved his point monk was not surprised he nodded and together they proceeded along manchester road past the millwall wharf plough wharf as far as davis street then turned right and then left into samuda street they stopped for a pint of ale at the folly tavern and there at last heard news of caleb stone no one admitted to having seen him at any specific time lately but one little rat of a man with a long nose and a walleye followed them out and discreetly at a price told benyon that caleb had a friend in a tenement house on quixley street off the east india dock wall road about three quarters of a mile away benyon passed over half a crown and the man almost immediately disappeared across the alley and into the samuda yard with its piles of timber is that worth anything monk asked dubiously oh yeah benyon replied with conviction sammy as one or two ostages ter fortune e wont lie ter me wed better find the sergeant thisll need at least alf a dozen of us if youd seen quixley street yerd not doubt that it took them over an hour and a half to find the pair from limehouse and for all five of them including the sergeant to get to quixley street which was a narrow throughway hardly a hundred yards long backing into the great northern railway goods depot just short of the first east india dock two men were sent to harrap street at the back and benyon to scamber street at the side the sergeant took monk in at the front it was a large building four stories high with narrow dirty windows several of them cracked or broken the dark brick was stained with damp and soot but only one of the tall chimney stacks smoked dribbling a fine grayblack trail into the cold air monk felt a shiver of excitement in spite of the filth and misery of the place if caleb stone really was here within a matter of minutes they would have him he wanted to see him facetoface to watch those extraordinary green eyes when he knew he was beaten there was a man lying in the doorway either drunk or asleep his face had several days growth of beard on it and he breathed with difficulty the sergeant stepped over him and monk followed behind inside the air smelled of mold and unemptied slops the sergeant pushed open the door of the first room inside three women sat unraveling ropes their fingers were callused and swollen some red with sores half a dozen children in various stages of undress played on the floor a girl of about five was unpicking the stitching on a length of cloth which presumably had been a garment a short while ago the window was boarded up one candle relieved the shadows it was bitterly cold obviously caleb stone was not here the next room was similarly occupied monk glanced at the sergeant but the grim look on his face silenced his doubts the third and fourth rooms were no more help they climbed the rickety stairs testing each stone before allowing their full weight on it the steps rocked alarmingly and the sergeant swore under his breath the first room on the next floor held two men both in drunken sleep but neither was caleb stone the second room was occupied by a prostitute and a bargee who hurled lurid abuse at them as they withdrew an old man lay dying in the third a woman keening gently beside him rocking back and forth the third floor up was crammed with women sewing shirts their heads bent eyes straining to see fingers flying with needle thread weaving in and out a man with pincenez glasses balanced on his nose glared at the sergeant and hissed his irritation wagging his finger like a schoolmis tress monk longed to hit him for his meticulous cruelty but he knew it would have done no good one piece of paltry violence would not relieve anyones poverty and he was after caleb stone not one wretched sweatshop profiteer the first room on the top floor up was occupied by a onearmed man carefully measuring powder into a scale in the next room three men played cards one of them had thin gray hair and a stomach which bulged out over his trousers the second was bald and had a red mustache the third was caleb stone they looked up as the sergeant opened the door for a moment there was silence prickling cold the fat man belched the sergeant took a step forward and in that instant caleb stone saw monk behind him perhaps it was some look of victory in monks face maybe he recognized the sergeant he climbed to his feet and lunged towards the win dow throwing himself out of it with a shattering of glass the fat man rolled over onto all fours and charged at monk monk raised his knee and caught him in the jaw sending him reeling backwards spitting blood the other man was locked in a struggle with the sergeant swinging backwards and forwards together like a parody of a dance monk ran over to the window and smashed the rest of the glass out of the frame then leaned out half expecting to see the figure of caleb broken on the pavement four stories below but he had forgotten the twists and turns of the stairs they were facing the back of the building and beneath him was the roof of a high wooden shed not more than twelve feet away caleb was running across it agile as an animal making for the opposite side and a halfopen window monk scrambled over the sill and leaped landing with a jar that shocked his bones within a moment he was on his feet and racing after caleb the shed roof rattling under his weight caleb swung around once his wide mouth grinning then he jumped for the window and disappeared inside monk went in after him finding himself in another cold suffocating room just like those he had left three old men sat with bottles in their hands around a potbellied stove smelling of soot caleb flung the door open and charged across the landing and monk heard his footsteps hard on the stairs he dived after him tripped on the fourth or fifth step which was broken and fell the remaining half dozen landing bruisingly and only just missing cracking his head on the newel post he heard calebs laughter as he clattered on down a floor below him monk clambered to his feet furious with pain and frustration and went down the rest of the stairs as fast as he could he was just in time to see calebs back as he went out the door into prestage street and turned towards brunswick street which ran all the way down to the river ashtons wharf and the blackwall stairs where the devil were the other constables monk yelled as loudly as his lungs would bear benyon brunswick street his elbow and shoulder were sore where he had hit them on the wall as he fell and one ankle throbbed but he charged along the footpath barging into an old woman with a bag of clothes who was determined not to step aside for him he knocked her against the wall unintentionally having been sure she would move her body felt heavy and soft like a sack of porridge she swore at him with a string of oaths he would have expected from a bargee caleb had vanished monk got into his stride again someone else was running along harrap street coattails billowing it must be one of the constables he swung around the corner and saw caleb running easily almost dancing as he turned around and waved his face laughing then scampered on towards the river monk extended his pace his lungs gasping his blood pounding it had been too long since he had been obliged to chase a man on foot this was a hard way to discover it the constable caught up with him and forged ahead caleb was still twenty yards beyond them and running easily every now and then leaping as if in mockery they had passed the turning to leicester street and were approaching norfolk street where was caleb making for caleb passed the corner of russell street and there was nothing ahead of him but the dock and the stairs a wild thought crossed monks mind that he was going to jump into the river suicide many a man would think it better than the hangmans rope monk would himself then he would make for the wharf not the stairs it was already midafternoon and the light was failing a grayness crept up from the river and robbed everything of what little color there was the mist deadened calebs flying footsteps as he raced across the stones to the edge of the water and the flight of steps downward the constable was only a couple of yards behind him monks breath labored in his lungs but his ankle was easing caleb disappeared down the stairs and the constable after him then there was a yell and a heavy splash then a scream of fear choked off almost instantly monk reached the edge of the wall just as a second constable came behind him caleb was on the steps feet wide apart balanced laughing his head thrown back the constable was thrashing around in the water sinking dragged down by his boots and his heavy clothing hell drown caleb shouted looking at monk youd better pull him out you cant leave him mr righteous there was a barge about ten yards out the first of a string moving slowly upriver with the incoming tide low in the water heavy with bales covered over with dark canvas the bargee in the stern looked at the man in the water and threw his hands wide he could not stop the impetus of his vessel there were another dozen behind him like railway carriages monk hesitated only a moment the constable was drowning his face was white with terror he had not the faintest idea how to swim and his own panic was killing him there was a piece of timber lying on the edge monk threw it in and waited long enough to see it float the instant was enough caleb charged up the steps again thrusting past him and onto the river wall racing upstream towards the artichoke tavern fifty yards away the second constable arrived swerving to go after caleb and leave monk to rescue the man in the water get him monk shouted jabbing his arm down the steps towards the water and spun on his heel to run after caleb the constable gasped saw his colleague struggling clasping for the wood and swung around plunging down the steps after him monk sprinted along the hard pavement behind caleb who seemed to be veering away from the edge as if he would go around to the front of the tavern and the door why had he friends there reinforcements he could hardly hope to hold off half a dozen police there was no escape through the backit fell sheer into the rising tide monk was only fifteen yards behind him then suddenly caleb swerved again turned on his foot and picked up speed running straight towards the river he was going to kill himself after all he ran even faster and at the dock made an almighty leap only then did monk realize what he meant to do the barge was only twenty feet from the shore he landed awkwardly sprawled across the canvas and all but pitched off the far side but he was on it and already it was carrying him away with more rage than judgment monk backed off to give himself a launching distance then in desperation leaped as well he landed with a numbing crash on the third barge the breath was knocked out of him and it was several seconds before he could even think to rise when he did his hands were grazed and he found it hard to expand his lungs and gasp in the damp darkening air he could see the dim shape of the bargee but he was barely aware of the sergeant on the river wall shouting and gesticulating he was swearing wildly his face contorted with fury certainly he did not even try to understand what he was saying there was only one thought in his mindget caleb he straightened up and started to make his way forward moving with his arms wide keeping his foothold on the wet canvas with difficulty the barges were close but there were still several feet of dark filthy river water between the bow of one and the stern of another if he fell he would be between the two and would be crushed long before he could be drowned caleb was on the lead barge facing him leaping up and down on the spot in mockery he put his hands to his mouth to cup the sound come on he yelled come and get me come on mr policeman i killed angus didnt i i destroyed him hes gone forever finished no more smart clothes no more virtuous wife by the fireside no more church on sunday and yes sir no sir arent i a good boy sir he folded his anus across his chest flat hands down then flung them wide dead he cried gone forever youll never find him nobodyll find him ever ever monk started off towards him floundering on the canvas piles stumbling and regaining his balance taking a wild leap across the dark water to the barge ahead landing splayed and bruised on his hands and knees he scrambled forward again oblivious of pain or danger the bargee was yelling something but he ignored it they had passed the blackwall entrance to the south dock ahead of them was the cubitt town pier then the curve of the river around the isle of dogs he could no longer see the lights of greenwich on the far side the fog and darkness were closing in the marshes to the left were a dim outline there were other boats but he saw them only from the corner of his eye he leaped to the front barge just in time to see caleb apparently overbalance land on his knees then disappear over the side then he heard his laughter coming up from the water and just as he reached the edge himself a rowing boat pulled away one man heaving on the oars another crouching in the stern seemingly terrified monk swore savagely he swung around to the bargee although even as he did he knew it was pointless the man had no way on earth of changing course the heavily laden barges were tied together and going upstream on the tide monk where was the voice coming from monk jump man then he saw the second rowing boat with the sergeant and another constable in it without a seconds hesitation he jumped landing in it and sending it rocking so violently it all but overturned the constable at the oars let out an oath the sergeant grabbed him roughly and forced him down on the duckboards at the bottom and the boat righted itself and plowed forward again after im the sergeant shouted unnecessarily they sat in silence monk still half crouched the constable at the oars dug them into the water with all the strength he possessed hurling his weight against them so violently that for several strokes the boat veered and bounced then he settled down to an even pace and picked up speed there was hardly any light now the late afternoon had drawn in and the overcast sky had robbed what little there was and the rising river mist distorted shapes foghorns sounded eerily the lights of a clipper appeared shadowed spars towering above them drifting like giant trees in the sky they rocked roughly in its wake where is the bastard the sergeant said between his teeth peering forward through the gloom ill get that swine if its the last thing i do bugsbys marshes monk answered straightening his legs to sit up properly ill wager hes going downriver again why hell know we have men in greenwich and people who would say where he went but he knows the marshes and we dont well never get him once hes ashore there in the dark the sergeant swore the constable pulled harder on the oars his back straining hands rubbed to blisters the boat sped over the misty darkrunning tide the shore loomed up before they were prepared there were no lights only the mud banks catching the last of the daylight in thin shining strips and the soft seeping sound of the rising water in the marsh reeds monk scrambled forward and jumped out into mud up to his calves it took a surprising effort to pull himself loose from its icecold sucking grip but twenty yards downstream he could see another figure on a firmer stretch and the black shape of a boat pulling away as if it had landed the devil himself and would flee for salvation the constable was out behind him cursing at the mud together they squelched and struggled over the slime onto firmer shore floundering towards caleb who was already trying to run no one shouted again they all three plunged wildly through the deepening mist as the rising wind blew wraiths of it around them then away again the sergeant brought up the rear dogged and determined swinging inland a little driving caleb towards the point cutting off his retreat back towards greenwich it was another fifteen minutes of exhausting heartpounding legaching pursuit before at last they cornered caleb with his back to the river and nowhere else to turn he held his gloved hands up open wide they could no longer see his face but monk could imagine his expression from his voice in the darkness all right take me he yelled take me to your petty little courtroom and your charade of a trial what will you convict me of theres no corpse no corpse and he threw his head back and roared with laughter the sound of it echoed across the dark water and was swallowed in the mist youll never find a corpseyou fools chapter the sergeant never for a moment hesitated about charging caleb with the murder of angus stonefield however when the crown prosecutor came to consider the case it was a different matter he debated the evidence be fore him and in the middle of the day sent for oliver rathbone well he demanded when rathbone had reviewed what they knew and heard the tale of calebs arrest is there any point in bringing him to trial in fact have we sufficient evidence even to proceed with a charge rathbone thought about it for some time before replying it was a rare bright winter day and the sun shone in through the long windows i have some knowledge of the case he said thoughtfully sitting with his elegant legs crossed his fingertips placed together monk consulted me some time ago about the evidence necessary to presume death he was acting for mrs stonefield the prosecutors eyebrows rose interesting he murmured not really rathbone answered poor woman was convinced in her own mind of what had happened and understandably wished to be in a position to appoint someone to continue the business before it was too severely dam aged by stonefields absence so what do you know that might assist this case the prosecutor leaned back in his chair and regarded rathbone steadily im inclined to believe stone did kill his brother i should very much like to see him answer for it but im damned if ill send to trial a case we cannot win and which will leave the wretched man vindicated as well as making us a laughingstock oh indeed rathbone agreed heartily it would be sickening to have him acquitted for lack of evidence and the moment after have the corpse turn up with proof of his guilt and not be able to do a damned thing about it thats the trouble we have only the one shot it must hit the mark there is no second chance considering that as children both men were wards of lord ravensbrook it may well be a case which attracts some attention the prosecutor went on in spite of stones present highly disreputable way of life it will be interesting to see who defends him he sighed if there is a need for defense the wretched man has admitted killing his brother rathbone said grimly boasted of it in fact it will still be very tight we have no corpse no absolute evidence of death but a great deal of circumstantial evidence rathbone argued leaning forward they were seen together the day stonefield disappeared even seen quarreling stonefields torn and bloodstained clothing has been found and no one has seen him since the prosecutor shook his head still possible hes alive somewhere where rathbone demanded jumped a ship and sailed to china or the indies or america but from a pool of london quay downriver at what time rathbone argued for america it would more likely be liverpool or southampton come to that what time was it he was last seen was the tide going out or coming in couldnt jump a ship on the incoming tide unless he ended up in london again and why would he do that he had nothing to gain and everything to lose he sat back in his chair again no youd never persuade a jury he simply took flight from what he had no debts no enemies no incipient scandal no hes dead poor devil probably buried in one of the common graves of the limehouse typhoid victims then prove it the prosecutor said grimly if his lawyer is worth his pay youll have a very hard job rathbone a very hard job indeed but i wish you luck when rathbone returned to vere street he found monk waiting for him monk looked appalling his clothes were as immaculate as always and he was freshly shaved but his face was haggard as if he were ill and had not slept when he stood up to follow rathbone into his office without per mission he moved as though his entire body ached from his appearance he might have been in the later stages of rheumatism rathbone had very ambivalent feelings about him but he would never have wished him ill a slight reduction in arrogance and selfconfidence perhaps but not this it disturbed him more than he was prepared for close the door he ordered unnecessarily monk was in the act of doing so and stood against it for a moment staring at rathbone as he went around the desk and sat behind it you got caleb stone i know ive just come from the crown prosecutors office it would help a great deal to have more evidence i know that monk said savagely moving away from the door and sitting painfully in the chair opposite the desk maybe the police will set up a proper search and find the body i imagine theyll go on dragging the river something i was hardly equipped to do although this much later theyd have to be lucky to find it they could always search the greenwich and bugsby marshes for someone of angus stonefields standing theyd think it worth it they might also think it worth it to get a conviction now that they have made an arrest rathbone said with a slight smile they have rather committed themselves they wont want to be obliged to let caleb stone free hed be insufferable hed be a hero to every villain from wapping to woolwich but you know that better than l what does he think the prosecutor rathbone raised his eyebrows a chance but hes not optimistic would you like a cup of tea you look he hesitated not sure how literal to be noyes monk shrugged tea wont help he made as if to stand up too restless to wait but then apparently found it painful and reclined back into his chair it was a rough chase rathbone said with a dry smile monk winced very rathbone rang his bell and when the clerk appeared he ordered tea i want it even if you dont now tell me why youve come it wasnt to know the crown prosecutors opinion of the case no monk agreed then remained silent for several seconds rathbone felt a chill inside for something to have affected monk this deeply it must be very ugly indeed he had another appointment in twenty minutes he could not afford delay and yet he knew impatience would be clumsy and he had no desire to add to the burden whatever it was perhaps monk sensed his urgency he looked up suddenly as if having reached a resolve his jaw was clenched and there was a muscle flicking in his temple his words came out in a tight level carefully controlled monotone as though he dared not allow any emotions through or it would all explode beyond his mastery i met a woman some time ago by chance on the steps of the geographical society in sackville street we became acquainted and i saw her several times after that she was charming intelligent full of wit and enthusiasm his voice was a flat concentrated monotone she expressed interest in the stonefield case because i was looking to find trace of angus stonefield the long and short of it is we spent an evening together walking around soho area looking for places where either angus or genevieve stonefield might have met a lover of course we didnt find anything i dont know if either of us expected to it was an evening of enjoyment away from the restrictions of society for her and from the misery of poverty and crime for me rathbone nodded but did not interrupt it sounded very natural he had no idea what was coming i took her home in a hansom monk stopped his face white rathbone said nothing to fill the silence monk took a deep breath and gritted his teeth we were passing along north audley street and were forced to slow because one of the large houses had been holding some social event and the guests were leaving suddenly she tore open the bodice of her gown stared at me with passionate hatred then shrieked and threw herself out of the moving hansom she landed sprawled in the street picked herself up and ran screaming that i had assaulted her it was preposterous but it was not a story utterly new to rathbone he had heard of hysterical women inviting advances and then suddenly and without the slightest warning that a man could see losing their heads and accusing assault usually the matter could be kept private with a little sensible discussion and the exchange of moneyor a promise of marriage money was preferableit was a far cheaper price in the long run but why would anyone do such a thing to monk she could hardly wish to marry him no society woman could marry a private agent of inquiry and he had no money although possibly she did not know that he dressed like a wealthy man monk had a letter in his hand he held it out rathbone took it and read it then folded it up and laid it on his desk that puts rather a different complexion on the subject he said slowly it would appear from this that it is revenge she wishes i assume you have no idea why or you would have mentioned it no ive racked my memory what there is of it a bitter mockery passed over his face theres nothing at all not a shred shes beautiful amusing a delight to be with and theres not even a ghost not a tiny thread of familiarity his voice rose sharp in desperation nothing rathbone caught a moment of the nightmare the bitter horror of living inside a man you did not know the one thing which in all eternity you could never escape was yourself quite suddenly and devastatingly he understood monk as he never had before but if he were to be of use he must quash emotion a man clouded by feelings was less able to think rationally or to perceive the truth then perhaps it was not she you wronged he said thoughtfully but someone she loved a woman will often feel more passionately and take far greater risks to protect a loved one than she will to save herself he saw the sudden light of hope in monks eyes but for gods sake who he demanded it could be anyone there was a light rap on the door and they both ignored it well i know of no one better able to investigate it than you rathbone pointed out and it matters monk he leaned forward his elbows on the desk between them dont delude yourself you can remain unharmed if she chooses to pursue this even if she proves nothing at all such a charge quite unsubstantiated would still be enough to ruin you if you were a gentleman in society with means and family reputation and she were a young woman seeking a husband then you might ride it out you could say she was hysterical a lightly balanced woman given to vapors or imaginings even that she had imagined your favor and taken your rejection hard but no one is going to believe that of a man in your position good god dont you think i know that monk said furiously if she were a young woman seeking a husband and i were likely material she wouldnt do it anyway think what it would do to her own reputation what gentleman will look at her now im not so damned ignorant i dont know what it will cost her nor is she thats what makes it so terrifying she hates me enough to destroy herself in order to destroy me then whatever you did to cause it is profound rathbone said it was not meant in cruelty but there was no time or space to deal in less than the truth and he was aware of his desk just beyond the door and his next ap pointment im not sure how much it may protect you to know he went on but if you do search i would begin by looking for someone who may have been unjustly convicted or a person hanged or jailed and perhaps died there dont begin with thefts or embezzlements or the victims of petty crime in other words start with the result of the investigation not the weight of the evidence or your own certainty that the prosecution was just will it help if i find it monk asked pinned between hope and bitterness rathbone toyed with a lie but only for an instant monk was not a man to give another an easy sop he did not deserve it himself possibly not he answered only if it comes to trial and you could prove she has a motive of revenge but if she has as much intelligence as you suggest i doubt shell seek a prosecution shed be unlikely in that event to get one certainly not a conviction unless she had an extraordi nary biased jury his face tightened and his eyes were steady she will do far more damage to you and leave you less chance of escape vindication or counterattack if she simply passes the word around she will not land you in prison that way but she will ruin your career you will be reduced to i know monk snapped rising to his feet abruptly and with a sharp intake of breath as his aching muscles and bruised body hurt him i shall have to scrape a living working for people in the fringes of trade or the under world looking for errant husbands collecting bad debts and chasing petty thieves he turned his back on rathbone and stared out of the window and i shall be lucky if they can afford to pay me enough for me to eat daily there will be no more cases of any interest to callandra daviot and she cant keep supporting me for nothing i dont need you to tell me that i shall have to move lodgings and when my clothes wear out i shall be reduced to secondhand i know all that rathbone longed to be able to say something anything of comfort but there was nothing and he was increasingly aware of the faint noises from the office and his next client waiting then for your own peace of mind at least you had better do all you can to discover who she is he said grimly and more importantly who she was and why she hates you so much she is prepared to do this thank you monk murmured as he went out closing the door behind him and all but bumping into the clerk hovering until he should leave and he might show in the gentleman waiting impatiently at his elbow of course rathbone was right he had not really needed anyone to tell him it was simply a release of the loneliness of it to hear the words from someone else and someone who for all their past differences at least believed his account and his advice regarding where to search was sound he walked along vere street deep in thought oblivious of other pedestrians or carriages passing him by there was only one course open to him and deeply as he loathed the prospect he dared not delay he must search his past records of cases and try to find the one in which drusilla had been involved albeit indirectly at least rathbones suggestions gave him somewhere to start it would be impossible to approach runcorn he would be only too delighted to add to monks predicament by denying him access he had no rights to police information anymore and runcorn would be legally justified in refusing him the irony of it would be the sweetest taste of victory for him at last after all the years that monk had trodden on his heels mocked him and bettered him in case after case and he would have to admit his amnesia he had never known for certain how much runcorn guessed but no acknowledgment had ever passed between them runcorn had never had the satisfaction of being certain and of knowing that monk knew he knew monk turned from great wild street into drury lane john evan was a different matter as different as could be he had not known monk before the accident and he had guessed the truth working with him so closely in that first dreadful case he had proved a good friend loyal despite all the odds in the hardest of circumstances he was young full of charm and enthusiasm a country parsons son with no money at all but the casual ease of one born to what in better times had been minor gentry evan had admired him he had chosen to see the best in him that was why it was peculiarly painful now to have to tell him of this problem and seek his help in uncovering its cause in fact he almost changed his mind about going to him at all perhaps it would do no good and all he would do would be to lose evans regard before he had to that was not only the cowards way out it was the fools evan would learn sooner or later better now and from monk better at least to see him fight than allow defeat by surrender he hailed a hansom and took it as far as the corner nearest his old station it was a bright morning he had barely noticed the sun had already melted the rime of ice on the footpath and the harness of passing carriages winked and glistened an errand boy was whistling as he walked with a swing in his stride monk reached the police station and went straight up the steps and inside to hesitate might lose him his courage momin mr monk the desk sergeant said with surprise what can we be doin for you id like to see mr evan if you please about a crime is it sir the mans face was unreadable and monk could not remember their relationship it was probably not cordial monk was his senior and the man was middleaged monk had probably treated him with impatience considering him secondrate he winced now at what he imagined im not sure whether it is or not he said as smoothly as he could i need rather more information and perhaps advice is mr evan in the station you wont be needin ter see mr runcorn then the sergeant said sententiously a very slight smile touching his lips no i wont thank you monk met his eyes without a flicker thought not the sergeants smile widened a fraction avent forgot the moidore case sir i avent monk forced himself to smile back thank you sergeant a very nice memory you have tastefully selective yer welcome sir ill fetch mr evan for yer and he turned and disappeared behind the door to reappear less than a minute later ell meet you in the coffee shop round the corner sir in five minutes wiser that way sir i admire a man of wisdom monk agreed thank you sergeant when evan came into the coffee shop his long humorous face with its aristocratic nose and rueful mouth looked full of anxiety he sat down opposite monk ignoring the coffee placed there for him what is it he asked it must be important to bring you to the station he searched monks face you look awful are you ill monk drew a deep breath and as briefly as possible without omitting anything essential he told him the story evan did not interrupt but his expression grew more and more distressed as the account neared its climax what can i do he said finally when monk finished surely she wont try to prosecute shed be ruined as well and shed never prove anything the worst he stopped yes monk said biting his lip you were going to say the worst that could happen is that her own circle would believe her it isnt even those who dont believe her will deny me the benefit of the doubt evan had barely touched his coffee and they were both unaware of the bustle and noise around them the hum of chatter and aroma of food no actually i was going to say the worst that happened to her was that her gown was torn she was in no way harmed in her person but i suppose a torn gown is enough it indicates an intention to do a great deal more evan regarded his cold coffee with distaste he had not touched it we must find out who she is and why she is prepared to take such a violent and costly revenge tell me all you know about her and ill search all your past case files her name is drusilla wyndham how old is she what is her appearance where does she live whom does she associate with monk realized how idiotically little he did know he felt foolish and the embarrassment of it burned up his cheeks i dont even know if her name is correct he said grimly i never saw her in company of anyone else i would hazard she is in her early thirties she is very small slender dainty but with a fine figure she has a beautiful face he winced as he said it fair brown hair hazel eyes and a charming voice with a little catch in it when she laughs i have no idea where she lives or with whom she associates except that the geographical society would appear to be one place she frequents she dresses very well but not extravagantly the chief charm of her appearance is her grace and her poise not a lot evan said with a look of concern you said she was in her early thirties and yet presumably unmarried is that not odd for such a charming young woman could she be widowed i dont know monk had been too delighted in her company to tax himself with such questions he realized now what a selfindulgent oversight it was i presume she was wellspoken evan continued that would narrow it at least to one class of person a couple sat down at the table next to them still side by side and laughing yes she is wellbred monk agreed but hardly a lady evan added with a sudden twist of dry humor doesnt give us a great deal to help ill start with the cases where someone was hanged or died in prison and where there was a woman of that general de scription involved somewhere a relative or close friend some other victim of the tragedy of course it could be someone i didnt catch monk said with sudden thought perhaps a case i didnt solve and the crime went unpunished perhaps she thinks i failed justice evan rose to his feet leaning a little on the table dont make it harder than it has to be he said quietly lets begin with the more obvious anywayhe smiledi dont think you had many unsolved cases from what i hear of you monk said nothing and watched evan as he made his way out turning once at the door to give a tiny salute of courage monk spent the afternoon with the police as they continued dragging the river around the isle of dogs and across bugsbys reach and searched the docks and inlets and the slums and alleys along the waters edge they even searched some of the pigsties and middens or cesspits they found much that was filthy violent and tragic including two dead bodies but neither of them could have been angus stonefield one was a child the other a woman monk went home in the dark close to despair he had never seen such an accumulation of human misery and he was weary his body ached and he was cold to the bone his feet were soaked and he no longer had any sensation left in his toes he would not go with them again reluctantly he felt a new respect deep and painful gouging out undiscovered parts of himself for men who could see such things day after day and still keep their courage and their innate kindness and sense of hope all he felt was anger and since he could change nothing his brain told him that was useless but his stomach still knotted inside the following morning he woke early long before the light and lay in bed planning what he would do to find drusilla wyndham it might not save his reputation or his livelihood but he had to know to answer the fears and the darkness within himself what manner of man was he that was the one truth which was inescapable and there were increasing times when the dread of that answer was worse than the answer itself because his imagination covered them all he rose at seven and ate a solitary breakfast then before eight left and walked for almost an hour his head bent in thought heedless of passersby of carriages clattering within feet of him idlers street sellers crossing sweepers neatly suited office clerks hurrying to business fashionable rakes and gamblers returning from a nights pleasure finally just before nine he took a hansom to the geographical society and went in at the entrance to seek some official of whom he could inquire he was uncharacteristically nervous usually his confidence intimidated people he had only to meet their eyes and ask curtly in his precise diction and he was answered today he felt at a disadvantage even before he spoke how far had she spread the accusation had these people already heard he did not feel like a villain only a fool good morning sir the porter said inquiringly may i be of service were you seeking information regarding any particular meeting or speaker monk had already composed his lie it was the sort of thing he had done often enough before when it mattered infinitely less personally it had been so much easier then actually i met a lady on the steps as she was leaving here nearly two weeks ago he began with acute selfconsciousness she was kind enough to recommend several other societies and groups to me but unfortunately i have mislaid the piece of paper on which i wrote them and i do not know her well enough to call upon her indeed i do not know her address was he talking too muchanswering what had not been asked it was a chance meeting because she bumped into me quite literally and so we fell into conversation he searched the mans face but it was perfectly bland there was not a shred of suspicion or disbelief in it indeed sir perhaps i can be of assistance i do know of several other societies which have similar areas of interest although i must say none of them to my knowledge deal in such an erudite manner or have so fine a group of speakers that is what the lady said she was very dainty almost so tall monk drew a level at drusillas height she had very handsome fairbrown hair and the most remarkable hazel eyes very wide and candid a most direct glance he hated the description but it was as she had seemed to him then she seemed to me to be of considerable intelligence and ease of manner an unusual person and most admirable i would have judged her to be just above thirty sounds like miss wyndham the porter said nodding his head very wellspoken young lady wyndham monk raised his eyebrows as if he had not heard her name before i wonder would that be major wyndhams daughter from the hussars as far as he knew there was no such person the porter pursed his lips doubtfully er no sir i dont think so i rather recall overhearing some snatch of conversation suggesting miss wyndham came from buckinghamshire and her father was in the clergy before an early demise poor man very sad he cannot have been an elderly gentleman sad indeed monk agreed his mind racing buckinghamshire it should not be so difficult to trace a welltodo clergyman who had died recently he must have been more than a mere parson and presumably his name was also wyndham i suppose it happened a few years ago now he said trying to make his voice conversational i really dont know sir it was spoken of with some sadness but then it would be and she was not in mourning i only wish to know so that i did not intrude and if i should mention it if i have to write monk explained would it be possible for you to give me the ladys address then i could request a new list of the places she recommended well sir i hardly think that would be proper the porter said regretfully nodding to two gentlemen who passed and touching his hat in a gesture of respect he turned back to monk you see sir im afraid the society would not sanction such a practice im sure you understand but if you care to write a letter and leave it with us there would be no bar to me forwarding it to her of course i understand perhaps i shall do that monk accepted because he really had no alternative a trip to buckinghamshire seemed indicated unless he could find some record of the late reverend wyndham without recourse to travel he left the geographical society if not with hope then at least with a sense of purpose but even the most diligent search of the appropriate register of the clergy yielded no reverend wyndham in buckinghamshire or in any other part of the country he began to walk very slowly along the footpath away from the library disappointment deep inside him like the cold and the damp of the afternoon perhaps he had been naive to have thought it might be so easy either the information was incorrect an invention for the benefit of whoever she was telling or else it was basically true but she had changed her name presumably to avoid the disgrace of whatever crime had brought her across monks path he ignored a flower seller and a boy with the latest edition of the newspapers perhaps the whole thing was nothing to do with his profession maybe he had met her purely personally her sense of injury might spring from some sexual betrayal he had committed his heart went cold at the thought had they been lovers and he had deserted her had there perhaps been a child and he had left her rather than take responsibility it was not impossible men had done that from time immemorial god knew there were illegitimate children all over the country and bungled abortions as well he had seen them himself even since the accident let alone before if that were true she could not hate him any more profoundly than he would hate himself he deserved the ruin she wished him he passed a seller of hot pies and for a moment the savory aroma tempted him then his stomach revolted at the thought of eating he had to know the truth at any cost whatever labor or pain he must know and if he was guilty of such a thing how could he tell hester she would not forgive him for that she would not stand by with her courage and spirit and help him fight his way back neither would callandra nor john evan for that matter he had to be the first to know but where to turn next if drusilla had changed her name it could have been anything before any of a million names he stepped off the curb and avoided the traffic and the horse dung except almost all people wanted to keep some sense of identity some link with the past there was often a connection a link of sound of initial letter or some other association in the mind at times it was a family name a mother or grandmothers maiden name for example he reached the far pavement just as a landau missed him by no more than a yard perhaps the part about buckinghamshire was true or about the church he turned on his heel back across the road again and strode back to the library where the directory of all clergy was lodged and asked to see it again this time he searched the incumbents of buckinghamshire for any senior clergyman who had died within the last ten years but there were none whose names suggested any connection however tenuous with drusilla wyndham is this all he asked the clerk who was hovering anxiously is there any way one might have been missed perhaps i had better look further back than ten years of course sir if you think it will help the clerk agreed if you could be a little more precise as to what it is you are searching for perhaps i could be of some assistance he adjusted his spectacles and sneezed i do beg your pardon im looking for a clergyman who died in buckinghamshire probably within the last ten years monk replied feeling foolish and desperate but i have been given the wrong name then i dont know how you can find it sir the clerk said shaking his head unhappily do you know anything else about him no do you not have even the least idea what his name is not even what it may have sounded like the man appeared to be pressing the issue simply for something to say he looked most uncomfortable it may have sounded like wyndham monk replied also only for civilitys sake oh dear i am afraid i can think of nothing of course there was the reverend buckingham who died in norfolk the clerk gave a jerky bitter laugh and sneezed again in a place called wymondham which of course is pronounced wyndham at least locally but that is hardly of use to you he stopped startled because monk had risen to his feet and clapped him on the back so sharply his spectacles flew off his nose and landed on the floor you are brilliant sir monk said enthusiastically quite brilliant why did i not think of that myself once you see it it is as obvious as daylight thank god for one man with brains the clerk blushed furiously and was quite unable to frame any reply what can you tell me about him monk demanded picking up the spectacles polishing them and handing them back where was he living what was the cause of his death how old a man was he what family had he what precisely was his position good gracious the clerk blinked at him like an owl his spectacles in his hand well well i can certainly find out for you sir yes yes indeed may i inquire why it is you must know is he perhaps a relative i believe he may be a relative of someone of the utmost importance to me monk replied truthfully if deviously someone who holds my very life in their hands yes please tell me everything you can about the late reverend buckingham and his family i shall wait here ahwelli may be yes of course he sneezed again and apologized to be sure and he scurried off about his task monk paced the floor until the clerk returned some twentyfive minutes later pinkfaced and brimming with triumph he died some eight years ago sir on the twentyeighth of march he frowned the cause of death was listed as chill rather unspecific he was not an elderly man indeed only in his fiftysixth year and apparently had been in good health until that time his family monk said urgently did he have children why yes yes he did and he left a widow a mary ann names of the children monk demanded what were their names what were their ages my goodness sir dont distress yourself so yes there were children indeed there were one son named octavian which is curious since apparently he was the eldest curious yes sir clergymen often have large families and octavian means eighth you know daughters did he have daughters yes yes he did eldest named julia second named septima poor man really cannot count quite amusing yes yes i am coming to the rest another son named marcus all very roman perhaps it was an interest of his a hobby yes and a last daughter named drusillaah this last gasp was because monk had again clapped him on the back and driven the air out of his lungs i take it that is the lady whom you are seeking yes yes i think it is nowthe living what was his position and where wymondham sir it is only a small village was he simply the parson it did not seem to fit what he had seen of drusilla could it be no more than an extraordinary coincidence and after all have no meaning no sir the clerk replied with growing enthusiasm himself i believe he had an attachment to the norwich cathedral or he had had in the recent past a distinguished scholar so my informant tells me ahthank you hope surged back up again is there anything else you know about the family for example the widow the daughters in what circumstances do they find themselves now the clerks face fell im sorry sir i have no idea i daresay you would have to travel to norfolk for that yes of course thank you i am enormously obliged to you and indeed he was he raced out of the building and flung himself into the first vacant hansom that passed shouting to the driver to take him to the police station where he could find john evan and tell him what he now knew but he was obliged to wait nearly three hours before evan returned from the case he was on by which time it was long after dark and had begun to rain they sat together in the coffee shop warming themselves with hands around hot mugs sipping slowly at the steaming liquid a babble of noise around them and constant movement as people came and went buckingham evan said with surprise i dont recall the name but there must be a case concerning a buckingham monk insisted try eight years ago specifically it was a cry of desperation terror gripped inside him that his wrong against drusilla had been personal and unforgivable not only to her but to himself as well i went back over all your cases evan said with pain in his eyes there was no buckingham that i can remember either charged or accused but of course ill try again ill look specifically for the name perhaps id better go to norfolk monk stared beyond evan without seeing the thronged room or hearing the laughter thats where they lived why would you have gone to norfolk evan was puzzled you only dealt with london cases if it happened there the local police would have handled it not you he shrugged very slightly and shivered as if someone had opened an outside door although the coffee shop was almost too hot with its crowded atmosphere and steaming drinks and the fire leaping in the hearth i suppose it could have started in london and there have been witnesses and suspects for that matterin norfolk ill try he frowned knowing he was speaking only for comfort dont worry if its there ill find it and if it is not monk thought then any injury to her was personal and how in gods name do i learn that how will i ever know my own view of it why i did whatever it was what i thought or felt what there is in mitigation for me he finished his coffee and stood up he had not the heart even to meet evans eyes what would he think or feel when he knew the truth what bitter disillusion and sense of betrayal he was so afraid of it it was as if it had already happened thank you he said with his voice choking in his throat he wanted to add more but could think of nothing thank you hester was also deeply afraid for monk not for what he might have doneshe had not concerned herself with thatbut for the ruin it would bring him when drusilla made her charges public the fact that she could not prove them was immaterial she had chosen her time and place to be melodramatic with great skill not a man or woman emerging from the party in north audley street would forget the sight of her pitching headlong out of the moving cab her clothes torn screaming that she had been assaulted whatever reason told them they would relive the emotions the horror and the sense of outrage and they would be totally unprepared to accept that they had been duped it would make them foolish and that would be intolerable something must be done to help him something practical and immediate there was little use trying to limit the damage after it was done she and callandra had talked about it sitting late at night in the small room in the limehouse hospital in the few moments when they were not either working or asleep callandra was deeply distressed even in the face of the disease and death around her and hester realized with a quick uprush of pleasure how fond she must be of monk callandras regard for him was far more than mere interest and the adding of a new dimension to her life but she had been able to offer no practical counsel now hester sat in the warmth and clean sweetsmelling comfort of enids bedroom in ravensbrook house and watched enids frail form at last peacefully asleep genevieve had gone home weary with grief and the mounting anxiety and loneliness of her loss dreading the trial of caleb which must shortly begin hester tidied a few things which were hardly out of place then returned to her seat it was so different from just a few days ago then monk faced no greater danger than failing on a case which had seemed hopeless from the beginning two weeks ago enid had been delirious and fighting for her life she had tossed from side to side moaning in pain as her body ached and her mind wandered in nightmare and delusion mixing past and present and distorting everything hester smiled in spite of herself one heard some very strange things in a sickroom perhaps that was one of the reasons certain people were wary of taking nurses rather than a ladys maid who presumably already knew a great many of her mistresss secrets enid had rambled about many things snatches of thoughts old griefs and loneliness longings she had never realized and perhaps would never have given words in her conscious mind there had been fear in her and half guessedat disillusion she had also referred more than once to letters which were quite openly declarations of love hester hoped enid had not kept them she doubted very much they were from lord ravensbrook nothing in what she had seen of him suggested such fluency or ease of expression he seemed a very formal man even stilted when it came to speaking of feelingswhich did not of course mean that his emotions were less or that his physical expression of them was not as profound as any other mans she had debated whether to mention it to enid and warn her that she was capable of indiscretion in her illness and therefore perhaps in her sleep if she should ever become feverish again then she had decided it might be seen as an impertinence and place a barrier of embarrassment between them if enid had managed so far to conduct her marriage without such a disaster then it might very well continue so without hesters advice she looked across at enids sleeping form now she seemed utterly at peace in fact there was a very slight smile on her face as if she dreamed of something pleasant perhaps she was thinking of some of those past letters they might still give her happy memories days when she knew she was admired found beautiful love letters were strange they could do so much good if kept discreetly and in the wrong hands so much damage hester had received very few herself and most of them had been formal more a statement of ardent hope than any real understanding or knowledge of her nature only those from soldiers had had any meaning and they were romantic heartfelt but in some measure cries of desperation and loneliness from young men far from home in an alien and dreadful circumstance and who simply found a gentle touch and a listening ear a single spark of beauty in the midst of pain and loss and the fear of loss she had treasured them for what they were not reading into them more she winced with embarrassment as she recalled one she had received long ago before the crimean war had even begun from a young man her father had considered a very acceptable suitor it had been couched in ardent terms and far too familiar in her opinion it had stated a love which had appalled her because he did not even see her only what he could turn her into she prickled with discomfort even now at the thought of it she had never wanted to meet the man again in fact she could remember vividly the next time they had met it had been at the dinner table in her fathers homeher mother was quite unaware of her feelings and had sat smiling at the foot of the table blandly staring at her across a sea of linen and crystal making optimistic remarks about domestic happiness while hester squirmed her face scarlet willing to give anything at all to be elsewhere she could still feel that wretched young mans eyes on her and the thoughts she imagined must be in his mind as he sat there in some ways it had been one of the worst evenings of her life if only he had not written she would never have suffered so much she might even have found him quite tolerable he was not personally displeasing quite intelligent not too opinionatedin fact altogether an agreeable person what ridiculous harm a letter could do if it overstated the intimate or pressed a case too far too soon it was as if the room had suddenly blazed with light of course that was the answer not perhaps in the highest moral standard in fact definitely quite questionable but monk was in a desperate situation the problem was to whom she should send them it must be the people of drusillas own social circle or it would hardly accomplish the purpose and hester had no idea who composed the current fashionable society because it had not interested her much for some years now it was of the utmost urgency however she thought on reflection that callandra would probably not be much more knowledgeable than she if she knew it would be by chance not design if ever there was a woman who did not give a whit about fashionable company or who dined or danced with whom it was callandra daviot genevieve was not of that social standing her husband was in business albeit a very respectable one but gentlemen only dabbled they did not actually work she looked across at enid there was the answer of course she could not possibly tell her why she wished to know not because she needed to protect monkenid would not have believed it of him without better proof than there was so far anyway hester could always moderate the story somewhat at this point but enid would certainly have the gravest doubts about what hester intended to do about it in fact it might very well be sufficient to keep her from providing the information altogether it must be obtained without the reason for it given and perhaps that might not be so very difficult hester could ask her about the last party she attended who was there what they wore who danced who flirted what was served to eat in fact she could ask her to describe several parties enid did not know her well enough to be aware that normally she had no interest whatever in such things she could do it she could begin as soon as enid awoke monk himself could find the necessary addresses if there were no better way of obtaining them she could begin with ten or a dozen there was no time to be lost you must have been to some wonderful parties she began with enthusiasm when enid awoke and she puffed up her pillows and brought her a little light food please tell me about them i should love to hear would you enid said doubtfully i would not have thought such things would interest you in the slightest she looked at hester narrowly amusement in her eyes people are always interesting hester said truthfully even people with whom one would not necessarily wish to spend great periods of time please tell me about the last big society party you went to who was there what did they say what did they do who was there enid repeated thoughtfully staring past hester at the curtains well i remember john pickering because he told that awful story about the bishop and she reminisced with a short smile and a dry not unkind observation and gradually hester knew from her what she needed committing every relevant fact to memory the next day she found monk at home looking weary irritable and frightened she might have tried to comfort him had she had time and not been so afraid he would somehow realize what she meant to do and stop her do you still have the wretched letter that woman wrote to you she asked hastily he was standing by the fire effectively shielding her from the warmth although that had probably not occurred to him why he asked ive read it several times it doesnt give any clues at all as to why it is she hates me or who she really is beyond the obvious do you have it or not hester said sharply please dont argue with everything i say there really isnt time you havent said anything else he pointed out and i wont have time to if you keep on being so persnickety do you have the letter yes then may i see it please what for he did not move get it she ordered he hesitated as if to argue further then decided it was not worth the emotional effort he went to the bureau drawer and took out the letter passing it to her with a look of distaste thank you she put it into her pocket then unfolded the piece of paper on which she had written the addresses of eighteen gentlemen who would serve her purpose i need the london addresses of as many of these as you can find unless they are in the country at present she instructed holding it out to him then it will be no use i want at least twelve and by tomorrow midday if you please it is of the utmost importance you may leave them at my lodgings in a sealed envelope dont fail she turned to leave i am sorry i cannot remain but i have a great deal to do good night hester he shouted what for what on earth do you want them for what are you doing he strode to the door after her but she had her hand on the knob already i have told you i have no time to discuss it now she replied briskly i shall explain it all later please do as i have asked you and as rapidly as possible good night she began as soon as she reached her lodgings where her landlady was quite surprised to see her as she had been there so little of late hester spoke to her graciously said how pleasant it was to be home again and announced that she would spend the evening writing letters in the unlikely event anyone should call she was not available to receive them her landlady looked both alarmed and fascinated but did not let down her own dignity sufficiently to ask for an explanation it was beneath a lady and she wanted to be thought a lady which prevented her exhibiting anything so vulgar as curiosity as soon as she had eaten hester began her task doing her best to imitate drusillas flowery erratic hand my dearest love i am still on fire from the joy of our last meeting of course i do understand the necessity for secrecy at least for the time being but the tenderness of your eyes was enough to thrill me to my very heart this was quite fun to write in such an unbridled strain she would never in the world write like this if she were putting her own name to it no matter what she felt she continued i long for the time when we may be alone together so that this pretense may no longer be when you can take me in your arms and we can give ourselves to each other with the passion which i know you feel as i do tearing me apart i ache for you my dreams are filled with the sight of you and the sound of your voice the touch of your skin against mine the taste of your mouth oh dear had she gone too far but the aim of this was to be as excruciatingly embarrassing as possible the man who received this must regard drusilla wyndham with an abhorrence verging on terror she proceeded i know all the things you dare not say i do not misunderstand your occasional coldness towards me when we chance to meet in public i burn inside my heart melts to be able to tell the world that we are lovers al beit yet to dare the final act but i shall wait knowing it will not be forever and that soon soon my darling you will cut the ties that bind you to your wife now and we shall be free to be together for ever your one true love drusilla there now if that did not make the man squirm then he was a rake and a cad and possessed of no decency at all naturally she had chosen only married men or those about to be she reread what she had written perhaps it was a bit extreme what drusilla had done was appalling but such a letter might damage her irreparably several almost certainly would which would make hester morally no better than drusilla herself and she realized with a wave of misery that even monk was not sure that he had not somehow caused her hatred she tore up the letter and put the little pieces into the wastebasket and began again this one was much more moderate inviting misinterpretation but phrased in such a manner that it could at a stretch of the imagination and with a great deal of charity be explained reasonably innocently that was better please heaven she had not softened it too much and it would still cause the necessary misgivings and mistrust of anything drusilla might say the flickers of personal fear the fellow feeling with another man who had had his words or his actions misconstrued by a vain and overeager woman she wrote several more by the time she put her pen down at a quarter to ten her hand ached and her eyes were stinging two days later lord fontenoy opened his mail at the breakfast table it appeared the usual collection of bills invitations and polite letters of one sort or another there was none which occasioned any unusual interest and certainly no alarm until he came to the last one lady fontenoy who had been reading a letter from her cousin in wales heard him splutter and looked up then with some anxiety forgot her own mail entirely my dear are you all right you look quite unwell is it distressing news no he said overloudly no not at all he amended it is something quite trivial he strove to invent a plausible lie something to account for his pale face and shaking hands and yet not excite her curiosity so that she expected to read the wretched thing which of course he could refuse but he did not wish her suspicion aroused he had a really most agreeable domestic life and desired intensely to keep it so no my dear it is simply a most foolish letter from someone who desires to make trouble in a quarter i had not foreseen its unpleasant but nothing to cause undue worry i shall deal with it perhaps he was reacting too strongly he recalled the phrases used they had initially appalled him but on second thought they were ambiguous capable of less demanding intent are you sure lady fontenoy pressed you do look very pale walter i swallowed my tea a little hastily he replied i fear it did not go quite the right way uncomfortable please dont distress yourself how is dorothea that is a letter from dorothea is it not she realized that was the end of the conversation she accepted that he would not mention it again but she knew perfectly well that the letter he had received had shaken his composure very thoroughly and she was not at ease for the rest of the day sir peter welby was also highly upset by his morning mail being still a bachelor now on the brink of a very fortunate marriage he breakfasted alone apart from the distant presence of his manservant good god he expostulated when he had read the alarming missive if that should fall into the wrong hands it could be very damagingly misconstrued it could all become very ugly indeed if read by someone unkindly disposed sir his manservant said questioningly his reaction was to tear it up into many pieces and those as small as possible then put it all on the breakfast room fire he remembered the woman quite clearly he had danced with her several times she was very comely and had an air about her which was highly attractive she had wit and he had thought intelligence but she must be out of her senses to have perceived his very slight flirtation as anything more and supposed that he had even the remotest intent to pursue the relationship now of all times if she really did mean what she seemed to then he must convince her he had no such thought in mind nor ever had had but then perhaps she had merely expressed herself unfortunately better not to mention it at allto anyone let it blow over he must be a great deal more careful in the future handsome women of a certain age were the very devil the honourable john blenkinsop read his mail with total disbelief he refolded the letter hastily and was in the act of replacing it in its envelope when his wife who had no mail this morning interrupted his train of thought she had news of her own to discuss which she had heard the previous evening only she had retired before he had returned from his club and thus had had no opportunity to pass it on did you know john the most dreadful thing happened in north audley street the other day she leaned forward over the toast and marmalade poor drusilla wyndham such a lovely creature was assaulted in a hansom can you imagine anything so perfectly dreadful she had asked some mans assistance in a matter and the man a very ordinary person by all accounts mistook her civility for encouragement and attempted to force his attentions on her john are you listening to me force his attentions he repeated confusedly you mean kiss her yes i suppose so she agreed he even went so far as to tear her gown open at the bosom the whole thing must have been a nightmare for her poor creature she only escaped him by hurling herself out of the hansom as it was moving mind you and fell into the road how she was not injured i cannot think the letter burned in his hand i wouldnt put too much weight to it my dear he began what she was aghast how can you say such a thing what on earth do you mean the man behaved unpardonably possibly my dear but some women do imagine things to be quite imagine she was nonplussed the man put his hands on her john he tore her gown how can she have imagined that well perhaps he merely brushed against her the motions of the cab and all that he thought of his own brush with drusilla and the absurd interpretation it seemed she had put upon that his sympathy was entirely with this fellow whoever he was he broke out in a sweat thinking how easily he could have been in his place rather a hysterical woman my dear he added dont like to distress you but i wouldnt accept all she says if i were you single women in their thirties and all that given to fancies of a rather heated nature it can happen misunderstood a civility for something much more easy enough she frowned do you really think so john i find it hard to believe of course you do my dear he forced a smile al though it felt painted onto his face because you are a woman and properly married with a home of your own and all that goes with it you would never imagine such things but not all women are as you you must appreciate that be advised mariah a good friend of mine whose name i will not mention to avoid his embarrassment has had a similar experience with a young woman and he was as innocent as the day i assure you but in the heat of her her imagination she totally misread him and accused him of well it is not fit for you to hear oh my goodness she was totally taken aback well i never i really had not thought it does you credit he rose and left the table but i urge you to dismiss the matter altogether and on no account be drawn into discussion of it now you must excuse me my dear please do not let me disturb you and as he passed the fire he dropped the letter into it and hesitated long enough to see the flames consume it to his infinite relief it would not be spoken of again chapter four days later the trial of caleb stone began in the central criminal court in the old bailey for the prosecution was oliver rathbone for the defense ebenezer goode goode was also a queens counsel of flair and skill he had taken the case not for the fee there was none but for the high profile of the issue and perhaps even more for the challenge rathbone knew him slightly they had appeared in opposition to each other before goode was a man in his midforties tall and rather gangling but the most remarkable things about him were his prominent very bright pale bluegray eyes and his broad startling smile he was full of enthusiasm and had a highly eccentric sense of humor he was also inordinately fond of cats the spectators seats were not as crowded as for a trial where the accused was a member of high society or the victim a more colorful character than angus stonefteld there was no hint of sexual scandal and apparently no money involved and since there was no corpse the question of murder was one of the issues yet to be proved those who had come were there largely to witness the duel between rathbone and goode to prove that very point they were connoisseurs of the adversarial procedure it was a fine blustery day outside shafts of sunlight brightened the windows and shone in hazy beams across the wooden panels of the walls the floor and the carved panoply of the judges seat the jurors were ready twelve carefully chosen men of solemnity proven worthiness and of course the appropriate qualifications of property ownership rathbone called his first witness genevieve stonefield there was only the mildest stir of anticipation as she crossed the court and climbed the steps to the witnessbox on rathbones advice she was wearing not black but a mixture of dark gray and navy it was sober unostentatious and extremely flattering she looked tired and strained but the essential passion and intelligence in her face were heightened and as she turned at the top of the steps and looked towards the room there was a sudden rustle of in terest one man drew in his breath in surprise and a woman clicked her teeth rathbone smiled genevieve stonefield was that sort of woman she caused emotions perhaps of envy in the female members of the crowd even if they did not quite know why there was something in her yet to be awakened something more elemental than in most women he must handle it with the utmost care perhaps it was a fortunate thing a jury could only ever be composed of men she was sworn in and gave her name and address staring solemnly at rathbone as if there were no one else present not once did her eyes stray to the judge or the jury not even to the clerk who gave her the bible rathbone rose to his feet and approached the high witness stand but stopped some distance away so he did not have to crane his neck to see her he began quietly mrs stonefield would you please tell the court all you can remember of events on the last day you saw your husband begin with your conversation at breakfast she took a deep breath and her voice was almost steady when she replied there was nothing remarkable in the post she said a few letters from friends an invitation she stopped and had to make a considerable effort to control herself it was not visible no tears or trembling no groping for a handkerchief just a long hesitation before she resumed it was to a musical evening in three days time which he said we should accept it was a violin recital he was particularly fond of the violin he found its tones emotionally very stir ring in a way nothing else quite touched so you wrote to accept rathbone interrupted believing he fully intended to be there yes she drew in her breath i never excused myself they must think me most rude it quite went out of my head if they did not understand at the time i am quite certain they will now he assured her please continue angus received one or two household bills which he said he would attend to when he came home then he left for his business he said he would be home for dinner have you seen him since mrs stonefield her voice was very quiet almost a whisper no have you had any communication from him whatever no rathbone walked a pace to the left and shifted his weight a little he was acutely aware of ebenezer goode leaning back in his chair a slight smile on his face his eyes bright and watchful he was at ease confident but never so careless as to take anything for granted in the dock caleb stone stood motionless his hair was long and thick and curled wildly adding to the reckless look of his face with its wide mouth and brilliant green eyes his very lack of movement drew the gaze in a room where everyone else fidgeted now and then shifting position scratching a nose or an ear turning to look at someone or something whispering to a neighbor the only person who did not even glance his way was genevieve as if she could not bear to see his face with its mirrorlike resemblance to the husband she had loved mrs stonefield rathbone proceeded has your husband ever been away from home overnight before oh yes quite often his business necessitated traveling now and then any other purpose that you are aware of yes she stared at him fixedly her body rigid in its navy and gray wool and trimming silk he went quite regularly to the east end of the city to the limehouse area to see his brother he was she seemed lost for words caleb stared as if he would force her to look at him but she did not several of the jurors were more attentive fond of him rathbone suggested ebenezer goode stirred in his seat rathbone was leading the witness but this time he did not object in a way he loved him genevieve said with a frown still keeping her head turned away from the dock i think also he felt a kind of pity because this time ebenezer goode did rise yes yes the judge waved his hand in a swift motion of dismissal mrs stonefield what you think is not evidence unless you give us the reasons for your belief did your husband express such a sentiment she looked at him with a frown no my lord it was my impression why else would he keep on going to see caleb in spite of the way caleb treated him unless it was loyalty and a sort of pity he defended him to me even when he was most hurt the judge a small lean man with a face so weary he looked as if he could not have slept well in years regarded her with patient intelligence do you mean his feelings were wounded maam or his person both my lord but if i cannot say what i know by instinct and because i knew my husband but only what i can prove by evidence then i shall say only that he was injured in his person he had sustained bruises abrasions and more than once shallow knife wounds or some other such sharp instrument rathbone could not have planned it better now there was not a man or woman in the whole courtroom whose attention was not held all the jurors were sitting bolt upright and facing the witness stand the judges lugubrious face was sharp in the crowd rathbone saw hester latterly sitting beside lady ravensbrook who was ashenskinned and looked as if she had aged ten years in the last weeks monk had said shed had typhoid fever it had certainly taken its toll even so she was a remarkable woman and nothing could rob her features of their character ebenezer goode bit his lip and rolled his eyes very slightly in the dock caleb stone gave a short burst of laughter and the guards on either side of him inched closer their disgust plain the judge glanced at rathbone do we understand mrs stonefield rathbone picked up the thread again that your husband returned from these trips to see his brother with injuries sometimes quite serious and painful and yet he still continued to make these journeys yes she said steadily what explanation did he offer you for this unusual behavior rathbone inquired that caleb was his brother she answered and he could not desert him caleb had no one else they were twins and it was a bond which could not be broken even by calebs hatred and his jealousy in the dock calebs manacled hands strong and slender grasped the railing till his knuckles shone white rathbone prayed she would remember precisely what they had discussed and agreed so far it was going perfectly were you not afraid that one day the injuries might be more serious he asked perhaps he might be crippled or maimed for life her face was pale and tense and still she stared straight ahead of her yesi was terrified of it i implored him not to go again but your pleas did not change his mind no he said he could not abandon caleb she ignored calebs snort of derision almost anguish he could always remember the boy he had been she said chokingly and all that they had shared as children the grief of their parents death she blinked several times and her effort to maintain control was apparent rathbone restrained himself from looking at the jury but he could almost feel their sympathy like a warm tide across the room in the crowd enid ravensbrooks haggard face was softened with pity for the distress she imagined so clearly there was such a depth of feeling in her rathbone could not help the fleeting thought that perhaps she too had known such loneliness as a child yes he prompted genevieve gently their sense of total loneliness she continued and the dreams and fears they had shared when they were ill or frightened they turned to each other there was no one else to care for them he could not forget that no matter what caleb might do to him now he was always aware that life had been good to him and for caleb it had not proved so fortunate in the dock caleb let out a sound half groan half snarl one of his gaolers touched him gently the other sneered did he say that mrs stonefield rathbone demanded did he use those words or is that your surmise no he used those words more than once her voice was clear and decisive now it was a statement you were afraid that caleb might harm your husband seriously out of his envy at his success and the hatred arising from that rathbone asked yes there was a murmur around the room a shifting of weight the sun had gone and the light was grayer across the wood did he not understand your feelings rathbone asked oh yes she affirmed he shared them he was terrified but angus was a man who set duty and honor above all even his own life it was a matter of loyalty he said he owed caleb a debt for the past and he could not live with himself if he were to run away now one of the jurors nodded his approval and his determination deepened he glanced up at the dock with bitter contempt what was that debt mrs stonefield rathbone asked did he say only a matter of caleb having defended him on occasions when they were children she replied he was not specific but i think it was from older boys from teasing and bullying he did imply that there had been some boy who had been especially brutal and caleb had always been the one to take the brunt of it and protect angus the tears momentarily spilled down her face and she ignored them angus never forgot that i see rathbone said softly smiling a little that is a sentiment of honor i imagine we can all understand and admire he gave the jury a moment or two to absorb the idea again he did not look at them it would be far too unsubtle but you believe he was frightened all the same he continued why mrs stonefield because before he went he would be restless and withdrawn she answered quite unlike his usual manner he preferred to spend time alone often pacing the floor he would be palefaced unable to eat his hands would shake and his mouth be dry when someone is as deeply afraid as that mr rathbone it is not hard to observe it especially if it is someone you know well and love of course he murmured he was acutely conscious of caleb crouched forward over the railing and of two jurors staring at him as if he were a wild animal and might even leap over upon them were he not manacled was there anything else sometimes he dreamed she replied he would cry out calling calebs name and saying no no and then he would wake up covered in perspiration and his whole body shaking did he discuss with you what was in these dreams no he was too distressed she closed her eyes and her voice quivered i would simply hold him in my arms until he went to sleep again as i would a child there was total silence in the court for once even caleb had his head bent forward so his face was hidden in the crowd there were only a few sighs of pentup breath being let go emotions tight enid looked as if she might weep and her hand clung to hesters i appreciate that this can only be painful for you rathbone resumed after a moment allowing genevieve time to master herself but there are questions i must ask when your husband did not return what steps did you take the following day i went into his place of business and asked mr arbuthnot the senior clerk if perhaps angus had been called away on business and somehow the message to me had been lost he said that had not happened he she stopped yes please do not tell us what mr arbuthnot said rathbone snuled at her very slightly we shall ask him in due course tell us merely what you did yourself as a result of his information i waited two more days then i called upon an agent of inquiry who had been recommended a mr william monk i shall be calling both mr arbuthnot and mr monk my lord rathbone said then turned back to genevieve what did you say to mr monk i told him i feared my husband had gone to see his brother and that caleb had murdered him she hesitated only a moment gripping the edge of the railing hard straining the fabric of her navy gloves i instructed him to do all he could to find proof of what had occurred he promised to do so and as a result of his efforts in this cause mrs stonefield did he bring you certain articles of clothing her face grew even paler and this time her voice was beyond her ability to control she gulped and when she spoke it was huskily yes rathbone turned to the judge may it please your lordship the prosecution exhibits one and two proceed the judge nodded in assent the clerk produced the coat and trousers monk had brought back from the isle of dogs they were just as he had presented them to the police soiled bloodstained and badly torn are these the clothes he brought you mrs stonefield rathbone asked holding them up so not only she must see but the whole room there was a gasp of indrawn breath he glimpsed titus niven white as a sheet his eyes blazing with anger sitting two rows behind enid ravensbrook he saw hester wince but knew she at least understood genevieve swayed and for an instant he thought she was going to faint he stepped forward although with the height of the witness stand above the floor he could not practically have assisted her one of the jurors groaned audibly if the verdict had depended upon sympathy rather than fact and ebenezer goode were not to speak rathbone could have won at that moment the only person in the room who seemed unmoved was caleb he seemed merely curious and slightly surprised would you look at these clothes mrs stonefield and tell the court if you recognize them rathbone said very gently but so his voice carried to every last person in the room there was not a breath or a rustle to detract from him she looked at them for no more than an instant they are the clothes my husband was wearing the last time i saw him she said with her eyes on his face please dont make me touch them they are covered in his blood ebenezer goode opened his mouth and closed it again no one had proved it was anguss blood but he knew better than to argue the point now he shot rathbone a bright warning glance battle would commence at the due time but he had never doubted that and genevieve would not be spared only treated with the caution necessary not to injure his own cause of course rathbone murmured as long as you have no doubt they are his none her voice was husky but quite clear i have already read the tailors label on the inside when mr monk first brought them to me thank you mrs stonefield i have no need to distress you further but please remain where you are in case my learned friend for the defense wishes to speak to you he smiled at her meeting her eyes for a moment and seeing them remarkably steady before returning to his seat ebenezer goode rose to his feet smiling with dazzling benevolence he approached the witness stand almost deferentially there was a rustle of interest around the room only caleb seemed not to care he avoided looking at him mrs stonefield goode began his voice resonant caressing the ear i am truly so sorry to have to put you through this ordeal but you do understand that grieved as we all are for your tragedy it is my duty specifically mine to see we do not compound it by blaming someone who is not truly guilty you see that im sure he raised his eyebrows hopefully yes i understand she answered him of course you do you are a generous woman he thrust his hands into his pockets staring up at her he was still smiling i do not doubt that the relationship between your husband and his brother was a troubled one and that they quarreled occasionally it could hardly be otherwise when their paths had become so very different he freed his hands and gestured with them your husband had everything life can afford a beautiful and virtuous wife five healthy children a wellcaredfor comfortable home to return to every evening a profitable business and the regard and esteemindeed the friendshipof the world both socially and professionally he shook his head and pursed his lips whereas poor caleb for whatever reasons has none of these things he has no wife and no children he sleeps wherever he can find shelter from the cold and the rain he eats irregularly he owns little beyond the clothes in which he stands he earns his living as and where he can too often by means other men would despise and indeed he is rejected and despised among men feared by some ill grant as perhaps are many whose circumstances drove them to despair he smiled at the jury i shall not try to depict him as an admirable man only as one who may justly be pitied and perhaps one whose occasional anger and resentment of his more fortunate brother is not beyond our limit to understand he had turned a little to face the crowd now he spun around to stare at genevieve again but mrs stonefield you say that in these visits of your husbands to the east end perhaps to limehouse or the isle of dogs that he returned home battered and bruised and sometimes even injured you did say that didnt you yes she was puzzled guarded as if he had been in a fight perhaps quite a serious one that was what i understood you to mean was i correct yes her glance strayed almost to caleb then jerked away again did he say specifically that it was caleb who had injured him mrs stonefield goode pressed please think carefully and be precise she swallowed turned to rathbone who deliberately looked away he must not be seen to have any communication with her she must be alone utterly alone if her evidence were to carry its fullest might mrs stonefield goode was impatient it was caleb he went to see she protested of course it was i had not considered other possibilities goode conceded thereby making sure the jury were aware that there were other possibilities we do not even need to consider them at least for the time being but did he say it was caleb who had injured him mrs stonefield that is the crux is it not possible that caleb was in some struggle and your husband as a loyal brother went to his assistance come maam is that impossible nonotnot impossible i suppose she said reluctantly but but what he was immeasurably polite but angus was not a brawler he raised his eyebrows not a man to get into a scrap not as you know him im sure but have you ever seen him in a public house in the isle of dogs sometimes it takes a very peaceable man or even a coward to avoid a fight there is caleb a fighter maam could he have instigated these brawls or have been the focus of them rathbone rose to his feet really my lord how can the witness possibly know such a thing as my learned friend has pointed out she was never there goode smiled at rathbone with exaggerated courtesy and not without humor alas hoist with my own petard i concede he turned back to genevieve i withdraw the question maam it was absurd may i ask from what your husband said to you is it possible that he was injured in a fight or a series of scraps in calebs company or even on his way to or from visiting him but not actually by caleb or is that impossible it is possible she conceded but everything in her face and the stance of her body denied it and the regrettable blood upon these clothes goode said his face twisted with distress which i willingly accept are his may i be optimistic even filled with hope that it is not in fact his blood at all but that of some other poor soul and that he shed them simply because they became spoiled in this manner then where is he she leaned forward over the railing her face pleading where is angus alas i have no idea goodes expression was one of genuine sorrow even apology but when they were found he was not in them harmed or unharmed maam i agree it does not look fortunate for him but there is no need to despair and certainly no proof of any tragedy let us keep courage and hope he inclined his head slightly and with something of a flourish returned to his seat the judge looked at rathbone there was the merest hint of weary humor in his eyes mr rathbone is there anything further you can usefully ask of your witness before i adjourn the court for luncheon thank you no my lord i believe she has told her story plainly enough for all to understand there was nothing he could do but make her repeat what she had already said it was a matter of judgment as to what would swing the jury one way or the other he believed restraint was the better part he had studied their faces their reactions to genevieve he should not overdo it let them form their own opinions of her paint her as they wished to see her her spirit to defend the interests of her children might be misperceived and mar the image the court rose caleb was taken down the crowd spilled out to purchase whatever refreshment it wished and rathbone goode and the judge partook of an excellent meal all separately at a nearby tavern they returned early in the afternoon proceed with your next witness mr rathbone the judge directed let us get to some meat in this matter rathbone spent the rest of the day calling the stonefield servants to corroborate what genevieve had said regarding anguss absences frotn home which were considerable although only when returning from seeing caleb was he ever injured on two of these occasions the wounds had necessitated considerable treatment he had refused to call a doctor in spite of the apparent seriousness and mrs stonefield had attended to him herself she had some skill in that area had mr stonefield been long in recovering on one occasion he had been obliged to take to his bed for over a week it seemed he had lost a great deal of blood had he given any cause for his injury no but the butler had overheard mr stonefield speak of his brother and mrs stonefield had made no secret of her assumption that caleb was the assailant the jurors faces made the belief plain and their contempt for caleb who ignored them almost as if they were irrelevant the butler was very straightforward he offered goode no opportunity to trip him and goode was far too wise to be seen to embarrass such a plain man he was courteous and complimentary all he could achieve was another reminder to the jury that the precise dealing of the wounds was still all surmise angus had never said in so many words that caleb had stabbed him and he did not labor that every man and woman in the room believed it was caleb it was in their faces when they looked at the dock and at calebs jeering insolent stare back at them the first day of the trial closed with a conviction of the mind but no evidence which the judge could direct as law only massive supposition and a crowd filled with a frustration of loathing rathbone left and almost immediately found a hansom without thinking he directed the driver to primrose hill that was where his father a quiet studious man with a gentle manner and an alarmingly sharp perception lived his father was sitting by a large log fire with his feet on the fender and a glass of red wine by his side when oliver arrived and was shown in by the manservant henry rathbone looked up with surprise and then a shadow both of pleasure and concern sit down he offered indicating the chair opposite wine what is it oliver sat down feeling the warmth of the fire creep over him with intense satisfaction i dont like that burgundy you have its a claret henry replied ill have a glass henry nodded at the manservant who departed to bring the wine youll burn your feet oliver said critically scorch the soles of my slippers perhaps henry argued he did not ask why oliver had come he knew he would be told in time oliver slid a little farther down in the armchair and accepted the claret from the manservant who went out and closed the door with a quiet snick the ash settled in the fire and henry reached forward and put on another log there was no sound in the room but the flickering of the fire no light but the flames and one gas lamp on the far wall the wind outside was inaudible as was the first beginning of the rain im thinking of getting a new dog henry remarked old edgemor has some retriever pups one i like in particular good idea oliver said he was going to have to open the subject himself this trial is troubling me so i gathered henry reached for his pipe and put it in his mouth but did not bother to light it he seldom did why what is not as you expected nothing i suppose then what is there to be distressed about henry looked at him with his clear lightblue eyes so unlike olivers own which were very dark in spite of his fairish hair you are off balance is it your mind or your emotions are you going to lose when you should win or win when you should lose oliver smiled in spite of himself lose when i should win i think summarize the case for me he took the pipe out of his mouth and pointed the stem at oliver absentmindedly and dont address me as if i were the jury just tell me the truth oliver gave a jerky little laugh and listed the bare literal facts as far as he knew them adding his feelings only as he believed they were relevant to some interpretation and not furnished by evidence when he had finished he stared at his father waiting for his response this is another one of monks henry observed have you seen hester again how is she oliver found himself uncomfortable it was not a subject he wished to contemplate much less discuss it is exceedingly difficult to get a jury to convict for murder without a body he said irritably but if ever a man did deserve to hang it is caleb stone the more i hear of angus the more i admire him and the worse caleb appears the man is violent destructive sadistic an ingrate but henry raised his eyebrows looking at oliver with piercing gentleness he seems to have not a shred of remorse oliver went on even looking at his brothers widow and knowing there are five children and what will happen to them now he stopped do you doubt his guilt henry asked sipping his claret oliver picked up his own glass the firelight shone ruby in it and the clean slightly sharp aroma of it filled his head no he is just so vividly alive even when i am not looking at him which is almost all the time i am aware of his emotions his rage and his pain and i am aware of his intelligence and if you win he will be hanged yes and that offends you yes and if you lose he will be a free man guilty and vindicated yes i cannot help you except to a quiet evening by the fire and another glass of claret you already know everything i would say yes of course i do i suppose i simply do not want to say them to myself alone he drank from the glass and the taste of it filled him at least until it was time to leave he could let the matter go monk had not been in court he would be called as a witness so he could not attend until after he had given evidence and he had no desire to wait around in corridors catching snippets of news he had no further word from drusilla wyndham if she intended drawing the police into the matter of his alleged assault she had apparently delayed her complaint he thought it far more likely she knew the futility of such a prosecution and would ruin him by innuendo a slower subtler form of torture and far more likely to be successful he would have to wait with the sword hanging over his head never knowing when it would fall he went to see evan only to find he had been sent to crouch end to interview a burglary suspect and would not be back until tomorrow there was little he could do to help monk until he knew at least what case if any was involved monk strode the cold pavements almost oblivious of the gusts of wind blowing in his face a carriage passed too close to the curb its wheels splashing through the gutters and soaking him his trousers flapped wetly around his ankles what had he done to drusilla what had he done to any woman he knew so little about his personal life he had not written regularly to his sister beth he knew that from the few letters of hers he had kept he had loathed runcorn and been at least partially responsible for the aggressive self serving way in which he now behaved runcorn had felt monks contempt all his professional life his original mild dislike of him had hardened into fear not without cause monk had sensed his weaknesses and played on them there was nothing in that to admire granted runcorn was an unattractive man narrow selfabsorbed and a coward with no generosity of soul but he was the poorer for having worked with monk not the richer who else was there no one from the past that he knew perhaps he had treated hermione well it seemed it was she who had let him down but if he had known her longer if she had not so bitterly disillusioned him would he in time have hurt her also that was a futile line of thought he crossed the road ignoring the horse droppings which had not been swept what of the present the brief span of two years since the accident he had behaved honorably with evan he was perfectly sure of that and with callandra callandra was fond of him she quite genuinely liked him the knowledge of that was one of the most pleasant of all his possessions and he clung to it with a fierceness which he would not have believed possible even a month ago but callandra was in her fifties a far truer mirror would be hester how had he treated hester who had stood with him against such terrors in the past and who had been unquestioningly brave and loyal in the teeth of failure and opposition he had been there unfailingly when she was in danger he had never for an instant doubted her honor or her innocence he had worked night and day to save her he had not even had to think about it it was the only possible course he could follow no other had entered his thoughts but how had he behaved towards her as a woman if he were honest he had been consistently abrasive and critical even offensive he had done it intentionally wanting to hurt her because in some indefinable waywhat why did she make him so uncomfortable because there was some elemental truth in her he did not want to know some emotion within himself she touched and he could not afford to feel she was demanding uncomfortable critical she demanded of him what he was not prepared to givechange uncertainty pain she had the difficulties of a man without the virtues the ease that went with them she required friendship but drusilla was utterly different how he regarded hester was irrelevant to this he crossed the next street dodging a dray he had been happy with drusilla enjoying her company without shadow she was fun lighthearted witty feminine she had made no intellectual demands no moral judgments there was nothing in her which irritated or discomforted him certainly hester was irrelevant but had he hurt hester was he innately selfish cruel and had he always been that was not totally irrelevant indeed it was the entire point he did not admire selfishness in others it was ugly from every aspect a spiritual weakness which soured every other virtue even courage and honesty were marred by it in the end is that what he was basically a man with no generosity of soul everything began and ended with his own interest what utter and abominable isolation it was its own punishment more terrible than anything imposed from outside he must know why did drusilla hate him there was nothing he could do until evan returned and he knew for certain whether it was a case or not if it was not then the next thing was to travel to norfolk but he could not leave london until he had testified in the stonefield trial he could join the police in their further search of the river for anguss body not that there was much hope of finding it now but it was still worth every effort it would almost certainly close the case against caleb and god knew he deserved that if ever a man warranted hanging it was caleb more importantly it would free genevieve from the emotional and financial prison of not knowing when he thought of her suffering and her courage her loss he was barely aware of his own dilemma or the gray street around him it was a clear cold afternoon when he stood in the small boat setting off from the shadwell dock stairs and started downstream with the wind in his face they took the north bank another boat was searching the south it was a long bitter day filled with the smell of tide and sewage the endlessly moving filthy water the sound of lapping and slurping as the wake of the larger ships washed against the shingle or the pier stakes and stairs and cargo boats and barges bound for the east coast passenger ships for france and holland clippers for every part in the empire and the world they went in and out of every dock every yard and stair poked every pile of wood or canvas every hulk every shadowed stretch of water lifted every drifting piece of flotsam they scoured carefully through the pier stakes where long ago those convicted of piracy on the high seas were tied until the morning tide drowned them monk was frozen his feet and trousers were wet from where he had jumped ashore onto the shingle his body ached his knuckles were skinned as were his palms from the wet ropes and he was hungry as dusk drew over a clear sky the air began to prickle the skin with cold and on shore the rime of moisture on the cobbles was turning to ice the tide was rising again they were beyond woolwich and the royal arsenal down as far as the end of gallions reach ahead of them was barking reach nothing the sergeant said with a shake of his head were wasting our time if e went in at all vs long gone now poor devil he waved his arm rocking the boat slightly right men might as well go ome gawd knows its going ter freeze as ard as the obs o ell tonight pass round that tot o rum its far enough ome dammit well find im somewere one of the others said laconically sea gives up its dead sooner or later mebbe the sergeant agreed but not tonight lads they turned in a wide circle and leaned their weight into the oars too tired to bother talking the shore was only a greater density in the night lit by yellow lamps carriage lights moving slowly sounds were faint across the water a rattle of wheels a shout the creak of spars in midstream it was a good hour later when they bumped into the mass in the water and the man in the bow called out it took them another twenty minutes working by lamplight awkward with the small boat tipping and the sodden heaviness of it to haul the body into the bottom and examine it monk felt his stomach knot and then churn with revulsion and he thought for a moment he was going to be sick it was the remains of a man in his late thirties or early forties as much as one could tell he had been dead for some time in monks judgment well over a week his features were badly decomposed by the river and its natural inhabitants what was left of his clothes were beyond recognition except that they must once have been a shirt and some form of trousers but of what quality or color it was impossible to say well the sergeant asked looking at monk this im there was a dry smile on his mouth and hopelessness in his eyes geez poor devil no uman bein should come ter this monk steeled himself and looked at the body more closely he was surprised his stomach had settled again although he was shuddering with cold he must have done such things before perhaps often the man was tall strongly built his hair was thick and dark there was nothing to disprove it was angus stonefield i dont know it could be he said with a sense of sadness which all but overwhelmed him as if up to that moment he had in some way still believed angus might have been alive the sergeant sighed i suppose well ave ter ask the wife although gawd isself knows ow yer could expec any woman ter look at that the more so if its im take him to the morgue monk said quietly loathing what he was doing even as he heard his own voice suddenly it seemed easy to hang caleb the anger was not enough even for that ill bring her it has to be done there may be some mark on the body where the clothes have protected it something she can recognize or which makes it possible the sergeant searched his face in the moon of the lamplight then nodded slowly right yare sir well do that cmon now boys put yer back inter them oars dyer wanter be stuck ere in the middle o the damn river till yer freezes solid yes mr monk genevieve looked at him her face creased with anxiety fear already at the back of her eyes he had been admitted to the parlor she was not using the larger more formal rooms probably to save the cost of heating them she looked exhausted he knew she had been in the courtroom all day and in the witnessbox a great deal of it testifying in an attempt to prove her husbands death watching caleb so physically like him must have been the worst ordeal of her life and now he was possibly going to add to it the final horror yet it could not be avoided no one else could do this if his face were undamaged recognizable perhaps ravensbrook or mr arbuthnot could have spared her as it was only she could know the intimacies of his body which were left monk was not often at a loss for words but even though he had thought of this since their grim find in the river he still did not know how best to tell her what is it mr monk her eyes did not leave his face have you found angus is that what you cannot bring yourself to tell me i dont know it was ridiculous that she should be helping him when he should somehow be easing it for her it was her grief her loss not his we have found a body but it will require someone who knows him well to identify it i dont understand she swayed a little bit what are you trying to say she swallowed is it angus or not you have seen caleb i can see a multitude of differences between them but to you they will be so alike you must know if it is angus or not there was a rising panic in her voice and her eyes please this this uncertainty is worse than knowing would be she stood with her hands knotted in front of her her body so tight she was shaking if i knew mrs stonefield i would not subject you to this he said desperately if even lord ravensbrook could have told i would have asked him but the river has done its damage to the face only where the clothes have protected it is it unharmed that is why you alone can tell she drew in her breath with a gasp tried to speak and made no sound at all he ached to be able to touch her in some manner lend her physical strength but it would have been an impossible intrusion would you like me to have someone come with you he asked have you a maid or shall we collect mr niven on the way i imagine you would not care for lord ravensbrook it was a question but he knew her answer from the stiffening of her neck no no thank you i think i prefer to be alone except for you if you will be so kind i have seen dead bodies before but not of my own husband nor damaged as you say of course he offered his arm immediately are you ready to come now or would you prefer to take a sip of brandy first i do not take spirits thank you i shall have my maid bring my cloak then i shall come it is better done quickly they rode in silence there was nothing of relevance to say and anything irrelevant now would have been both painful and absurd they clattered through the darkness past the shimmering street lamps reflected on the mist and smoke and the swaying lights of other coaches and carriages passing there was no sound but the clatter of hooves on stone and the swish of wheels and occasional splatter of water as they struck a particularly bad gutter they reached the morgue and pulled up with a jolt monk climbed out and helped her alight they crossed the pavement and went up the steps a single constable was waiting for them palefaced and unhappy he led them inside the place smelled clean and stale with an indefinable odor that was a mask for something else the washed and deeply decaying flesh of the dead the attendant took them to a small room where a body lay on a wooden table covered with a sheet it was customary to remove the sheet and show only the face in this instance it was the one part of the man most disfigured someone had taken the forethought to cover the head sepaarately the attendant unfolded the cloth from the neck down showing the shoulders upper arms chest and abdomen genevieve stood absolutely still as if she could not move from the spot monk was afraid that if she did she would collapse and yet from where she was she could not see sufficiently well to know more than that it was the upper torso of a wellbuilt man unless there were some major abnormality in angus she would have to come closer to know if this were him or not he took her arm mrs stonefield he said gently your distress is natural even a revulsion but we do not know if this is your husband or not without your help we will never know please use all your courage and look she took a step forward still with her eyes closed then another step and a third monk restrained her she was close enough they stood together in the silence not a sound from outside penetrated the room there was no motion of breath even the lamps seemed to burn without a hiss as if the air swallowed them genevieve opened her eyes and looked down at the naked chest in front of her no she whispered and the tears spilled over her eyes in both relief and despair it is not my husband please put back the cover over the poor man i do not know who he is it is not angus monk insisted you are quite sure yes she turned away from the body there are no scars on him angus had a unique pattern of scars on the side of his chest where he was hurt a stab wound once when he was with caleb i know exactly where it is i stitched it myself it is not there in that man monk guided her towards the doorway out im sorry to have brought you here he said bitterly i would have spared you this could i have known he nodded to the morgue attendant and the constable followed them out i know you would mr monk she answered with a little cough she put her hand over her face and swayed he steadied her and the constable came quickly to the other side he guided her to the entrance and the sharp night air thank you monk looked at the constable ill see mrs stonefield home yes sir good night sir maam when the trial of caleb stone recommenced the following day rathbone was aware of the preceding nights events he regretted profoundly both genevieves ordeal and the fact that it had not been anguss body he was also moved by it she could so easily have claimed him it was extremely unlikely anyone would have challenged her and the poor man whoever he was would almost certainly not be identified by anyone else surely the temptation crossed her mind he said to monk as they walked in the rain up the steps into the central criminal court she could hardly have been prosecuted for such an error even if it were ever proved it could have answered all her immediate needs and ours monk agreed grimly following rathbone in through the massive doors and shaking his umbrella before he folded it but no she looked just once and pronounced it not him she had no doubts what she thought about in the journey there or for the few moments before she looked at him we shall probably never know if she was tempted she had overcome it by then remarkable woman rathbone said quietly taking off his hat i wish i could feel more certain of an outcome for her little hope monk asked not as it is rathbone replied but i shall do my best we are certainly not beaten yet the first witness of the day was monk himself he testified of his search for angus which had taken him eventually to finding anguss clothes on the beggar in the east india dock road and his exchange of his own in order to obtain them then he told of his pursuit of caleb with the police and the arrest in the marshes rathbone did not mention their earlier encounter since all that caleb had said was inadmissible being hearsay and unwitnessed archie mcleish had been out of earshot beyond the other makeshift door when rathbone had finished ebenezer goode rose to his feet he looked at monk carefully meeting his gaze he recognized a professional his eyes gleamed and his lips parted in a wolfish smile brilliant all teeth but he was far too wily to attack where he could not win do you know where angus stonefield is now mr monk he asked very gently as if they had struck up a casual conversation in some tavern over a pint of ale no monk replied do you know for certain mr monk irrefutably whether he is alive or dead no goodes smile grew if possible even broader no he agreed neither do any of us thank you that is all rathbone rose and called lord ravensbrook there was a stir of interest but only slight the case was slipping away and rathbone knew it ravensbrook took the stand with outward calm but his body was rigid his eyes staring straight ahead he might have faced a firing squad with the same tight unhappy courage enid was there in the crowd again with hester beside her but he did not appear even to be aware of her much less to seek her when he had been sworn rathbone approached him and began my lord you have known both brothers since their birth have you not not since birth ravensbrook corrected since their parents died they were then a little over five years old i beg your pardon rathbone rephrased the question you have known of them they are related to you are they not yes ravensbrook swallowed hard even from where rathbone stood he could see his throat tighten and the difficulty with which he answered for a man of his natureproud intensely private drilled to keep his feelings under control and seldom to express them in words even when appropriatethis must be an experience close to torture when they were left orphans rathbone continued loathing having to do this but compelled without this background there was no case perhaps even with it there was none was he putting this man through such a refine ment of public pain for nothing you took them into your home and cared for them as if they were your own is that not so yes ravensbrook said grimly his eyes did not move from rathbones face as though he were trying to blot out the rest of the room and convince himself they were alone two men having an acutely personal conversation in the privacy of some club it seemed the obvious thing to do to a benevolent man rathbone agreed so from the age of five years angus and caleb stonefield lived in your home and were raised as your sons yes were you married at that time my lord i was a widower my first wife died very young there was barely a flicker of expression on his face just a shadow of grief then it was gone again it was not done to display ones vulnerability before others i married my present wife several years after that angus and caleb had already grown to adulthood and left home still he did not look towards enid as if to do so would somehow draw her into his tangle of pain or leave him more exposed so you were all the family they knew rathbone persisted ebenezer goode moved restlessly in his seat caleb stretched his hand away from the gaoler beside him and his manacles clanked against the railing the judge leaned forward is this leading somewhere mr rathbone so far your questions have seemed to elicit only the obvious yes my lord i am about to ask lord ravensbrook about the relationship between the two brothers as he observed it from childhood i am merely seeking to establish that he is an expert in this field you have done so please proceed rathbone bowed and turned back to ravensbrook when you first knew them my lord were they fond of each other ravensbrook hesitated only a moment his face held a curious look of puzzlement and distaste as if he found it distressing to answer the question yes they were extremely close at that time there was no division between them when did you first notice a division ravensbrook did not reply his face reflected a pain and a distaste which was hardly surprising to remember that time when angus and caleb had loved one another was a peculiarly bitter contrast with the present the sympathy for him was palpable in the room my lord rathbone pressed when did you first notice the beginnings of a division between the two brothers we need to know and you are the only one who can tell us of course ravensbrook said grinfly it was almost three years after their arrival angus was always a a quiet child studious obedient caleb appeared to resent it he was far less easy to discipline he would take correction very poorly he had an unfortunate temper in the dock caleb jerked his head up and the movement caught the eye of several of the jurors they looked at him with a new interest was this division between them on both sides rathbone inquired again ravensbrook hesitated for so long rathbone was obliged to repeat the question it did not appear so ravensbrook answered at last certainly as time passed angus became more diligent in his studies more of an agreeable companion caleb let out a snort which was almost a cry there was rage in it but an undertone of pain as well and rathbone suddenly felt the weight of rejection in it even all those years after the confusion and realization of the less favored son he thought of his own father and the bond between them he could not recall ever feeling it threatened jealousy was unknown to him and caleb was not he prompted ravensbrooks jaw tightened and his face was very pale no he said flatly he was rebellious argumentative a perverse child did you love him it was not a question he had intended to ask it served no purpose to his case he spoke without forethought only a sudden overwhelming emotion which was inexcusable totally unprofessional of course ravensbrook answered his dark eyebrows raised very slightly one does not withdraw ones loyalty or regard from a member of ones family simply because they are of a difficult nature one hopes that with care they will grow out of it and did caleb grow out of it ravensbrook did not reply did he grow out of the envy of his brother rathbone persisted did they regain their earlier closeness ravensbrooks face was tight bitterly inward as if he exercised an iron control it did not appear so to me in the dock caleb let out a short bark of derisive laughter and the judge swiveled around to glare at him breath drawn in to reprove him if he should make another sound among the jurors a man frowned another shook his head and pursed his lips ebenezer goode stiffened it was the first negative sign to his case although he must surely have known that calebs manner the very expression on his face was the greatest single factor against him there was no evidence at least so far it was a matter of emotion and belief a question of interpretation rathbone pursued the line of inquiry lord ravensbrook will you draw for the court the pattern of the relationship between these two brothers as they grew up in your house were they educated similarly for example a bitter smile touched ravensbrooks chiseled mouth then vanished instantly exactly the same he replied there was one tutor who taught one set of lessons it was only their response which was different in every regard i treated them equally as did all the rest of the staff everyone rathbone affected surprise surely there would have been those who had favorites as you say the boys became increasingly dissimilar caleb leaned forward in the dock his face eager listening intently ravensbrook must have been aware of it but he stood without the slightest movement he could have been carved in bone he was a man wading through a nightmare and it showed in every line and angle of his body enids eyes seemed never to leave his face lord ravensbrook rathbone felt he needed to attract his attention before there was any purpose in repeating his question ravensbrook looked at him slowly lord ravensbrook you have told us how unlike these two boys became surely others who know them must have felt differently towards them angus had every virtue honesty humility gratitude generosity while caleb was aggressive lazy and ungrateful if that is so can people truly have regarded them with equal affection perhaps i was speaking more for myself than for others ravensbrook conceded grudgingly his face stiff i did my best not to permit it but it may have existed in the village i had no control over that the village rathbone had omitted to ask ravensbrook where the brothers had spent their childhood he should have realized it would not have been in london my country home in berkshire ravensbrook explained his face suddenly white it was a better atmosphere for them than the city learned to ride hunt fish he took a deep breath manly pursuits learned a bit about the land and a mans responsibilities towards his fellows there was a murmur of assent from one or two people in the room enid looked puzzled caleb bitter a very privileged childhood by the sound of it rathbone smiled i gave them all i could ravensbrook said without expression except perhaps for a certain gravity which might have been sadness or merely an effect of the light in his impassive face with its patrician features and dark very level eyes under their short brows you speak of a jealousy growing between them rathbone continued he was battling with a witness who was all but hostile and it was like drawing teeth he could understand it having to expose his most private family life to the gaze of the public in general and the seekers of sensation in particular was something no decent man would wish and to one like milo ravensbrook it was like facing enemy fire but if there was to be justice it was unavoidable not only punishment for caleb but a decent acknowledgment for genevieve and her children would you give the court an example of any evidences of these you can recall instances of behavior resentments quarrels ravensbrook looked somewhere over the heads of the crowd i should prefer not to naturally rathbone commiserated no one wishes to recall such events but i am afraid it is necessary if we are to discover what is the truth of this present tragedy i am sure you wish that he was not perfectly sure perhaps ravensbrook would rather it went unknown and could fade from memory as a mystery but he could not say so there were several minutes of silence one of the jurors coughed and produced a large handkerchief another shifted his weight as though embarrassed the judge stared at ravensbrook ebenezer goode looked first at ravensbrook then at rathbone his face expectant but it was caleb who broke the tension forgotten have you he called down his lips drawn back in something close to a snarl forgotten how angus was afraid of that damn black horse of yoursbut i rode it forgotten how angry you were silence the judge banged his gavel but caleb ignored him leaning forward over the railing of the dock his beautiful manacled hands gripping the railing his eyes glaring his expression was one of such blazing hatred it struck a note of fear even though he was imprisoned by the height of the dock above the floor of the court and had warders on either side of him there was a power and a rage in him which could be felt across the space as though it might actually touch and darken the mind because i could make it behave and you couldnt caleb finished ignoring the judge it was as if no one existed in the room but himself and ravensbrook remember how you beat me because i took the peaches from the conservatory goode was on his feet but powerless that was seven years earlier ravensbrook replied not looking at caleb but staring straight ahead of him still you took every peach you deserved punishment the judge banged his gavel again mr goode either keep your clients behavior appropriate to this court or i shall have him removed and continue the case in his absence make that plain to him sir caleb swung around his face twisted with fury dont talk to me through a third party as if i werent here damn you i can hear what youre saying and i can understand you what bloody difference does it make whether im here or not anyway you say what you want about me believe what you want youll believe what suits your idea of the way you want things to be his voice rose even more what does the truth matter what do you care who killed whom as long as your world stays the same with the same comfortable reassuring lies cover it all up bury it put a white cross over it and say a prayer to your god that hell forgive you then go away and forget ill see you all in hell be sure of it ill be there and waiting for you the judge looked tired and sad take the prisoner down he instructed the warders caleb sank down suddenly his head in his hands ebenezer goode rose and walked at least halfway towards the bench my lord may we have a brief adjournment so i may advise my client i believe i can persuade him to keep silence theres no need caleb interrupted jerking his head up i shant speak again theres nothing else to say the judge glanced at rathbone i am ready to proceed my lord rathbone replied he had no desire to break the mood by an adjournment another outburst and i will act the judge warned yes my lord goode returned to his seat without looking towards the dock rathbone faced lord ravensbrook again i think part of my question has already been answered but if you could mention one or two other instances it would give the court a fuller picture for example how did the two brothers fare in their academic studies ravensbrooks body was as rigid as if he were in a military parade angus was excellent at his work especially mathematics history and geography he said staring ahead of him he was less interested in latin and the classics but he studied them because i wished it he was a most admirable boy and abundantly repaid me all i ever did for him a ghost of a smile crossed his face and vanished again i believe in later years he grew to appreciate the value of latin at least it is such a superb discipline for the mind he always understood the need for that caleb never did he was always unruly desiring to rebel to overthrow even to destroy it was something in him i could never govern i tried everything i knew and everything failed did he say anything about anguss success rathbone asked ravensbrooks voice was hard and low to begin with he merely expressed resentment later his feelings grew into a positive hatred a jealousy he seemed unable to control did he ever resort to physical violence ravensbrooks face was filled with an emotion so deep he seemed to shake very slightly and his skin was pale and tight across his high narrow cheekbones but to rathbone at least it was unreadable there could have been anger in it frustration knowledge of failure guilt or nothing other than a deep aching grief i cannot answer you of my own knowledge ravensbrook said almost under his breath and yet his words carried in a silent room where not a man or woman moved not a boot creaked not a skirt rustled if they fought i had not seen them did either of them ever sustain injuries you could not account for otherwise rathbone pursued the inevitable caleb was still motionless in the dock his head bent face hidden as though he had accepted defeat i dont recall ravensbrook answered youths will climb trees ride horses drive carriages and gigs dangerously the set of his jaw made it obvious he could be drawn no further naturally rathbone bowed and accepted defeat at what age did they leave home to go their separate ways my lord ravensbrook winced as if he had been struck angus joined a company of dealers in the city just after his eighteenth birthday they were acquaintances of mine and were keen to have him there was pride in his tone a slight lift to his head it seemed an excellent opportunity and he grasped it eagerly he did extremely well it was not long before he rose within the company and as you know eventually founded his own business and caleb rathbone said caleb left shortly before that he simply walked out i heard rumor that he had been seen in the village stories of drinking brawling ravensbrook remained silent for a moment there was not a sound in the room then they ceased he finished i presume that was when he went to london but he did not take up any position any calling not that i know of did you seek to find any position for him ravensbrook winced i could not recommend him to anyone it would have been dishonest he was a violent and deceitful man and appeared possessed of very few skills that were of any use in the crowd enid ravensbrook sat with such a pity in her face one might have thought it was that which had ravaged her rather than disease hester slid her arm around her and held her with a tenderness as if she might break i see rathbone murmured thank you my lord did he at this time express any hatred or jealousy towards his brother who sounds to have and to be everything he was not yes frequently ravensbrook acknowledged he both hated and despised his brother despised him rathbone affected surprise ravensbrooks face was bitter he thought angus weak and dependent lacking in either courage or individuality he thought him a coward and said so i imagine it was his way of excusing his own failure in his mind possibly rathbone nodded we are most of us loath to admit fault in ourselves thank you my lord that is all i have to ask you would you be so good as to remain for my learned friend to speak with you ebenezer goode was courteous and at least outwardly genial he rose to his feet and strolled into the center of the floor his startling face full of interest all this must be deeply distressing for you lord ravensbrook it would be for any man i shall be as brief as i am able he sighed you have painted a vivid picture of two brothers who began with a deep bond between them and grew apart one favored obedient talented the other rebellious unconventional and rightly or wrongly feeling himself less favored it was not surprising he should express a resentment and a jealousy he glanced at the jury with his dazzling wolfish smile brothers do fight with each other at times any family man will tell you that yet you say that you never witnessed any of their fights that is correct there was no expression on ravensbrooks face and the resultant injuries whether from fights or other youthful masculine pursuits goode pursued such as climbing trees riding horses and so on were they serious for example were there ever broken bones concussions dangerous bleeding no merely abrasions and some severe bruising ravensbrook remained expressionless his voice flat tell me my lord did either brother suffer these injuries very much more severely than the other goode inquired no no as far as i can remember they were fairly equally matched goode shrugged and nothing was serious nothing that you would consider a wounding never intent to maim or permanently to damage no in other words much as you or i may well have sustained in our youth yes if you will ravensbrook agreed his voice still without lift or interest as though the entire subject were tedious so in your knowledge this regrettable jealousy never resulted in anything more than words goode pressed not in my knowledge goode gave the court his wide gleaming smile thank you my lord that is all and so the trial progressed and continued throughout the afternoon and the following day rathbone called arbuthnot who testified that angus had come into the offices on the day of his disappearance that a woman had visited him after which he had declared that he was going to visit his brother and expressed his intention to return at least by the following day ebenezer goode could not shake him and did not try next followed a procession of witnesses from limehouse and the isle of dogs all adding their small pieces to the picture it built slowly indistinctly it was all indicative nothing conclusive but the picture was dark the setting for tragedy and everyone in the courtroom could feel it like a coldness in the air rathbone was aware at the edge of his mind of hester sitting next to enid ravensbrook of their faces as they watched the parade of frightened and troubled people one by one adding their few words their tiny addition of color to the story still so full of gaps and shadows he forced it to the edge of his awareness their feelings must not matter nor must those of caleb now sitting forward in the dock staring down towards the crowd although whose face he watched rathbone could not know but his expression was still the same mixture of anger pain and triumph ebenezer goode questioned them also and showed just how fragmentary was their evidence the picture remained partial distorted illusionary but he could not dispel the evergrowing awareness of hatred darkness and the conviction that angus stonefield was dead and by whatever means it was the man in the dock with his passion of suppressed violence who had accomplished it chapter after he had finished his evidence monk left the court there was nothing he could accomplish there and his own inner fear drove him to pursue the truth about drusilla wyndham it was no longer a matter of what she could do to ruin his reputation and his livelihood it was the question within himself as to what manner of man he was that she wished to even at such a cost to herself she had accused him of assaulting her of trying to force himself upon her was it possible that although he had certainly not done so this time on some occasion in the past he had the thought was repulsive to him he could not imagine any pleasure whatever in taking a woman against her will it would seem a degrading performance to both parties devoid of tenderness or dignity and with no communication of the mind nothing shared beyond the most rudimentary physical contact and afterwards the shame and the regret and the sense of futility had he really done such a thing only if he were then a completely different man but the fear plagued him waking him in the night with a choking in the throat and a sudden coldness perhaps the fear was as bad as a reality on leaving the old bailey he went straight to find evan he must see the records for himself even if he had to be smuggled into the police station after hours as a witness or a suspect so he could read the files of all his old cases which had ended in the ruin or death of anyone again he had to wait for evan he paced back and forth unable to sit down his muscles jumping his mind tormenting him with frustration the desk sergeant looked at him with a certain pity yer look right tore up mr monk he observed if its real urgent like i can tell yer were mr evan is i should be most grateful monk added he tried to smile at the man but he knew it ended as a grimace his lips pulled over his teeth twentyfive great coram street just orff brunswick square know where that is i spec oh yes it was opposite mecklenburg square where they had found the body of the man he had so nearly killed before the accident he could not ever forget that yes i do thank you the mans name flashed into his mind parsons the sergeants face lit with a smile he had not realized that monk remembered him welcome sir im sure monk raced out and caught a hansom at the end of the street swinging himself up and shouting the address at the driver as he threw himself into the seat he was then obliged to wait standing in the icy wind in great coram street while evan concluded his business but when he emerged he saw monk and recognized him instantly perhaps because men dressed as he was seldom stood idly on pavements in late february i found it he said triumphantly striding across towards him hunching his shoulders and pulling his greatcoat collar higher shivering a little but his face radiated success monk felt a kind of breathlessness a hope so painful it almost choked him he swallowed before he could speak found it he dared not even make it plain he meant the reference to drusilla in case it was not he might have meant merely something concerning his present investigation it was hard for monk to remember there were other matters other crimes other peoples lives well i think it is evan qualified it very slightly moving smartly away from the curb as a brougham clattered by the name buckingham is there he touched monk on the arm and turned to walk against the wind along great coram street towards the square with its bare trees outlined against the sky the reason it took me so long to find he went on was that it wasnt a capital case at all only an embezzlement and not of very much monk said nothing his footsteps rang on the cold stone it made no sense at least not so far a reginald sallis embezzled some funds from the church evan continued the tale a matter of about twenty pounds or so but it was reported to the police and investigated it was unpleasant because the money was from an orphans fund and suspicion fell on a lot of people before the case was proved but it was proved monk said urgently we didnt get the wrong man oh no evan assured him keeping pace it was definitely the right man good family but a bit of a rake apparently very handsome or at least had a fine way with women what makes you say that monk asked quickly they had turned into the square and were walking across the grass towards landsdowne place and the foundling hospital which lay ahead of them they must skirt around it to guildford street the evidence of his involvement was rather carefully concealed by two young ladies both of them apparently in love with him evan replied or more accurately one of them felt very deeply the other her sister was merely flirting this doesnt explain anything monk said desperately brushing past a hussar in uniform a romantic rivalry between sisters a petty embezzlement for which a young rake got what a year five years two years evan answered his face suddenly tight and his eyes full of pity but he died of gaol fever in coldbath fields he wasnt a particularly pleasant young man he robbed the charitable funds of the church but he didnt deserve to die alone in prison for it was that my fault monk felt the same wrench of pity he had seen the coldbath fields prison and would not have wished it on any living thing he could remember the cold that ate into the bones the damp of the walls as if they were forever weeping the smell of mold and sour places that are never open to the air one could taste the despair in it he could close his eyes and see the men shavenheaded in the backbreaking exercises of passing the shot endlessly pointlessly moving cannon balls from one place to another around in a ring or the treadmill the cages graphically known as the cockchafers the enforced silence beat in his ears where all human exchange was forbidden was that my fault he demanded again with sudden violence stopping evan by grasping his arm so he winced and was forced to swing around to face him it was your doing evan said without deviating his gaze at all but the man was guilty the sentence was the judges to give not yours what drusilla buckingham could not forgive you for i should imagine was that you used her to catch sallis you told her he was betraying her with her own sister julia in rage and hurt she gave you what you wanted monk felt the cold bite into the core of his body he was no longer aware of his feet on the pavement or the carriages coming and going along guildford street the clink of harness and was he i dont know evan answered him theres nothing to suggest it monk let out his breath slowly he hated the misery in evans eyes the refusal to excuse him but he had no argument he felt the same revulsion for himself the man might have been guilty but why had he pushed the hurt so far was it worth using a womans jealousy to betray her lover to the coldbath fields for a few pounds from the church funds albeit the poor box he wouldnt do it now he would let it go the shame would be enough if the vicar knew even if drusilla knew in her heart was that not all it really needed its past evan said quietly you cant undo it i wish i knew how to stop her now but i dont i didnt recognize her monk said sincerely as if it meant something i spent hours with her and nothing returned in my memory at all evan started to walk again and monk kept up with him nothing monk said desperately its not so surprising evan looked straight ahead of them shes changed her name and it was several years ago fashions are different now i daresay she altered her appearance somewhat women can it was a very trivial offense to our eyes but it was a scandal at the time sallis was trusted and the romance came out too both girls reputations were ruined all sorts of thoughts boiled up inside monk excuses that died before they were formed selfdisgust remorse confusion none of it found easy words and perhaps they were better unsaid anyway i see he kept pace with evan their footsteps making a single sound on the pavement thank you they crossed guildford street and turned down lambs conduit street monk had no idea where they were going he was simply following but he was glad it was not mecklenburg square he had too many nightmares already that evening drusilla wyndham as she was now known attended a musical soiree at the home of a lady of fashion she had dressed with great care to set off her considerable beauty and she fully expected to create an effect she swept in head high skin glowing with the inner triumph which burned in her mind the knowledge that the cup of revenge was at her lips the first taste on her tongue and she did create an effect but it was far from the one she had intended a gentleman who had always shown her gallantry looked at her with alarm and then turned his back as if he had suddenly seen someone else he must speak with immediately she did not take it seriously until sir percy gainsborough also effected not to have seen her when he quite plainly had done the honourable gerald hapsgood positively spilled his champagne in his urgency to avoid her apologized in alarm to the lady next to him and then in most unbecoming haste trod on the edge of her gown and only saved his balance by catching hold of lady burgoyne the duchess of granby gave her a stare which would have frozen cream altogether it was a most unpleasant evening and she went home early confused and very put out not having said a word of what she had meant to rathbone entered the courtroom of the old bailey for the third day of the trial with little more confidence than he had had in the beginning but his resolution undiminished he had hoped the police might find anguss body since they had turned their full efforts towards it but he had always known it was an outside chance there were so many other possibilities and calebs defiance of monk in the greenwich marshes should have warned him he had said they would never find angus looking at caleb as he stood in the dock while the judge entered and took his place at the bench and the last whispering ceased rathbone saw the jeering triumph in him again the violence so close beneath the surface every angle of his body suggested arrogance are you ready to proceed mr rathbone the judge inquired was that a faint shred of pity in his face as if he believed rathbone could not win he was a small man with a lean weary face full of lines that had once been pugnacious but were now too tired for the effort yes may it please the court my lord rathbone responded i call albert swain albert swain the usher repeated loudly call albert swain swain large awkward and mumbling so badly he had to repeat almost everything told how he had seen caleb on the day of anguss disappearance bruised his clothes badly torn and stained yes he thought it was blood yes his face was bruised and swollen and his cheek gashed what other wounds were there he could not say he had not looked did caleb appear to limp or carry himself as if some limb were paining him he did not remember try harder rathbone urged yes caleb had limped upon which leg swain had no idea he thought it had been the left or the right rathbone thanked him ebenezer goode rose to his feet toyed with the idea of demolishing the man and decided it would be impolite cruelty seldom paid and it was against his nature and surprisingly having made his statement the witness could not be shifted from it he had most definitely seen caleb stone looking as if he had been in a fight and that was no mistake he would not be pushed further he would not retreat he drew no conclusions he was perfectly certain it was the right day he had earned two shillings and redeemed his blanket from the pawnbrokers that was not an event to forget he was rewarded by a nod from the judge and a sad pursing of the lips from the foreman of the jury ah indeed goode conceded thank you mr swain that is all rathbone called his final witness selina herries she came very much against her will and stood in the witness stand clutching the railing stiffbacked her head and neck rigid she was dressed in drab clothes a plain stuff dress of respectable cut modest at neck and sleeve and she had a shawl wrapped around her so that one could only guess at her waist her bonnet hid a great deal of her hair nevertheless her face was fully visible and nothing could detract from the strength and the spirit in the high cheekbones the bold eyes and generous mouth in spite of the fact that she was afraid and desperately unwilling she stared straight at rathbone and awaited whatever he should say in her seat on the public benches genevieve turned slowly reluctantly and gazed at her in some faint way this was her mirror image this was the woman who loved the man who had killed angus their lives were opposite genevieve was a widow but selina stood on the brink of bereavement too and perhaps a worse one rathbone looking from one to the other could see an uncrossable gulf between them and yet a spark of the same courage and defiance gave both faces the same fierce warmth he could not help also looking at caleb would the sight of selina waken anything in him of regret of understanding not only of genevieves loss but of what he too was about to pay in retribution was there anything of human passion or need or gentleness in the man what he saw as caleb leaned over the rail balancing his manacles on the wood was utter despair that absolute absence of hope which knows defeat and makes no struggle at all then in the public benches lord ravensbrook moved and caleb caught sight of him and the old scalding hatred returned and with it will to fight mr rathbone the judge prompted yes my lord he turned to the witness stand miss herries he began standing in the center of the open space of the floor his feet a little apart you live on manilla street on the isle of dogs is that so yes sir she was not going to commit herself to anything whatsoever that she did not have to are you acquainted with the accused caleb stone her eyes did not flicker certainly she did not look across at caleb yes sir how long have you known him bout she hesitated six seven years i spose she swallowed nervously and ran her tongue over her lips six or seven years is quite close enough rathbone smiled trying to reassure her approximately how often do you see him her face clouded and he hastened to help every day or once a week perhaps or once a month e comes and goes she said guardedly sometimes les around fer two or free days then ell be gorn again mebbe gorn for weeks mebbe back sooner im reglar i see but over the years you have come to know him well yer could say is he your lover miss herries her eyes slid to caleb then away again quickly there was no readable expression in his face a juror frowned someone in the crowd sniggered may i rephrase the question rathbone offered are you his woman caleb grinned his green eyes bright it was impossible to read his thoughts or even whether his tense almost wolfish expression was amusement or unworded threat selinas chin came up a fraction she avoided meeting the glance of anyone in the crowd beyond rathbone yeah i am thank you for your candor maam i think we may take it that you do know him as well as anyone may be said to i spose she remained careful there was almost silence in the room but one or two people stirred this was of little interest she was acknowledging the obvious rathbone was aware of it she was his final witness and his last chance but for all her fear of the court she would not willingly betray caleb not only were her emotions involved and whatever memories she might have of moments of intimacy but if he were to be found not guilty then his vengeance would be terrible added to that she lived on the isle of dogs it was her home and they were her people they would not look with tolerance on a woman who sold out her man whether for gain or from fear for herself whatever price the law exacted for loyalty the punishment for disloyalty must be worse it was a matter of survival have you met his brother angus as well rathbone asked his eyebrows raised she stared at him as she would a snake yeah it was a qualified agreement made reluctantly there was warning in her voice that she would go little further rathbone smiled mr arbuthnot has testified that you called at his place of business and saw him on the day of his disappearance is he correct her face tightened with anger there was no way out yeah why wot why he repeated why did you call upon angus stonefield cos caleb told me ter what passed between you nuffinkl i mean what did you say to him and he to you oh i don member it was a lie and everyone knew it it was there in the low mumble from the onlookers the slight shaking of the heads of the jurors the quick shift of the judges eyes from selina to rathbone selina saw it too but she assumed she had beaten rathbone rathbone pushed his hands into his pockets and looked at her blandly then if i were to say that you gave him a message that caleb wished to see him urgently that day and wished him to go immediately to the folly house tavern or the artichoke you would not be able to recall differently i her eyes blazed with defiance but there was no way out she was loath to entrap herself by argument or excuses which might rebound on her again she had been caught once perhaps that has stirred your memory rathbone suggested carefully ironing all the sarcasm out of his voice she said nothing but he had scored the point and he knew it from the jurys faces once she had established that she was prepared to evade or even lie to protect caleb it would prejudice anything she might say in his defense did you see angus stonefield later that day miss berries rathbone resumed she said nothing you must answer the question miss berries the judge warned if you do not i shall hold you in contempt of court that means that i can sentence you to prison until such time as you do answer and of course the jury are free to take any meaning they will from your silence do you understand me i saw im she said huskily and swallowed hard she stared straight ahead of her her head rigid so she could not even in the corner of her eye see caleb leaning over the railing of the dock his eyes on her rathbone affected interest as if he had no idea what she was going to say now there was total silence in the room at the folly house tavern she said sullenly what was he doing nuffink nothing e were standin around waitin fer caleb i spose thats were i told im ter be did you see caleb arrive also no but he told you earlier that he intended to be there not that time special thats where e said angus were to go for im always same place i didnt even see em together an i never saw em quarrel an thats the truth whether yer believe me or not i do believe you maam rathbone conceded but did you see caleb later on that day no i didnt one of the jurors shook his head another coughed into his handkerchief there was a rustling in the public benches rathbone turned away from the witness stand and his glance caught ebenezer goodes and saw him smile ruefully the case still hovered on the knifes edge but however unwillingly selinas evidence might be all it needed to topple it against caleb goode had very little with which to fight and they both knew it it would be a desperate gamble to call caleb himself even goode could not know what he might say there was a recklessness in the man a well of emotion too dangerous to tap rathbone turned the full circle before he faced selina again his eye caught hester near the front of the crowd and beside her enid ravensbrook looking pale and tense her face was strained with pity and the terrible waiting for the evidence to unfold as they came nearer and nearer to the moment when the hatred and jealousy of years must finally explode in murder caleb had already left home when she had married ravensbrook but she must still have inherited some feeling for him sensitive to her husbands long involvement to all he had given the years of struggle and finally the failure certainly she knew both angus and genevieve and was only too familiar with their loss milo ravensbrook sat on the other side of her his face so pale he seemed bloodless his dark eyes and level brows like black gashes on graywhite wax could a man see a more hideously painful revelation than that one child had killed the other he would be left with nothing and yet from the moment that anguss bloodstained clothes had been identified was there anything else they could have done any other course to follow enid turned to him her expression a mixture of anguish and almost an expectation of hurt as if she already knew he would reject such intimacy yet she could not help offering herself she put her hand on his arm even from where rathbone stood he could see how thin her fingers were it was only three and a half weeks since she had passed the crisis of her illness ravensbrook remained frozen as if he was not even aware of her there was silence in the room rathbone looked again at selina miss herries when did you see caleb again consider your answer very carefully an error in judgment now could cost you very dearly ebenezer goode half rose to his feet then decided an objection would achieve nothing the question had been too carefully worded to be considered a threat he sank back in the crowd someone dropped an umbrella rustled for an instant then left it where it lay miss herries selina stared at rathbone and he remained fixed on her gaze as if he could see into her brain read her fears and weigh them one against another the judge moved his hands then refolded them next day selina said almost inaudibly did he mention angus no her voice was a whisper will you please speak so we may hear you miss herries the judge directed no not at all rathbone pressed no he didnt say that he had met him no and you didnt ask rathbone allowed his eyebrows to shoot up did you not care you surprise me was it not the money for the rent of your home which angus was to bring surely that was a matter of the utmost importance to you i took the message she said flatly wot else werent up ter me ter ask and he didnt tell you reassure you for example how boorish perhaps he was in too foul a temper this time ebenezer goode did rise my lord my learned friend is making suggestions for which he has had no grounds and they are the merest speculation yes yes the judge agreed mr rathbone please do not lead your witness with such remarks you know better than that ask your question and have done my lord miss herries was caleb in a bad temper when you saw him again no just a little hurt hurt she said suspiciously stiff bruised yeah well she hesitated weighing how far she dare lie her glance slid once towards caleb then quickly away again she was frightened weighing one danger against another rathbone was sorry for her but he could not relent there were facets of his professional skills he did not enjoy it would be overdoing it to draw the jurys attention to her dilemma they had seen calebs face they knew her position better to allow them to deduce it than to patronize them risk having them think he was too eager i do not ask you to tell us how he obtained any injuries he may have received miss herries he helped her if you do not know simply say whether he was injured in any way or not you are surely in a circumstance to know he was your lover e were urt yeah she conceded but e didnt say ow an i dont ask theres lots o fights in limeouse an blackwall fights any night an most days caleb often got urt but e never killed no one far as i know her chin came up a fraction not that anyone got the best of im neither i can well believe it maam i have heard suggestions he is a very powerful man with an excellent skill in defending himself and considerable physical courage she stood a little straighter her head high thats right no one beats caleb stone her pride caught him with a knife stab of pity and he knew almost without letting his eyes stray to the jury that it was also the last fragment needed to tip the thin balance of belief towards conviction thank you miss herries he turned to goode your witness sir goode rose slowly as if he were tired uncurling his long legs he ambled across the open space of the floor and stopped before the witness stand looking up at her ali miss herries allow me to ask you a few questions they will not take long he smiled at her dazzlingly from the look in her face she may well have found that more unnerving than rathbones elegance nor prove painful he added yeah excellent im most obliged he tucked his thumbs under the armholes of his waistcoat beneath his gown did caleb tell you why he was prepared to ask his brother for money considering the feeling between them or indeed why his brother was willing to give it no e dont tell me things like that int my busness angus always gave im money if e wanted it guilt i reckon guilt for what miss herries was angus responsible for calebs misfortune i dunno she said sharply mebbe e was mebbe e poisoned the old mans mind agin caleb e were all goodygoody butter wouldnt melt in is mouf ow do i know what e felt i jus know e came any time caleb sent for im i see and was angus at all apprehensive when you gave him calebs message wot i apologize did he seem to you to be worried or fearful was he reluctant to go no well i spose e didnt want ter leave his busness but he never did that aint ard tunderstandood waana leave a nice warm office uptarn ter go ter some public ouse on the isle of dogs no one indeed goode agreed but beyond that natural reluctance he was as usual yeah and he had often met with caleb before yeah he did not for example offer to give you the money to save himself the journey to limehouse and in fact the necessity to see caleb at all no she did not add anything further but there was surprise in her face as well as antagonism goode hesitated seemed to consider a further question then discard it rathbone had a sudden flash of intuition as to what it was he determined to ask it himself on reexamination goode had led the way for him and when you saw caleb the day after goode resumed he made no reference to angus is that right yeah e dint say nuffin at all abaht im her face was pale rathbone was sure she was lying he looked across at the jury and saw reflected in their faces exactly what he felt no one believed her do you know if he killed his brother miss herries goodes voice cut across the silence there was a gasp of indrawn breath around the room caleb let out a short cry of derision almost like a bark no selina said shaking her head from side to side as if to be rid of something that caught at her no i dont know nuffin like that an you got no right to say as e did im not saying it miss herries goode assured her i am doing my utmost to persuade these gentlemen herehe waved his hand in the general direction of the jurythat there is no proof whatever even that angus is deadno absolute proof at alllet alone that they can hold his brother responsible for it there are a dozen other possibilities as to where angus stonefield may beand why rathbone stood up the judge sighed mr goode this is not the time to address the jury either directly or indirectly as you well know if you have any further questions for this witness please put them to her if not then allow mr rathbone to redirect if he so chooses of course goode bowed with formal if rather ostentatious courtesy and returned to his seat mr rathbone rathbone faced selina he smiled you just confirmed to my learned friend that caleb had often met with angus before and you were aware of this you also said that on the occasion we are specifically referring to the last day on which angus stonefield was ever seen that caleb was not in a temper any different from usual yeah she had already admitted as much and it seemed a favorable thing to acknowledge yet he sent for his brother and his brother dropped all his matters of business and cameto a public tavern on the isle of dogsso far as you know simply to pass over money which since it was for your rent he could easily have given to you and as you say who would willingly leave a warm office in the west end to the judge did not wait for goode mr rathbone you are retracing old ground please if you have a point come to it yes my lord i do have a point indeed miss herries you are telling us that for caleb to send for his brother for him to come and for caleb to be bruised stiff injured scarred perhaps bleeding in places but nonetheless jubilant having won a fight was a perfectly normal pattern of behavior for him and you have also said no one beats caleb stone that no one must include his unfortunate brother who has not been seen since only his bloodstained clothes have been found on the isle of dogs selina said nothing her face was as white as the paper on which the court clerk wrote in the dock caleb stone started to laugh wildly it soared in pitch and volume until it seemed to fill the room and reverberate from the wooden paneling the judge banged his gavel and was ignoredit was no more than an instrument beating time to the uproar he demanded silence and no one even heard him calebs hysterical laughter drowned out everything else the gaolers grabbed at him and he flung them off in the gallery journalists scrambled over each other to get out and grab the first hansom to race to fleet street and the extra editions enid rose to her feet amid the clamor looking one way then the other she tried to speak to ravensbrook but he ignored her staring at the dock as if transfixed he did not seem to see what was in front of him the frenzy and the farce only some terrible truth within him the judge was still banging his gavel a sharp thin rhythmic sound without meaning rathbone waved his hands to indicate that selina herries might be excused she swiveled around and descended the steps to the floor her head always turned towards caleb finally the gaolers overpowered him and he was led down some semblance of order was restored redfaced the judge adjourned the court outside in the corridor rathbone considerably shaken ran into ebenezer goode looking shocked and unhappy didnt think you could do it my dear fellow he said with a sigh but from the jurys faces i would wager now that youll get a conviction never had a client been so hellbent on his own destruction rathbone smiled but it was a gesture of amiability not of any pleasure his victory would bring a professional satisfaction but it was curiously devoid of personal triumph he had thought caleb stone totally despicable now his feelings were less clear the force of his instability the awareness of his emotions in the room even though he had not yet spoken became tangled in his judgments and he found himself awaiting his testimony with far less certainty of the outcome than goode lord and lady ravensbrook were standing a few yards from them she looked ashen but determined not to give way she was supported by her husband hester must have been temporarily dismissed perhaps to summon the car riage ravensbrook did not hesitate to interrupt goode i must speak with you goode turned politely and then he saw enid his expression altered instantly to one of amazement and concern apparently he had not met her but he surmised who she was my dear lady you must still be far from recovered please permit me to find you some more comfortable place to wait ravensbrook recognized his own omission with a flicker of anger and introduced them hastily goode bowed not taking his eyes from enids face in the circumstances the quality of his attention was a compliment and she smiled in spite of herself thank you mr goode i think i shall wait in my carriage i am sure miss latterly will return in a few moments and i shall be quite all right until then it is very kind of you to think of it not at all he assured her we cannot permit you to stand even until your carriage should come i shall fetch a chair and so saying he ignored ravensbrook and rathbone marched some ten yards away and returned carrying a large wooden chair which he placed near the wall and assisted enid into it the matter dealt with ravensbrook turned to goode again ignoring rathbone although he could not have failed to know who he was is there any hope he said bluntly his face was still stiff and blurred with shock rathbone moved a step away in courtesy although he was not beyond earshot of finding the truth goode raised his eyebrows i doubt it my lord certainly not of proving it i daresay what happened to angus will always be a matter of surmise if you mean what will the verdict be at present i think a conviction of some sort is not unlikely although whether it will be murder or manslaughter i would not venture to say he took a deep breath we must first hear calebs story that may now be different from earlier he has heard evidence which may prompt him to speak more openly of the meeting with his brother you intend to call him ravensbrooks body was rigid his skin like paper do you not fear he will damn himself out of his own mouth if he has not already done so i ask you in compassion not to if you leave it as it is plead a quarrel which got out of hand on his behalf then the jury may return manslaughter or even less perhaps only the conceding of a death hope flickered boldly in his dark eyes that would surely be in the best interests of your client he is quite apparently insane perhaps the only place for him is bedlam goode considered it for several moments possibly he conceded pulling down his brows his voice very quiet but the jury is not well disposed towards him his own behavior has seen to that bedlam is not a place i would send a dog i think i must give him the opportunity to tell the story himself there is always far less likelihood of the jury believing it if he will not tell it himself rathbone will destroy him ravensbrook accused in a sudden flair of temper he will lose control of himself again if he is pressed and he is frightened then hell say anything simply to shock i will make the judgment when i have spoken with him goode promised although i am inclined to agree with you thank god of course it is his decision goode added the man is being tried for his life if he wishes to speak then he must be allowed cannot you as his legal adviser protect him from himself ravensbrook demanded i can advise him that is all i cannot deny him the opportunity to speak in his own defense i see ravensbrook glanced at rathbones profile then i think he has very little chance since i am his only living relative and once he is convicted i may have no further opportunity to speak with him i would like to see him alone today at least he is still an innocent man of course goode agreed quickly would you like me to arrange it for you i shall seek your help if it is necessary ravensbrook answered i am obliged for your offer he glanced at rathbone then at enid on her chair she looked at him in a long curious pleading gaze as if there were a question she did not know how to frame if he understood there was no reflection of it in his expression or in his bearing he did not offer any further explanation wait for me in the carnage he told her you will be more comfortable there miss latterly will be back in a few moments and without anything further he took his leave walking rapidly towards the stairs down to the cells some twenty minutes later rathbone was outside on the entrance steps to the street talking to monk who had just arrived ebenezer goode came striding down his hair flying his face ashen he pushed past a clerk almost knocking the man off his feet what is it rathbone said with a sudden upsurge of fear whats happened man you look terrible goode seized him by the arm half turning him around hes dead its all over hes dead whos dead monk demanded what are you talking about caleb his voice was hoarse caleb is dead he cant be rathbone knew even as he said it that it was stupid he was trying to deny reality because it was ugly and he did not want to believe it how monk asked cutting across rathbone what happened did he kill himself he swore viciously clenching his fist in the air how could they be so damnably stupid although i dont know why i care better the poor devil does it himself than drag it out to the long torture of a judicial hanging i should be glad he said the words between his teeth hard and guttural why cant i rathbone looked from monk to goode the same conflicting emotions tore inside him he should have been grateful caleb had in effect confessed rathbone had succeeded the duke of wellingtons words rang in his ears about the next most terrible thing to a battle lost being a battle won there was no taste of victory whatever it wasnt suicide goode said shakily ravensbrook went in to see him as he asked apparently caleb was concemed he was going to be found guilty he said he wanted to write a statement perhaps it was a confession or an indication of something who knows ravensbrook came out for a quill and a paper for him he took them back in apparently the quill was poor he found his penknife to recut it rathbone felt sick as if he knew the words before they came caleb suddenly lurched forward seized the knife and attacked ravensbrook goode said his eyes going from rathbone to monk and back again rathbone was startled it was not what he had thought after all they fought goode went on poor ravensbrook is cut quite badly god help him rathbone said quietly that was not the ending i wanted but perhaps it is not the worst thank you goode thank you for telling me chapter rathbone was stunned by the news it was preposterous even if not all the elements were tragic he had never known such a thing to happen before certainly not in this manner monk was standing stockstill his face dark come on rathbone said gently its all over monk did not move no it isnt i dont understand it rathbone laughed abruptly do you ever do any of us if you thought he was going to tell you what he did with angus or why he killed him now instead of sometime in the past years you were dreaming the wretched man was mad dear god wasnt that evidence enough jealousy had driven him insane what more is there to understand why he attacked ravensbrook now monk replied turning and standing to climb the steps back up what good would it have done him none at all rathbone said impatiently following rapidly after him what good did killing angus do him nothing except release his hatred perhaps he felt the same way about ravensbrook he had nothing to lose cant hang him twice but they werent necessarily going to hang him at all monk said sharply striding through the door and into the hallway goode hadnt even begun hes a damned clever lawyer they passed a group of darksuited men talking quietly and almost bumped into a clerk hurrying in the opposite direction we know caleb killed angus monk went on or at least i do because i heard him admit it even boast about it but thats not proof he still had hope maybe he didnt know that im a damned clever lawyer too rathbone said at his elbow is this what you wanted monk demanded matching rathbone pace for pace along the corridor coattails flying cant prove he was guilty so deceive the poor devil into committing another murder right there in his cell so we can hang him for that without a quibble even ebenezer goode couldnt defend him from that it was on the edge of rathbones tongue to give back an equally bitter response then he looked more closely at monk the confusion in his face it was not all anger there was doubt and pain in it as well what he demanded swinging to a stop are you deaf i said monk began i heard what you said rathbone snapped it was sufficiently stupidi shall ignore it i am trying to fathom what you meant something puzzles you something more than simply the questions we were asking before and now we shall almost certainly never answer ravensbrook said caleb attacked him monk began walking again and he fought him off in the struggle caleb was killed accidentally i heard it rathbone agreed going down the steps towards the cells why what are you thinking that it was actually suicide and ravensbrook is covering it up why they were obliged to walk in single file for some distance then at the bottom monk caught up again it makes no sense rathbone went on what reason could he have the wretched man is dead and guilty by implication if not proof what would he be saving him or any one legally hes innocent monk said with a scowl not yet proven guilty whatever we know you and i we dont count for gods sake monk the public knows and as soon as the court reconvenes theyll have him for trying to kill ravensbrook as well but as a suicide hed be buried in unhallowed ground monk pointed out they were just outside the main door to the cells this way hes not convicted of anything only charged people can believe whatever they want hell go down in posterity as an innocent man i should think if its a lie at all rathbone argued it is more likely ravensbrook doesnt want to be accused of deliberately allowing the man to take his own life morally at any time legally while hes in custody and on trial point monk conceded thank you rathbone acknowledged i think it is most probable he is simply giving a mixture of what he knows in the confusion and what he hopes happened he is bound to be very shocked and grieved poor devil monk did not reply but knocked sharply on the door they were permitted in with some reluctance rathbone had to insist in his capacity as an officer of the court and monk was permitted largely by instinct of the gaoler who knew him from the past and was used to obeying him it was a small anteroom for the duty gaolers to wait ravensbrook was half collapsed on a wooden hardbacked chair his hair and clothes were disheveled and there was blood splattered on his arms and chest even on his face he seemed in the deepest stages of shock his eyes sunk in their sockets unfocused he was breathing through his mouth gasping and occasionally swallowing and gulping air his body was rigid and he trembled as if perished with cold one gaoler stood holding a rolledup handkerchief to a wound in ravensbrooks chest a second held a glass of water and tried to persuade him to drink from it but he seemed not even to hear the man are you the doctor the gaoler with the handkerchief demanded looking at monk in his gown and wig rathbone was instantly recognizable for what he was no but theres probably a nurse still on the premises if you send someone to look for her immediately monk replied her name is hester latterly and shell be with lady ravensbrook in her carriage nursell be no use the gaoler said desperately nobody about needs nursin for gawds sake look at it an army nurse monk corrected his impression you might have to go a mile or more to find a doctor and shell be more used to this sort of thing than most doctors around here anyway go and get her dont stand around arguing the man went perhaps glad to escape monk turned to look at ravensbrook studied his face for a moment then abandoned the idea and spoke instead to the remaining gaoler what happened he asked tell us precisely and in exact order as you remember it start when lord ravensbrook arrived he did not question who monk was or what authority he had to be demanding explanations the tone in monks voice was sufficient and the gaoler was overwhelmingly relieved to hand over responsibility to someone else anyone at all is lordship came in wi permission from the ead warder for im ter visit wi the prisoner he responded im bein a relative like an the prisoner lookin fit ter be sent down then like as not topped where is the head warder rathbone interrupted goin ter speak wi the judge the gaoler replied dunno wot appens next never ad no one killed in the middle o a trial afore leastways not while i were ere he shivered he had taken the glass of water theoretically for ravensbrook and it slurped at the edges as his hand shook rathbone took it from him and set it down so you opened the cell and allowed lord ravensbrook in monk prompted yes sir an o course i locked it beind im the prisoner bein charged wi a violent crime like it were necessary of course it was monk agreed then what happened nuffink for bout five minutes or so you waited out here o course and after five minutes is lordship lord ravensbrook e knocked on the door an asked ter come out i thought it was kind o quick but it int none o my business so i let im aht but e werent through he was still holding the rolledup handkerchief at ravensbrooks chest and the blood was seeping through his fingers e said as the prisoner wanted ter write is last statement an ad i any paper and a pen an ink he went on his voice hoarse well o course i dont ave it in me pocket like but i told im as i could send for em which i did int that right me lord he looked down at ravensbrook for confirmation but ravensbrook seemed almost unaware of him you sent for them who did you send monk pressed jimson the other bloke on watch wi me the feller wot yer sent for the nurse and you locked the cell door o course i locked it there was indignation in his voice and lord ravensbrook waited out here with you yeah yeah e did did he say anything ravensbrook neither moved on his chair nor made any sound wot ter me the gaoler said with surprise wot would a lordship talk ter the likes o me abaht you waited in silence monk asked yeah werent long three or four minutes then jimson came back wi pen an paper an ink i gave em ter is lordship opened the cell door again and e went in an i locked it and then the man screwed up his face in concentration im trying ter think as if i eard anythink but i cant recall as i did i should lave why well there must a bin summink mustnt there he said reasonably cos arter a few minutes like is lordship banged on the door an shouted fer elp shouted real loud like e were in terrible troublewhich o course e were he took a deep breath still staring at monk so me an jimson we both went to the door immediate like jimson unlocked it an i stood ready not knowin what ter expec and what did you find he looked over towards the cell door about ten feet away and still very slightly ajar is lordship staggerin an beatin on the doors wi is fists he answered his voice strained an e were all covered in blood like e is now he glanced at ravensbrook then away again the prisoner were in an leap on the floor wi even more blood on im i cant remember wot i said nor wot jimson said neither e elped is lordship out an i went ter the prisoner he kept his eyes fixed on monks face as if to block out what was in his mind i knelt down by im an reached for is and like ter see if e were alive i couldnt feel nothin although ter be onest wif yer sir i dunno as ow i werent shakin so much i wouldnt a knowed anyway but i think e were dead already i never seen so much blood in me life i see monks eye strayed involuntarily towards the halfopen cell door he forced his attention back to the man in front of him and then what the gaoler looked at ravensbrook but ravensbrook gave him no prompt whatsoever in fact from the fixed expression on his face he might not even have heard what they said we asked is lordship what ad appened the gaoler said unhappily although anyone could see as thered bin a terrible fight an someow the prisonerd got the worst o it and when you asked lord ravensbrook what did he say e said as the prisonerd leaped on im and attacked im when e ad the penknife out ter recut the nib and though ed done is best ter fight im off in the struggle ed got isself stabbed an it were all over in a matter o seconds caught the vein in is throat and whoosh gom he swallowed hard his concentration on monk intense don get me wrong sir i wouldnt never ave had it appen but maybe theres some justice in it dont deserve ter get away wi munlerin is bruvver like no one do but i ates an anging jimson says as im soft but it int the way for no man ter go thank you monk did not volunteer an opinion but a certain sense of his agreement was in his silence and the absence of censure in his voice at last monk turned to ravensbrook and spoke clearly and with emphasis lord ravensbrook will you please tell us exactly what happened it is most important sir ravensbrook looked up very slowly focusing on monk with difficulty like a man wakening from a deep sleep i beg your pardon monk repeated his words oh yes of course he drew in his breath and let it out silently im sorry for several more seconds he said nothing until rathbone was about to prompt him then at last he spoke he was in a very strange mood he said slowly speaking as if his lips were stiff his tongue unwilling to obey him his voice was curiously flat rathbone had seen it before in people suffering shock at first he seemed pleased to see me ravensbrook went on almost relieved we spoke about trivialities for a few minutes i asked him if he needed anything if there was anything i could do for him he swallowed and rathbone could see his throat tighten straightaway he said that there was ravensbrook was speaking to monk ignoring rathbone he wanted to write a statement i thought perhaps he was going to make a clean breast of it some kind of confession for genevieves sake tell her where anguss body was he was not looking directly at monk but at some distance of the mind some region of thought or hope and was that what he wanted rathbone asked although he held no belief that it could have been it was only a last wild chance that he might have said something but what could it matter except that genevieve would have some clearer idea and was that good or bad perhaps ignorance was more merciful ravensbrook looked at him for the first time no he said thoughtfully no i dont think he even intended to write anything but i believed him i came out and asked for the materials which were brought me i took them back in he grasped the pen from me put it in the inkwell which i had placed on the table then made an attempt to write i think he forced it then he looked up at me and said the nib was blunt and had divided would i recut it he moved his shoulders very slightly not quite a shrug of course i agreed he gave it to me i wiped it clean so i could see what i was doing and then i took out my knife opened it no one in the room moved the gaoler seemed mesmerized there was no sound of the outer world the courthouse beyond the heavy iron door ravensbrook looked back at monk again his eyes dark and full of nightmare then almost as if closing curtains within his mind he looked just beyond him his voice was a little highpitched as if he could not open his throat the next moment i felt a ringing blow and i was forced back against the wall and caleb was on top of me he took a deep breath we struggled for several moments i did all i could to free myself but he had an extraordinary strength he seemed determined to kill me and it was all i could do to force the knife away from my throat i made a tremendous effort i suppose seeing the nearness of death in the blade i dont know exactly how it occurred he jerked back slipped and missed his footing somehow and fell pulling me on top of him rathbone tried to visualize it the fear the violence the confusion it was not difficult when i freed myself and managed to rise to my feet ravensbrook went on he was lying there with the knife in his throat and blood pouring from the wound there was nothing i could do god help him at least he is at some sort of peace now hell be spared the he took another long deep breath and let it out in a sigh the judicial process rathbone glanced at monk and saw the same look of distress in his face and also the knowledge that there was no retreat or evasion possible thank you monk acknowledged ravensbrook then with rathbone behind him walked over and pushed the cell door wider and went inside caleb stone was lying on the floor in a sheet of blood it lay in a scarlet tide around his head and shoulders the penknife a beautiful silver engraved thing was lying upside down against his neck as if it had fallen out of the wound with its own weight there was no question that he was dead the beautiful green eyes were open and quite blind there was in his face a look of resignation as if he had at last let go of something which was both a possession and a torture and the ease of it had surprised him monk looked for something to tell him some fact beyond that which ravensbrook or the gaoler had said and saw nothing there were no contradictions no suggestions of anything additional anything unexplained by the account of a simple stupid piece of violence the only question was had he been impulsive in a sudden overwhelming rage perhaps like the rage that had killed angus or had it been a deliberately planned way of committing suicide before the hangman could take his life in the slow exquisite mindtorture of conviction sentence and hanging he turned to rathbone and saw an understanding of the same question in his face before either of them could form it in words there was a noise behind them the heavy clank of an iron bolt in a lock and then hesters voice monk swung around and came out of the cell almost pushing rathbone forward into the outer room lord ravensbrook hester glanced once at the gaoler still holding the bloodsoaked handkerchief against ravensbrooks chest then moved forward and dropped to her knees where are you hurt she said as if he had been a childquite soothingly but with the voice of authority he raised his head and stared at her where are you hurt she repeated putting her hand gently over the gaolers and moving the kerchief away very slowly no gush of blood followed it in fact it seemed to have clotted and dried already please allow me to take your coat off she asked i must see if you are still bleeding it seemed an unnecessary comment there was so much blood he must still be losing it at a considerable rate should you miss jimson asked he had returned with her and was staring at ravensbrook dubiously might make it worse better wait till the doctor gets ere es bin sent fer take it off hester ignored jimson and started to pull on ravensbrooks shoulders to ease the jacket away from him he did nothing and she moved his arm aside from where he had been holding it across his chest take the other one she ordered monk it will slip away if you hold it properly he did as he was bid and gently she pulled the coat off leaving it in monks hands the shirt beneath was surprisingly white and not nearly as badly stained as monk had expected indeed there were only four marks that he could see one on the front of the left shoulder one on the left forearm and two on the right side of the chest none of them were bright scarlet or puddled in blood only the one on the shoulder that he had been holding was still shining wet doesnt look too bad hester said dispassionately she turned to the first gaoler i dont suppose you have any bandages no i thought not have you cloths of any sort the man hesitated right she nodded then take off your shirt it will have to do ill use the tails she smiled very dryly and yours too mr rathbone i think i need a white one she ignored monk and his immaculate linen even in this contingency she was apparently aware of his finances rathbone drew in a sharp breath and thoughts of voluminous petticoats floated into his mind and out again he obeyed have you any spirits she asked the gaoler a little brandy for restorative purposes perhaps she looked at ravensbrook have you a hip flask my lord i dont require brandy he said with a very slight shake of the head just do what is necessary woman i wasnt going to give it to you she answered have you any he stared at her with seeming incomprehension yer feelin faint miss the gaoler said with concern the shadow of a smile touched her lips no thank you i wanted to clean the wounds water will do if thats all there is but brandy would have been better rathbone passed her the glass of water ravensbrook had declined monk moved forward and fished in ravensbrooks jacket and found the flat silver engraved flask opened it and set it where she could reach it in silence they watched her work cleaning away the blood first with cloths from the gaolers coarse shirt then with a little brandy which must have stung when it was applied from the involuntary oath escaping ravensbrook and the clenched teeth and gulp of pain but even monk could see that the wounds were not deep more gashes and cuts than genuine stabs she then bound them with bandages made from almost all of rathbones fine egyptian cotton shirt which she tore with great abandon and considerable dexterity and monk thought not a little satisfaction he glanced at rathbone and saw him wince as the cloth ripped thank you ravensbrook said stiffly when she was finished i am obliged to you again miss latterly you are extremely efficient where is my wife in your carriage my lord she replied i daresay she will be at home by now i took the liberty of instructing the coachman to take her she may become ill if she sits waiting in this chill i am sure someone will find you a hansom immediately yes he said after a moment of course he looked at rathbone if you need me for anything i can be found at my home i cannot think what else there is to do now or to say i assume the judge will make whatever remarks he believes necessary and that will be an end to it good day gentlemen he stood up and walking very uprightly and with a slight sway made his way to the door oh he turned and looked at rathbone i presume i may have the liberty of giving him a decent burial after all he has not been found guilty of anything and i am his only relative he swallowed painfully i can see no reason why not rathbone agreed suddenly touched by a sense of overwhelming loss deeper than mere death a bereavement of the spirit of the past as well as the future i will attend to the formalities my lord if you wish yes yes thank you ravensbrook accepted good day and he went out of the door now no longer locked it swung to heavily behind him hester looked towards the cell you dont need to rathbone stepped in front of her its most unpleasant thank you oliver for your sensitivity she said bleakly but i have seen far more dead men than you have i shall be quite all right and she walked in brushing his shoulder he had replaced his jacket and it looked odd with no shirt beneath inside she stood still and looked down at the crumpled form of caleb stone she stared at him for several seconds before she frowned a little then with a deep sigh straightened up and came out again her eyes met rathbones what are you going to do she asked quietly go home and get a shirt he replied with a twisted smile there isnt anything else we can do my dear theres no case to prosecute or defend anymore if mrs stonefield wishes me to act for her in the matter of for mally acknowledging her husbands death then of course i will do so first we must deal with this matter which i imagine the judge will do when court reconvenes tomorrow morning is there something which worries you monk said suddenly looking at her closely what is it i i dont think i am quite certain she frowned in concentration but seemed unwilling to add more then come to my house and dine rathbone invited her and included monk with a gesture that is if you do not have to return with lady ravensbrook or go back to limehouse no she shook her head the typhoid is past its worst in fact there have been no new cases for over two days and many of those who are left are beginning to recover i i would like to think further on caleb stone before even considering it they ate a surprisingly good meal rathbones house was warm and quiet furnished in the discreet fashion of half a century earlier the excellent chair lines of the regency it made for comfort and a sense of space hester had not thought she would wish to eat at all but when the meal was placed before her and she had not had to take any part in its preparation she found that she was after all quite hungry when the last course was completed rathbone sat back and looked across at her well what is it that worries you are you afraid it was suicide and if it was does it really matter who would it help to prove it even if we could why would he commit suicide now she asked fumbling through the ideas jumbled in her mind the memory of the wounds she had seen and the small very sharp knife almost like a scalpel lying with the very end of its blade in calebs neck and its silver handle in the sheet of blood beside him his defense had not even begun perhaps he had no hope it could succeed monk suggested you dont believe that rathbone said instantly could he have killed himself in remorse perhaps hearing the evidence somehow brought it back to him or more likely it was seeing ravensbrook and knowing the grief it had brought him and of course genevieve genevieve monks eyebrows rose he loathed her she was part of all that he despised in angus the comfortable pious wife with her smiling complacent face and her total ignorance of the tragedy and reality of the kind of life he led the poverty and the hardship and the dirt you dont know anything about genevieve do you hester looked from one to the other of them and saw the blank incomprehension in their faces no of course you dont she grew up in limehouse rathbone was astonished he sat quite still except for a slight parting of his lips monk on the other hand gave a snort of disbelief and moved his hand sharply to dismiss the idea as preposterous knocking his elbow against his empty wineglass and clinking it against its neighbor yes she did hester said sharply ive just spent nearly a month in limehouse and i know the people she grew up with they remember her her name used to be ginny motson monk looked astonished his face was almost expressionless with surprise i assume you wouldnt say that unless you were sure beyond question rathbone said gravely this is not gossip is it no of course it isnt hester answered the scene over the mistake clear in her mind she told me herself when she realized i had guessed they sat silently for several minutes turning over those new and amazing thoughts the butler came in and removed the last of the dishes and brought the port offering it to monk and rathbone he bowed civilly to hester but disregarded her otherwise she puzzled him and his uncertainty showed in his face it would explain a number of things monk conceded at last her dread of poverty above all no woman who had not known it should fear it as she does i thought it was simple love of comfort im glad it isnt hester smiled she knew monks vulnerability where certain women were concerned he had been a startlingly poor judge of character before but she did not refer to that it was a precisely delicate subject just now then was it angus or perhaps caleb who taught her to carry herself like a lady and speak like one rathbone mused if it were caleb then that may have been the cata lyst which turned his rivalry with angus into hatred she met angus when he came to see caleb and perhaps she fell in love with him or less attractively saw a chance to get out of the poverty and squalor of limehouse into something far better and she took it and you think caleb might have loved her hester said raising her eyebrows so much that after he had killed angus for having taken her away from him he now felt such remorse on looking at her face in the courtroom that he killed himself halfway through the trial and lord ravensbrook allowed him to and is prepared to conceal it no she shook her head sharply she told me she was never calebs woman and i believe her she had no reason to lie and i dont think she did anyway it makes no sense if what you are saying were true he would have written whatever it was he sent for the paper and ink to say unless of course you think lord ravensbrook took it but why would he rathbone regarded his port shining ruby red in the candlelight but did not touch it youre right he conceded it doesnt make sense and i dont see caleb stone taking his own life out of remorse honestly monk added there was more than hatred in him i dont know what a terrible emotion that clawed at his heart or his belly or both but there was a wild humor in it a kind of pain that was far subtler than remorse and does it matter now he looked from one to the other of them but the shadow in his eyes and the sense of unhappiness in him answered the question more vividly than words could have done no one bothered to affirm it it was tangible in the air the quiet candlelight of the dinner table gleaming on unused silver and winking in the bloodred colors of the untouched port glasses if it was not suicide then either it was accident or murder rathbone stated he looked at hester was it exactly as ravensbrook said no she was quite positive it may have been an accident but if it was as he said then why didnt he cry out when caleb first attacked him he didnt rathbone said slowly he cant have and according to his own account he struggled with him for several moments seconds perhaps but there was obviously a struggle in which lord ravensbrook tried to save himself from injury monk took up the thread and was in principle successful his wounds are minor but caleb was killed by a freak mischance he pulled a face if caleb attacked him why did he not cry out straightaway hester asked i dont know in some desperate hope of ending the matter without the gaolers needing to know rathbone suggested it could be damning evidence if it were revealed in court and even if no one introduced it ravensbrooks injuries would allow the conclusion easily enough irrational in the circumstances monk argued people frequently are irrational hester said but i dont think they work out a chain of thought as complicated as that in the heat of an unexpected attack would you if you were leapt upon when you least thought of such a thing would you think of anything more than defending yourself if there were a weapon involved and the attacker were younger and stronger than you and you knew he had already killed one man and was in danger of being hanged so he had nothing to lose even if he were caught would you even think at all or just fight for your life rathbone bit his lip if caleb stone attacked me thered be nothing in my mind but surviving he admitted his face twisted but i am not his father monk shrugged but there was a tightness of wounded enthusiasm in his eyes when i was chasing him down the river i didnt think at all there was nothing in my mind but a blind determination to catch him i hardly even felt my own wrenches and bruises until afterwards rathbone looked at hester are you sure he didnt cry out almost immediately after the initial shock of the attack it might take a moment in time to ward him off and collect his wits he had six separate wounds she answered but they were all clean he may well have bruises come up in the next day or two as well and his clothes were torn a little as if in a struggle but caleb had only one real wound and that was the slash across his throat which killed him what are you saying rathbone leaned forward that ravensbrook was mistaken or that in some essential of importance he lied i think so yes i think he lied she answered very deliberately i just dont know why monk sipped his port looking from one to the other of them you mean there was a considerable struggle before he called out rathbone persisted what reason would he have if it was not suicide and not an accident then are you saying that ravensbrook murdered him why on earth should he not just to prevent him from being hanged thats absurd then there is something we dont know hester answered something which would make sense of it or if not sense at least something understandable to ones feelings people kill for various reasons rathbone said thoughtfully greed fear hatred if it is irrational then it may spring simply from emotion but if it is rational then it will be as a result of something that has happened and to prevent something else from happening to prevent some loss or pain to themselves or someone they love what could caleb do to ravensbrook apart from be hanged which could be a disgrace but he has already disgraced himself very thoroughly monk shook his head hester is right there is something crucial that we dont know perhaps havent even come close to he turned to rathbone what was going to happen next if caleb had lived the defense would have begun tomorrow rathbone replied slowly his concentration suddenly sharpening his wineglass ignored perhaps we need to speak with ebenezer goode i thought i knew what he was going to do but perhaps i dont monk stared at him what could he do plead insanity the best argument he has is that it was an accident that caleb didnt mean to kill him and then when he had he panicked either that or try to convince them there is not enough evidence to prove angus is dead at all and i dont think he will win with that then maybe thats it rathbone clenched his fists on the white tablecloth he was going to bring out some evidence to show angus was not the just and honorable man we suppose that would be worth killing him for to protect anguss name and genevieves perhaps to prevent caleb from telling some appalling truth about him that would be a reason do you think lord ravensbrook would kill caleb to protect genevieve monk looked skeptical i gathered from their behavior towards each other that their relationship was cool at best then to protect himself rathbone argued urgently leaning farther forward or protect angus or his memory of him after all he was the nearest to a son he had one can love a son in a strange passionate and possessive way as if he were part of oneself ive seen some very complex emotions between parent and child and caleb monk asked his lips drawn back in a hard smile god knows rathbone sighed perhaps it was to spare him the verdict and the hanging i wouldnt wish hanging on anyone its an appalling way to die its not the actual drop and the rope around the throat jerking tight and breaking the neck as the trap opens its the deliberate hourbyhour minutebyminute dragging it out to the appointed hour its a refinement of cruelty which degrades everyone involved then perhaps we should ask mr goode hester concluded if we want to know but do we yes monk said without hesitation i want to know even if i dont want to do anything about it rathbones eyes widened could you do that know and do nothing monk opened his mouth to reply then changed his mind he shrugged and drank the rest of his port looking at neither rathbone nor hester rathbone rang the bell and the butler appeared within seconds i want you to take a note to ebenezer goode straightaway rathbone ordered it is vital we meet with him before court sits again tomorrow i expect he will be at his home but if he is not it is worth pursuing him to wherever he is get your coat and ill have the note ready take a hansom the butler did not move a muscle his face remained as impassive as if rathbone had merely asked him to bring another bottle of port yes sir would that be the address in westbourne place sir yes rathbone stood up and make all haste it was over an hour and a half later when ebenezer goode strode in his coattails flapping behind him a broadbrimmed hat jammed on his head and a look of glittering expectation in his eyes well he said as soon as he was in the door he swept a bow to hester then ignored her staring at rathbone and monk what is it that possibly matters now that it cannot wait until tomorrow morning and allow me a decent dinner have you found a body yes and no rathbone indicated an easy chair they had retired to the withdrawing room and were relaxed in front of a brisk fire do you know miss hester latterly she of course knows you miss latterly how do you do goode bowed perfunctorily what the devil do you mean rathbone have you found angus stonefields body or not no we have not but calebs death may not be nearly as simple as we had supposed goode froze still halfway to the chair how in what way is ravensbrook more severely injured than they said goode sank into the chair no hester answered him a few very minor cuts on his upper arms and shoulders they will stay for a while but none of them is serious goode looked at her sharply miss latterly is a nurse monk said rather quickly she was in the crimea and has tended more wounded men than you have had cases she was close to the court fortunately and came to lord ravensbrooks assistance i see a flash of interest lit goodes expression do i take it from your tone of voice and your curious choice of words miss latterly that there is something more to your opinion than you have said it is simply this mr goode monk explained we can think of no explanation which fits all the facts therefore we feel that there must be some profoundly significant fact which we do not know goodes eyebrows shot up and you think i do he said incredulously i have no idea at all why caleb should attack lord ravensbrook he may well have hated him because he so obviously preferred angus and perhaps always had done but that is all rather obvious by the way what facts does that not fit he looked again at hester the fact that lord ravensbrook did not cry out until after he had sustained six very minor wounds she answered him and caleb had sustained one fatal slash across the jugular vein and was already dead he leaned forward staring at her intently are you suggesting maam that lord ravensbrook was a willing actor in calebs death either by suicide or by murder not quite we do not believe it likely caleb would have killed himself why should he his defense had not even begun she looked at him intently had he not some realistic chance of escaping conviction or at least conviction of anything worse than not reporting a fatal accident if i were defending himshe ignored goodes sharp start of amazementl should plead a fight in which angus had accidentally been killed perhaps fallen into the river hit his head and caleb had been afraid to report it since he could not prove what had happened and knowing the quarrel between them and his own reputation expected no one would believe him after all there is no witness to say anything differently goode leaned back in his chair and stretched his long legs would you indeed yes she said decisively wouldnt you a sudden dazzling smile broke across his face yes maam indeed i would especially after the weight of evidence produced by the prosecution i think trying to rebut it simply as not proven would be insufficient the jury do not like caleb stone and mrs stonefield has aroused a considerable sympathy was that what you intended rathbone demanded were you going to call caleb tomorrow of course goode answered i have no one else why what light can that throw upon his death none unless we knew what he was going to say monk spoke for the first time plainly was he going to say something about angus which it would have been worth killing him to keep secret ravensbrook goodes voice rose almost to falsetto you think lord ravensbrook murdered caleb in his cell to keep him silent obviously you dont rathbone said dryly so you cannot know of anything such as we suggest or else he does not know its effect monk could not let go so easily perhaps he knows what it is but not its meaning or what it could lead to he swiveled around to face goode what was he going to say goode bit his lip well with a normal client i would know the answer or i would not ask the question but with stone all i could do was guess certainly he told me he would say it was an accident that the hatred was mutual and he had no more destroyed angus than angus had wished to destroy him he crossed his legs and rested his elbows on the arms of his chair making a steeple of his fingers you must understand he spoke elliptically and in paradoxes and half the time he just laughed if i thought it would have helped him i would have pleaded the man mad he regarded them each in turn his face full of pity and question but who wants to spend his life in bedlam i think id rather be hanged he was at times eminently sane he was certainly highly intelligent and obviously well educated when he chose to he spoke beautifully at other times he sounded like any other ruffian from the isle of dogs so you dont really know what he would say rathbone concluded would you i only know what i intended to ask him what was that rathbone and monk said together about his quarrel with angus of course and what led up to it goode replied about angus monk clapped his hands on his knee he twisted around to look at hester then we must find out what it was he was going to say what their quarrel really was if we want to know if it was worth killing him for do we i do goode said instantly guilty or innocent he was my client if he was murdered for whatever reason i not only want to know i want to prove it to whom rathbone asked the court isnt going to sit while we search for angus stonefields youth its an unnatural death goode pointed out therell be a coroners inquest a formality rathbone answered ravensbrook will give his account the gaolers will confirm it the doctor will confirm the cause of death and it will be pronounced an unfortunate accident everyone will say what a shame and think what a relief the matter will be closed and they will proceed to the next case it will take us days perhaps weeks to find the answer to whatever caleb was going to say which mattered so much monk said angrily cant you delay it a while perhaps rathbone looked across at goode what do you think we can try goodes voice lifted a little yes dammit we can certainly try he swung around miss latterly yes are you with us will you be as obstructive as possible as a witness to the events as vague and as contradictory as you may give them cause to think to question to wonder and to doubt of course she agreed but who will help monk to trace anguss life he cannot do it all alone well all do it until the inquest begins goode said simply by then surely we will have some idea of what it is we are seeking and from whom we must make the coroner believe there is a question of murder rathbone went on with rising eagerness if he thinks it is accident or suicide he will simply close the matter and darrunit that is going to be hard the only possible guilty party is ravensbrook and that wont sit easily with any coroner i know so we had better begin now monk said decisively he looked at goode i assume you will demand a full coroners inquest for your client and time to gather evidence he turned to rathbone and you will ask to represent the crown since you are the prosecutor he turned lastly to hester assuming her agreement without it crossing his mind to ask her you and i will begin to delve into anguss past we shall have to do it separately because there is no time to do it together you already know far more about genevieve than i do humor and selfmockery flickered across his face and you seem to be a far better judge of her character find out all you can of angus from her including where when and how they first met and all she knows of his relationship with caleb and ravensbrook this time the truth i shall go to ravensbrooks country home and see what i can learn there that is apparently where the brothers grew up what about the isle of dogs and limehouse rathbone asked ill go there hester said immediately after i have seen genevieve and perhaps titus niven goode was aghast you cannot go to limehouse miss latterly you have not the faintest idea what it is like or you would not entertain such a thought a gentlewoman like yourself would be i have been nursing the typhoid victims there for more than a month mr goode she said patiently i am in an excellent position to investigate in that quarter i daresay i know more of the individual residents than anyone else i could name you at least two hundred and tell you their families and their ancestors and i could tell you who they have lost recently they will talk to me as they would not to any of you that i can swear goode looked taken aback and considerably impressed i see perhaps i had better stick to my own last would i be presumptuous to be concerned for your safety not at all but probably unnecessarily worried she replied with a generous smile since caleb is dead no one is going to feel the same urgency tþ defend him now or fear the reprisals for betraying him by the truth rathbone rose to his feet i think a good nights sleep is called for before we begin let us meet here again in three days time and discuss what we have learned agreed goode rose also miss latterly may i find you a hansom and escort you as far as your home thank you she accepted graciously that would be most agreeable it has been a somewhat exhausting day chapter ebenezer goode woke very early the following morning unable to sleep any longer because his mind was churning over the extraordinary events of the preceding day he had not liked caleb stone indeed privately he had had little doubt that stone was guilty of the murder of his brother exactly as he was charged but there had been an extraordinary vitality in the man a core of passion which made his death unexpectedly hard to accept he lay with the blankets up to his chin turning over and over in his mind what rathbone had said and that odd fellow monk did the nurse really know what she was talking about was it conceivable that milo ravensbrook could either have willed calebs death or worse still have brought it about the thought was especially hideous when he remembered the remarkable face of lady ravensbrook the strength in it the power of feeling and imagination even ravaged by recent disease as it was there was something in her which awoke an extraordinary interest in him he found even while he was thinking of ways and means of discerning the truth and the near impossibility of proving it it was her features impressed on his closed eyelids her expression her mouth even her voice in his ears she had said barely a dozen words to him and every inflection remained he rose at half past six while it was still dark sent for water from a very surprised housemaid then shaved washed dressed and requested breakfast by quarter past seven his cook was not in the least amused and allowed it to be known he did not care in the slightest although good cooks were not easy to obtain he left the house at eight and walked briskly swinging his rather handsome stick and so deep in thought he passed a dozen acquaintances without seeing them and addressed two more by their fathers names by five minutes past nine he was outside ravensbrook house and saw his lordship leave in his own carriage goode mounted the steps and pulled the brass bell knob good morning sir the footman said with only the merest surprise good morning goode replied with a charming smile i am sorry to disturb the family so early but there are matters which cannot wait will you ask lady ravensbrook if i may speak with her i shall await her convenience naturally he passed over his card lady ravensbrook sir the footman was uncertain he had heard correctly it seemed absurd what could the lawyer have to say to lady ravensbrook if you please goode stepped inside and took off his coat and gave the man his hat he had no intention of being turned away and he was used to pressing his cause he had not become one of londons leading barristers by being easily refused or overridden thank you so good of you should i wait in the morning room yes he had been here only once before but he recalled it was the second door to the left he assumed consent and strode across the hall leaving the footman holding his clothes and with little choice but to accede he was obliged to wait nearly three quarters of an hour in the calm ornate room with its heavy curtains and shelves of books but when at last the door opened it was enid ravensbrook who stood there instantly he felt guilty she looked desperately afraid her lavendercolored gown hung on her in spite of the fact her maid had taken it in as much as was possible without recutting it altogether her hair had lost its luster and even the cleverest dressing could not conceal how much of it had come out in her illness her skin had no color at all but nothing could dim the intelligence in her eyes or the underlying strength in the lines of her cheekbones and jutting nose and jaw she looked at him with unwavering courage good morning mr goode my footman tells me you wish to speak with me she closed the door and walked quite slowly as if she were afraid of losing her balance he made half a gesture towards helping her and knew instantly that he should not he ached to reach out and give her his strength but it would be an intrusion he did not need to meet her eyes to know it she reached the nearest chair and sat down smiling at last thank you mr goode i am obliged to you i hate being an invalid now what is it you wish to say to me i presume it is to do with poor caleb i knew him very little and yet i cannot help grieving that he should die so although god knows perhaps the alternative was worse but you knew angus he said quickly with lord ravensbrooks regard for him and his own gratitude and affection he must have come here often it had been a statement as if he did not doubt it yet the look on her face was one of uncertainty and denial no she shook her head fractionally he came of course but not so very often and he seldom stayed long i am not sure if it was because genevieve felt a certain uncomfortableness here i think my husband overawed her to a degree he can be again she hesitated and he had a sudden sharp perception that it was not the words she was struggling with nor even if she should express the thought to him but the thought itself it was something she had long avoided facing because of its pain he was stunned by how much it distressed him he hesitated perhaps it was not worth pursuing at such cost it could all be left to the coroner to cover with polite decencies but the doubt lasted only a moment he could not live with such cowardice and it was not worthy of her he smiled please maam tell me the truth as you feel it as you saw it it is not a time for lies however gently meant or seemingly kind isnt it she frowned both angus and caleb are dead poor creatures and their hatred with them whatever it was for it is gone now finished i wish it were he meant it profoundly but there will have to be an inquest into calebs death we need to know why suddenly he launched himself into such a violent and hopeless act do we her face was calm her inner decision made what does it matter now mr goode it seems he never lived in peace cannot he now at least be buried and left to rest in whatever ease his soul can find and we with him my husband has known little but grief of one sort or another since he first took them into his home even with angus no no that was quite unfair of me angus brought him great joy he was everything he could have wished but he said gently insistently he was there is a shadow in your voice a hesitation he insisted what is it what was it in angus lady ravensbrook which made caleb hate him so passionately they were close once why did they grow so hideously far apesþ i dont know but you guess you must have thought about it wondered even if only for the pain it brought your husband of course i thought about it i lay awake many hours wondering if there were some way they might be reconciled i searched my mind i asked my husband often until i realized he knew as little as i and that to speak of it gave him pain he and angus were not not what she spoke reluctantly he was dragging the words out of her and he knew it easy in each others company she admitted it was as if the shadow of caleb were always there a darkness between them a wound that could never be completely forgotten but you liked angus yes yes i liked him now the shadow was gone she spoke wholeheartedly he was extraordinarily kind he was a man you could admire without reservation and yet so modest he never put himself forward was never pompous yes i liked angus enormously i never saw him lose his temper or perform a cruel act the marks of grief were plain in her face but simple loss without doubt or underlying darkness he hated himself for persisting and yet the nagging anxiety was in his mind like a toothache dull and ever present and sometimes giving a stab so sharp it robbed the breath never no she said as if she had not expected to feel so never i am not surprised my husband loved him he was all he could have wished in a son had he been granted one he must have hated caleb for destroying him he said gently it would be understandable if he could never forgive such an act of treachery most especially since angus still kept such loyalty towards caleb she turned away her voice even lower yes i could not blame him and yet he does not seem to feel the anger i do it is almost as if he waited leaning forward the silence in the room prickling his ears she turned very slowly to look at him i dont know what you expect me to say mr goode the truth maam it is the only thing clean enough the only thing which will in the end stand above all the pain i dont know it it was almost as if what he prompted as if he had known one day it must happen and it was like a blow he had long awaited and the reality of it is the end of the tension almost a solace is that a terrible thing to say no it is merely sad he said gently and if we were honest perhaps something we might all say one can become very tired she smiled for the first time some brightness reached her eyes you are very kind mr goode i think perhaps you are well named for the first time in many years he felt the color warm in his face and a strange mixture of pleasure and an awareness of how lonely he was oliver rathbone was in court when it reconvened the benches for the crowd were almost empty the newspapers were blaring headlines that caleb stone had tried to commit another murder this time of the man who had been a father and a benefactor to him and a greater justice had prevailedhe himself had become the victim the matter was ended the judge looked for ebenezer goode saw his absence and raised his eyebrows at rathbone there is no one to defend my lord rathbone said with a shrug he did not know where goode was and was privately a little disconcerted that he was not present he had counted on his support indeed the judge said dryly not an entirely satisfactory explanation but i suppose it will have to suffice he turned to the jury and in formal manner told them what they all already knew caleb stone was dead there was no possibility of proceeding with the trial since he could not now give evidence or speak in his own defense therefore there could be no verdict a mistrial was declared the jury thanked and dismissed rathbone saw the judge afterwards in his oakpaneled chambers the early march sunlight shone pale through the high windows what is it the judge asked with some surprise you have no more interest in this rathbone whatever we may believe of him we cannot pursue caleb stone any further he has made the only escape which is beyond us to retrieve i know that my lord rathbone stood in front of him looking down to where the judge sat in his leather chair a small man with lines under his eyes all i want is to be sure that his escape was either an accident or of his own planning i dont understand you the judge frowned ravensbrook said it was an accident but if it was suicide are you really so passionate in prosecution you want it proved his mouth tightened why man you want him buried in unconsecrated ground it is unlike you to be so vindictive it has nothing to do with providing for the widow or allowing her to marry again in due time if she so wishes i dont believe it was suicide rathbone answered murder the judges rather tattered eyebrows rose in astonishment did you not hear what happened lord ravensbrook went in to see i know what he said rathbone cut across him i was there within a few minutes of it i saw ravensbrook and saw the body i think there is a possibility ravensbrook murdered him lord ravensbrook the judge was not shocked he simply did not believe it do you realize what you are saying rathbone why on earth would lord ravensbrook murder anyone let alone his own ward appalling as the man was and before the defense which could conceivably have made a case for an accident that is something i intend to find out rathbone said through his teeth i have monk on the case now youve taken leave of your senses the judge said with a sigh leaning back in his chair as if he needed the softness of its leather padding to cushion his bones the idea has no foundation whatever his eyes narrowed unless there is something quite extraordinary which you are concealing from the court if there is you place yourself in considerable jeopardy there isnt rathbone replied with feeling i know nothing beyond what has already been revealed but i believe that something exists i would like the coroner to open the inquest and then adjourn it so we may find the evidence to prove it and you expect me to tell him this the judges pale blue eyes were wide with incredulity im sorry rathbone but even if i did without some evidence to support you he would think me as mad as i think you youll have three days at the most its not enough maybe thats as well now if that is all i can do for you allow me to prepare for my next case good day to you hester also rose early and took a hansom to genevieves house she had reason to believe she would be at home since she was no longer required to help enid and there was no further business to be hoped for at the old bailey in the prevailing tragic circumstances she would hardly be either receiving social calls or making any the business of anguss death would have to wait upon legal procedure she was not disappointed genevieve looked pale and exhausted but reasonably composed how are you hester said as she was led into the kitchen the only room in the house with any warmth it was spacious and full of agreeable smells of baking bread and fresh linen drying on the large airing rack across the ceiling let up and down on a rope pulley fastened to the wall there was no one else present presumably the cook had been allowed to go in the interests of the increasingly stringent economy a housemaid had answered the door and perhaps there could be a woman come in to do the heavy work once or twice a week no doubt the nurserymaid would be the last to be let go a manservant would have been too expensive even to consider genevieve smiled briefly but there was an honesty in it we shall manage once they grant that angus is dead we shall be able to appoint someone to manage the business and proceed with decisions i daresay it will be difficult for a little while but that will not matter she met hesters eyes with candor i have certainly been colder and hungrier before the children do not find it easy to understand but i shall explain it to them as well as i can will it be mr niven you ask to manage the business it was really none of her affair but hester inquired because she hoped it was genevieve colored very faintly but there was no awkwardness in her answer without excusing herself or explaining the necessity she went over to the sink and started to peel potatoes they were old black in spots and with too many eyes there were also carrots and turnips on the bench yes i have known him for a long time and he is the most honorable of men she answered frankly i think angus would have approved im glad hester tried to smile to soften what she had to say next even though genevieve had her back to her where she sat at the scrubbed wooden table genevieve turned around the knife in her hand what is it what else can have happened nothing it is simply that it is not yet over we do not know the truth not all of it we never will genevieve said bleakly glancing at the kettle on the range then resuming her peeling but even with caleb alive i dont think we would have all i hoped for was to have the authorities accept that angus was dead i could have borne it if caleb had not been proved guilty unjust though that would be what was angus like hester said with sudden urgency how could he still care for caleb when caleb hated him so much why did he keep going back to the east end what childhood debt of honor or guilt kept him bound to someone who loathed him so passionately that he finally killed him genevieve stood rigid for several seconds then put down her knife and moved to the large black cooking range the kettle was beginning to steam she took a blackandwhite china teapot out of the cupboard rinsed it with boiling water then spooned tea out of the caddy and poured the rest of the water from the kettle and let it steep she brought out cups and then milk from the larder i dont know she said at last i really dont there were times when i thought he hated caleb just as much and i begged him never to see him again she sat down in the chair opposite and began to pour the tea at other times he was sorry for him and yes perhaps almost a little guilty although he had no cause to be caleb could have had as much had he chosen it was not as if there were an inheritance and angus had it at calebs expense there was nothing from their parents genevieve shook her head if there was it was so little it was used long ago do you care for milk certainly angus began his business by joining a firm as any young man might do she passed the cup over caleb could have done the same except that he was so reckless and so lazy in his studies that he had not equipped himself to be of use but again that was his choice she was staring at hester now sometimes i think angus was sorry for caleb and there were times when i knew he was afraid of him hester took the tea and thanked her it was hot and fresh and she was glad of it it took a great deal of courage for angus to return to limehouse and find caleb genevieve went on after he had been badly hurt and he was more than once he was always tired and depressed and i begged him not to return it is not as if caleb cared for him or was even grateful for the help angus gave him it made me so angry and then that distressed him he said he could not help it caleb was his brother his twin and he was bound by a tie which he could not break when i realized how it hurt him i ceased to speak of it she looked down again ignoring her tea her eyes brimming with tears if you had known angus you would understand there was a goodness in him an honor unlike anyone else i have known the only other man as gentle and with anything like the same inward love of what is good is mr niven i think that is why they were friends and why i feel i can turn to him now angus would have understood that there was nothing further to pursue except facts and hester was not even sure what use they would be nevertheless she asked genevieve precisely in which street she had grown up where and when she had first met caleb how she had met angus and all she could remember of that early relationship i barely knew caleb she said bitterly i swear to you that is the truth he was a violent man even for limehouse he frightened me i think he frightened everyone he was so like angus in build and feature and yet so unlike him in nature that no one could mistake one for the other the way he walked the way he stood his voice everything was wild and i dont know how to describe it she frowned struggling with recollection as if he were always angry as if there were something inside him so full of rage it was held in only by the frailest thread and any provocation at all and it would explode and be free to hurt and destroy whatever stood in its path hester did not interrupt her but quietly sipped her tea and watched genevieves face i suppose he must have had a gentler side genevieve went on her voice lower that poor creature selina seemed to have cared for him she bit her lip i dont know why i speak of her like that i started in the same place just three streets away i could easily have been there now if i had never met angus and he had not had the patience and the love to teach me how to better myself to speak well enough to pass as respectable if not as a lady she smiled ruefully and began her tea at last he taught me how to carry myself how to dress how to conduct myself with others i would never have passed for gentry and have entertained in my own home but over the years i have learned more confidence and i dont believe i ever embarrassed him in front of his colleagues you see he was the opposite of caleb he had endless patience i cannot remember him ever losing his temper he would have considered it wrong that he was betraying the best in himself i wish i had known him hester said sincerely he might have been a trifle pompous perhaps he lacked humor or imagination but he must have been a man of immense kindness and an inner integrity which was both rare and beautiful thank you for telling me so much she rose to take her leave i am sorry to have had to ask you it must have given you pain and pleasure genevieve rose also i like to talk about him it is very sad when people cease to mention someone when he is dead it is almost like denying he ever lived i am glad you wanted to know monk already knew from genevieve where angus had grown up and even before ebenezer goode had left his home monk was in a hansom bound for the railway station and the first train to the berkshire village of chilverley it was a tedious journey necessitating a number of changes and delays moving from cozy waiting room with fire to icy windraked platforms then chilly trains it was quarter to eleven when he finally stepped off at chilverley in a bright hard wind chilverley hall the stationmaster said obligingly yes sir about three miles north from here that way he pointed half behind him know colonel patterson do you you look like a military man if i may say so monk was astonished had it not been so contrary to his own interests he would have let his temper have full rein colonel patterson he said grimly this is chilverley yes sir chilverley berkshire he looked at monk anxiously who were you looking for sir the family home of lord ravensbrook oh bless you sir it is the family home of the ravensbrooks but he dont live here no more sold it moved up to live in london so they say im surprised it wasnt entailed monk said irrelevantly daresay it might have been the stationmaster wagged his head but lord milo were the last o the line no reason why he shouldnt sell if he wanted must have got a tidy sum for it he touched his cap respectfully as two gentlemen one in a norfolk jacket the other in a greatcoat went by and through the gate to the road no brothers or even cousins monk had no reason to ask it simply occurred to him the stationmaster turned back to him no sir had one brother younger than him but he was killed poor soul accident it was in italy or some such place he shook his head drowned they say pity that was he were a very charming gentleman if a bit wild very handsome and a bit free with the ladies and with his money still a sad end for one so young how old was he again it hardly mattered no more than thirtyone or thirtytwo the stationmaster answered its all a long time ago now well over quarter of a century nearer thirtyfive years would you know if any of the old servants are still at the house oh no sir all left when his lordship did colonel patterson brought his own household with him is there no one i could find who lived in the house then monk pressed what about outside staff even a gardener gamekeeper coachman is it still the same vicar as it was then the stationmaster nodded oh yes mr nicolson is still the vicar vicarage is opposite the church just beyond that second stand of elms he pointed cant miss it just follow the road round about two miles from here sir thank you im obliged to you for your time and your courtesy and without waiting for any acknowledgment monk strode out in the direction the stationmaster had indicated the wind sighed through the bare branches of the elms and a cloud of rooks soared up into the air disturbed by some predatory cat their black tangled nests were low in the forks towards the trunks it had been a hard winter the vicar was an elderly man but spry and brighteyed he greeted monk over the hedge from where he had been looking hopefully at the green lawn and first spears of bulbs showing through monk gave the briefest of explanations as to his purpose the vicar regarded him with a lively interest yes sir of course i can what a fine morning isnt it wont be long before the daffodils come through love a good show of daffodils come into the parlor my dear fellow got a decent fire going get the chill out of yourself he came to the gate and opened it for monk to walk through then he led him up a chipped stone path to the door which was heavily bowered with honeysuckle now a dark tangle of stems not yet showing green in fact would you like a spot of luncheon he invited showing monk the way inside where it was immediately warm hate to eat alone uncivilized good conversation best for a meal dont you think he went through the overcrowded hall and opened the door into a bright chintzcurtained room wife died five years ago have to grasp at all the company i can know everyone here have done for years cant surprise each other anymore gets tedious in the winter dont mind in the summer enough to do in the garden what did you say your name was william monk mr nicolson ah well mr monk would you care for some luncheon while you tell me your business here in chilverley monk was delighted to accept he was cold and hungry and it would be far easier to stretch out a conversation over the table than sitting in even the most agreeable parlor good good now please make yourself comfortable while i inform the cook the reverend nicolson was so obviously happy to have company that monk allowed at least half the meal to pass before he broached the subject of his journey he swallowed the last of the cold mutton pickles and vegetables and set his knife and fork down the maid appeared with hot flaky apple pie and a jug of cream and set them on the table with evident satisfaction taking away the empty plates then the vicar began his tale and monk listened with amazement anger and growing compassion chapter the coroners inquest into the death of caleb stone opened two days later the public benches were packed it was an extraordinary incident and people were curious to learn how such a thing had happened lord ravensbrook was obliged to attend and give evidence indeed he was the only immediate witness also to be called were the three gaolers all sitting rigidly upright embarrassed and profoundly frightened jimson was convinced they were all innocent bailey that they were all to blame and would be punished appropriately the third gaoler who had gone to report the matter refused to have an opinion at all hester was to be called by rathbone if not by the coroner there was also the doctor who had examined the body officially enid ravensbrook sat beside her husband still palefaced and gaunt but steadyeyed and less physically ill than the week before next to her was genevieve stonefield and beside her calm and resolute titus niven selina herries sat alone head high face white and set eyes hollow with shock rathbone looked at her and felt an unaccountable grief for her they had nothing whatever in common no culture no cause no beliefs barely even a common language and yet the sight of her filled him with a sense of the universality of bereavement he knew what it was to lose that which had been dear in whatever manner however mixed or confused the emotion ebenezer goode was not yet there it was he who was officially to represent the interests of caleb stone rathbone had persuaded genevieve to allow him to represent her as sisterinlaw of the deceased and therefore the closest relative ravensbrook had been only his childhood guardian and had never apparently adopted either boy and selina was not calebs wife the coroner was a large genial man with a ready smile but more of agreeability than humor as was appropriate to his calling he opened proceedings with formality then called the first witness the gaoler jimson the room was simple not like the high court in the old bailey there were no steps to climb to a stand no carved and ornamental bench or thronelike chair for the coroner as for the judge jimson stood behind a simple rail which did little more than mark the position for him and the coroner sat behind a fine oak table jimson swore to tell the truth then gave his name and occupation he was so nervous he gulped and stumbled over his words the coroner smiled at him benignly now mr jimson simply tell us what happened there is no need to be so frightened man this is a court of inquiry not of accusation now begin when the prisoner was put back in your custody after the trial was adjourned yes sir mlord sir will do very well i am not a judge yes sir thank you sir jimson took a deep breath and swallowed hard again e were in a rare state the prisoner i mean e were laughin an shoutin an swearin fit ter bust there was a rage in im

we locked im in we the coroner inquired can you recall which of you it was yes sir it were me i see proceed there was almost silence around the room only the slight sound of fabric rustling as someone shifted in a seat and a whisper as a woman spoke to the person next to her the journalists present wrote nothing so far then lord ravensbrook came an asked if e could see the prisoner im bein is only relative like jimson continued an seein as ow things was goin bad with im in the trial guess like e thought as thered be a verdict soon an then e wouldnt be allowed ter see im alone anymore im bein a

slightest relieved well it all seemed right ter us bailey an alcott an me so we let im in just a moment mr jimson the coroner interrupted when you let lord ravensbrook in how was the prisoner what was his demeanor his attitude was he still in this rage you described earlier how did he greet lord ravensbrook jimson looked confused did you see him mr jimson the coroner pressed it is necessary that you answer truthfully this matter concerns the death of a man in your custody yes sir jimson swallowed convulsively only too desperately aware of his responsibility no sir i didnt go in with is lordship i i didnt like ter im bein family like an knowin from the guard as ad im in court ow ard it were goin an as e were like ter be anged i let is lordship in wen e said as e preferred ter be alone lord ravensbrook said he wished to see the prisoner alone yes sir e did i see then what happened arter a few moments is lordship came out an asked fer a pen an ink an paper cos the prisoner

an e went back inter the cell wi em then just a few minutes arter that there were a cry an a bangin on the door an wen i opened it is lordship staggered out covered wi blood an said as thered bin an

ter do what i could fer is lordship till elp come thank you mr jimson the coroner looked for goode where is mr goode he asked with a frown i understood he was to represent the family of the dead man is that not so rathbone rose to his feet yes sir he is i dont know what may have kept him i ask the courts indulgence i am sure he will not be long he had better not be he thought grimly or we shall lose this by default this is not a court of advocacy mr rathbone the coroner said irritably if mr goode does not favor us with his presence we shall proceed without him have you any questions you wish to ask this witness rathbone drew in his breath to make as longwinded a reply as he could and was saved the necessity by the doors swinging open wide on their hinges ebenezer goode swept in coattails flying arms full of papers and strode up to the front he bestowed a dazzling smile upon the coroner apologized profusely and took his seat managing to disturb everyone within a tenfoot radius are you ready mr goode the coroner asked with heavy sarcasm may we proceed of course goode said still with the same smile very civil of you to have waited for me we did not wait for you the coroner snapped do you have questions for this witness sir yes indeed thank you goode rose to his feet upset his papers and picked them up then proceeded to ask a lot of questions which merely reaffirmed what jimson had already said no one learned anything new but it wasted considerable time which was goodes purpose and rathbones the coroner kept his temper with difficulty bailey the second gaoler was called next and the coroner elicited from him confirmation of everything jimson had said but briefly there were no contradictions to explore it took all goodes ingenuity to think of sufficient questions to stretch it out a further half hour and rathbone found it hard to add anything at all he redescribed calebs words his gestures his tone of voice his behavior earlier during the trial he even asked bailey what he thought ca leb felt and expected of the outcome until the coroner stopped him and told him he was asking the witness to speculate beyond his ability to know but sir mr bailey is an expert witness on the mood and expectations of prisoners charged with capital crimes rathbone protested it is his daily occupation surely he of all men may know whether a prisoner has hope of being acquitted or not it is of the utmost importance in learning the truth that we know whether caleb stone was in despair or still nurtured some hope of life of course it is mr rathbone the coroner conceded but you have already drawn from mr bailey and mr jimson everything that they know it is up to me to reach conclusions not the witnesses however experienced yes sir rathbone said reluctantly it was only one oclock the coroner looked at the clock and adjourned for luncheon have you heard from monk goode demanded when he and rathbone were seated in an excellent tavern nearby and enjoying a meal of roast beef and vegetables ale apple and blackberry pie ripe stilton cheese and biscuits has he learned anything no i havent rathbone said grimly i know he went to chilverley but i havent heard a thing after that goode helped himself to a large portion of cheese and what about the nurse whats her name latterly he asked did she learn anything of use i see her in court shouldnt she be in the east end we could have put off calling her today she might have given us something shes already learned all she can rathbone said defensively she said theres nothing there we dont already know what about caleb damn it goode said angrily if this isnt an accident then either its suicideand weve already decided that is unlikelyor its murder in the interests of human decency never mind abstract concepts like truth we need to know then well have to go further back than calebs life in limehouse rathbone replied taking another biscuit it lies in the relationship between ravensbrook angus and him that is in chilverley all we can do is stretch this out until monk himself returns or at least sends us a witness goode sighed and god knows what well learn then or what well be able to prove rathbone added finishing his ale the afternoon proceedings began with the coroner calling milo ravensbrook to the stand there was instant silence around the room even the barest rustling of movement ceased and every eye was on him his skin was sickly pale but his clothes were immaculate and his bearing upright he looked neither right nor left as he took his place behind the rail and swore in a precise slightly hoarse voice as to his name his jacket was open and hung a little loosely to accommodate the bandages where he had been injured his jaw was tight but whether it was clenched in physical pain or emotional distress no one could say there was a murmur of both awe and sympathy even before the coroner spoke rathbone glanced at the crowd enid looked at her husband and her eyes were shadowed with unhappiness and pity almost absently her hand strayed to genevieve beside her lord ravensbrook the coroner began will you please tell us what happened on the day of caleb stones death you do not need to repeat anything before you actually went into his cell unless you wish to do so i have no desire to harrow your feelings more than is my duty and cannot be avoided thank you ravensbrook acknowledged without turning his head he stared at the wall opposite him and spoke as if in a trance he seemed to be reliving the events in his mind more real to him than the paneled room the mild face of the coroner or the crowd listening to his every word all eyes were upon his face which was racked with emotions and yet curiously immobile as if it were all held inside him with unyielding selfcontrol the gaoler opened the door and stood back for me to go in he began in a level careful voice i had sought permission to speak to caleb alone i knew it might very well be the last time i had such an opportunity the trial was not going in his favor his hesitation was barely perceptible i i had certain things i wanted to say to him which were of a personal nature probably it was foolish of me but i hoped that for anguss widows sake he might tell me what had happened between angus and himself and she could know that angus was at peace if you will the coroner nodded there was a sigh around the room genevieve caught her breath in a gasp but made no other sound she closed her eyes as if she could not bear to see rathbone glanced at goode and saw a flicker of question in his eyes of course it was futile ravensbrook resumed nothing i could say had any effect upon him or softened the anger inside him was he in a rage when you first went in lord ravensbrook the coroner asked his eyes wide and gentle the gaoler seems not to know he was sullen ravensbrook replied frowning slightly if he were aware of selina herries staring at him as if she would imprint his features in her mind he gave no sign of it at all i asked him for genevieves sake to tell me what had happened in that last meeting he continued but he would not i assured him i would not repeat it to the authorities it was only for the family i wished to know but he was adamant his voice was level but seemed tight in his throat as though he had to force it out and several times he licked his lips rathbone glanced around the room again enid sat stiffbacked leaning a trifle forward as if she would be closer to him genevieve looked from the witness stand to enid and back selina herries clenched her knuckles in front of her and her bold face was filled with pain but her eyes did not waver he asked me for pen and paper ravensbrook said resuming his account he said he wanted to write a last testament did he mean a will or a statement do you know the coroner inquired he did not say and i did not ask ravensbrook answered i assumed it was some statement perhaps a form of last words i hoped it would be his confession or contrition for his own souls sake in the audience selina let out a little cry then immediately stifled it another woman gave a stifled sob but whether of personal grief or simply the emotion of the scene it was impossible to say titus niven put his hand on genevieves discreetly very gently and the tightness in her shoulders eased a fraction so you asked the gaoler for a pen ink and paper the coroner prompted yes ravensbrook agreed the emotion in the room did not seem to touch him perhaps his own turmoil was too great when they came i returned to the cell and gave them to caleb he tried to use the pen but said it was scratchy the nib needed recutting i took out my penknife to do it for him you did not offer him the knife the coroner asked leaning forward earnestly ravensbrooks mouth tightened and his brows furrowed no of course not thank you proceed ravensbrook stood even more rigidly the desperate grip on his emotions the fragility of his hold was painfully apparent he was a man walking through a nightmare and not a soul in the room could be unaware of it this time even the coroner did not prompt him ravensbrook took a deep breath and let it out in an inaudible sigh without the slightest warning without saying a word caleb launched himself at me the first i knew of it he was at my throat his hand clasping my wrist and attempting to seize the knife from me we struggledi to save my life he to gain mastery over me whether to kill me or to snatch the knife in an attempt to take his own life i do not know nor will i guess there was a slight murmur of assent a sigh of pity for gods sake wheres monk goode whispered to rathbone this cant be strung out beyond tomorrow rathbone did not answer there was nothing else to say i cannot tell you precisely what happened ravensbrook started again it was all too quick he managed to stab at me several times half a dozen or so we fought back and forth it probably seemed for longer than it was he turned to face the coroner looking at him earnestly i have very little idea whether it was seconds or minutes i managed to force him away from me he slipped and my own impetus carried me forward i tripped over his leg and we landed together when i arose he was lying on the floor with the knife in his throat he stopped there was total motionless silence in the room every face was turned towards him emotions naked in horror and compassion selina herries looked like a ghost suddenly thinner sadder the brave arrogance leached away when i could gather my senses ravensbrook said taking up his account again and realized that i was no longer in danger from him i leaned forward and attempted to find his pulse he was bleeding very profusely and i feared he was beyond help i turned to the door and banged and called out for the gaolers one of them opened it and let me out the rest i believe you already know indeed my lord the coroner agreed i do not need to trouble you any further may i offer you and your family my deepest sympathy in your double loss thank you ravensbrook turned to leave goode rose to his feet the coroner made a motion with his hand to stop ravensbrook who looked at goode as he would an enemy in the field of battle if you must the coroner conceded reluctantly thank you sir goode turned to ravensbrook smiling courteously showing all his teeth by your own account my lord and by the evidence of your most unfortunate injuries he began by the way i hope you are beginning to recover thank you ravensbrook said stiffly i am very glad goode inclined his head as i was saying by your own account my lord you did not cry out for help until the struggle with caleb had continued for some moments why did you not call immediately you surely must have appreciated that you were in very considerable danger ravensbrook stared at him his face white of course i knew that he said his jaw clenched the muscles visible even from where rathbone sat and yet you did not cry out goode persisted why not ravensbrook looked at him with loathing i doubt you would understand sir or you would not ask for all his sins and ingratitude his disloyalty caleb stonefield had been a son to me i hoped i might deal with the matter without the authorities ever needing to know of it it was the most tragic accident that it ended as it did i could have hidden my own wounds until i was clear of the courthouse he was until the end unhurt i see goode replied expressionlessly he went on to ask all manner of further questions sought explanations of the finest points rathbone did the same after him until it was apparent he had lost all sympathy from the crowd and worn the coroners patience threadbare he conceded at quarter past four in the afternoon and was called by the coroner to take the stand himself the coroner elicited his evidence and dispatched him within twelve minutes goode racked his brains and could think of nothing further to ask him at twentynine minutes to five monk was called and found to be absent rathbone protested that he should be located the coroner pointed out that since rathbone himself had been in monks presence every moment of the relevant time there was nothing useful that monk could add goode rose to his feet and was also overruled the coroner adjourned the sitting until the following day rathbone and goode left the court together deep in anxiety there was no word from monk the first witness of the morning was hester latterly miss latterly the coroner smiled at her benignly there is no need to be nervous my dear simply answer the questions to the best of your ability if you do not know the answer then say so yes sir she nodded and smiled back at him innocently you were leaving the courtroom after attending the trial when you were informed by the gaoler bailey that someone was injured and needed medical assistance is that correct he was not going to allow her to ramble by telling the story in her own words he had summarized it for her most precisely rathbone swore under his breath if monk doesnt come within an hour it is all going to be over goode said where in gods name is he is there an early train from chilverley this morning should i go and look for him rathbone glanced around desperately ill send a clerk he said mr rathbone the coroner said with a frown i beg your pardon rathbone apologized grinfly the coroner turned to hester miss latterly yes would you please answer the question i beg your pardon sir what was it very carefully the coroner repeated himself yes sir she replied i had attended the trial with lady ravensbrook she then repeated the entire procedure of her departure baileys arrival enids reaction her own reaction the instructions she had given to the coachman and her reasons for doing so all the alternatives and why they were unacceptable enids assurance that she would be perfectly able to manage and that she would indeed go home and then her return with bailey through the courtroom buildings and her arrival at the cells nothing the coroner could sayand he tried several timeswould stop her she seemed not to hear him rathbone shot a sideways glance at goode and saw his incredulity and the beginning of a bleak amusement yes the coroner said grimly thank you what did you see when you arrived at the cells miss latterly please confine yourself to what is relevant i beg your pardon please confine yourself to what is relevant miss latterly to what sir to what is relevant miss latterly the coroner said extremely loudly relevant to what sir the coroner controlled himself with some effort to the matter of caleb stones death madam i am afraid i dont know what is relevant she replied without a flicker of expression in her face it would seem from what i observed that he was possessed by such a frantic hatred of his erstwhile guardian lord ravensbrook that he was prepared at any cost whatever even the certain sacrifice of his own life by hanging surely a most damnable way to die to inflict upon him some injury even to wish his death i am sorry that is a very complicated sentence perhaps i had better rephrase it no the coroner shouted then he drew a deep breath that is not necessary miss latterly your meaning is perfectly plain even if not your reasons for believing so she launched into her reasons for believing so impervious to his attempted interruptions she seemed to be hard of hearing verging upon outright deafness she described in detail exactly how lord ravensbrook had appeared to her describing every sign with clinical thoroughness and drawing upon her experience of soldiers in shock in the crimea to illustrate that her opinion was an expert one then she described his wounds their appearance her treatment of them how she had been obliged to make use of rathbones shirt and why the gaolers shirts would not do her apologies to rathbone for the inconvenience and her belief that ravensbrook would make good his loss when she had finished that without drawing breath she went on to describe ravensbrooks response to the treatment by half past twelve she still had not reached the point where she had opened the cell door and seen the body of caleb stone the coroner adjourned the sitting for luncheon and retired exhausted brilliant if somewhat farcical goode said dourly in the same tavern as the day before but unless monk turns up with something this afternoon it will achieve nothing i think one of us should go to chilverley and get him he would come if he had anything rathbone said when the court reconvened it was packed to standing room no one offered an explanation as to why perhaps it was because it had not gone as expected perhaps it was the hope of some revelation possibly it was hesters performance and the sense of the absurd suddenly it had all be come interesting the coroner had dined well he was in a better mood for battle and he met hesters resumption of evidence with a stern eye and a voice which was perfectly willing and capable of shouting her down would you please tell me if caleb stone was dead when you looked into the cell miss latterly yes or no will suffice yes she said with a smile of agreeability he was dead yes how do you know at some length she told him explaining all the ways by which one might know that life is extinct i am a physician and a lawyer maam he shouted above her i am perfectly aware of the difference between life and death i beg your pardon she said pleasantly he repeated what he had said no she shook her head i mean i am sorry for having told you what you already know sir of course i knew you must be a lawyer i did not appreciate you were a physician also if i have slighted you i am very sorry not at all he said graciously thank you i have nothing further to ask you he looked at rathbone and goode meaningfully your evidence has been most complete he added nevertheless goode rose to his feet and asked her to clarify as much as he could possibly misunderstand he was drawing to the end of his wit and invention when an elderly gentleman in clerical garb made his way with difficulty to the front of the room and handed a letter to rathbone rathbone tore it open and read it and let out an audible sigh of relief goode turned to look at him and saw the rescue in his eyes he allowed hester to draw to a close at last and be released with a sigh of gratitude from the coroner and some disappointment from that part of the crowd who had known neither caleb nor angus and had no emotional involvement in the outcome the doctor who had examined the body was called the coroner dealt with his evidence and dispatched him in less than a quarter of an hour neither goode nor rathbone could think of anything further to ask him he had said that the cause of death was a slashing wound from the penknife which had caught the jugular vein and the deceased had then bled to death it was quite consistent with him having held the weapon in his other hand and its being forced back into his throat in a fall or during a struggle there was nothing more to add rathbone rose to his feet where on earth was monk if he did not appear in the next few minutes they would lose by default he could not spin this out any longer the coroners patience was stretched to breaking with respect sir while all this is both true and relevant it still does not tell us whether his death was accidental or not in the absence of proof that it was suicide mr rathbone the coroner said patiently we shall have to assume that he attacked lord ravensbrook in the same jealousy and hatred which apparently possessed him with regard to his brother only in this case his weapon was turned upon himself and he became the victim rathbone took a deep breath and laid his reputation in the balance or there is the third possibility sir that it was not caleb who attacked lord ravensbrook but that the outcome was exactly what was meant from the beginning there was utter silence not even an indrawn breath of disbelief it was as if life in the room were suspended enid was ashenfaced genevieve paralyzed finally the coroner spoke mr rathbone are you suggesting that lord ravensbrook intentionally killed caleb stone i am suggesting that it is a possibility sir goode closed his eyes and leaned back in his seat anguish written all over his face two spots of color touched milo ravensbrooks cheeks but he neither moved nor spoke selina herries bit her knuckles and stared at rathbone in gods name man for what conceivable reason the coroner asked the door opened at the back of the court and monk came in drenched with rain tousled and exhausted for lack of sleep but accompanied by an elderly man and a stout woman in black rathbone felt weak with relief his voice trembled as he answered the coroner i will call witnesses to answer that question sir i shall begin with the reverend horatio nicolson of chilverley with your permission the coroner hesitated he looked around the room saw the wideeyed faces the anticipation the journalists who were still present sitting with pencil in hand faces bright with eagerness he could not disallow it i shall stop you if for one instant there is irrelevance or any attempt at unsubstantiated attack he warned be very careful mr rathbone very careful indeed i will have no ones good name taken lightly rathbone bowed his head in acknowledgment and called horatio nicolson to the witness stand slowly with deep regret and obvious embarrassment the reverend nicolson mounted the witness stand and took the oath rathbone began by establishing precisely who he was so that the court might understand his importance so you knew lord ravensbrook and his family quite well at the time angus stonefield came to chilverley he asked yes sir nicolson answered his face grave did you come to know angus yes i tutored him in latin beginning when he was about eight i believe he was an excellent student intelli gent willing and quick to learn a most agreeable boy so thoughtful and well mannered he smiled at the memory in spite of himself my wife was especially fond of him she worried about him he was quite often ill you know and at times seemed very withdrawn his voice dropped a little there was a sadness in him especially when he was very young most rational i suppose having lost both his parents at such an early age did he continue to be such an excellent student mr nicolson rathbone asked nicolsons face pinched with grief no i am afraid he became very erratic at times he was excellent his old self and then there would be occasions when i would hardly see him for several weeks do you know the reason for this nicolson drew in a deep breath and let it out in a silent sigh i asked naturally lord ravensbrook confided in me that he had become most recalcitrant at times hard to discipline and on occasion even openly rebellious there was a faint rustling in the room no one was yet interested nicolsons head lifted although i must say in his defense that lord ravensbrook was a hard man to please he spoke as if he had not seen ravensbrook in the room nor did his eyes move towards where he sat stiff and pale he was handsome charming and talented himself nicolson continued and he expected those in his own family to come up to his standards if they did not he was harsh in his criticism but angus was not strictly speaking his own family rathbone pointed out except distantly was he not the child of a cousin nicolsons face tightened touched with a deep pity no sir he was the illegitimate son of his younger brother phineas ravensbrook stonefield was the young womans name which was all he was legally entitled to but he was ravensbrook by blood rathbone heard the murmur of surprise around the room the indrawn breath the coroner leaned forward as if about to interrupt then changed his mind why did lord ravensbrook not adopt him rathbone asked especially since he had lost his wife and had no children of his own lord ravensbrook and his brother were not close sir nicolson shook his head a great weight of sadness in his voice and in the gentle lines of his face there was tension between them a deeplying rivalry that could take no joy in the others happiness or success milo the present lord ravensbrook was the elder he was clever charming and talented but i think his ambition was even larger than his abilities considerable as they were memory lit his face phineas was quite different he had such vitality such laughter and imagination everyone loved phineas and he seemed to have no ambition at all except to enjoy himself the coroner leaned across his table mr rathbone is this of any relevance to caleb stonefields death it seems to be very old history and of a very personal nature can you justify it in this court yes sir it is at the very core of it rathbone said with feeling momentary to passion something of the rage and the emergency in him must have been there in his voice and the angles of his body every eye was on him and the coroner hesitated only a moment before permitting him to proceed rathbone nodded to nicolson i am afraid he got away with much that perhaps he should not nicolson said quietly but his voice carried even to the back of the room in the silence he could smile at people and they forgot their anger they forgave him far too much for his own good or for milos the sense of injustice you see as if all the pleasures and pains of life could be weighed against each otheronly god can do that at the end when it is all known he sighed perhaps that is why he was so harsh with poor angus to try to prevent him following in his fathers footsteps such charm can be a terrible curse undoing all that would be good in a man it is not right that we should laugh our way out of justice it teaches us all the wrong lessons was lord ravensbrook so very harsh mr nicolson in my opinion yes sir in what way the coroners face pinched but he did not interrupt in the room there was a scrape of fabric on fabric the squeak of a boot milo ravensbrook fidgeted and moved as if to speak but did not nicolson looked wretched but he did not hesitate to reply in a soft steady voice he seemed at times impossible to please he would humiliate the boy for mistakes for foolishness which was merely born of ignorance or uncertainty lack of confidence and of course the more a child is embarrassed the more mistakes he makes it is a terrible thing to feel worthless sir to feel you owe a debt of gratitude and instead of paying it you have to let down those you most wish to please he pressed on with difficulty through his obvious emotion as a small boy i saw angus many times struggling to keep from weeping and then the shame he felt when he could no longer help it and was then chastened for that too and he was bitterly ashamed of being beaten which he was frequently it terrified him and then he felt himself a coward because of it in the crowd a woman stifled a sob selina herries had not wept for calebs death it was still too new a shock for her her feelings towards the man too mixed between pride contempt and fear of him now her feelings for the child he must have been were simple she let the tears run down her face without shame or hindrance enid ravensbrooks face was ashgray and set in lines of intolerable pain as if some longfeared tragedy had at last struck her she looked sideways at her husband but her expression was unreadable not once did he turn to her perhaps he did not dare to see what was in her eyes genevieve stonefield was beyond weeping but she clasped titus nivens hand as if she might drown if she let it go mr nicolson rathbone prompted nicolson blinked my heart ached for him and i was moved to speak to lord ravensbrook on his behalf but i fear i did no good my interference only provoked him to be even stricter he thought angus had complained to me and he regarded that as both cowardice and a personal disloyalty i see to rathbone it was a picture of such pain he was lost for more powerful or appropriate words what must have lain beneath the surface of anguss honorable and upright character could he ever have forgiven ravensbrook for those years of misery the coroner had not interrupted nor had his eyes once strayed to the clock but now deeply unhappy he was compelled to speak mr rathbone this past distress is most harrowing but it is still so far irrelevant to the death of caleb stonefield i am sure you must be aware of that mr nicolsons evidence has addressed itself solely to angus that is because he never met caleb rathbone replied if i may be permitted to call my last witness sir she will explain it all i hope she can mr rathbone otherwise you appear to have harrowed our emotions and wasted our time to no purpose it is to a purpose i assure you i call miss abigail ratchett abigail ratchett was a very stout woman with unnaturally black hair considering that she must have been at least seventyfive but apart from being hard of hearing she was selfassured and quite in command of her wits every eye in the room was upon her you are a nurse miss ratchett rathbone began speaking clearly and rather above his usual pitch and volume yes sir and midwife at least i used to be the coroners face tightened goode groaned rathbone ignored them both were you in attendance when miss alice stonefield was delivered of her two sons in october of the father being one phineas ravensbrook rathbone glanced at ravensbrook he looked like a deathshead i were in attendance yes sir miss ratchett replied but it were just a normal birth like any other no twins sir just the one child boy beautiful he were healthy child called him angus she did one could have heard a tin tack drop in the court what rathbone demanded the coroner leaned forward peering at her madam you are aware of what you are saying there are people in this courtroom who knew both angus and caleb there were one baby sir miss ratchett repeated i were there miss alice had one baby i were with her for all the time she nursed him knew him right until his poor mother were killed year after phineas ravensbrook died in some foreign place it were after that as his uncle took him poor little mite only five he were an terrible took with his grief father never ad no time for im never owned im he didnt nor loved is mother neither her face betrayed her feelings for phineas ravensbrook what you say makes no sense madam the coroner cried desperately if there was only one child where did caleb come from who was he and who killed angus i dont know nothing about that miss ratchett answered levelly i just know there were one baby but i do know as children have a powerful imagination i looked af ter a little girl once as ad a friend all imaginary and whenever she done something wrong she said as how it were mary what done it not her she was good mary was bad an ordinary excuse any child might make the coroner said i have children myself madam i have heard many such stories the reverend nicolson rose to his feet i beg your pardon sir he addressed the coroner respectfully but he would not be denied but is it not possible that in his unhappiness and his feeling of rejection obligation and loneliness that the boy created an alternative self which would take the blame for his failures and which would also be free to hate his uncle as he wished to as he did in his heart he raised his voice above the mounting noise in the room the groans and murmurs of horror pity rage or disbelief might it not begin as an escape within the imagination of an unhappy childs hurt and humiliation he asked and then grow into a genuine madness wherein he became two quite separate people one who did everything to please and earned the resultant rewards and another who was free to feel without guilt all the anger and hatred for his rejection because he was the son of a father who would not own him and an uncle for whom he was never good enough a reflection of the brother he envied and upon whom he could no longer be revenged except through the child the coroner banged on his desk for silence order he commanded that is a monstrous scene you paint sir may god forgive you for it i should not be surprised if the ravensbrook family cannot he looked at where milo ravensbrook sat rigid whitefaced but for the scarlet daubs on his cheeks but it was enid ravensbrooks expression the rage and the pity in her which made the coroner draw in his breath and from which rathbone knew that nicolson was not so far wrong absolute insanity ravensbrook said between his teeth for gods sake everyone here knows there were two brothers this woman is either wicked or she has lost her wits her memory is fuddled with drink he swung around genevieve you have seen both angus and caleb he was shouting now tell them this is preposterous i have seen them genevieve said slowly but never together i have never seen them at the same time but it couldnt be they were utterly different no she looked at abigail ratchett no you have to be mistaken it was over fortyone years ago your memory is confused how many babies have you delivered hundreds it was one baby abigail ratchett said fiercely im not drunk and im not mad no matter what anyone says genevieve turned to monk desperation in her face she had to raise her voice to make herself heard you said someone saw them together on the day angus was killed find that man and bring him here that will solve it the coroner banged again demanding silence then turned to monk well he said sharply did you find such a witness if you did what is all the nonsense it seems you are totally irresponsible sir i went back monk replied his voice quiet hard i found the witness and i had him stand exactly where he had seen angus and caleb face each other i stood where he said they did now suddenly there was not a sound in the room i was before a mirror sir monk said with a brilliant smile i fought with my own reflection in a glass and the man watching me relived a mirage that proves nothing ravensbrook said thickly you have said caleb confessed to murdering angus how can a man murder himself he said he had destroyed angus monk corrected and that i would never find the body that was the joke that is why he laughed caleb knew of angus and despised him i think angus did not know of caleb he could not bear to for him it was truly another person a dark presence beyond himself and he was profoundly afraid of him nonsense ravensbrook retaliated his voice rising you cannot prove such a wild and totally scurrilous story caleb was insane certainly and he murdered his brother then when he knew he would be convicted and hanged in a last frenzy of hatred he attacked me too because god forgive me i always loved angus better if i am guilty of a sin it is that and only that the voice was rising again people were moving about it can be proved monk lifted his voice staring at the coroner the body of caleb stone is in the morgue he swung around to selina madam do you know calebs body well enough to tell it from anguss yeah course i do she said without blushing he looked at genevieve and you mrs stonefield could you tell your husbands body from calebs yes her voice was no more than a whisper her face bloodless then let us put an end to this farce the coroner commanded we shall take these two ladies to the morgue he rose his face set his eyes unblinking he did not even bother with the uproar in the court or pay the slightest attention to the journalists falling over one another to get out and find messengers the morgue attendant pulled back the sheet and uncovered the naked body as far as the groin the room was cold and smelled of water and death the candlelight was yellow and left the corners in shadow selina herries leaned on hesters arm her face calm almost beautiful all the brashness and the anger gone from it she looked at the face with its smooth brow the chiseled mouth the green eyes closed then she looked down at the broad chest scarred and marble white the pattern of old injuries was quite individual thats caleb she said quietly she touched his cold cheek with her fingers gently as if he could feel her god rest him she whispered the coroner nodded and hester went out with her a few minutes later she returned with genevieve again the morgue attendant laid back the sheet genevieve stared hard at the same calm face with its closed eyes and the same white body with its old scars finally her eyes filled with tears and they spilled down her cheeks in an anguish of pity wrenching at her with a pain she would never forget yes she whispered so quietly that in any place but this room of death it would not have been heard yes that is angus i know those scars as i know my own hand i bandaged most of them myself god make him whole and give him peace at last she turned slowly and hester held her in her arms while she wept the grief of all the lost pain she could not heal the child she could not reach ill conduct the prosecution of ravensbrook for murder rathbone said with passion youll never prove it monk pointed out that doesnt matter rathbone clenched his jaw his body rigid the charge will ruin him it will be enough monk leaned forward and picked up one of the dead hands it was beautiful perfectnailed and he knew now why caleb had always worn glovesto protect anguss hands he folded it carefully across the other perhaps no one else in the room could feel so deeply and with such an intimate pity for a man divided against himself forever in fear of a dark half he did not know be at peace he said what debts you cannot pay we will about the author amonganne perry s other novels featuring investigator william monk arefuneral in blueslaves of obsessionthe
