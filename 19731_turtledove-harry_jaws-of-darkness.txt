shazli king of zuwayza tewfik hajjaj s majordomo qutuz hajjaj s secretary in bishah one ealstan added up a long column of figures the young bookkeeper let out a sigh of relief when the answer turned out to be what hed expected bearing the ledger into his employers private office he told pybba those algarvians are going to make us rich good the pottery magnate rumbled well give em some of their silver back too and not the way they expect pybba wasnt only the biggest pottery maker in eoforwicand for that matter in all of forthweg he was also one of the leaders in the underground struggle against the algarvian invaders who occupied his kingdom what do you suppose they want with fifty thousand style seventeen sugar bowls ealstan asked the question had bothered him ever since an algarvian colonel marched in to place the order pybbas broad shoulders went up and down in a shrug powers below eat the redheads whatever it is his eyes flicked down to the bottom of the column he nodded thats not a bad pile of change eh why dont you go on home now your wifell be waiting for you i expect aye she will thanks ealstan was glad to have leave to head for his flat pybba showed no sign of going anywhere his bushy beard was shot with gray but he went home later and came to work earlier than anybody he employed go on he growled now get out of here before i change my mind odds were he wasnt joking ealstan set the ledger on his own slanted worktable then got out while the getting was good twilight spread gloom across eoforwic though the occupied capital of the kingdom of forthweg seemed sad and gray and gloomy enough even at midday a couple of tall lean algarvian constables swaggered past ealstan their arrogant stride made them stand out as much as their coppery hair and their short tunics and pleated kilts forthwegian men wore kneelength tunics like ealstans forthwegian women wore loose tunics that reached their ankles men and women alike were stocky and swarthy with dark hair and eyes and strong noses some of the people on the street were almost certainly of kaunian blood too but most of the kaunians left alive in eoforwic these days were sorcerously disguised to look like their forthwegian neighbors the algarvians hated kaunians as ancient enemies and sacrificed them in droves to use their life energy to fuel potent sorceries in their war against unkerlant to the west few forthwegians cared what happened to their blond neighbors ealstan was one of those few vanai his wife was a kaunian she was also the one whod devised the sorcery that let her folk masquerade as forthwegians these days she went by thelberge a forthwegian name her own would have been plenty to betray her not so long after winter yielded to spring she would have their first child ealstan frowned a little as he walked along wondering if the baby would need a spell cast over it every few hours for years to come he hoped not some halfbreed children looked altogether forthwegian after a few paces his frown deepened since shed got pregnant vanais protective spell hadnt been holding as long as it did before she found herself with child if it happened to wear off while she was away from the flat his fingers writhed in an apotropaic sign powers above prevent it he said softly they had so far he had to hope they would keep on doing it vanai was careful she knew the risk too of course but she couldnt see the illusion that fooled everyone else the greatest danger lay there she couldnt see it stop fooling people either such worries dogged ealstan about every other night on the way home they made him walk faster a lump of dread in his throat as if an algarvian constable were about to lay hold of him for being a kaunian his laugh held no mirth he wasnt a kaunian to the algarvians he was that even more suspicious creature a kaunianlover but being a kaunianlover didnt show here was his own street here was his own block here was his block of flats a dingy building in a bad part of town he and vanai had stayed here ever since coming to eoforwic from gromheort and her village of oyngestun in the east he went up the stairs into the cramped dark lobby he paused there at the brass bank of post boxes to see if anyone had sent him a letter his family back in gromheort knew where he lived he didnt think vanai had any living family not any more she has me he thought and hurried up the stairs to his flat the narrow stairway had a familiar reek stale cabbage and stale piss sometimes it disgusted him but hed lived here long enough that sometimes as tonight it just felt homey back when he and vanai first moved in before shed crafted the spell that let her look like a forthwegian shed stayed holed up in the flat all the time like a trapped animal theyd worked out a coded knock to let her know it was safe to unbar the door and let him in he still used it more from habit than from any other reason he knocked and waited when vanai didnt come to the door he knocked again louder this time she fell asleep a lot more easily than she had before she got pregnant when she still didnt come he knocked once more louder still he frowned and took from his belt pouch the long brass key that could work the latch from the outside if the door was barred of course working the latch wouldnt matter one way or the other he turned the key and pushed at the door not expecting to be able to get in but it swung open van he began but checked himself he tried again calling thelberge are you there sweetheart no answer the flat was quiet and dark no lamps lit as if nobodyd been inside since well before the sun went down fighting back alarm ealstan hurried into the bedchamber vanai wasnt lying there sound asleep she wasnt sitting on the pot which she also needed to do more than she had before quickening hed already seen she wasnt in the front room or the kitchen he went back there anyway thelberge fear made his voice quaver only silence answered little by little ealstan realized he hadnt known what fear meant now he did my neighbors he thought wildly maybe my neighbors know something trouble was he hardly knew his neighbors for one thing they kept coming and goingthis block of flats wasnt the sort of place where people settled down to live out the rest of their lives and for another because of who and what vanai was she and ealstan hadnt gone out of their way to make friends if anything theyd gone out of their way to keep to themselves but he had to try thinking about the alternative ealstan didnt want to he wouldnt think about the alternative imagining vanai in algarvian hands he shook his head he wouldn t think about that he knocked on the door to the nextdoor flat closer to the stairs silence he knocked again go away someone inside saida womans voice im your neighbor ealstan began and id like to ask you go away she said again or else i start screaming powers below eat you he muttered under his breath but he went away to the flat on the other side of his wondering what would go wrong now he knocked on the door there this time at least it opened a graybearded man stood in the doorway his narrow eyes had all the warmth of chips of ice what do you want kid he demanded whatever it is make it snappy i dont mean to bother you ealstan said but have you seen my wife today she was supposed to be home when i got back and shes not shes expecting a baby so im worried havent seen her his neighbor shook his head sorry he didnt sound sorry he sounded as if he never wanted to see ealstan again and when he slammed the door ealstan had to jump back in a hurry to keep from getting his nose flattened he stood in the hallway cursing softly wondering whether even to bother knocking on the door across the hall from his at last with a sort of despairing shrug he did who is it came from inside another womans voice ealstan your neighbor from across the hall he answered wondering if shed open the door to his surprise she did she was somewhere in her late thirtieswhich to ealstans nineteen made her seem almost grandmotherly though little by little he realized she wasnt really bad looking she eyed him with frank appraisal well hello ealstan from across the hall she said when she was through and breathed brandy fumes into his face im ebbe what can i do for you dear want to borrow a cup of olive oil you should have knocked a long time ago did that mean what it sounded like ealstan had more urgent things to worry about i dont mean to bother you he began as he had to his other neighbor oh youre not bothering me at all ebbe broke in aye shed been drinking brandy all right rather desperately ealstan plunged ahead have you seen my wife today she should have been waiting for me when i got home but she isnt im worriedshes expecting a baby no darling i havent seen a soul todaytill you ebbe answered but why dont you come on in anyway if shes not there maybe ill do ealstan fled back inside his own flat he barred the door as if all the algarvians in forthweg were after him he wondered if ebbe would come knocking in turn to his vast relief she didnt but that relief quickly passed the algarvians in forthweg werent after him they were after vanaiand he was horribly afraid they had her he ate barley bread and olive oil and salted garlictangy almonds for supper washing the food down with harsh red wine then instead of talking and laughing and probably making love with vanai he spent the longest loneliest most miserable night hed ever passed he might have slept a little on the other hand he might not have too when dawn came he made a breakfast much like his supper then yawning he started back to pybbas pottery someonemore likely several someoneshad scrawled a new graffitohabakkukon walls and fences dully he wondered what the nonsense word meant nothing in forthwegian algarvian or classical kaunian he was sure of that pybba glared when he got to work youre late he rasped as he did most mornings whether ealstan was or not then he took a longer look at his bookkeeper powers above who hit you over the head with a rock i wish somebody had ealstan answered he wasnt late anything buthe and pybba had the offices to themselves my wife wasnt home when i got there she still isnt i think the redheads have grabbed her why in blazes would they want her the pottery magnate demanded you two didnt just have a fight or something no ealstan said flatly why would they want her shes kaunian thats why hed never told his boss that pybba hated algarvians aye but he had no great use for blonds now pybba stared at him eyes big as the saucers he turned out by the tens of thousands oh you fool he cried you great stupid fool habakkukthe first habakkuk the nameship of what would be a growing classglided east along a ley line not far from the island kingdom of sibiu the hobnails in the soles of leinos boots dug into the great vessels icy deck the kuusaman mage smiledno he grinned he was as proud of habakkuk as if hed invented her along with a good many other kuusaman and lagoan mages he had ships had sailed the seas for centuries uncounted ships aye but none like habakkuk ships had been wood and canvas riding wind and wave then as magecraft and manufacturing grew more sophisticated theyd been iron and steel traveling the ley lines of the worlds energy grid in defiance of wind and wave now leino took another step his hobnailed boots bit into the icy deck again habakkuk was a thing of ice ice and a little sawdust for strength leino and his fellow mages had planed the top of an iceberg flat down in the icebergridden seas bordering the frigid austral continent theyd hollowed out chambers in the ice chambers that held men and supplies andthe point of the exercisefar more dragons than any ordinary ship could haul magecraft had shaped the habakkuk more magecraft propelled it along the ley lines and still more magecraft kept it from melting away to nothing as it sailed these warmer though still far from warm waters farther from the land of the ice people leino wondered what the natives of the tropical continent of siaulia would think if the habakkuk ever had occasion to sail there most of them had never seen any ice in all their lives let alone a great floating mountain of it that refused to disappear even in that bloodwarm sea high overhead a dragon screeched leino glanced up not in fear but in wariness lest it prove an algarvian beast diving to the attack but it wasnt it was painted in the kuusaman colors of skyblue and seagreen which made it hard to spot for a moment against the drifting clouds down it spiraled long snaky body short clawed limbs great batwings now gliding now beating long neck and fearsome bigeyed head so much ferocity all governed by a brain the size of a plumand by the dragonflier who sat strapped into his harness at the base of the beasts neck leinos shiver had nothing to do with the ice on which he trod or with the chilly quartering breeze facing the impersonal forces of magecraft was hard enough they would kill you only if you abused them or made a mistake with them dragons now dragons might kill you out of malice or simply because they forgot what a command meant with plumsized brains they were better at forgetting than remembering leino didnt think there was enough silver in the world to make him train to become a dragonflier but his countryman aboard the descending dragon handled his dangerous job with nonchalant competence he brought the beast down right where a gang of handlers waited for it one of the handlers chained the dragon to a stout iron stake fixed deep in the ice another tossed it chunks of meat yellow with crushed brimstone or scarlet from a coating of powdered cinnabar both of which helped the dragon flame strong and far the dragonflier unhooked himself and went off to report to his superior leino went below too the stairways and the corridors were cut from ice so were all the chambers opening onto the corridors the doors and their fittings were ordinary doors and fittings and some of the chambers had wall hangings inside to lend more privacy to what went on in them when leino walked into one of those chambers the four mages already inside looked up and nodded to him good morning leino said in classical kaunian two of the other wizards were kuusamans like himself the other two lagoans they shared the great island off the southeastern coast of the derlavaian mainland but did not share a language but every educated man who hailed from eastern derlavai or the island could use classical kaunian the common language of sorcery and scholarship and a good morning to you answered his countrywoman essi she pointed to a teapot above a spirit stove get yourself a cup if you care to i think i will leino smiled being inside all this ice makes me want to have something warm inside myself essi nodded we all feel that way now and again like leino like pekka his wifeof whom she reminded him more than a littleshe was short and slim with golden skin coarse black hair and a broad highcheekboned face with dark narrow eyes set at a slant a steaming mug of tea sat on the table in front of her aye so we do that was ramalho the senior lagoan mage of the pair here hed worked with leino on the habakkuk down in the land of the ice people lagoans sprang from algarvic stock ramalho was tall and fair and redheaded though a flattish nose said he might bear a little kuusaman blood he went on of course there is warmth and then there is warmth he took a swig from the flask on his hip his coppery ponytail bobbed at the base of his neck as he drank hed done that down in the austral continent too but never to the point where it interfered with his work after pouring himself a mug of tea leino sweetened it with honey and took a couple of big swallows before it started getting cold then he sat down at the place waiting for him at the table shall we begin he said we could have begun some little while ago had you got here on time said xavega the other lagoan mage i am so sorry mistress leino said inclining his head to her i did not realize you had an urgent engagement elsewhere really xavega it was no more than a minute or two said aalbor the last kuusaman mage in the chamber he was in his early forties a decade or so older than leino and was more inclined to be patient than sardonic patience didnt help here not least because xavega had so little herself she glared first at leino then at aalbor i might have known one kuusaman would stick up for another oh let it be by the powers above that wasnt aalborit was ramalho have you never been late in all your born days xavega glared at him too things should run properly she insisted by which she no doubt meant the way i want them to run leino sighed he didnt point that out aloud and wondered why well actually he didnt wonderhe knew he took another sip of tea to make sure the knowledge didnt show on his face xavega was too pretty for him to want to antagonize her too badly she had hair the color of burnished copper fine regular features large green eyes and a lush figure that seemed all the more spectacular to him because he was used to the sparer build of kuusaman women he was married aye and happily so but he owned an imagination that worked perfectly well let it lie ramalho repeated a little more sharply oh very well xavega said with poor grace some people though now leino had all he could do not to laugh out loud every time xavega opened her mouth she showed him how absurd his fantasies were she was one of those lagoans with no use at all for their eastern neighbors over the years lagoas and the land of the seven princes had quarreled a fair number of times as neighboring lands will when the derlavaian war broke out some few kuusamans had wanted to fight lagoas and not algarve fools leino thought he stole another glance at xavega odds were shed never look at him but he still enjoyed looking at her it might even have been better that she did despise him he was in less danger of landing himself in trouble this way do you suppose we might actually work the magic we all came here to work essi asked oh very well aalbor said imitating xavegas petulant tone so closely that leino essi and ramalho all laughed xavega sent the senior kuusaman mage a glare more venomous than any shed given leino as for leino himself he sighed however luscious xavegas body might be in getting it one also had to deal with her mind that came close to making it more trouble than it was worth before the three wizards from kuusamo began to incant they joined in a small not quite sorcerous ritual reciting before the kaunians came we of kuusamo were here before the lagoans came we of kuusamo were here after the kaunians departed we of kuusamo were here we of kuusamo are here after the lagoans depart we of kuusamo shall be here that little chant was in kuusaman not classical kaunian mages from the land of the seven princes had prefaced sorcerous operations with it for centuries leino had trouble imagining working deliberately planned magic without it ramalho and xavega knew what it was of course even if they didnt understand it as he usually did ramalho raised an amused eyebrow xavega said something in lagoan leino didnt speak much of the neighboring kingdoms language but both the sound of the words and ramalhos dismayed expression made him doubt shed paid kuusamo a compliment aalbor returned to classical kaunian let us begin all five mages pulled off the amulets they wore and held them in their hands leinos like those of essi and aalbor was of silver set with moonstones and pearls xavega and ramalho used gold charms with lodestones and amber to feel for and tap the power of the ley lines lagoan sorcery was of the algarvic school more closely related to that of sibiu and algarve itself than to that of lagoas island neighbor but the style and substance of the amulets and the charms the mages used to activate them were only means to an end however much the means differed they could and did work together toward the same end as leino drew sorcerous energy from the ley line and applied it to keeping the habakkuks icy structure solid and secure he felt the energy also flowing into essi and aalbor into ramalhoaye and into xavega too they channeled it to the ship sensing what was comparing that to the pattern they all held in their minds of what should be and correcting the discrepancies they found they werent the only team with such a responsibility keeping the habakkuk afloat took a lot of magecraft leino shook his head as that thought occurred to him it wasnt strictly true ice floated but keeping the habakkuk afloat as something more than a slowly melting lump of ice took a lot of magecraft at last leino and his comrades looked at one another have we done all that wanted doing they asked one another without words have we shored up the ship for another day again without words they agreed they had will anything go wrong because of something we have failed to do that was a clear negative xavega was the first to speak aloud with unmistakable relief we are finished we have finished she pushed back her chair and strode out of the chamber almost of their will rather than his leinos eyes followed her like other algarvic peoples lagoans wore kilts xavegas showed off quite a lot of elegantly turned leg with another sigh leino got up too and poured himself a fresh cup of tea it wasnt what he wantedwell it wasnt all of what he wantedbut it would have to do four hundred years before king plegmund of forthweg had been the mightiest monarch in eastern derlavai his armies went from triumph to triumph in algarve to the east and in unkerlant to the west even nowadays his name was one to conjure with in forthweg and the algarvians had conjured with it recruiting plegmunds brigade from forthwegians who still wanted to go to war despite their kingdoms defeat sidroc wondered what he would be doing if the redheads hadnt organized the brigade something boring with his father hengist back in gromheort he supposed whatever else he was down here in the duchy of grelz in southern unkerlant he wasnt bored one of the algarvian officers who led plegmunds brigade blew a piercing blast on his whistle and shouted forwardin algarvian of course forward sidroc went on snowshoes because some of the drifts were higher than his head his sigh briefly raised a young fogbank around his face in gromheort whole winters would go by without snow on the ground in unkerlant it sometimes seemed a day couldnt pass without a new blizzard mezentio sidroc shouted as he slogged forward hurrah for king mezentio he yelled in algarvian not forthwegian plegmunds brigade might have been named for a forthwegian king but it used the occupiers language yelling in algarvian also lessened the chances that a redhead would take him for an unkerlanter and blaze him by mistake he and his countrymen looked more like the enemy than they resembled their allies and paymasters the unkerlanters holed up in the hamlet ahead didnt intend to be run out they had a couple of eggtossers in there and hurled death back at the men of plegmunds brigade and the algarvians with them the eggs burst when they struck releasing blasts of sorcerous energy and sending fragments of their metal eggshells whistling through the air like flying scythe blades when eggs started bursting close to sidroc he flopped down on his belly in the snow chunks of sharp metal screeched past above his head not far away somebody shrieked and then started cursing in forthwegian cursing was something not subject to military discipline urra shouted the unkerlanters in the village swemmel king swemmel urra their word for king wasnt much different from sidrocs he understood it the unkerlanters sounded raucous and drunk sidroc had some spirits in a flask on his belt too he wish he were drunk stupid and mean he didnt have enough in the flask for that worse luck forward the algarvian officer shouted again we have to keep moving we have to drive them back herborn will be ours again herborn was the capital of the duchy of grelz herborn had been the capital of the algarvian puppet kingdom of grelz till swemmels soldiers recaptured it a couple of months before theyd captured king raniero toothe cousin mezentio had put on the throne of grelz captured him and boiled him alive mezentio sidroc yelled and got to his feet again mezentio ceorl snowshoed forward beside him like more than a few men whod joined plegmunds brigade hed been a robber a bandit before the algarvians werent fussy about such things not even a little eggs fell on the village too kicking up fountains of snow sidroc whooped when some of the thatchcovered roofs caught fire sending columns of black smoke into the gray sky unkerlanter soldiers ran through the streets they were awkward and bowlegged on their snowshoes just as sidroc was on his he raised his stick to his shoulder thrust his right index finger out through the open seam in his mitten and rammed it into the sticks activation hole the beam leaped forth from the other end he hoped it bit an unkerlanter swemmels soldiers were blazing back at the men of plegmunds brigade and the algarvians too puffs of steam rose from the snow where their beams missed sidroc and his comrades the screams that rang out said not all the beams had missed sidroc did his best not to think about that even when a beam zipped past his head so close he smelled thunderstorms for a moment a few inches more to the left and sidroc shook his head im not thinking about that curse it he spied more movement in the village he raised his stick again then lowered it swearing as vilely as he could sergeant werferth saw that movement too and also knew it for what it was behemoths he shouted in algarvian and followed that with his own foul forthwegian werferth was no youngster looking for adventure like sidroc nor a ruffian two jumps ahead of the constables like ceorl hed been a sergeant in the forthwegian army before the algarvians smashed it as far as sidroc could see hed joined plegmunds brigade simply because he liked being a soldier he would never make officers rank not in the brigadehe wasnt an algarvian of course he wouldnt have made officers rank in the forthwegian army eitherhe wasnt a nobleman but sidroc didnt have much time to worry about werferth the behemoths now they were really something to worry about they lumbered forward each one with enormous snowshoes on its feet each one with a surcoat that made it harder to spot flapping over its chainmail each one with its great curved horn sheathed in iron to make it all the more sharp and deadlyand each one mounting a crew of armored unkerlanters who served either a heavy stick or an eggtosser that made the behemoth deadly far beyond the reach of its horn sidroc threw himself down in the snow again a footsoldier could blaze down a behemothif he put a beam right in its eye what were the odds not worth betting he tried to knock over the unkerlanter footsoldiers who ran forward with the beasts he had a better chance of that where are our behemoths he shouted eggs burst around the unkerlanter animals but only a direct hit was likely to slay one the best way to fight behemoths was with other behemoths where are our behemoths that was ceorl and that was alarm in his voice the summer before algarve had lost far more behemoths than she could afford to lose trying to smash the unkerlanter salient around the town of durrwangen since then the redheads hadnt had enough to meet the unkerlanters onslaughtwhich was one great reason swemmels soldiers had pushed so far east since the battles around durrwangen the algarvians had come up with a fair number of behemoths for the counterattack aimed at herbornwhich was one great reason mezentios soldiers had been able to head west again juvs of darkness if however they didnt get some behemoths right here pretty soon some of mezentios soldiers and a good many forthwegians whod been rash enough to join them were going to have a very thin time of it indeed an egg burst right on top of an unkerlanter behemoth all the eggs it had been carrying for its tosser burst too a great flash of light an enormous clap of thunder only a hole in the grounda shallow hole in the ground for it was frozen hardshowed where the beast had been the unkerlanters who served that eggtosser couldnt have known what hit them sidroc cheered he didnt raise his head to do it though plenty of king swemmel s soldiers remained alive flame enveloped another behemoth and its crew this time sidroc saw the dragon that flamed the beast it was painted in green red and white algarvian colors he cheered again the redheads had been short of dragons since durrwangen too though not to the same degree as theyd been short of behemoths but the unkerlanter behemoth crews who served heavy sticks also blazed at the algarvian dragons their beams were strong enough to burn through silvery belly paint and the armoring scales beneath a dragon slammed into the snow it thrashed for a long time before it died its great tail sent a couple of unkerlanters spinning smashed and broken to their deaths the dragonflier though had surely died at that first crushing impact with most of the enemy behemoths dead algarvian officers blew their whistles their imperative cry rang out again forward sidroc would sooner have stayed where he was and let somebody else take the chances but along with the other troopers from plegmunds brigade and along with the algarvians too no denying the redheads had spirithe scrambled to his feet and went forward even as he did he wondered why he didnt particularly care about clearing the unkerlanters from the village ahead he didnt even particularly care about retaking herborn hed seen enough battered unkerlanter villages and towns and cities to last him the rest of his days what do i care about then he wondered blazing at an unkerlanter in a snow smock not much different from his own the unkerlanter toppled sidroc whooped and slogged on why am i giving these buggers the chance to do to me what i just did to that poor whoreson he whooped again when ceorl blazed an unkerlanter he didnt even like ceorl and he knew full well the ruffian had no use for him when they werent up against swemmels soldiers oddly that gave him an answer of sorts i cant let the fellows who are in this with me down if he stayed behind theyd think he was a coward and their opinions were the only ones that mattered to him these days his mother was dead killed when the algarvians took gromheort his father remained back in forthweg and had no real understanding of what he was doing here hed killed his cousin leofsig in a brawl hed brawled with leofsigs brother ealstan tooand ealstan from what he gathered had run off with a kaunian tart leofsig and ealstans father and mother and sister hated him who was left then but the men alongside whom he fought more algarvian dragons swooped down on the unkerlanters behemoths died under the eggs they dropped and from the flame that burst from their jaws the handful of behemoths that survived had had enough and lumbered off toward woods beyond the village the trees helped shelter them from dragon attacks forward shouted the algarvian officers and forward went the algarvian footsoldiers and the men of plegmunds brigade they overran the village king swemmel s troopers had defended so fiercely some of the redheads had weapons sidroc hadnt seen before small pottery jugs that they flung at their foes and that burst like miniature eggs i want some of those when can we get em he asked sergeant werferth when the algarvians have enough to spare for their poor relations werferth answered sidroc swore and kicked at the snow the sergeant was bound to be right some soldiers pushed on down the snowcovered road toward herborn othersthe less luckywere ordered into the woods to go after the last few unkerlanter behemoths and the footsoldiers with them werferth had never been given to wild flights of optimismwhat veteran sergeant was but now he said maybe we really will drive these sons of whores out of herborn looks like weve got a lot of em in a pocket here i wouldnt mind sidroc said but whatll the algarvians do for a new king of grelz whod be daft enough to want the job after what happened to the old one before the sergeant could answer the algarvian officers whistles started screeching again but instead of yelling forward as they had since the drive on herborn began the redheads shouted by the left flank crystallomancers say theres an unkerlanter attack coming in we have to hold we cant let swemmels men out of the box weve shoved em into by the left flank by the left flank werferth echoed loudly then he sighed somethings gone wrong somewhere sidroc only shrugged not like its the first time he too turned to the left count sabrino had fought as a footsoldier during the six years war which ended almost thirty years before the derlavaian war broke out that put the colonel of dragonfliers well up into his fifties these days he was more than twice the age of most of the men in the wing he commanded when the wing worked hard as it was working hard now he felt the weight of every one of those years too im still strong he thought as he spooned up boiled oats with onions and carrots and chunks of meat cooked into them like every algarvian fighting in unkerlant hed long since given up asking what the meat was better not to know am still strong curse it in a standup fight i can take most of my men but that wasnt what left him feeling like an antiquity in the museum back in trapani the youngsters he led could get by with irregular meals and not enough sleepand much of that at odd hoursand stay fresh he couldnt not any more a hard stretch of flying left him feeling as if he were moving underwater he had trouble trusting himself to make the right decisions when he was too worn to see straight captain orosio one of his squadron leadersthe only one whod been with the wing when the war was newgave him a sympathetic look when he complained my guess is your wounds still troubling you sir orosio said youre a gentleman sabrino said and gave orosio a seated bow by his pedigree orosio wasnt much of a gentleman or he would have been a colonel with a wing of his own sabrino flexed his shoulder it did still pain him his wounded dragon had come down behind unkerlanter lines and hed got blazed escaping swemmels men aye youre a gentleman but its more than that i cant stand having my life turned upside down a new way every day as easily as i could when i was your age and thats all there is to it thats not so good sir orosio lacked much of the spirit of fun that most algarvians had serious and sober as usual he went on war does what it wants to do not what you want it to do really sabrino did his best to look astonished i never would have noticed he hoped orosio would laugh he feared orosio would believe him he never found out either way before the squadron leader could react a crystallomancer stuck his head into the tent nodded to sabrino and said sir brigadier blosio from army headquarters would speak to you would he sabrino said the crystallomancer nodded with a sigh sabrino got to his feet the next interesting question is would i speak to him he didnt scandalize the young mage any further but got up and followed him off to his tent it had been cold inside the mess tent as soon as sabrino poked his head out the flap the unkerlanter winter stabbed icy knives into the marrow of his bones this wouldn t have bothered me so much when i was half my age either he thought bitterly dragons crouched in the snow chained to the iron spikes that kept them from flying off and doing something stupid on their own dragon handlers moved among them keeping them fed this wasnt a proper dragon farm not the way the manuals back in algarve said one should be organized it was the best worn overtaxed men could do ever since cottbus failed to fall in the first winter of the campaign against unkerlant the whole war in the west had been one improvisation after another each seeming more desperate than the last the crystallomancer ducked into his own tent with a sigh of relief sabrino followed a brazier in there warmed the air all the way up to frigid a certain pungency in the air said the brazier was burning behemoth dung rather than charcoal one more improvisation sabrino sat down on what had probably been some unkerlanter peasants milking stool and peered into the crystal brigadier blosios image looked out at him sabrino took some consolation in noting that blosio looked miserably cold too reporting as ordered sir he said what do you need from my wing you know how our drive for herborn has cut off a good many unkerlanter soldiers blosio said as if doubting sabrino knew any such thing aye sir sabrino answered stolidly still a good many in front of us too we just tore up some behemoths trying to come through a peasant village and smash in the head of our column with a typically extravagant algarvian gesture brigadier blosio waved that away as if it were of no account he explained why theyre trying to break out and smash through our columns when the unkerlanters surrounded herborn the algarvians and grelzers had tried to do the same thing theyd failed sabrino asked the obvious question here what do their chances look like blosios shrug was as unrestrained as his wave had been neither one of our columns is as strong as one might wish and weve cut off a lot of unkerlanters but we have to do what we can you know oh indeed sabrino nodded in case youre wondering sir my wing has twentyone dragons ready to fly had the wing been at full strength it would have had sixtyfour it hadnt been at full strength or anywhere close for a couple of years brigadier blosio shrugged again thats how things are colonel and theyre not getting any better trapani is ordering some of our dragons taken out of the west and brought back home to algarve the way things are now the lagoans and kuusamans are pounding our southern cities flat from sibiu because weve hardly any beasts to put in the air against them thats not good sir count sabrino reckoned that a commendable understatement the way things are now the unkerlanters are pounding our armies here flat because we havent got enough beasts to put in the air against them we have to try there blosio said we have to try here too sabrino knew his protest wouldnt change anything and blosio had a point king mezentio couldnt very well let algarve itself take a beating for one thing people back home might sour on the war if they kept getting hit without seeing their countrymen hit back for another the eggs the kuusamans and lagoans dropped hit manufactories that made things the army needed and also slew the mages without whom sabrinos men would have had no eggs to drop and the algarvian footsoldiers would have had no sticks with which to blaze then go out and try to put paid to that unkerlanter counterattack blosio said thats the best thing your wing can do for algarve he gave map coordinates aye sir sabrino said resignedly he wasnt sure blosio heard him the brigadiers image vanished from the crystal it flared for a moment before becoming an inert globe of glass sabrino nodded to the crystallomancer thanks on second thought he didnt know why he was thanking the young mage because of the crystal sabrino now stood a better chance of getting killed out into the cold again he shouted for his men they knew he was giving them no great giftonly the chance to die before their time but knowing that they affected not to they scrambled onto their dragons and fastened the harnesses that held them safe as if they were going on a lark not into battle sabrino also strapped himself into the harness at the base of his dragons neck he knew he could die if any little thing went wrong how vividly he knew it was another reminder of his years he also knew his dragon like most algarvian beasts hadnt been getting enough quicksilver its flames wouldnt reach so far as they would have with more of the vital mineral in its system had algarve taken the unkerlanter city of sulingen had algarve seized the vital cinnabar mines south of sulingen had that happened mezentios men wouldnt have been pushed back into grelz a dragon handler slipped the chain that held sabrinos beast to its stake the colonel of dragonfliers hit his mount in the side of the neck with his goad the dragon screeched furiously flapped its great leathery wings and bounded into the air looking back over his shoulder sabrino watched the rest of the dragons in the wingall of them painted in varying patterns of green red and whitefollowing him he murmured the charm that activated the crystal he carried with him so he could give his squadron commanders the map square the wing was ordered to attack they passed it on to their dragonfliers so did sabrino with gestures and pantomiming maybe ill go on the stage after the war is over he thought and laughed at himself he laughed doubly by all appearances the war would go on forever the landscape below did nothing to contradict that it was a chiaroscuro blend of snow and smoke and soot all the villages and a lot of stretches of forest had been fought over two three four times whoever finally won the war the grelzer peasantry would be generations recovering from it fresh columns of smoke rising into the sky would have told him where the heavy fighting was even without the coordinates hed got from brigadier blosio he urged his dragon toward those columns urqed meant hitting it with the goad harder and harder till it did what he wanted every once in a while a dragon would have enough of that and flame its flier off its back dragons were trained not to do that from the moment they hatched but everyone who had anything to do with them knew they were too stupid and too vicious to be very reliable sabrinos dragon obeyed now captain orosio s image tiny but perfect appeared in the wing commanders crystal orosio said by the powers above sir thats a cursed broad front the unkerlanters have opened up how many of them are there anyhow i asked brigadier blosio the same question sabrino answered i gather were supposed to find out by experiment orosio said something pungent and abruptly broke the etheric connection as soon as sabrino spotted swarms of unkerlanters trying to force their way north and east through a wavering line of algarvian defenders he ordered his dragons to the attack they swooped low on an advancing column of behemoths dropping eggs among them and flaming down several sabrinos dragon didnt have to be urged to attack restraining it making it attack when and where he wanted it to was harder but he managed it was when he made the beast gain altitude for another pass at the enemy that he gasped in horror the column of behemoths his wing had assailed was one of dozens perhaps one of hundreds all with footsoldiers moving with them and in support of them the algarvians hadnt cut off a few brigades theyd tried to surround a whole army and a pugnacious one too a man who hooked a salmon would eventually pull it to shore a man who hooked a leviathan would be hauled out to sea and never seen again unless he threw away the line in a hurry but who would do that soon enough in any case his countrymen couldnt throw away the line king swemmel s soldiers gripped them too closely for that all they could do was hang on tight and hope for the best they wouldnt hold back this unkerlanter attack sabrino could see as much that meant they wouldnt recapture herborn either which raised an interesting question or a couple who was fisherman here who fish and whod caught whom skarnu had discovered it was much harder to join in the underground fight against algarve with a small baby in tow hed been fighting the redheads since the war began first as a captain in king gainibus army and then after algarvian behemoths and dragons shattered the valmieran forces in what wasnt quite battle but could nonetheless have got him killed at any moment gedominu started to cry merkela plucked her son and skarnus out of the cradle she checked to see if he was wet her grunt said he wasnt she undid the top three toggles on her tunic and shrugged it off her shoulder to bare a breast that was what the baby had wanted sure enough hes hungry skarnu remarked merkela nodded the motion made some of her blond hair flip down onto the babys face she brushed it aside with her free hand hes getting bigger and stronger every day she said he needs to get bigger and stronger even if we lose the fight against mezentios whoresons powers above forbid it skarnu exclaimed and his fingers twisted in a protective gesture that went back to the days when valmiera was a province of the kaunian empire and algarve a woodland full of barbarous tribes merkela went on as if he hadnt spoken even if we lose gedominu will carry on the fight against the algarvians when he grows to be a man she stroked the babys head which looked bald but in fact had a thin fuzz of fine blond hair even paler than hers or skarnus hes sucking in hatred for the redheads along with my milk she was implacable as an avalanche gedominu was named for her husband the old farmerhed been twice merkelas agehad taken in skarnu and his veteran sergeant when he could have turned them over to the algarvians after the valmieran army surrendered gedominu the man not the boy had gone raiding against the redheads himself and hed been taken hostage and blazed after one of those raids killed an algarvian cavalryman with a trip line skarnu wondered whether he would have ended up in merkelas arms even if the algarvians hadnt killed her husband she was a farmwoman and he a marquis but that had nothing to do with the way they were drawn to each other he didnt suppose her wedding vows would have had anything to do with it either but she wasnt just his lover before shed got pregnant shed fought alongside him count simanu whod been in bed with the redheads was dead largely because of the two of them and now now skarnu stared at the walls of the cramped little flat he and merkela and gedominu shared it was a far cry from the mansion in which he and his sister krasta had lived before the derlavaian war broke out and it was almost equally far in a different way from the farmhouse whose mistress merkela had been with a sigh skarnu said ukmerge isnt much of a town merkelas lip curled she spoke quietly so she wouldnt bother gedominu but didnt bother hiding her venom i never wanted to live in pavilosta when i went there on market days but ukmerge makes pavilosta look like it was one of the kings pleasure palaces even had he wanted to skarnu would have had trouble arguing with that pavilosta was a pleasant little market town or perhaps village it still kept much of the air of the countryside that was its reason for being in ukmerge they made shoes the town stank of leather people either worked in one of the two big shoe manufactories or sold things to those who did and the folk who filled the manufactories also filled grim blocks of flats like this one gedominu let merkelas nipple slide out of his mouth she put a cloth on her shoulder then raised the baby to it and patted his back he rewarded her with a belch and a little sour milk she laughed at him when he spit up wiping his mouth she said you thought you were going to ruin my tunic didnt you you thought so but i fooled you gedominu replied with a series of noises from the other end merkela laughed again ruefully this time you cant stay ahead of a baby no matter how hard you try give him to me ill change him skarnu said hed discovered she scowled at him if he left her to do all the work with the baby as he cleaned gedominus bottom and put a fresh cloth around it he went on as long as we stay ahead of the algarvians thats what counts merkela shook her head weve got to do more than that that was good enough when you pulled me off the farm before the redheads grabbed mepowers below eat your cursed count amatu for betraying me to them it was good enough when we got out of erzvilkas after their mages tracked us there but its not good enough any more now i want to hit back again so do i skarnu said but the underground isnt very strong here in ukmerge merkelas lip curled again this time with contempt as complete and automatic as krasta could have shownwhich was saying a great deal shoemakers she sneered as she set her tunic to rights they dont care whether theyre making shoes for their own people or for the algarvians that was an unkind judgment on the folk of ukmerge but also skarnu feared an accurate one the shoe manufactories had missed hardly a days work after the valmieran army abandoned the town and the algarvians marched in leyline caravans carried endless crates of marching boots west to algarve for king mezentio s soldiers to wear as merkela said the shoemakers got paid no matter who wore what they made gedominu looked up at skarnu and smiled skarnu smiled back he could hardly help it his son hadnt been smiling very long every time gedominu did it was as if hed discovered the idea of being happy for the very first time and wanted everyone around him to be happy too then smiling still the baby proceeded to ruin the cloth skarnu had just pinned into place around his middle skarnu said something rather more pungent than the odor wafting from gedominu merkela laughed and asked do you want me to change him this time its all right skarnu shook his head i havent even washed my hands yet he cleaned the baby off again then tossed the sodden stinking rag into a pail that held a good many others the pail fortunately had a tightfitting lid skarnu shut it and then did wash up wondering all the while if gedominu would make yet another mess someone knocked on the door skarnu and merkela both froze knocks on the door these days were all too likely to mean trouble skarnu had acquired a small stick from some highly unofficial sources as a footsoldier or even as a farmer hunting vermin or after small game for the pot he would have despised it but it could knock over a man at short range and what more did somebody on the run need who is it he asked if he didnt like the answer hed find out exactly what the little stick could do tytuvenai said the man on the other side of the door that wasnt a mans name it was the name of a town not too far from ukmerge underground leaders often called themselves by the names of the towns where they harassed the algarvians it made them harder for the redheads to identify skarnu knew a fellow whod called himself tytuvenai the man in the hallway asked that you pavilosta aye warily skarnu opened the door if tytuvenai was an algarvian captive king mezentio s men would get an unpleasant surprise but the fellow from the underground stood there alone well come in skarnu said and closed the door after him my thanks tytuvenai said he nodded to merkela hello milady ive heard somewhat of you youve tweaked the algarvians a time or two yourself if even half what they say about you is true they deserve worse than tweaking merkela said with a scowl by the powers above they deserve worse than what theyve given our kaunian cousins in forthweg and i want to give it to them merkela had no compromise in her not when it came to the algarvians and not when it came to anything else either what are you doing here skarnu asked his unexpected guest i have some news that might interest you tytuvenai seemed unperturbed at skarnus suspicions anyone who wasnt suspicious these days of course was likely either a fool or a dupe go on skarnu said good news and bad news actually the other man from the underground told him the good news is that count amatu whom i gather you got to know better than you wanted to is no more he met with an unfortunate accident in priekule not long ago that is good news skarnu exclaimed it was such good news he went into the cramped little kitchen got out three glasses and poured peach brandy into them after he brought them out he raised his and said heres to amatus untimely demise if id known he would go over to the algarvians id have killed him myself and saved whoever else it was the trouble they all drank merkela asked whats the bad news then instead of directly answering her tytuvenai swung his gaze back to skarnu the bad news is he was killed coming home from marchioness krasta s mansion from my sisters mansion skarnu said and tytuvenai nodded skarnu knocked back the rest of the brandy in his glass at a gulp i dont know why it surprises me he remarked and then shook his head it doesnt surprise me curse it for years shes been sleeping with that algarvian colonel whos come after me why wouldn t she invite amatu in for tea one of these days youll have your revenge against your sister merkela said may it be soon may it be strong aye may it be so skarnu said he would never forget the shocked betrayal hed felt when he saw krastas name and colonel lurcanios linked in a news sheet that had come down from priekule to pavilosta now that the lagoans and kuusamans are flying dragons out of sibiu and from their own island theyll knock that mansion into a pile of rubble tytuvenai said heres hoping anyway with a nod to skarnu and another to merkela he left as abruptly as hed arrived skarnu barred the door so may it be just as he said it merkela said no skarnu shook his head what her stare was fierce and angry like a hawks you have no sister weve been through this before i know skarnu said impatiently but i still dont want dragons dropping eggs on the mansion its not just krastas its mine too one of these days after the war is won i want to bring you there you and gedominu too hes my heir after all now merkelas eyes widened hed never said anything like that before she knew he was a marquis but he usually played it down she started to laugh me a peasant whose folk have been peasants since dirt in a noblemans mansion in priekule thats daft skarnu shook his head not when i love you and not when youve fought for valmiera if that doesnt make you more noble than my precious sister i dont know what would he took her in his arms theyd started making love again cautiously a couple of weeks before there was nothing cautious about it this time along with his partner oraste bembo tramped through the streets of gromheort looking around at the grimy battered forthwegian city the plump algarvian constable said curse me if im not glad to be back what here oraste was a man of few but strong opinions youre out of your stinking mind not me bembo said not a bit of it tricarico was even gloomier than this place is and all my friends are here oraste snorted like youve got friends the only one of us whos ever got leave since they sent us to this miserable place and it wasnt good enough for you are you an idiot or just an ingrate aye rag on me as much as you want but i was there and you werent bembo said seemed like everybody was too worried and working too hard to have a good time he nodded liking the taste of the words thats just how it was sure enough if a tart laid you for free youd complain because you didnt like her negligee oraste jeered speaking of which even looking at algarvian women had to be worth going home for these forthwegian dames are built like bricks and the long tunics they wear might as well be tents well that wasnt so bad bembo said hed done a lot more looking than touching but he wouldnt embarrass himself by admitting as much to his partner did i tell you saffa had somebodys baby only four times now or is it five oraste returned if you ask me youre just jealous on account of she didnt have yours bembo walked the next block in wounded silence oraste had been teasing him but that blaze hit entirely too close to the mark he wouldnt have minded had the pretty little sketch artist had his baby or at least done something with him that made it possible for her to have a baby but she hadnt wanted to do anything of the sort not with him that shed done it with someone else was all the more galling most days his definition of an ideal tour on the beat would have been to have nothing to do but cadge food and drink from the bakers and taverners on the streets he patrolled today though he was glad to hear a noisy quarrel ahead so was oraste he pulled his bludgeon off his belt and slapped it into the palm of his hand lets see whats going on he said anticipation in his voice he liked breaking heads hed complained forthwegian women were built like bricks so was he unlike forthwegian women he was just about as hard as a brick too two men stood in the middle of the street screaming at each other caring nothing if they got in the way of wagons and carriages the first thing bembo noticed was that they looked very much alike save that one of them had a typical proud hooked forthwegian nose while that of the other fellow was shaped more like a tuber the second thing he noticed was that hed seen and spoken with the fellow with the ordinary nose before he didnt know whether oraste noticed the same thing if his partner did notice he didnt seem to care get out of the roadway you idiots before you get mashed flat oraste growled assuming the forthwegians would speak his language maybe he meant a wagon would squash them if they didnt move maybe he meant he would bembo knew which way he would have bet the forthwegians did understand algarvian they also understood what a constable bearing down on them with a bludgeon was likely to mean before oraste could do anything they would regret they hurried back onto the sidewalk now whats going on here bembo asked being partnered with oraste often made him take the role of sweet reason he resented that it wasnt one for which he was well suited my brother is a traitor said the forthwegian with a nose like a tuber my brother is a liar said the other forthwegian the one who looked familiar before bembo could say anything oraste used his bludgeon to point at the fellow whod spoken first every son of a whore is a liar not everybodys a traitor that means you start who are you whos he and if you two are brothers how come youre calling each other nasty names those were all questions bembo would have asked he wouldnt have asked them as if he intended to murder the forthwegian if he didnt like the answers maybe that made oraste a better constable than he was he didnt much care im hengist the forthwegian with the bumpy nose answered hes hestan why is he a traitor ill tell you why because his son ran off with a kaunian slut thats why i have no idea where ealstan is hestan said all i know is he left gromheort two years ago and i havent seen him or heard from him since left he ran off after he had a fight with my son my guess is he thought he murdered sidroc hengist said furiously and what were they fighting about sidroc got hit in the head but he finally got reminded or remembered they were fighting about a blond bitch named vanai thats what futter your son hestan shouted sounding even angrier than hengist talk about murdersidroc murdered my leofsig and nothing happened to him so now he thinks he can put a noose around ealstans neck too hold on slow down oraste said whos who again too many names all at once but bembo had heard all the names before he pointed to hestan this is the fellow who was talking with that brivibas bugger when i recognized his voice in spite of the magic that made him look like a forthwegian so oraste said but then a couple of beats behind bembo he began to catch up wait a minute that longwinded bastard was whatshernames granddad wasnt he thats right bembo nodded one of our officers who came through here not so long ago was looking for that vanai twist too hed had her when he was garrisoned in oyngestun and he wanted to take her west with him so he wouldnt have to sleep all by his lonesome but she never got pulled into gromheort remember shed skipped oyngestun before we cleaned out the place aye thats right oraste said i forgot how all the pieces fit together he glowered at hestan whats this nonsense about murder you were spewing it isnt nonsense the forthwegian said his sonhe spat at hengists shoesbeat mine to death with a chair in my own dining room why didnt he hang for it then oraste demanded hestan didnt answer right away when he didnt bembo did i recall that nasty business this sidroc item had just signed on with plegmunds brigade so nobody much cared what he did aye hes loyal to king mezentio hengist said unlike some people i could name bembo was less impressed than hengist had thought he would be most of whats in plegmunds brigade is stable scrapings you ask me he said orastes big head went up and down thats the truth half ofemd be in gaol if they werent in unkerlant hestan laughed hengist looked as if he hated bembo and oraste both but oraste wasnt finished still and all this fellowhe pointed at hestanhangs around with kaunians and his kids likely a kaunianlover too i say we run him in see if the bigwigs think hes worth keeping suits me bembo pointed to hestan you can come along quietlike or well make you unhappy and then youll come along anyway he jerked a thumb at hengist as for you pal get lost before we haul you in too hengist turned to go but not without a parting blaze his precious leofsig escaped from a captives camp he bribed officials to look the other way did he now bembo eyed hestan in a speculative way hed never been allergic to cash on the side or under the table but oraste said he wont get away with that not with us oraste had been known to take a bribe every now and then but only every now and then more often he preferred making people he nabbed suffer whether by beating them or just by letting the law take its course instead of giving them the chance to get out of their trouble since bembo couldnt very well take a bribe if oraste wouldnt he grabbed hestan by the arm and said come along you hed intended to sound fierce he suspected he sounded petulant instead hestan said i never thought i would wish anything ill on my brother in spite of what his son did to my family but now he shook his head powers below eat him and may they crunch his bones doing it aye hes a piece of work all right oraste agreed somebody ought to give him a good kick in the bollocks the forthwegian gave him a curious look youre arresting me but you sound like you hate him dont let it worry you bembo said oraste hates everybody oraste scowled but didnt deny it it was as near true as made no difference bembo felt that way himself a good deal of the time it was an easy attitude for a constable to take constables saw the worst of peoplewhen people were at their best they didnt need constables and algarvian constables in gromheort not only saw the worst of people they saw the worst of people who hated them as occupiers i havent really done anything you know hestan somehow still managed to sound mild and thoughtful even if your superiors decide that everything my dear brother says is truewhich it isnti havent done anything much bembo thought him likely to be right but he said thats for them to decide not for us well i cant tell you what to do thats certain the forthwegian said but wouldnt you rather have the silver i end up paying stick in your belt pouches otherwise it will just end up with people who have too much already that sort of argument made perfect sense to bembo he sent oraste a look of appeal oraste said if bembo here and me take you into that alley and beat you to death you dont pay anybody anything hestan licked his lips some constables made threats like that to run up the price oraste meant his hestan had the sense to realize as much he spoke carefully ive never harmed algarve the most ive tried to do is keep my family safe his laugh was bitter look how well that worked out one son dead one vanished off the face of the earth one son whos a kaunianlover oraste said odds were he reckoned murder a lesser crime but bembo said come here he drew oraste aside all the while eyeing hestan to make sure he didnt take off he spoke in a low but urgent voice we cant just kill this fellow hes a big blaze thered be riots maybe our heads could roll and hes got the loot to pay his way free once we hand him over dont you want some he didnt usually have the nerve to argue with oraste like that because he argued this time his partner seemed more than usually impressed oh all right oraste said gruffly but well squeeze him till his eyes pop well of course bembo said after that it was just a matter of haggling over the price two every day the sun rose on vanai she thanked the powers above for one more day of life after two algarvian constables in eoforwic seized her when the spell that let her look like a forthwegian wore off before she could get back to her flat shed expected to be shipped west and slaughtered right away the redheads saw the kaunians of forthweg as no more than a convenient source of life energy to fuel the sorceries they used to fight their evermoredesperate war against king swemmel of unkerlant but all theyd done so far was throw her into the kaunian quarter in eoforwic it was as if they were saying we dont need you in particular right this minute now that weve got you youre not going to get away again or maybe they were saying something worse maybe they were saying we can wait till you have your baby they well slay you both and get twice the life energy from you she walked out of the flat in which theyd stuck hera flat ironically bigger and finer than the one shed shared with ealstan and she had it all to herselfand went down to the street not too many people showed themselves in the kaunian quarter these days some of those who did had hair like hers formerly dyed black but now showing its blond roots theyd been caught trying to live their lives like anyone else too she walked toward the edge of the kaunian district it wasnt far only a couple of blocks but it was clearly marked and strongly guarded a constable pointed his stick at her and snarled get away from me or youre dead you stinking blond whore he wasnt even one of mezentios men he was young stocky swarthy blackbearded bignoseda forthwegian among forthwegians he even looked a little like ealstan whom she loved with all her heart but this fellow didnt love her the algarvians found plenty of forthwegians ready even eager to help hold down the kaunians that let the redheads send more of their own soldiers off to fight the unkerlanters how convenient for them vanai thought go on get away the forthwegian was so young his voice cracked but he was easily old enough to blaze her down or else keep coming he sounded as if he wanted her to im leaving she said hastily so as not to give him an excuse to do just that she turned and retreated letting out a sigh of relief as she put a building between her and the hothead shed had guards algarvian and forthwegian growl at her before but never an encounter like this i could escape she thought i could it would be easy if she still knew the spell that would let her look like a forthwegian she should have known it she was the one whod devised it reconstructed a botched charm in a cheap stupid book called you too can be a mage into sorcery that really did something she always kept a bit of dark brown yarn and a bit of yellow with her in case she got the chance but the guards wouldnt growl and snarl and curse if she approached the edge of the kaunian quarter while looking like a forthwegian they would blaze without warning theyd done it before no forthwegians were supposed to be inside the district and no kaunians were supposed to go outside it unless they were ushered forth to go to their doom since the redheads had stopped letting kaunians out vanai had wondered what she would do inside the quarter but the algarvians didnt bother with kaunianmanned manufactories maybe they should have had they been as efficient as swemmel of unkerlant claimed he was maybe they would have or maybe not they valued the kaunians only for the life energy they gave up on dying not for what they might accomplish alive and so whether the kaunians worked or not didnt seem to matter to mezentios men a young kaunian whod never dyed his hair nodded to vanai and said so you got caught on the outside did you aye she nodded then rested a hand on her bulging belly i think carrying a baby made the spell wear off faster than it should have whatever it was the spell gave out and i got nabbed too bad for you the young blond man said being a kaunian these days isnt much fun being a kaunian in forthweg never was much fun vanai answered but youre right of courseits worse now she paused in some surprise ill tell you one thing though speaking my own language again feels good shed used forthwegian not classical kaunian whenever she talked with anyone but ealstan out in eoforwic and more and more with him once she assumed her forthwegian disguise sure enough the young man scowled we can even write in our own language in here why not the penalty for writing in classical kaunian is death and the redheaded barbarians are going to kill us anyhow he laughed without any great mirth but then scowled again couldnt you speak kaunian with your man he pointed at her abdomen some she said but he washe isa forthwegian oh the young blond fellow looked revolted for a moment then his face froze he walked away from vanai as if she didnt exist back in oyngestun her home village both forthwegians and kaunians would have reacted the same way to the thought of a union between their people here in eoforwic in what had been the capital and most sophisticated city of forthweg such marriages and other alliances had been more readily tolerated back before the algarvians overran the kingdom so vanai had heard anyhow maybe the fellow shed been talking with had been dragged here from a little village of her own or maybe like some kaunians he was as blindly prejudiced against forthwegians as so many forthwegians were against kaunians she wandered aimlessly through the kaunian quarter for a while when the algarvians first herded the kaunians they hated into this little district it had been disastrously crowded it wasnt any more a lot of kaunians had already been shipped westand only the tiny handful of them lucky enough to escape their captors had ever come back to forthweg a lot had slipped out of the kaunian quarter sorcerously disguised as forthwegians before the redheads started getting wise to them vanai took a certain somber pride in that even though shed been caught shed helped a lot of her people go free but on the other hand even though shed helped a lot of her people go free shed been caught it all depended on how you looked at things a bell began to clang in a little square a couple of blocks away she hurried toward it so did plenty of other kaunians men women and children spilling out of blocks of flats and houses seeing all those blond heads around her vanai was very conscious of belonging to a separate people not for the first time she wondered what it would be like to live in valmiera or jelgava far to the east where almost everyone was of kaunian blood whatever the algarvians were doing to the jelgavans and valmierans they couldnt possibly stuff them into tiny districts and have their neighbors help keep them there she was sure of that and they couldnt possibly set up feeding stations in the middle of the district that bell might have summoned cattle on a farm the only difference was kaunians knew how to queue up here an algarvian said when vanai got to the head of the queue he gave her a chunk of barley bread a chunk of crumbly white cheese and some salted olives it wasnt fancy food but it was enough to keep her going till the next time the bell rang shed feared the redheads would starve the kaunians theyd trapped but that turned out not to be so the algarvians didnt care if forthwegians starved but if kaunians died of hunger before they could be sacrificed they were wasted as far as algarve was concerned and so they got something close to enough to eat vanai was just spitting out an olive pit when more bells began to chime these not in the kaunian quarter but all over eoforwic she needed a moment to understand what that meant then someone close by spelled it out for her exclaiming dragons unkerlanter dragons king swemmel s dragonfliers didnt come over eoforwic very often the capital of forthweg lay a long way east of land unkerlant still held and swemmels forces had trouble sparing dragons from the more urgent fight against algarve but every once in a while they would load eggs under some of their stronger beasts and pay a call on the city and the leyline junctions it contained the day was cool and cloudy with a threat of rain that made the unkerlanter dragons painted rockgray all the harder to spot only after vanai watched eggs fall from beneath a dragons belly and heard them burst not far from the kaunian quarter did she realize that standing in the street and watching wasnt the smartest thing she could do she ran into a block of flats and then down into the cellar even if an egg landed on the building that was the safest place she could go she wasnt the only one to see as much either plenty of other kaunians had got there ahead of her she wondered whether they lived in the block of flats or had fled there from the street as she had i hope every one of those eggs comes down right on an algarvians head an old woman said powers above make it so vanai exclaimed i wouldnt even mind too much if an egg came down on me a man said then the redheads couldnt use my life energy no vanai said i want to outlive them im going to have a baby i want my baby to outlive them too thats right the old woman nodded vigorously though vanai could hardly see her in the gloomy shadowfilled cellar thats the best revenge they lose their life energy and we keep ours that would have been the best revenge the only trouble was vanai hadnt the slightest idea how to make it real if the algarvians seized her if they took her from the kaunian quarter and threw her onto a leyline caravan and sent her to the barbarous wilds of unkerlant and slew her how could she fight back she couldnt she knew it too well unkerlanter eggs kept thudding down every so often one nearby would make the ground shake under her feet and the block of flats shake over her head king swemmel s dragonfliers still didnt come over eoforwic all that often no these last few raids though they were coming in larger numbers than before vanai hoped that meant they were doing more damage than before too she heard a different sort of thudnot the harsh roar of a bursting egg but the sound of something large hitting the ground after falling from a great height they blazed down a dragon the old woman said too bad vanai said oh too bad their eggs might kill us the man said and were sorry when they die of course vanai told him theyre trying to hurt the algarvians and thats the most important thing nobody in the crowded cellar presumed to disagree with her snow blew out of the west into colonel spinello s face winters in the north of unkerlant were less savage than in the south though still bad enough the algarvian officer had fought in both and had standards of comparison he also had a wound badge with a ribbon to show hed been blazed twice and puckered scars on his chest and his leg to prove he hadnt got it by paying off a clerk if anything he welcomed the snow it meant the ground got hard enough for proper maneuvering and he was convinced that gave the advantage to the brigade he commanded unkerlanter warfare was that of the bludgeon not the rapier yet the rapier could be more deadly slipping between a mans ribs to pierce his heart and kill him while hardly leaving a mark on his body listen to me he called to the soldiers within earshotand they did listen to him he was a bantam rooster of a man not very tall but proud and swaggering even by algarvian standards when he spoke men paid attention and so did women just for a moment he let himself think of fronesia the mistress hed acquired while recovering from his latest wound in trapani but his mistress was a distraction now the algarvian capital was a distraction too listen to me he repeated louder this time and more troopers in the muddy halffrozen trenches and holes in the ground turned their heads his way weve got to take pewsum back boys and were going to do it he pointed ahead toward the battered unkerlanter town a couple of miles to the west when hed first taken command of the brigade algarve had still held pewsum hed made his headquarters in the village of ubach a few miles farther west still king swemmel had spent a lot of lives pushing the front this far spinello hoped to spend far fewer repairing it he shook his head he had to spend far fewer repairing it for he couldnt spare that many algarvian lives we need pewsum he went on we need the leyline caravan depot there and we need the junction with other ley lines running north and south algarvian soldiers werent peasants too ignorant to write their names the more they knew about what wanted doing and why the better they fought weve got some behemoths spinello waved at the big whitedraped beasts i had to yell and scream and jump up and down to get em but i did it some of his soldiers grinned but he wasnt kidding the north had been the quiet front in unkerlant for quite a while most algarvian behemoths had been moved down to the south where the fighting was harder weve got some dragons laid on too that drew whoops from the men dragons were even harder to come by up here than behemoths were a trooper shouted and weve got our luck colonel well of course weve got our luck spinello answered shes standing right here next to me the soldiers cheered as fiercely as if they were attacking right then the pretty young kaunian girl named jadwigaiwho looked quite fetching in a broadbrimmed algarvian hat and a heavy cloak over her tunic and trousersblushed and smiled and waved to the men they cheered again harder than ever theyd brought her along with them after overrunning her village in western forthweg when the war against unkerlant was new and triumphant the brigade had always fought well since and jadwigai had become a sort of mascot for it nobodyd ever tried to force her into algarvianstyle kilts nobodyd ever tried to force himself on her either had anyone been so rash his own comrades would have put paid to himand odds were gruesomely spinello sighed fog trickling from his mouth and nostrils fronesia was a long way away he wanted jadwigai hed had a kaunian to keep his bed warm a girl named vanai when he was stationed in the forthwegian village called oyngestun jadwigai was even younger and even prettier but spinello kept his hands to himself he didnt want troubleand he did want to keep the brigade fighting hard he added and well have some special sorcery to help us when the attack goes in that was all he said about that he glanced over at jadwigai did she know that the algarvians who treated her like a princess slaughtered kaunians from forthweg by hundreds by thousands by tens of thousands to power the magics they hurled against the unkerlanters how could she not know but if she did she kept it to herself what went on in the mind behind that blueeyed smiling face spinello couldnt tell not being able to tell excited him too the brigade comes first he thought and then curse it he turned to major rambaldo one of his regimental commanders and asked what is the time major rambaldo pulled from his belt pouch an eggshaped windup clock smaller than his fist a triumph of the watchmakers art after glancing at the glassprotected dial he answered sir it is the very hour set for the attack then put your clock away and keep it safeand yourself too of course as rambaldo stowed away the little mechanical treasure colonel spinello drew from his own pouch a less complex tool a brass whistle he took a childish delight in loud noises and the whistle certainly made one a moment later he made another all by himself shouting forward you lazy whoresons at the top of his lungs stay safe colonel jadwigai called in good algarvian and blew him a kiss he waved his hat to her as he went forward he would have thought more of her good wishes had she not sent kisses to other soldiers who went past her he shrugged that was how things were she didnt belong to him she belonged to the brigade mezentio spinello yelled algarve he still favored his wounded leg a little as he trotted forward he could use it though which counted for more a lot of algarvians with wounds of one sort or another were back in active service these days the kingdom needed them too much for them to stay back a moment longer than they had to major rambaldo he of the fancy clockwork trotted along beside spinello he was half a head taller and correspondingly longer of leg he was also whipcord lean where spinello was stocky by algarvian standards and so seemed to be hanging back when he could have gone faster i wish wed hit them yesterday or even the day before he said not breathing hard we wouldnt have had the behemoths then spinello answered we wouldnt have had the dragons either or the kaunians to kill with jadwigai out of earshot he spoke frankly rambaldos shrug was a work of art even among algarvians who could say more with their hands and bodies than most folk could with words the unkerlanters wouldnt have had the extra day or two to dig themselves into pewsum either spinello grunted an unkerlanter detachment new in a place might be easily routed out a day later the job got harder two days later it could become impossible hed seen as much in sulingen and at the durrwangen bulge and a good many other places besides he hoped he wouldnt see it again here eggs burst in front of the advancing algarvians moments later eggs burst among them swemmels soldiers in pewsum had no intention of being dislodged algarvian behemoths lumbered forward to deal with the unkerlanters less mobile eggtossers and then the terrible beam from a heavy stick blazed through white surcoat and armor and flesh of three behemoths in quick succession the rest milled about in dismay before pulling back out of range the heavy sticks crew didnt bother burning down individual footsoldiers with it that would have been like smashing cockroaches with an anvil feeling very much like a cockroach spinello scuttled forward cherishing whatever cover he could find dragons painted in algarvian green red and white swooped down on pewsum that horrible heavy stick waited for them and swatted first one and then another out of the sky then more eggs burst around it and it fell silent but the dragons couldnt silence all the sticks and eggtossers around pewsum any more than the behemoths had and spinellos brigade stalled just outside the town taking casualties and unable to advance any farther huddled in a hole behind what was left of a stone fence spinello cursed the stubborn unkerlanter defenders well you were right major he called to rambaldo who sprawled not far away now we have to see what else we can do about it he raised his voice to a shout crystallomancer one of the young mages attached to the brigade hurried up aye sir put me through to the mages at the special camp spinello said were going to need the strong magic aye sir the crystallomancer repeated and took the glass globe from his pack after activating it he pushed it to spinello go ahead sir spinello spoke to the wizard whose image appeared in the crystal the mage nodded then he vanished the crystal flared and went inert spinello gave it back to the crystallomancer will we get what you want rambaldo asked well get what we need spinello answered and the regimental commander nodded the sorcerers at the special camp had had such requests many times before over the past two and a half years swemmel of unkerlant preached efficiency the algarvian mages practiced it rounding up however many kaunians they needed and slaying them didnt take long peering out from behind the stone wall spinello watched the ground shake in pewsum as if it were being visited by its own private earthquake but the magic the algarvians powered with kaunian life energy was potent beyond any mere temblor not only did buildings shudder and collapse but great fissures in the ground opened and closed gulping down men and even an unkerlanter behemoth and lambent purple flames shot up from the ground engulfing still more enemy soldiers and beasts spinellos whistle screeched along with those of the rest of the algarvian officers still able to advance forward he shouted and sprang to his feet himself now that the mages have staggered em lets knock em flat with a cheer the brigade went forward again the men had confidence no doubt of that some of them shouted jadwigai along with mezentio and algarve again spinello wondered what the pretty little kaunian mascot thought she was close enough to pewsum to have seen even to have felt the magecraft how could she not know whence it came but if she did how could she stay friendly to the algarvians who kept her could she pretend so well just to stay alive spinello didnt know he wondered if he ever would he also discovered not for the first time that counting on the unkerlanters to stay stodgy was no longer a paying proposition no sooner had his brigade burst from cover and rushed toward pewsum than king swemmel s mages unleashed against them the same sorcery the towns defenders had just suffered the unkerlanters didnt kill kaunians they got rid of their own old and useless and condemned but life energy was life energy the spell wreaked as much havoc on the algarvians as it had on the unkerlanters spinello fell to the ground as it shuddered beneath him algarvian soldiers shrieked as violet flames devoured them not twenty feet from spinello the earth opened up swallowing major rambaldo an instant later the crack slammed shut crushing him and his fancy ever so expensive windup clock spinello staggered to his feet once more but he could see at a glance that the assault on pewsum had failed he hung his head and kicked at the frozen dirt algarve had seen too many failures lately some small like this one some very great indeed when he wondered would his kingdom start seeing successes again leudast had spent a lot of time commanding a company while still a sergeant he was far from the only unkerlanter underofficer whod done that unkerlant often gave responsibility without giving rank to go with it that saved the paymasters moneyit saved them more than just the monthly difference between a sergeants rate and a lieutenants too for everyones pay was chronically in arrears but now leudast was a lieutenant himself it would have taken capturing a fugitive wouldbe king to get a born peasant bumped up to officers rank but hed done exactly that mezentios cousin raniero whod styled himself king of grelz had gone into swemmels stewpot and leudast wore two little brass stars on each of his tunics collar tabs he still commanded a company marshal rathar had promised him five pounds of gold for capturing raniero he hadnt seen any of it yet if he lived through the war maybe he would as a born peasant he knew better than to complain if he let people see he was unhappy he didnt know exactly what hed get but he had a good idea it wouldnt be the missing five pounds of gold at the moment he stood inside a peasant hut not much different from the one hed grown up in save that one wall and half the thatched roof had burned away with him stood the other lieutenants and sergeants commanding the companies in his regiment and captain recared the regimental commander recared looked preposterously young to be a captain the previous summer before the great battles in the durrwangen salient recared had looked preposterously young to be a lieutenant you know what we have to do men recared said in the abrupt tones that marked him not only for a city man but for an educated city man to boot weve stopped the redheads drive on herborn theyre not going to take it back from us no matter how much they want to and theyve stretched themselves thin trying too now we see if we can bite off the columns they used for their push well hurt em if we do leudast remarked his own accent said he came from the northeast not far from the forthwegian border and sounded particularly out of place down here in grelz recared smiled at him thats the idea sergeantuh lieutenant the worse that happens to the algarvians the better for unkerlant oh aye sir if anything leudast knew that better than his superior he was one of what couldnt be more than a handful of men whod fought the redheads since the first day of the war against them most of the soldiers whod served king swemmel on that now longvanished day were dead or captured or crippled leudast had been wounded only twice and put out of action for a few weeks of the slaughter around sulingen if that wasnt good luck what was all right then recared said weve got plenty of behemoths weve got plenty of dragons and if we need sorcery well manage that too when i shout forward we shall go forward we shall not halt until i shout stop gentlemen i do not intend to shout stop leudast and the rest of the company commanders looked at one another slow grins spread over their poorly shaved faces one of their number a sergeant said curse me if thats not an algarvian kind of thing to say makes it into a riddle like the others nodded recared said the algarvians have taught us some lessons in this war no doubt about it but that time is passing by the powers above it is now were the schoolmasters and well give them stripes for not learning the lieutenants all of them but leudast nodded again he and the sergeants looked blank they were peasants and knew little of schoolmasters lets go then recared said we can do it we will do it nothing is more efficient than victory king swemmel had been trying to make unkerlanters efficient throughout his reign as far as leudast could see the king hadnt had a lot of luck also as far as leudast could see saying the king hadnt had much luck was about the least efficient thing one of his subjects could do he pulled his cloak more tightly around him as he left the farmhouse hed known hard enough winters in the north of unkerlant down here in the duchy of grelzthe kingdom of grelz no more not after what had happened to raniero once swemmel had his waythe wind seemed full of icy knives do we hit the redheads lieutenant the redheads and the traitors i mean sergeant kiun asked hed been a common soldier when leudasts company captured raniero just as leudast had been a sergeant but kiun had been the one whod recognized that mezentios cousin wasnt just the algarvian colonel his uniform proclaimed him to be hed been promised a pound of gold along with his promotion he hadnt seen it yet either aye we do leudast answered high time we finish breaking out of this box theyve tried to put us in hed had to break out of algarvian encirclements before and counted himself lucky to have escaped with his life but this was different for one thing he and his comrades werent altogether cut off the redheads hadnt been able to slam the lid down on the box and for another there was more power here inside this box than was out there trying to contain it eggtossers began hurling their loads of death at the algarvians watching the bursts kick up snow and smoke in the distance leudast nodded to himself hed seen heavier poundingsespecially down in sulingen where his countrymen and the algarvians had hammered at each other till the redheads finally brokebut hed also seen what the algarvians were capable of in this particular fight theyd never flung so many eggs at the unkerlanter trenches dragons painted unkerlanter rockgray swooped down out of the sky dropping more eggs on the redheads and flaming men and behemoths they caught in the open few gaudy algarvian dragons rose to challenge them captain recared blew his whistle forward he shouted swemmel and unkerlant urra forward leudast echoed only then did he remember hed finally got his hands on an officers whistle he shrugged shouting would do forward urra and forward they went all of them shouting so they wouldnt blaze one another by mistake some of them didnt go forward very far but stopped beams as soon as they broke from cover some of the shouts turned to screams red flowed here and there on white snow flowed and quickly began to freeze back when things had gone well for the algarvians theyd always had a knack for flanking unkerlanter unitssometimes squads sometimes whole armiesout of position even after things started going not so well for them the redheads had kept that gift for showing up exactly where they would make the most trouble if they hadnt had it king swemmel s soldiers would long since have run them out of unkerlant leudast wished his countrymen showed a similar knack no matter what he wished the unkerlanters seemed to lack it as far as he could see unkerlanter forces too often hit the algarvians where they were strong and tried to bull through instead of hitting them where they were weak and going around had he been a general that was what he would have tried to do maybe the unkerlanter generals were trying to do it if so they didnt have it down yet on the other hand if you hit anything hard enough and often enough it would eventually fall over the unkerlanters had more eggtossers and dragons than their foes and they had many more behemoths behemoths on snowshoes were cursed awkward beasts going forward at an aggressive waddle and kicking up little clouds of snow at every stride but they went forward which was the point of the exercise wherever the algarvians tried to rally and with their usual skill and dash they tried again and againeggs from the tossers most behemoths carried and beams from the heavy sticks the rest bore on their backs smashed up strongpoints mezentio leudast had heard that defiant war cry more often than he could recall this time it came from a tiny village near the edge of a forest of snowcovered firs the enemy soldiers holed up in the village blazed at the advancing unkerlanters misses boiled steam from snow hits sent men sprawling bonelessly in death mezentio the shout rang out again and again but it didnt sound right algarvians yelled their kings name almost as if they were singing it these soldiers simply shouted it the same as they might have shouted swemmel the very same as they might have shouted swemmel leudast stiffened he shouted too those arent redheads those are fornicating grelzers men whod served the algarvian puppet kingdom of grelz couldnt very well shout raniero any more not after swemmel had boiled raniero alive a lot of the soldiers whod chosen to wear dark green tunics instead of rockgray had sneaked away from the fighting doing their best to pretend theyd been nothing but peasants or shopkeepers while the algarvians occupied grelz few who tried to surrender to swemmels soldiers succeeded none had joy of it afterwards but here some stubborn souls still did what they could to help mezentios cause forward leudast shouted again this time he remembered to blow the whistle lets give the traitors what they deserve kilted soldiers slipped away through the trees the grelzers were buying time for their algarvian comrades to get away maybe the men whod followed raniero and the dream of grelz as a kingdom of its own realized how little their lives were worth with the duchy back in swemmels hands and the kings inspectors sure to be hunting them down or maybe the algarvians were simply selling out their erstwhile allies leudast didnt care why the grelzers fought he just wanted to be rid of them as fast as he could so he could go after the escaping redheads his men converged on the village from three sides some of them had a shout of their own death to the traitors by the way the grelzers blazed there werent very many of them they didnt look like holding up the pursuit for long but as the men from leudasts company came close to the tumbledown shacks in which the enemy fought they got a nasty surprise what looked like small pottery jugs flew toward them and burst like miniature eggs when they hit the ground several soldiers howled as flying shards scored their flesh others hesitated and the attack wavered come on curse it leudast shouted i dont care what sort of toys theyve gotthere cant be more than a dozen of them he got up and went on toward the hamlet if his men didnt follow he wouldnt last long follow they did the grelzers proved to have only a few of those small throwable eggs leudast would have liked to ask them where theyd got the few they did have but by the time the fight was over no grelzers remained alive to ask his broad shoulders rose and fell in a shrug if the grelzers had this particular toy the algarvians would too he was liable to find out more about it than he wanted to know he shrugged again are we going to let those algarvians get free of us wed cursed well better not he plunged into the woods after the redheads again his men followed more often than not marchioness krasta worried about no ones feelings but her own thus when her maidservant bauska came into her bedchamber one morning to help her decide what to wear that dayin krastas mind always a vitally important choiceshe greeted the woman with hows your little bastard doing bauskas lips tightened shed had a daughter by one of the algarvian officers billeted in krastas mansion on the outskirts of priekule carefully she said shes doing very well milady well good krasta hadnt intended to be cruel so she added i havent heard her howling in the night lately thats something twoyearolds dont cry as much as newborn babes no bauska agreed i suppose not krasta said did you ever hear even a word from the father bauska shook her head nothing since he went off to unkerlant to fight too bad krasta sighed mosco was a handsome chap ill give you that mosco had been a good deal handsomer than colonel lurcanio whose adjutant hed been hed also been a good deal younger than krastas own algarvian lover every so often she thought bauska had got the better bargain bauska didnt need to know that though neither did lurcanio perhaps the gray silk tunic and trousers milady the maidservant suggested taking them from one of krastas cavernous closets powers above no krasta shook her head do you want me looking like an unkerlanter soldier milady if you put on king swemmel s crown would you look like him of course not krasta said indignantly hes dreadfully ugly from everything ive heard and im not well then bauska said well then what krasta snapped she was impervious to logic as any number of schoolmasters whod tried to instill it in her might have told bauska what does that have to do with anything get me another outfit and be quick about it before i box your ears she meant it bauska must have known she meant it the gray tunic and trousers disappeared as if they had never been dark blue trousers and a gold tunic met with more approval as if to prove she could make her own choices krasta shrugged on a rabbitfur jacket and went downstairs pushing past bauska without another word had the maidservant not got out of her way krasta would have pushed right through her bauska must have known as much because she did move down in the front hall krasta pointed to another servant tell the driver to ready the carriage i shall go into priekule before long aye milady the servant went off to do her bidding before the war hardly anyone had ever said anything but aye milady to krasta or done anything but go off to do her bidding even now hardly any valmierans presumed to go against her wishes but valmierans these days werent the only folk with whom krasta had to reckon she was reminded of that as soon as she went into the west wing of the mansion the algarvian occupiers had taken over the west wing without so much as a byyourleave theyd made it plain that if krasta proved difficult they were capable of taking over the whole place and throwing her out up till then no one had ever dealt with her on those termswho would have dared the redheads dared and they unlike her countrymen had the power to enforce their wishes desks and cabinets full of papers filled the elegant salon of the west wing these days algarvian military bureaucrats sat behind the desks doing what they needed to do to keep priekule running the way they wanted it to krasta had never inquired about the details details were for servants and other commoners but one detail she did notice fewer algarvian military bureaucrats sat behind the desks this morning than shed ever seen before more and more these days the endless grinding war in unkerlant pulled algarvians out of valmiera and off to the distant barbarous west bauskas captain mosco had been one of the first sent away from civilization but many many redheads had followed him since those who remained eyed krasta with a leering familiarity that would have earned them slaps in the face had they been valmierans to be despised rather than algarvians to be feared as things were krasta swung her hips a little more than usual when she walked past them they looked aye but they couldnt presume to touch because she belonged to their superior captain gradasso the adjutant whod taken over for the departed mosco wasnt at his desk in the antechamber in front of lurcanios office krasta beamed at that she would have had to try to make sense of his archaic valmieran so heavily flavored with the classical kaunian he knew embarrassingly more of than she did as things were she walked straight into lurcanios lair gradasso wasnt in there either as he often was when not out front to block importunate visitors krastas algarvian lover glanced up from the papers that covered his desk like snow drifts in a hard winter how tired he looks she thought lurcanio was in his fifties close to twice her age he was a handsome man more often than not distinguished came to mind when she thought of him not now now the only fitting word was weary good day my dear he said bowing in his chair his valmieran unlike his adjutants was fluent flavored only by a slight algarvian trill youve come to say farewell before you venture forth to the shops unless i miss my guess he read her far better than she could read him which never failed to annoy her well aye she admitted not quite daring to lie to him a telling measure of how much he intimidated her enjoy yourself lurcanio said i wish i could find such an easy pleasant escape honestly puzzled krasta asked why cant you lurcanio sighed his mustachesgraying copperwere waxed so stiff the exhalation didnt trouble them why my sweet because unlike you i have to work for a living i have duties to perform he waved at the blizzard of papers in front of him who would take care of them if i went off whenever i chose krasta didnt recognize a rhetorical question when she heard one why captain gradasso of course what are servants for colonel lurcanio sighed again first an adjutant is not a servant second they are my duties not his he has his own and third at the moment he is performing his duties far from here what do you mean krasta asked i mean that he is on his way to the duchy of grelz if he hasnt got there yet lurcanio answered powers above grant that he stay safe for the time being i have his work to do as well as my own i may eventually be assigned another adjutant on the other hand i may not where she was sensitive to little else krasta understood every nuance of rank thats an outrage she exclaimed it is war lurcanios shrug was less extravagantless algarvianthan usual he got up came around the desk and took krasta in his arms as he kissed her his hands roamed her body she wondered if he would want her to flip up his kilt shed done that a couple of times here she wouldnt have minded doing it againthe danger of discovery often excited her but lurcanio let her go with a last pat he said go on enjoy yourself be glad you can he returned to his paperwork krasta needed no more urging to do what she already intended to do anyhow before she left though she went around behind the desk bent beside lurcanio and teased his ear with her tongue for a moment if he preferred work to her she wanted to remind him of a little of what hed be missing then laughing she hurried away before he would grab her her driver smelled of spirits he often did krasta didnt worry about that overmuch even if he was drunk the horse remained sober take me to the boulevard of horsemen she said when she went into priekule she most often went to the street with the capitals finest shops the driver nodded he probably would have taken her there even had she said she wanted to go somewhere else because he was used to heading there waiting for her and drinking while he waited as it had ever since the algarvians marched into it priekule looked sad and gray buildings needed paint and a scrubbing they werent likely to get any time soon a lot of the people on the street seemed to need paint and a scrubbing too they shambled along lacking the will or the energy to do anything more some of the valmieran women by contrast wore altogether too much paint and wore either trousers that might have been painted onto their backsides or algarvianstyle kilts that barely covered those backsides some of them had caught the redheaded soldiers they were obviously after too krasta sneered shed caught a redheaded soldier too but she didnt usually let herself think of it that way now that she was here she wondered why shed come to get away from the mansion for a while she supposed but the boulevard of horsemen wasnt what it had been shop windows displayed mostly junk and often old junk at that the only shops with plenty of new items on display were the booksellers hardly krastas favorite haunts just because she could read and write didnt mean she felt she had to very often but then she saw viscount valnu flipping through some volume or other inside a bookstore she tapped on the glass valnu looked up his smile illuminated his long bony face he fluttered his fingers at her then did a proper job of waving urging her to come in she did though she felt at least as out of place as she would have walking into a brothel where are my spectacles she exclaimed careless as usual of the proprietor behind his counter dont i have to have spectacles not you darling valnu murmured in a husky voice that enchanted womenand also algarvian officers of a certain inclination he kissed her on the cheek you are a spectacle so you dont need to wear any you should talk krasta said he was wearing a kilt himself one that showed off as much leg as those of any of the slatterns on the street what are you doing here eating beans valnu answered what else is there to do at a booksellers he started to put away the tome hed been looking at krasta took it from him before he could slide it back on the shelf the kaunian empire and the barbarians of the southwest she read from the front cover and started to laugh dont let your redheaded friends know you look at such things viscount valnu laughed too it shall be my deep dark secret believe me he rolled his blue blue eyes as if to say no one could possibly take him seriously and then krasta remembered something that had shaken priekulehad certainly shaken hernot long before dont let your redheaded friends know about amatu either she said this time in a lower voice amatu whod gone over from the valmieran underground to the algarvians had been ambushed and murdered on his way home from a supper with krasta and lurcanio valnu had known beforehand he would be there the viscounts smile never wavered youd better keep quiet my dear or youll go the way he did he said that could happen to you too you know she answered with a smile of her own if i had an accident lurcanio would learn everything that was a lie but valnu couldnt prove it he condescended to raise an eyebrow maybe we should talk further aye krasta nodded maybe we should marshal rathar wished he were back at the front still commanding the unkerlanter armies battling to drive the algarvians out of the duchy of grelz there he was lord of all he surveyed who dared go against the wishes of the second most powerful man in all the kingdom of unkerlant one man dared and no one in unkerlant not even marshal rathar perhaps particularly not marshal rathar presumed to disobey king swemmel s express command and so rathar found himself back in cottbus far from the fighting all too close to the king the maps in his officethe maps whose moving gray and redheaded pins showed the fight going well in the south and not badly in the northdid little to ease his spirit if anything they reminded him what he was missing running a hand through his irongray hair he glared at his adjutant i feel like a caged wolf major nothing else but major merovec shrugged im sorry lord marshal he replied not sounding sorry at all hed spent the whole war in cottbus in the vast royal palace rathar didnt doubt his courage but hed never had to show it he went on the king will surely be glad to have your advice swemmel was never glad to have anyones advice major merovec and marshal rathar both knew that perfectly well they both also knew how deadly dangerous saying anything else would have been a young lieutenant whose clean soft rockgray tunic and clean soft features said hed never done any real fighting either came into the office and saluted merovec and rathar he said lord marshal his majesty bids you sup with him this evening an hour past sunset having delivered his message he saluted again did a smart aboutturn and strode away a signal honor major merovec murmured and a signal indication of the kings trust in you aye rather against his will rathar found himself nodding supping with swemmel meant being trusted enough to hold a knife no doubt it would prove a small dull blunt knife but a knife nonetheless in his presence considering how the guards searched everyone granted audience with the king considering how rathar had to leave his marshals sword on hooks in the antechamber before passing through swemmel had chosen to show him favor by evening the palace would be buzzing with the news rathar shrugged maybe i misjudged him he thought my guess was that he recalled me from grelz to keep me from winning too many victories to keep me from getting too popular i dont want his throne curse it but if i tell him i dont want it hell only worry more that i do when he walked through the hallways of the palace on his way to supper courtiers bowed low before him they were smooth sleek confident creatures these days altogether unlike the frightened lot of two and a half years before when cottbus looked like falling to the algarvians a lot of them had fled west for good or ill they were back to those of lower rank being second most powerful in the kingdom seemed little different from being most powerful rathar knew better but also knew no one would believe he knew better pretty women dropped him curtsies as he went by had he put forth a little effort he supposed he could have had a good many of them his passions didnt run toward seduction though the only woman but his wife with whom hed lain recently was ysolt his headquarters cook that hadnt been a seduction more on the order of a molestation of him by her he grimaced he wasnt proud of being conquered rather than conqueror king swemmel s dining room like his private audience chamber and the throne room had an antechamber attached to it the guards in the antechamber took rathars ceremonial sword from him then they patted him more intimately than ysolt had though he enjoyed their attentions rather less only after satisfying themselves that he carried nothing more lethal than his hands did they let him go on to the king in the dining room he fell to his knees and then to his belly knocking his forehead against the carpet he sang swemmels praises and his own love awe and loyalty for his sovereign some of the ritual phrases were as old as the unkerlanter monarchy swemmel and his henchmen had devised most of them though at last the king said we give you leave to rise and to sit at our table thank you your majesty powers above bless you and keep you your majesty rathar sat at the foot of the long table swemmel at the head the king had a long pale face made longer by a receding hairline his hair going gray now had begun dark his eyes of course still were save for that he looked more like an algarvian than one of his own people but he was an unkerlanter through and through bring in the spirits he shouted to a servitor rathar had seen the man before in bodyguatds uniform rather than waiters once swemmel and marshal rathar were served the king raised his glass death to algarve he cried and gulped down the potent stuff as if it were water death to algarve rathar echoed king swemmel had chosen a toast he liked he too had to empty his glass and he did though his gullet felt as if hed swallowed a dragon while it was flaming impassively the servitor poured both glasses full again death to traitors swemmel shouted and drained the second glass death to traitors rathar agreed and matched him the dining room began to spin a little when in command out in the field rathar couldnt afford to drink like an unkerlanter peasant holed up in his hut for the winter but when summoned before his sovereign he couldnt afford not to drink a toast against traitorsfor king swemmel saw traitors everywhere and would surely see one in a marshals uniform if he refused to condemn them as if to prove that very point swemmel muttered we are surrounded by traitors traitors everywhere two big glasses of potent spirits had put a hectic flush in his cheeks but his eyes were wild and staring everywhere he repeated to rathars relief the king was looking up at the ceiling not right at him bowing his own head the marshal said thank you your majesty for doing me the honor of inviting me here oh aye swemmel said carelessly he gestured to the servitor who filled the glasses yet again rathar wondered what outrages the king might commit while drunk and also whether he himself would be fit for duty in the morning if an algarvian mage were somehow keeping track of swemmels drinking bouts rathar shook his head mezentios men could have worked far worse outrages than they had if that were so the king meanwhile leaned toward the servitor and commanded bring on the supper aye your majesty the fellow replied and went off to the kitchens now king swemmel did turn his bloodshot gaze full on marshal rathar tomorrow or the next day we shall have somewhat to say to the ministers from lagoas and kuusamo they claim they are algarves foes but leave to our kingdom the burden of fighting and dying they have taken sibiu back from the redheads rathar said and their dragons visit algarves towns by day and night swemmel snapped his fingers this for the islands of sibiu he snapped them again and this for dragonfliers if our socalled allies would reckon themselves men before their mothers let them come forth to fight on the mainland of derlavai soon they say before long they say he made his voice a piping mocking falsetto to show what he thought of that well all right then your majesty rathar said king swemmel had a point had the algarvians not chosen to grapple with unkerlant to the death they could have worked far more mischief in the east than they had were king vitor of lagoas and kuusamos seven princes grateful for the burden unkerlant had so unwillingly assumed so far as rathar could see only in the sense of being glad they hadnt had to shoulder it themselves the servitor came back from the kitchen with a large iron pot the lid still on he had cloths wrapped around the handles so he wouldnt burn his fingers setting the pot down on a trivet in the middle of the table he bowed to the king supper your majesty he announced unnecessarily or perhaps not so unnecessarily swemmel started as if hed forgotten all about food once reminded he nodded and said as a mark of our favor you may serve marshal rathar first as you say your majesty the servitor took the lid off the pot a great cloud of savory steam rose from it you do me too much honor your majesty rathar said and not for politeness sake alone when the king sobered up tomorrow would he remember what hed done remember and regret it he might if i let rathar eat before i did he might think my cursed marshal might decide he deserves first place in the kingdom all the time other men famous in their day had vanished when such thoughts occurred to king swemmel but swemmel seemed unconcerned now as the servitor spooned meat from the pot the king said we give you what you have earned marshal when the first whiff of that savory steam reached rathars redoubtable nose he recoiled in something worse than mere horror when raniero went into the stewpot in herborn rathar had smelled this precise odor of cooked flesh he was sure of it swemmel wouldnt couldnt serve him the servitor set the plate in front of him just as he was about to push it away and flee the table heedless of what the king might think the man murmured i hope the stewed pork pleases you lord marshal stewed pork rathar said slowly he looked down the length of the table to his sovereign swemmel rarely laughed he was laughing now laughing till tears gleamed in his eyes and slid down his hollow cheeks well marshal he said dabbing at his face with a snowy linen napkin well did you think we were serving you up a ragout of boiled traitor more laughter shook him it hit him hard as spirits smote a man who seldom drank your majesty i must say it crossed my mind rathar replied most courtiers would have denied the very idea rather had found the king could sometimestake more truth than most people thought swemmel shook his head it may be that we shall eat of mezentios roasted heart but we would not share that dish with any subject it is ours was he still joking or did he mean every word of it for the life of him rathar couldnt tell swemmel wagged a forefinger at him before that day comes though we needs must drive the redheaded robbers from all our land not merely from the south how do you propose doing what we require rathar sighed with relief at dealing with a purely military matter i have some thoughts along those lines your majesty he replied and took a bit of pork he hoped it was pork anyhow at the isolated hostel in the rustic naantali district of southeastern kuusamo fernao felt like a pine in a forest of poplars he was the only lagoan mage the only lagoan at allthere the rest of the theoretical sorcerers all the secondary sorcerers and all the servitors were kuusamans short goldenskinned blackhaired flatfeatured slanteyed as a tall fair straightnosed ponytailed redhead he could hardly have stood out more no that isn t quite true he thought and nodded to himself my eyes are set on a slant too even if theyre green not black lagoans were of mostly algarvic stock descendants of the invaders whod settled in the northwest of the large island off the derlavaian mainland after the kaunian empire collapsed but theyd intermarried with the folk they found there and a fairsized minority showed some kuusaman features similarly some few who lived under the seven princes especially in lands near the lagoan border had the inches or the nose or the bright hair that spoke of foreign stock grafted onto the roots of their family tree fernao waved to one of the serving women in the refectory she came over to him and asked what is it you want she spoke kuusaman fernao answered in the same tongue an omelette of smoked salmon and eggs and cheese and bread and honey and a mug of tea linna when he first came to kuusamo hed known not a word of the local language but hed always had a good ear and now he was getting close to fluent linna nodded aye sir mage she said ill bring them to you as soon as theyre done she hurried off toward the kitchens thank you fernao called after her a hand fell on his shoulder he looked up in surprise what are you thanking her for ilmarinen demanded in coldly precise classical kaunian my breakfast fernao answered also in the international language of magecraft and other scholarship is that all ilmarinen said suspiciously by his wrinkles and white wispy little chin beard the kuusaman master mage carried twice fernaos years but he sounded like an angry young buck hed been chasing linna ever since this hostel in the wilderness went up and hed been annoying doing it not long before shed finally let him catch her hed been much more annoying since with what patience fernao could muster he nodded as sure as i am of my own name if you care to you may sit down beside me and watch me eat it and if you care tohe paused as if about to make a radical suggestion you may even get one for yourself i think ill do just that ilmarinen said and slid into a chair how are you this morning fernao asked why my usual sweet charming self of course the older mage replied like most educated folk fernao had no trouble using classical kaunian to communicateat first hed used it all the time after coming to kuusamo since it was the only tongue hed had in common with the locals but again like most educated folk he spoke it with a certain stiffness not so ilmarinen he was so fluent in the ancient language it might almost have been his birthspeech fernao eyed him i must say you did not seem particularly sweet and charming ilmarinen reveled in irony and crosstalk but he hadnt seemed ironic either what hed seemed like was a jealous lover of the most foolish and irksome sort perhaps he even knew as much for the smile he gave fernao was more sheepish than otherwise but did i seem my usual self he asked if you mean your usual self lately aye fernao answered not intending it as a compliment before ilmarinen could say anything linna came out again she waved to the master mage then walked over and ruffled his hair ilmarinen beamed as long as she was happy with him all seemed right with his world fernao wondered what would happen ifno whenshe tired of him for the sake of the work on which so many mages were engaged he hoped he wouldnt have to find out any time soon ilmarinen asked for smoked salmon too and sliced onions to go with it linnas nose wrinkled poo she said see if i kiss you ilmarinen looked devastatedbut not so devastated as to change his order fernao took that for a good sign sniffing linna headed back to the kitchens and then fernao stopped worrying about ilmarinens infatuation for pekka walked into the refectory and he had to start worrying about his own like most lagoan men hed always reckoned kuusaman women on the small and scrawny side by lagoan standards pekka was on the small and scrawny side somehow that mattered very little once fernao had come to know her she sat down at the table with him and ilmarinen i hope the two of you were talking about our next experiment she said in classical kaunian since she was not only a woman in whom he was interested but also the theoretical sorcerer heading the project for which hed come to kuusamo fernao didnt want to lie to her on the other hand the prospect of telling her the truth didnt fill him with delight either it didnt bother ilmarinen one bit well now that you mention it no he said breezily pekka gave him a severe look it rolled off him the way water rolled off greasy wool she said what were you talking about oh i just wanted to let this lagoan lecher know that if i ever caught him sniffing around my linna id cut out his liver and eat it without salt ilmarinen replied he was on the small and scrawny side too to say nothing of being an old man that didnt keep a small twinge of icy dread like a detached bit of the savage winter outside from sliding up fernaos back however small and scrawny and old ilmarinen was he was also with master siuntio dead at algarvian hands the leading theoretical sorcerer of his generation and a formidable practical mage as well he wouldnt have to use a knife to make unfortunate things happen to fernaos liver fernao said for about the fourth time i was not sniffing around her when he brought out a phrase like that in classical kaunian he sounded both pompous and preposterous ilmarinen now ilmarinen sounded menacing pekka snorted i have never seen fernao behave at all strangely around linna she said which is rather more than i can say for certain other people of my acquaintance linna came back with fernaos omelette and ilmarinens smoked salmon and onions before the elderly theoretical sorcerer could make any more snide comments he might well not have let that stop him the serving girl didnt speak much classical kaunian and couldnt have followed whatever he said but pekka asked her for a plate of bacon and eggs and sent her off again ilmarinen let out a cackle the laugh of an old man who made trouble and had fun doing it which women have you seen fernao behaving strangely around then he asked and cackled again without the least hesitation fernao kicked him in the ankle and that wasnt the only small dull thud from under the table pekka must have kicked him from the other side aii ilmarinen said that wasnt a cacklemore like a yelp between the two of you you can carry me out of here i dont think ill be able to walk if you keep on being rude and obnoxious someone will carry you out sure enough someone will carry you out feet first pekka said her voice was quite mild as far as fernao was concerned that made her more intimidating not less ilmarinen attacked his food with singleminded determination unlike the other theoretical sorcerers it wouldnt talk backunless the onions did he left an odorous trail behind as he got up and hurried out of the refectory both his ankles seem in good working order pekka remarked aye fernao said and then maybe i should have kicked him harder i was thinking the same thing pekka said he will be difficult just for the sake of being difficult linna brought her the bacon and eggs she dropped back into kuusaman to say thanks youre welcome the serving girl answered she picked up ilmarinens plate he got out of here in a hurry didnt he did you scare him away fernao understood every word of that where he wouldnt have understood any of it when new to the land of the seven princes he spoke in kuusaman too we did our best that made linna laugh as she went off though he hadnt been joking pekka also stuck to her own language saying youre getting quite fluent the only time we really need to use classical kaunian these days is when we talk about the fine points of sorcery thank you fernao kept on using kuusaman not least because he plainly pleased pekka by doing so you probably praise me too much but thank you not at all pekka said seriously which made fernao glad hed always had a good ear for languages then she dug into her breakfast pausing only to tell him you should eat she might have been speaking to a little boy not to a fellow theoretical sorcerer she has a little boy fernao reminded himself pekka would sometimes talk about uto she has a husband too a mage in his own right when fernao was newly come to kuusamo pekka had talked a lot about leino too she didnt do that so much now fernao wondered why part of him hoped he knew the answer eat pekka said again this time in peremptory tones aye she might have been talking to her son im sorry fernao answered as contritely as if he were a boy im how do you say going slowly without any particular reason he used classical kaunian where he lacked the kuusaman word pekka supplied it dawdling she took a big bite of bacon dont dawdle we have no time for it theres no excuse for it if we dont get to the bottom of this sorcery if we dont get to the point where we can use it against the algarvians well be in a world of trouble no matter how the derlavaian war ends up am i right or am i wrong oh youre right without a doubt youre right fernao dutifully attacked his omelette after a bit though he said its only that when he paused again it wasnt because hed run out of words in kuusaman only that what pekka asked sharply fernao didnt answer he looked down at his plate then glanced back up to her despite her golden skin shed flushed never mind she said and rose and hurried away its only that if i dawdle i can sit here and be with you he would have said that or something like it she had to understand it even if he hadnt said it and it had to be on her mind too or she would have joked about it fernao sighed he finished breakfast then got to his feet and reached for his cane he couldnt hurry away not after a bursting egg almost killed him and did ruin his leg down in the land of the ice people and he and pekka had to go on working side by side as if they felt nothing toward each other but professional respect he sighed again it wasnt easy and got harder all the time three back before the war garivald had visited tolk only a handful of times though the market town lay less than a days walk from zossen his home village after king swemmel s armies drove the algarvians out of the western portion of the duchy of grelz hed left the band of irregulars hed led before unkerlanter regulars and inspectors could reward him for his fight against the redheads by making something unfortunate happen to him and so hed gone back to zossen only to find the war there before him the village his wife his son his little daughter all gone as if theyd never been hed trudged on to tolk farther west still not least because he had no idea what else to do tolk survived the algarvians and their grelzer puppets hadnt made a stand there as they must have at zossen buildings were smashed only burntout rubble remained of a few whole blocks but tolk survived sitting by the fire in a tavern there garivald turned to obilot and said powers above only know what we would have done if this place was gone too like him she had a thick earthenware mug of spirits in front of her she shrugged as she took a swallow from it gone somewhere else thats all what difference does it make where we are we havent got anything left but each other garivald still didnt know exactly what the algarvians had done to her and to whatever family shed had to make her flee to the irregulars shed fought mezentios men longer and harder than he had shed been in the band when munderic whod led it before garivald rescued him before the redheads could take him to herborn and boil him alive for making patriotic songs he said we might have starved before we got anywhere else late winter was the hard time the empty time of the year in peasant villages in grelz as it doubtless was in peasant villages all over unkerlant obilot shook her head she had to bring up a hand to brush dark curls back from her face she wasnt pretty not in any conventional sense of the word she was too thin too fierce looking for anything approaching beauty but the energy that crackled through her made every other woman garivald had known including annore whod borne him two children pallid in comparison she said two desperate characters with sticks in their hands dont starve well maybe not garivald said and drank from his own mug of spirits in most winters hed have stayed drunk much of the time from harvest till planting how else to while away the long winter with so much time in it and so little to fill that time as an irregular hed found other ways as a refugee he was finding other ways still but when he put the mug down again he said i dont feel like a desperate character no obilots laugh held little mirth what else are you what else is anybody in grelz she lowered her voice what will you be if the inspectors catch up with you dead garivald answered and drained the mug he waved it in the air to show the tapman he wanted it refilled obilots mug was empty too lets see some silver the fellow said when he brought a jar of spirits over to their table garivald dug a coin from his belt pouch and set it down on the scarred pine board here fill us both up again the tapman scooped it up looked at it and made it disappear he filled both mugs but then he said if you havent got the brains to be careful passing money with king raniero s faceraniero the traitors face i mean youll land in more trouble than popskull can ever get you out of youre just lucky i know a jeweler wholl give me weight for weightwell almostin silver hell be able to melt it down and make earrings or something out of it nobody at the next table could have heard a word he said he went back behind the bar obilot asked how long have you been carrying that silver bit around how should i know garivald shrugged maybe since before king swemmel s soldiers broke into grelz but maybe i got it yesterday chopping firewood for that baker if you did he was probably glad to palm it off on you obilot said i wouldnt be surprised garivald agreed but at least in a place like tolk i can find odd jobs to do and make a little money in a peasant village i would starve everybody hates strangers in a village i ought to know i did back when people i hadnt seen before came into zossen for all i knew they were inspectors or impressers sneaking around its not right obilot said savagely with your songs you did as much as anybody to get the algarvians out of grelz the redheads mustve thought so or they wouldnt have wanted to boil you but what thanks do you get from your own side back in the woods they were going to arrest you or kill you with another shrug garivald answered when have you seen a peasant win not with our own kings not with the redheads not ever he didnt even sound bitter what point when he told simple truth a youngster who might have been the tapmans little brother or son brought in more wood and threw it on the fire a couple of people in the tavern clapped their hands the young man grinned taken by surprise the wood wellseasoned pine burned hot and bright weve got the right table obilot said and turned toward the flames their reflections danced in her eyes garivald was about to do the same when somebody new came in from outside close the door curse you someone inside said youre letting out the heat garivald started to chime in but the words never passed his lips instead he turned his back on the door and leaned toward the fire as obilot had done in a whisper even he had trouble even he had trouble hearing above the crackling flames he said thats tantris who just walked in tantris whats he doing here obilots face went hard and feral hes supposed to be off in the woods seventyfive miles east of here the only reason hed come to tolk is because he knows what we look like garivald finished for her he knows what you look like the whoreson obilot said hes got to be after you i dont count for anything not to the likes of him she was bound to be right when garivald had slipped out of the woods with her and headed back toward zossen without pursuit hed thought the unkerlanters were willing to let him alone that seemed a mistake a bad mistake i led fighters who didnt take orders straight from king swemmel he said i made songs people liked songs that made people want to fight the redheads this is how my own kingdom pays me back mezentios men had been ready to kill him now swemmels were too the knowledge tore at him as if hed set his foot in a trap and maybe he had he sipped spirits and watched tantris out of the corner of his eye the soldier didnt want to be recognized for what he was he wore a dark blue tunic of civilian cut rather than the rockgray uniform tunic in which garivald had always seen him in the woods he glanced garivald and obilots way but gave no sign of knowing who they were after a moment garivald realized the two of them were silhouetted against the flames in the fireplace he stayed where he was tantris bought a beaker of ale and stood at the bar drinking it obilot kept her voice very low is it true she said that now there are irregularsgrelzer irregulars i meanfighting for the algarvians in the lands our armies have taken back from them ive heard it the same as you have garivald answered i dont know whether its true but ive heard it till that cursed tantris walked thought the door i wouldntve believed it obilot said but now do you know i almost begin to understand considering how she felt about the redheads that was no small statement a good many peasants fled east when mezentios men had to retreat garivald said i used to think they were the ones in bed with the algarvians i guess a lot of them were but maybe not all if he hadnt got in trouble with the redheads for his songs his life in zossen wouldnt have been too very different under them from what it had been before the war that was a judgment on algarve and unkerlant both he supposed obilot turned her head ever so slightly toward tantris what are we going to do about him hope he goes away garivald answered tantris drank his ale he bought a chunk of chewy bread and dipped it into the bowl of coarse salt the tapman kept on the bar bite by bite the bread disappeared he washed down each bite with another swig of ale garivald might have done the same he had done the same many times the tavern door opened again this newcomer unlike tantris did not try to disguise what he was a military mage two troopers tramped in behind him he strode up to the tapman and snapped let me see your cashbox fellow why should i the tapman asked are you robbing me why the mage echoed ill tell you why treason to king swemmel thats why he dropped a silver coin on the bar it rang sweetly this is money of raniero the false king the king of traitors by the law of similarity like calls to like this foul coin calls to one in your box whoever harbors money of raniero is a traitor to his majesty garivalds blood ran cold the fellow behind the bar had to say no more than i got it from him and point and he would find himself in more trouble than tantris could give him what the tapman did say was its here under the bar he reached down but what he came out with wasnt the cashbox but a stout bludgeon he doubtless used to break up tavern brawls he didnt break one up this time with a shout he brought the bludgeon down on the military mages head with another shout somebody else threw his mug at one of the unkerlanter troopers behind the mage it shattered against the back of the soldiers skull he went down with a groan somebody shouted king swemmel and punched the man whod thrown the mug somebody else shouted powers below eat king swemmela shout nobody would have dared to raise before the algarvian invasionand kicked the fellow whod yelled the kings name in the blink of an eye the desperate struggle between the grelzers whod fought for swemmel and those who hated him broke out anew in the tavern the weapons werent so fancy as those of the great war still wracking unkerlant but that made the battle no less ferocious people kicked and punched and grappled and bit knives flashed in the firelight and garivald and obilot made their way through the chaos toward the door as best they could he punched whoever got in his way regardless of which side the fellow was on lets see tantris track us through this he told obilot whod just kicked a man where it did the most good a savage grin on her face she nodded a jar full of potent spirits flew into the fireplace and smashed the spirits caught fire as they splashed out flames clung to an overturned chair close by fire somebody shrieked then everybody was fleeingeverybody who could garivald and obilot werent the only ones who ran not just out of the tavern but away from it as fast as they could we got away she panted this time he answered and ran harder the sun rose earlier and set later these days before long the equinox would come to the naantali district in much of the world that would mean spring and so it would hereformally pekka was from kajaani which lay even farther south she knew the snow and ice wouldnt start melting for quite a while after that if anything the weather here was worse than in kajaani a port city that had the ocean to soften its climate in most circumstances pekka would have complained about that not now as she rode in the sleigh from the hostel to the blockhouse she turned to fernao and said i dread the spring thaw shed spoken kuusaman the lagoan mage nodded and answered in classical kaunian i understand whyall this will turn to mud and we shall have a demon of a time moving from where we stay to where we need to go to keep on with our experiments exactly pekka said and we have to go on with the experiments that blazed in her next to it nothing else mattered the track to the hostel curved as the horse rounded the bend the sleigh tilted a little under the fur robes that warded them against the weather pekka slid toward fernao she was very much aware of her body pressed against his for a moment and wished she hadnt been quite so aware of it its harmless she told herself not for the first time nothing can come of it that wasnt quite the same thing even if it sounded as if it were after the sleigh straightened again pekka took an extra moment to move away from fernao the lagoan mage raised an eyebrow when she finally did his eyes were shaped like hers but green not dark brown was it the combination of strange and familiar that drew her or was it just that she worked closely with fernao every day while shed seen leino for one brief leave since she came to the naantali district and her husband went off to work on habakkuk whatever it was it disconcerted her she almost wished fernao would do something overt then she could tell him no as forcefully as necessary and they could readjust as needed and go on of course hed saved her life two or three times from algarvian sorcerous assault and from her own botched spellcastingand this last time hed hurled strong sorcery back against mezentios mages do i really want to tell him no but fernao hadnt done anything overt and didnt seem likely to ambiguity remained pekka laughed it might as well be life she thought whats funny fernao asked nothing really she answered at which he raised that eyebrow again ignoring it she took her mittened hand out from under the robes to point ahead we are almost there she said in classical kaunian so we are fernao agreed he didnt expose any part of himself but his eyes to the frigid air i wonder how the driver stands it up there out in the open we of kuusamo do not let the cold trouble us quite so much as you do pekka said which was truebut only to a degree when the sleigh stopped as it did a couple of minutes later fernao had no choice but to come forth the furs he wore were of kuusaman make he hadnt had anything in his own wardrobe to contend against winter in the naantali district that wasnt to say he hadnt known its like before he remarked the only difference between this place and the land of the ice people is that the sun does come up for a little while here even in the middle of winter eraye pekka said the idea that winter could get worse than it did here was horrifying all by itself as soon as she got inside the blockhouse she started to sweat and started shedding her outdoor clothes one layer at a time braziers and soon the press of bodies heated the cramped chamber in which shed incant ilmarinen and piilis came into the blockhouse together ilmarinen had always shared a sleigh with master siuntio but siuntio was dead slain by murderous algarvian magecraft now ilmarinen rode with the younger theoretical sorcerer pekka didnt know when she would stop missing siuntio or if she ever would without him this project would never have begun would never had gained the backing of the seven princes alkio and raahe came in right behind ilmarinen and piilis the married coupleboth solid theoretical sorcererswere about halfway between pekka and ilmarinen in age solid pekka thought aye they re very solid so is piilis nothing wrong with their work at all were the three of them together a match for siuntio pekka shook her head she knew better she wasnt a match for siuntio as project leader either she also knew that but she was what they had secondary sorcerers hurried into the blockhouse too some spells protected the animals at the heart of the experiment from freezing before they were needed others would transfer the spell pekka and the other theoretical sorcerers had crafted to the animals when the time came and with the secondary sorcerers came the protective mages after two algarvian attacks pekka knew how necessary they were but they didnt beat back mezentio s mages the last time she thought fernao did that fernao and ilmarinen and i three theoretical sorcerers who shouldnt be allowed to work magic like practical wizards she smiled recognizing the ironic pride in her thoughts the blockhouse had been built with theoretical sorcerers and secondary sorcerers in mind it hadnt been built to include the protective mages when the weather got better perhaps pekka could prevail upon the seven princes to enlarge it meanwhile people shoved and jostled and stepped on one anothers feet and got in one anothers way are we ready pekka asked at last but even her at last proved too soon the mages were nowhere near ready when she spoke again it was in some exasperarion sooner or later we shall have to go into the field the algarvians will not wait for us and neither will the gyongyosians ilmarinen snapped his fingers that for the gongs theyre honest foes which means we can beat them without folderol knock em back across the bothnian ocean one island at a time as soon as the algarvians started killing kaunians to make their magecraft mightier they put themselves beyond the pale privately pekka agreed with him even so she said whichever way we aim the magic well have to be able to do it in our time the sooner we learn the better not even contrary ilmarinen could quarrel with that and raahe said she is right let no one complain that we women are slow here that made people laugh more of the mages in the blockhouse were men than women but only a few more kuusamans were emphatically aware of the differences between the sexes but unlike lagoans and most folk on the mainland of derlavai didnt think those differences applied to what each sex could do well when pekka asked are we ready again she found that her colleagues were before the kaunians came we of kuusamo were here she said and her fellow magesall of them but fernaorecited the ritual phrases the phrases that moved them toward readiness for conjuration along with her he has to feel very much alone a foreigner a stranger whenever he listens to us she thought know i would if i were in lagoas say and mages just brusquely started to enchant without preparing first but then such small thoughts slipped out of her mind driven from it when she focused like a burning glass on what lay ahead she took a deep breath to steady herself let it out and said i begin every time she used the spell it became sharper more powerful all the theoretical sorcerers tinkered with it between experiments one couplet one sorcerous pass at a time it grew closer to what it had to be had she seen this version a year before it would have astounded her she couldnt help wondering how much further they had to go if we come as far in the next year as we have in this past one ill be able to shatter the world like a dropped egg without even lifting a finger she knew that was an exaggeration but maybe it wasnt an enormous one by the nature of things spells that exploited the inverted unity shed helped discover at the heart of the laws of similarity and contagion had the potential to release far more sorcerous energy than cantrips based on one or the other of the socalled two laws how close mortal mages could come to tapping that potential was one question another more urgent question was how much attention she could give to such irrelevant quibbles before making a hash of the spell she was casting now and endangering herself and everybody in the blockhouse with her she didnt like remembering fernao had had to save her from the consequences of dropping a line in one of these spells which is why practical mages make jokes about what happens when theoretical sorcerers go into the laboratory pekka thought too much of their kidding wasnt kidding at all but sober truth but then even embarrassment and worry fell away as she lost herself in the intricacies of the spell she was casting getting the words precisely right making sure the passes matched and reinforced them feeling the power build as verse after verse pass after pass fell into place it was almost like feeling pleasure build when she made love and then she made that thought fall away toonot without regret but she did it power built and built and builtand then as she cried let it be released it was released she felt the secondary sorcerers take hold of what shed brought into being felt them hurl it forth to the banks of animal cages set far from the blockhouse and felt it kindle there and then she needed no occult senses to feel it for the ground shuddered beneath her feet a great roar rumbled thought the air she knew that when she and the other mages went to examine the site they would find another huge crater torn in the frozen ground the naantali district was starting to look like the moon as seen through a spyglass its wide stretches of worthless land were the main reasons experiments had moved here nicely done fernao said very nicely done when we measure the crater we will be able to calculate the actual energy release and see how close it comes to what the sorcerous equations predicted my guess is the discrepancies will not be large it had the right feel to it pekka noddedwearily now that the spell was done i think you are right she replied also in classical kaunian ilmarinen said and when we go out to the crater we can see how much green grass and other outofseason bits and pieces we find at the bottom of it pekka grimaced so did fernao the spells they were working with twisted time among other things the equations made that very clear ilmarinen ever the radical kept insisting the twist could be exploited for itself not just for the energy it released the unanimous opinion of the rest of the theoretical sorcerers was that the energy release came first as pekka and fernao rode out toward the crater an exhausted little birda linnetcame fluttering down out of the sky and landed on their sleigh when pekka reached out for it it flew off again and was soon lost to sight she stared at fernao in no small consternation shed never seen a linnet in wintertime they flew north for the winter to escape the cold maybe this one hadnt escaped the cold maybe it hadnt escaped the sorcery either and if it hadnt what did that mean hajjajs carriage rolled up to the dragon farm outside bishah the capital of zuwayza when the carriage stopped the zuwayzi foreign minister descended to the sandy soil a skinny man with dark brown skin and gray almost white hair hed earned by lasting close to seven decadesand also by guiding zuwayzas relations with the other kingdoms of the world ever since his homeland regained its freedom from unkerlant in the chaos following the six years war general ikhshid came bustling up to greet him ikhshid was paunchy with bushy white eyebrows he carried almost as many years as hajjaj hed been a captain in the unkerlanter army during the six years war one of the few men of zuwayzi blood to gain officers rank there like hajjaj ikhshid wore sandals and a broadbrimmed hat and nothing in between in zuwayzas fierce desert heat clothes were nothing but a nuisance however much zuwayzi nudity scandalized other derlavaians ikhshid had rank badges on his hat and marked with greasepaint on his upper arms he bowed to hajjaj wheezing a little as he straightened good day your excellency he said always a pleasure to see you believe me youre too kind hajjaj murmured returning the bow believe me the pleasure is mine aimed at a lot of men hajjaj would have meant that as no more than the usual pleasant hypocrisy with ikhshid he meant it hed never been convinced zuwayzas senior soldier was a great general though ikhshid was a good one but ikhshid like hajjaj himself commanded the respect of every zuwayzi clanfather hajjaj could think of no other officer of whom that was true you do me too much credit your excellency ikhshid said by no means sir hajjaj protested zuwayzi forms of greeting and politeness if uninterrupted could go on for a long time here an interruption arrived in the person of marquis balastro the algarvian minister to zuwayza to hajjajs relief balastro was not nude but wore the usual algarvian tunic and kilt with a hat of his own to keep the sun off his head his bow unlike ikhshids was deep and flamboyantalgarvians didnt do things by halves good day to you your excellency he said in his own language and to you as well your excellency hajjaj replied in the same tongue hed been fluent in algarvian for a long time back before the six years war an era that seemed so distant and different it might have been a thousand years ago hed spent his university days in trapani the algarvian capital balastro struck a pose now sir you will see that algarve stands by her allies in every way she can i shall be glad to see it very glad indeed hajjaj said that gave the algarvian minister the chance to strike another pose and he made the most of it pointing to the sky and exclaiming then look now at the dragons summoned to zuwayzas aid hajjaj looked so did ikhshid so did the writers from a couple of zuwayzi news sheets summoned to the outskirts of the capital for the occasion sure enough half a wing of dragonsthirtytwo in allpainted in algarves gaudy green red and white spiraled down toward the dragon farm they are indeed a pleasure to see your excellency hajjaj said bowing once more bishah shall be safer because of them after the last raid when the unkerlanters pounded us from the air almost as they pleased dragons to fly against those in swemmels rockgray are most extremely welcome i can see how they would be balastro agreed till lately zuwayza has enjoyed all the advantages of the derlavaian war but only a few of the drawbacks you won land from swemmel yet paid relatively little for it because he was more heavily involved against us that was imperfectly diplomatic no matter how much truth it held hajjaj felt obliged to reply do remember your excellency that unkerlant attacked my kingdom a year and a half before yours went to war against king swemmel oh no doubt balastro said but ours is the bigger fight with unkerlant even reckoning in the relative sizes of your kingdom and mine another undiplomatic truth when hajjaj started to answer this time a landing dragons screech drowned out his words normally that would have annoyed him at the moment it gave him the excuse he needed to say to balastro walk aside with me your excellency that we might confer together in something a little closer to privacy balastro bowed again with all my heart sir nothing could please me more that might well not have been true but it was diplomatic when general ikhshid started to follow the two of them away from the other dignitaries and the writers and the folk concerned with the mundane needs of dragons hajjaj sent him a quick hooded glance he and ikhshid had served zuwayza side by side for many years the veteran officer stopped after a step and a half and began fiddling with a sandal strap had hajjaj and balastro sought privacy among algarvians everyone close by would have swarmed after them the redheads were powerfully curious and also powerfully convinced they had the absolute right to know everything that went on around them hajjajs countrymen showed more restraint they could hardly show less restraint than most algarvians the zuwayzi foreign minister thought how now your excellency balastro asked once he and hajjaj had put a little distance between themselves and the other folk whod come out to see the algarvian dragons fly into the dragon farm if you have a grievance with my kingdom please come out with it hajjaj replied your little hints and gives do nothing but make me nervous all right thats fair enough i will balastro said heres the grievance in a nutshell you expect algarve to make you a perfect ally and come to your aid whenever you need something from her and yet you refuse to return the favor zuwayza is a free and independent kingdom hajjaj said stiffly you sometimes seem to forget that and you sometimes seem to remember it altogether too well marquis balastro said i tell you frankly your excellency those kaunian exiles you harbor have sneaked back to forthweg and done us a good deal of harm there and i tell you frankly i have trouble blaming them when i consider what you algarvians have done to the kaunians in forthweg hajjaj answered when you consider what kaunians have done to algarve down through the centuries you might well say they have it coming balastro said hajjaj shook his head no your excellency i would never say that nor would king shazli i have made my views and his quite clear to you so you have balastro agreed now i am going to make something quite clear to you and i am sure you will have no trouble making it quite clear to your king if the kaunians keep hurting us in forthweg they make it likelier that we lose the war against unkerlant if we lose the war against unkerlant you will also lose the war against unkerlant it is as simple as that the more you want to deal with king swemmel afterwards the more you should look the other way when the blonds climb into their boats and sail east to forthweg we do not look the other way hajjaj insisted our navy is far from large but we have turned back or sunk several of their boats balastro snorted enough to show us a few no more than that the trouble was he was right hajjajs sympathies and those of his king lay with the blonds whod escaped from algarvian occupation and from the massacres the redheads inflicted on those blonds as far as he was concerned wars had no business being fought that way not even swemmel of unkerlant had fought that way till the algarvians forced it on him waging war on the same side as the redheads made hajjaj want to go sweat himself clean in the baths but when the choice was having unkerlanters overrun zuwayza hajjaj shook his head when he and ikhshid were young an unkerlanter governor had ruled in bishah if the algarvians lost if zuwayza lost that could happen again algarve however monstrous its warmaking didnt threaten zuwayzas freedom unkerlant did and always would bitterly hajjaj said i wish we were an island in the great northern sea so we would not have to make choices such as these wish for the moon while youre at it balastro answered the world is as it is not as you wish it were but do you wonder that we hesitate to give you more help against swemmel when we see how you repay us knives have two edges hajjaj said if you want to keep us in the fight against unkerlant we need the tools and the beasts to go on fighting if we go out of the war how much likelier is it that algarve will lose balastro looked as if hed bitten down hard on a lemon hajjaj had turned his argument around on him at last the algarvian minister said the marriage in which were trapped may be loveless but it is a marriage and wed both be hurt if we divorced whether we love you or not your excellency we have sent you a present that costs us dear for our own substance these days is not so large as we would wish and we have do believe me no dragons to spare we have nothing at all to spare hajjaj bowed is it so bad as that it is bad and it does not get better balastro replied that is not good news the zuwayzi foreign minister said did i tell you it would be balastro said now sir you may not love us but you are wed to us no less than we are wed to you even if you do not think us as fresh and lovely as you did when you first went to bed with us will you not give us a present for a present to keep us from quarreling and throwing dishes at each other after supper with some amusement hajjaj said you sound like an old husband sure enough and what present would you have from us as if i dont know balastro nodded aye that one sure enough no gauds no jewelsjust do as you say youve been doing all along i am not even asking that you give over harboring kaunians here if you will harbor them you will but your excellency harbor them here if they want to go back to forthweg stop turning a blind eye to them you can stop them and i hope you will not do me the discourtesy of claiming otherwise i shall take your words to king shazli hajjaj said hating himself hating what the war made him do for the sake of his kingdom he added i shall take them to him with the recommendation that he follow your suggestion balastro bowed i can ask no more when hajjaj recommended something to the king whatever it was had a way of happening here hajjaj wished that were not so zuwayzas marriage to algarve was indeed loveless but as the algarvian minister had pointed out it was indeed a marriage too both sides would be worse off if it fell apart and so to keep it going zuwayza needed to give algarve a present in return for the present shed got almost hajjaj wished the algarvian dragons had not come almost sergeant istvan and some of the gyongyosian soldiers in his squad squatted in a muddy trench on the miserable little island called becsehely whiling away the time shooting dice istvan sent the bone cubes rolling across the flat board the big tawnybearded men used for a playing surface when he saw a pair of ones staring at him he cursed szonyi laughed only two stars in your sky there sergeant i can beat that easy enough he scooped up the dice and proved ita throw of five wasnt anything much but plenty to take care of a two szonyi gathered up all the coins on the board still cursing his luck istvan leaned back and let the next trooper in the game take his place lajos hadnt been with him as long as szonyi had istvan and szonyi and corporal kun had been together since the fighting on obuda an island in the bothnian ocean some distance west of becsehely theyd fought the kuusamans there then gone back to the derlavaian mainland to battle the unkerlanters in the ilszung mountains on the border between gyongyos and swemmels kingdom and in the trackless forests of western unkerlant that was where lajos had joined the squad now with the stars not shining on the gyongyosian cause in the fight against kuusamo theyd come back to island duty again szonyi set a stake on the board lajos young and eager matched it szonyi threw first a six lajos took the dice and threw another six they each put down more coins doubling the stake szonyi threw a nine before lajos picked up the dice corporal kun nudged szonyi and held out a silver coin in the palm of his handa side bet this that hell beat lajos by two or better no thanks istvan shook his head and then had to brush curly dark yellow hair out of his face betting on the side is how you make your money ive seen that lajos threw an eight szonyi collected the twofold bets behind his goldframed spectacles kun assumed an injured expression there he said you see you would have won this time i would have aye now istvan nodded but anybody who takes a lot of side bets against you ends up without any money in his belt pouch so go find yourself a new fish youve hooked me too often already szonyi won the next duel of dice too he said i dont make side bets against you either kun the sergeants rightyou win em often enough to make some people wonder whether you magic the dice oh rubbish kun said or perhaps something rather more pungent unlike most of the men in the squad including istvan he wasnt a peasant or herder from a little mountain valley such sturdy soldiers gave the gyongyosians reason to reckon themselves a warrior race but kun had been a mages apprentice in gyorvar the capital before taking service in ekrekek arpad s army he knew little bits and pieces of sorcery himself enough to ensorcel dice istvan had sometimes wondered himself but he said kun s lucks no better than anybody elses when hes got the dice in his own hand ive noticed that its only when hes making side bets that he cleans up i cant see how hed put a spell on somebody elses dice but not on his own rubbish kun repeatedor again words to that effect ill tell you what makes the difference i know what im doing and you backcountry boys dont theres no more magecraft in it than there is to cooking a goose if theres no magecraft we ought to be able to do it too once you tell us howisnt that right szonyi said he and kun often banged heads like mountain sheep kun nodded now aye if you can remember a few simple things he raised an eyebrow by gyongyosian standards he was on the scrawny side szonyi came close to making two of him but he had no fear for he added for simple people even simple things come hard szonyi bristled istvan said never mind the insults if you can teach us teach us i wouldnt mind learning something to help me put a little extra silver in my belt pouch all right by the stars i will even if itll cost me money kun said and spent the next little while talking about how to figure odds while rolling dice by the time he got through istvan was frowning and scratching his head are you sure thats not magecraft he asked anything somebody doesnt know how to do looks like magecraft to him kun said impatiently this isnt its nothing but a fancy kind of arithmetic i guess youd call it how can it be arithmetic szonyi demandedhe was never content with anything kun said two and two is always four with this youre right some of the time and youre wrong some of the time if you run out of silver and bet your tunic youre liable to walk home naked over the long run though you wont kun s smile grew rather nasty and if you dont believe me why wont you make side bets with me before szonyi could answer horns blared out an alarm from the high ground such as it was at the center of becsehely scoop up that money boys grab the dice istvan said dowsers mustve spotted another wave of kuusaman dragons coming to pay us a call dowsing now dowsing is real magecraft kun said sensing motion at a distance farther than you can seehow could you possibly do that without sorcery istvan nodded well thats true enough i was a dowsers helper for a while over on obuda they gave me the job for a punishment because he had a heavy sack of rods to carry but i ended up enjoying itborsos was an interesting fellow to talk to rememberhe showed up in the unkerlanter woods too thats right szonyi also nodded he was trying to spy out something swemmels stinking goateaters were up to the horns cried out again booted feet thudded on wet ground as gyongyosian soldiers who werent already in trenches ran for shelter take cover shouted captain frigyes the company commander take cover and be ready to come up blazing if the kuusamans bring boats up onto the beach may the stars hold that idea out of their heads istvan said and made a sign to avert the evil omen becsehely was big enough to support a dragon farm wings thundering gyongyosian dragons painted in bold stripes of red and blue and black and yellow flew out to meet the enemies the dowsers had spotted kuusaman colors were sky blue and sea green which made their dragons hard to see but easy to tell apart from the gyongyosian beasts once noted i wonder if this really will be the invasion kun remarked making sure dirt didnt foul the business end the blazing end of his stick theyve pounded us before when we thought they would land and they didnt istvan said heres hoping they stay away again oh aye heres hoping but kun seemed unable to look on the bright side of things the trouble is theyve taken a lot of islands away from us too if they hadnt our regiment would still be fighting the unkerlanters in those woods that went on forever and ever im not sorry to be out of the forest istvan admitted of course idve been happier if theyd sent us somewhere besides this miserable flat place i miss having a horizon with mountain teeth in it if the kuusamans do come ashore kun hesitated plainly wondering how to go on if they do come ashore i wonder if our officers will have to hold us to the oath we swore the oath about the strong sorcery i mean i know what you mean istvan said algarve and unkerlant used the life energy from sacrificed people to power their sorcery the algarvians killed kaunians theyd conquered king swemmel s sorcerers sacrificed those of their own folk they reckoned useless both those answers revolted the gyongyosians but theyd seen they might need such wizardry with a shrug istvan continued were a warrior race most of the company had volunteered to be sacrificed if the need ever arose istvan had without thinking twice kun had too much more hesitantly the stars already know szonyi said they always know kun said but dont that thin hiss in the air wasnt the stars telling corporal kun what would be it was an egg falling to burst in the sea just off the muddy westfacing beach of becsehely some dragonflier overhead had been too eager but other bursts of sorcerous energy walked up the beach toward the trenches where istvan and his comrades huddled he hated taking a pounding from dragons more than any other part of war he knew exactly why too he couldnt hit back an egg falling out of the sky didnt care whether he belonged to a warrior race or not he looked up sure enough the kuusaman dragons were harder to see than those his countrymen flew but by the way eggs carpeted becsehely by the way gyongyosian dragons tumbled out of the sky one after another he had no trouble figuring out the kuusamans outnumbered them the kuusamans had been the first to figure out how to transport dragons on board ship and theyd got better and better at it since but they didnt have things all their own way here the gyongyosians had brought heavy sticks to becsehely sticks that could blaze through a behemoths chainmail and through the behemoth tooand sticks strong enough to blaze down a dragon no matter how high it flew istvan whooped when a kuusaman dragon faltered in midair he whooped again when it started down toward the island nor was he the only one we nailed that son of a strumpet szonyi shouted he looks like hes coming straight toward us kun said and people stopped whooping finishing a wounded furious dragon with handheld sticks was anything but a mornings pleasant sport this one landed on the muddy beach not a hundred yards in front of istvans trench its shrieks tore at his ears then all at once they stopped cautiouslya few eggs were still burstinghe stuck up his head to see what had happened the dragon lay dead the kuusaman dragonflier was holding the stick he took into the air with him he must have put a beam through the dragons eye at close range seeing istvan he threw the stick down on the beach and held his hands high ito surrender he shouted in horrible gyongyosian istvan hadnt expected to capture a dragonflier but he wouldnt complain come on get in this trench before your own people drop an egg on you he called ito thank the dragonflier said and jumped down and ran over to istvan younoto kill he asked anxiously as he slid into the trench in his boots istvan would have sounded anxious too but the gyongyosian sergeant shook his head no you kuusamans youve got captives from my kingdom too once you start killing captives where do you stop istvan had to repeat himself with simpler words to get the enemy dragonflier to follow that but the fellow finally nodded good he said i yoursto be for a little while istvan wondered what was so good about being a captive but only for a little while the kuusaman had come through the war alive istvan wondered if he would be able to say the same skrunda wasnt a big city jelgava held dozens probably hundreds of towns like it as in so many of those towns the people of skrunda liked to think of it as bigger than it really was newssheet vendors hocked their wares as zealously as they did in balvi the capital down in the southeast habakkuk explained one of them shouted waving a sheet with great abandon floating home of air pirates talsu couldnt remember the last time hed bought a news sheet theyd been full of lies ever since the algarvians overran his kingdom but hed seen graffiti praising habakkuk all over skrunda hed also seen that the redheads didnt love them they gathered work crews together to wash them off or paint over them and so he dug into a trouser pocket and came up with a couple of coppers for the newssheet vendor here you go pal the fellow said and handed him the sheet hed been waving thanks talsu answered he kept his nose in the news sheet all the way back to the tailors shop where he worked with his father that almost got him into trouble for he noticed a couple of algarvian constables just in time to get out of their way he scowled after they swaggered past jelgava like valmiera to the south was a kaunian kingdom redheads in a land of blonds kilts in a land of trousers seemed shockingly out of place even though king donalitu had fled to lagoas and exile more than three years before even though king mezentio of algarve had promptly named his younger brother mainardo as king of jelgava in donalitus place a whitewashed patch on a fence probably told where a graffito shouting habakkuk had been painted talsu walked past it with a thoughtful grunt he also nearly walked past the tailors shop and the rooms above it where he and his family lived his father was working on a tunic of algarvian military cut in a fabric too heavy for jelgavas weather when talsu walked in traku frowned to see the news sheettalsus father in truth spent a good deal of time frowning what sort of nonsense are the redheads spouting today he asked he might make uniforms for the occupiersespecially as now for algarvians sent west to fight in freezing unkerlantbut he didnt love them neither did talsu hed fought them before his kingdom collapsed and hed tried to fight them here in skrunda too hed spent some months in a jelgavan dungeon from trusting the wrong people then no he had no reason to love algarvians he set the news sheet on the counter i bought the miserable thing because it said it would tell me what habakkuk was ah that interested traku too he reached for the news sheet and does it it says habakkuk is an iceberg or a swarm of icebergs fixed up with sorcery so theyll sail the ley lines like regular ships and carry a whole great load of dragons while theyre doing it talsu answered traku skimmed through the article aye thats what it says all right he remarked when he was through the next question is do you believe it i dont know talsu answered weve had dragons from kuusamo or lagoas or wherever theyre from drop more eggs on skrunda lately than they did in the whole war up till now so theyve got something new i expect maybe traku nodded ill give you that much anyhow but giant chunks of ice with dragons on top of them i doubt it he wadded up the news sheet and flung it in the trash can my guess is the redheads came up with this fancy nonsense because they cant build real ships as fast as lagoas and kuusamo can and theyre making all the news sheets print it to distract people youre probably right talsu agreed hed got good at searching out the truth buried in algarvian lies this story sounded more like a lie than anything he could easily swallow he went on i saw one other thing in the news sheetor rather i didnt see it whats that his father asked no more boasting about how the redheads were going to chase the unkerlanters right out of that town down in the southherborn thats the name of the place talsu said when the algarvians stop bragging about something its because they havent done it or they cant do it trakus opinion of that needed only one word good talsu nodded he pointed to the tunic his father was working on do you need any help with that no thanks traku answered ive done just about all the handwork it needs he showed the stitches hed applied himself after that its just a matter of laying out the rest of the thread and putting on the finishing touches you can do some more work on that kilt over there if you feel like youve just got to get some work in this very minute all right ill do that then talsu picked up the kilt which at the moment was only a piece cut out from a bolt of heavy woolen fabric as he did so he remarked i never thought id have to worry about making one of these not back before the war started i didnt who would have in a kaunian kingdom traku said we wear trousers the way decent people are supposed to he paused to set thread along a seam he hadnt sewn i do hear that down in balvi there were women wearing kilts even before the war so they could show off their legs trollops thats what i call em oh aye trollops is right talsu said not without a certain interest he went on you see a few jelgavan womeneven a few jelgavan menin skrunda wearing kilts nowadays but they just want to lick the algarvians boots they want to lick em somewhere north of the boots traku said with a coarse laugh talsu laughed too deliciously scandalized hearing the racket from downstairs his sister ausra called whats so funny nothing talsu and traku said in the same breath the way they echoed each other set them both laughing again harder than ever whats so funny that wasnt talsus sister it was his mother and she came down into the tailors shop to get an answer for her question nothing laitsina traku repeated this time in more placating tones laitsina looked from her husband to talsu and back again men she said a distinct sniff in her voice you sit around here telling each other filthy stories and then you expect me to pretend i dont know youre doing it you dont ask for much do you with another sniff she went back up the stairs she was right talsu whispered well of course she was his father answered also in a whisper but so what do you think she and ausraand now your wife too when gailisas up there with em and not working at her fathers grocerydont do the exact same thing when they figure we cant hear em traku shook his head to show talsu what he ought to think not bloody likely not when ive caught em a time or two have you now talsu was scandalized in a different way oh aye traku said they can be as foulmouthed as we ever are only they dont want anybody knowing it its their secret like some of the things gailisa had said made talsu suspect his father had a point he wasnt about to admit as much though he had far fewer illusions than when hed gone into king donalitu s army he cherished those hed managed to keep traku went back to work once hed laid out all the remaining thread on the tunic he began to mutter to himself and to make quick passes over the garment he and talsu hardly thought of what they did as magic it was just a trick of the tailors trade but magic it was using the laws of similarity and contagion to make the unsewn thread conform to that which was sewn the thread writhed and twisted as if briefly coming to life when the writhing stopped the tunic was done traku picked it up tugged at the sorcerously made seams and put on a pair of reading glasses so he could examine it closely when he was done he set it down and delivered his verdict not bad if i do say so myself of course not father talsu said you do the best work in town he lowered his voice again to add better than the cursed redheads deserve too it depends on how you look at things traku said im not doing this just for the algarvians you know im doing it for my own sake too i dont think i could stand doing bad work on purpose no matter who its for all right i know what you mean talsu waved yielding the point and it means one more algarvian whos never coming back to skrunda again that too his father said the algarvian in question a captain came into the tailors shop that afternoon to pick up the tunic after trying it on he nodded it being good he said in jelgavan flavored with his kingdoms trilling accent cloth being nice and thick he dabbed at his forehead with a pocket handkerchief i sweating here when i going down to frozen unkerlant i not sweating anymore he changed back into the thinner tunic hed worn into the shop set on the counter the price to which he and traku had agreed and carried away the garment he would need while fighting king swemmels men i hope he sweats plenty down in frozen unkerlant talsu said after the redhead left oh sure traku agreed as if surprised talsu would have bothered saying anything like that sooner or later either the algarvians or the unkerlanters will run out of men heres hoping its the algarvians he scooped up the silver coins the redhead had left behind and put on his glasses again to examine them this mainardo bugger the redheads call king of jelgavas got a pointy nose aye so he does talsu said from what i remember of the algarvian coins i got before things fell apart mezentios got a pointy nose too he shrugged theyre brothers no reason they shouldnt look alike no reason at all his father said no reason they shouldnt both be trouble either and they cursed well are powers below eat em he paused got up off his stool straightened stretched and twisted this way and that something in his back went poppoppop as if hed cracked his knuckles he sighed ahh thats better i couldnt get the crick out of there no matter how hard i tried he glanced over to talsu hows that kilt coming ive done a couple of pleats by hand and ive got the thread laid out talsu replied now im going to put on the finishing touches the charm he wanted part jelgavan part the classical kaunian that was jelgavans ancestor part nonsense words was almost but not quite identical to the one his father had used with the tunic again most of the kilts stitchery shaped itself traku examined the finished garment and patted his son on the back nice job i still think kilts are ugly as all getout myself but the redhead who ordered this onell get what he paid forand a free trip to unkerlant besides talsus answering grin was every bit as nasty as his fathers out in the field marshal rathar most often wore a common soldiers rockgray tunic with the large stars of his rank on the collar tabs that wouldnt do for a formal court function at the orders of king swemmel s protocol officerwho plainly outranked even a marshal in such mattershe put on his most gorgeous dress uniform before repairing to the throne room you look splendid lord marshal major merovec said loyally rathar eyed his adjutant i doubt it if you want to know the truth what i look like is a gaudy popinjay unkerlanter military fancy dress like that of the other kingdoms of derlavai was based on the regular uniforms of a bygone age when officers needed to be recognizable at a distance and when coldhearted snipers hadnt been able to put a beam through their heads from half a mile away rathars uniform was scarlet and black with ribbons and medals gleaming on his chest splendid merovec repeated his majesty commanded it so how could you look less than splendid hmm the marshal nodded when you put it that way youve got a point having satisfied both his adjutant and the fussy protocol officer rathar made his way through a maze of palace corridors to the throne room at the heart of king swemmel s residence however magnificent the dress uniform he wore though he had to surrender his ceremonial sword to the guardsmen in the antechamber outside the throne room he thought being without a blade detracted from the effect he was supposed to create but his was not the opinion that counted swemmels as always prevailed inside the throne room the king dominated that had always been true in unkerlant and would probably stay true till the end of time the great throne raised swemmelas it had raised his predecessors and would raise his successorshigh above his subjects and drew all eyes to him set against the kings jewel and pearlencrusted robe and massy golden crown marshal rathar s uniform might as well have been simple rockgray nothing competed with swemmel here lesser courtiers nodded to the marshal as he walked past them up the aisle leading to the splendid throne to them he was a person of consequence to swemmel rathar was what the other courtiers were an ornament a decoration a reflection of his own magnificence and glory the marshal prostrated himself before swemmel knocking his head against the carpet and crying out the kings praises as loudly as he could with his mouth an inch off that rug we suffer you to rise king swemmel said in his thin voice take your place beside us we are soon to receive the ministers from kuusamo and lagoas as we have spoken of before and would have you beside us that we might speak to them with greater efficiency that is my pleasure your majesty and my duty rathar replied and stood to the right of the throne where swemmel could easily seek his opinion whether swemmel would want advice or whether he would take it once he got it were questions of a different sort a herald cried his excellency count gusmao minister to unkerlant from king vitor of lagoas his excellency lord moisio minister to unkerlant from the seven princes of kuusamo as usual gusmao and moisio walked up the aisle toward the throne together a pair of oddly mismatched twins coming from the island their kingdoms had shared for so long gave them a similarity that transcended their complete lack of physical resemblance moisio was little and swarthy and flatfaced with a few wisps of gray hair on his chin to do duty for a beard but for gusmaos neat ponytail and a few differences in the cut of his tunic and kilt he could have been an algarvian he was tall and fair with red hair and catgreen eyes lagoans are of algarvic stock too rathar reminded himself theyre allies not algarvians seeing gusmao still made him nervous both ministers bowed low to king swemmel being their own sovereigns direct representatives in unkerlant they didnt have to prostrate themselves swemmel nodded to each of them through you we greet your rulers he said thank you your majesty that was lord moisio a kuusaman title of annoying ambiguity he spoke unkerlanter understandably but with the most peculiar accent rathar had ever heard i appreciate your courtesy as always was that sarcasm with moisio you could never be sure count gusmao said king vitor congratulates you your majesty on the victories your brave soldiers have won against our common foe his accent was different from moisios it was also different from the way algarvians spoke unkerlanter which helped rathar feel easier around the redheaded lagoan minister we thank you swemmel said that restraint astonished rathar restraint wasnt usually one of swemmels outstanding character traits then the king leaned forward on the throne and pointed a long skinny finger at count gusmao we would thank you more were your soldiers fighting on the mainland of derlavai as ours are taking sibiu back ought to count for a little something moisio spoke before gusmao could the kuusaman minister courted lese majesty every time he opened his mouth swemmel had never executed a minister from another kingdom not even the algarvian minister after mezentio beat him to the punch there was always a first time though before the king could start roaring at lord moisio gusmao added and from sibiu our dragons pound valmiera and algarve itself king swemmel snapped his fingers as he had with rathar in discussing the islanders sibiu is nothing but rocks and mud dropped into the sea if it fell in unkerlant no one would notice we fight the algarvian murderers from the narrow sea in the frozen south to the garelian ocean in the steaming north have your overlords the courage to cross to derlavai and close with the foe hed asked that question of the ministers from the two island kingdoms a year before theyd talked about how many other wonderful things they were doing in the fight against algarve rathar knew there was a good deal of truth in what they said that didnt keep him like a lot of unkerlanters from resenting them for the easy time theyd had of the war we do close with the algarvians gusmao said we close with them on the sea we close with them on the air we have driven them from sibiu you do everything except the thing that truly matters swemmel said and snapped his fingers again we know why you hang back too you hope to see the algarvians maim us while we maim them then come in and sweep up the leavings for yourselves is it not so marshal he nodded to rathar rathar wished he hadnt he suspected swemmel had a point whether the king had a point or not though he shouldnt have raised it with his allies rathar said his majesty means weve carried the burden on the mainland of derlavai by ourselves for a long time now help would be welcome we mean what we said swemmel broke in ruining rathars try for diplomacy shall we stop fighting the gyongyosians out among the islands of the bothnian ocean then moisio asked that would let the gongs concentrate on you of course but if its what you want he shrugged gyongyos is an ague king swemmel said algarve is a plague do you understand the difference do you understand anything at all the foreign minister will probably cut his throat rathar thought but then the king had always had even less use for the foreign ministers advice than he had for that from his chief soldier count gusmao said when we hit the algarvians you may be sure we shall hit them hard swemmel yawned when you have something new to say come before us again and let us hear it until then he made a gesture of dismissal if you will not listen your majesty how can you expect to hear anything new lord moisio asked gasps rose from the unkerlanter courtiers one of those gasps rose from marshal rathar he sometimes dared tell the king things others would have hidden from him never not even in the days of the twinkings war had he dared be rude to swemmel the king of unkerlant was conscious of his kingship first last and always king swemmel s eyes widened then narrowed through those narrowed eyes he stared down at the kuusaman minister do you seek to see how far you can try the immunity granted to a diplomat sirrah the king inquired in a voice deadly cold we shall teach you the answer there if you like but you will not have joy of the learning you are as good a foe to your friends as you are to your foes moisio answered keep that up a while and see how many friends you have at the end of it your majesty rathar began urgently whether swemmel did or not he understood that unkerlant would have a much harder time beating algarve and gyongyos without help from the two island kingdoms be silent marshal swemmel snapped and rather ingrained to obedience was silent the kings head swung back to moisio we grant immunity to no man diplomat or otherwise for insolence against our person insolence what insolence the kuusaman said count gusmao told you a thing you would not hear it you refused to hear it where lies the insolence in that more gasps rose from the unkerlanters this time marshal rathar kept quiet every once in a while someone taking a line like moisios could get through to swemmel where flattery and court tricks failed more often of course such attempts ended in disaster which was why even rathar used them only as a last resort swemmel said i have heard such nonsense as he spouts from both of you before why should i care to hear it again he wasnt shouting for his guards to take lord moisio away and do something dreadful to him his failure to shout for them was as much asmore thanrathar could have hoped for why your majesty count gusmao spoke for himself because it is not nonsense i told you the truth and nothing but when we hit the algarvians you may be sure we shall hit them hard aye no doubt and when will that be king swemmel jeered moisio did something then that rathar thought would get him killed in the next instant he stepped up onto the base of the throne and beckoned to swemmel to lean down to him to rathars astonishment the king didmaybe swemmel was too astonished to do anything else too and the kuusaman minister standing on tiptoe whispered something into his ear really swemmel for once sounded altogether human and not in the least royal really lord moisio s voice was firm whatever hed told the king he believed it hearing the way he affirmed it rather believed it too the only problem was he had no idea what moisio had said and by swemmels conspiratorial smirkone that moisio sharedhe wouldnt get to find out any time soon either four a blizzard howled outside the peasant hut in eastern grelz that colonel sabrino had taken for his own sabrino wondered if it would be the last blizzard of the winter it was heavy wet snow not the dry powdery stuff that fellor sometimes just blew sidewayswhen the weather was even colder whether it proved the last blizzard or not it was too thick for the wing of dragons he commanded to fly and so he sat in the hut in front of a roaring fire and poured down spirits to make time go by the peasant whod once lived here had probably passed the winter the same way one thing anyhow sabrino said pronouncing each word with considerable care whats that sir captain orosio sat on another stool not far away he had a mug of spirits too and hed also emptied it more than once in weather like this even the cursed unkerlanters cant get their dragons off the ground sabrino said orosio considered that with owlish intensity once it had penetrated he nodded youre right sir he said as if sabrino had given him some hidden key to the true meaning of the world by the powers above youre right of course i am sabrino said grandly he drew himself straight on his stool and almost fell off it i am a colonel of dragonfliers do i know these things or do i not youre a colonel of dragonfliers of course you do orosio tilted back his mug and drained it he reached for the jar that sat on the rammedearth floor between sabrino and him the jar sloshed when he picked it up grunting in satisfaction he poured himself a refill after he drank he turned carefullytoward sabrino how come youre still a colonel of dragonfliers whats that sabrino asked how come youre still just a colonel of dragonfliers lord count orosio said again youve got the blue blood and powers above know you fight your wing like a mad bastard how come youre not a brigadier of dragonfliers or maybe a lieutenant general of dragonfliers by now plenty of people who started behind you and werent so good to begin with are ahead of you now it doesnt seem fair to me ah sabrino reached out and patted orosio on the shoulder you are a gentleman my friend nothing less than a gentleman but the war could go on till i was much older than i am nowwhich is quite old enough believe you me it isand i would die a colonel of dragonfliers i suppose i ought to count myself lucky i wouldnt die a sergeant of dragonfliers i dont understand sir orosio sounded on the verge of tears because he didnt understand there had been times when sabrino found himself on the verge of tears because he understood altogether too well no more though he wasor he told himself he wasresigned to what had happened to his career do you want to know why im not a brigadier of dragonfliers or even a lieutenant general of dragonfliers orosio its simple nothing simpler in fact i told king mezentio to his face that he was making a mistake when he started sacrificing kaunians for the sake of sorcery and i turned out to be right thats why im still a colonel of dragonfliers and why ill be one till my dying day he emptied his own mug and poured it full again would you have had a better chance for promotion if you turned out to be wrong orosio asked sabrino shook his head no not any chance at all he said loudlyaye he could feel the spirits sure enough it didnt help that i turned out to be right but it didnt matter much either you tell the king hes made a mistake and youve made a worse one if you ever wanted to see rank higher than the one you owned thats not fair by the powers above its not fair captain orosio said with drunken insistence of his own youre a free algarvian youve got as much right to tell him whats so as hes got to tell you oh aye ive got the right sabrino agreed ive got the right but hes got the might the jingling rhyme made him laugha telling measure of how drunk he was not fair orosio said again the way things are we need every good soldier doing everything he can he leaned over to pat sabrino this time and he too almost fell off his stool youre a good soldier sir but youre not coming close to doing everything you can no you think not sabrinos laugh was loud and emphatic too right this minute im doing everything i can just to sit up same as you are who me orosio said im fine just fine to prove how fine he was he burst into raucous song thats lovely sabrino said another telling measure of how low in the jar the level of spirits had got he yawned enormously lets go to bed aye lets captain orosio said not that the hut boasted any real beds instead it had benches against the wall on which the unkerlanter peasants who lived there had been wont to throw pillows and blankets and themselves those pillows and blankets were long gone as were the unkerlanter peasants sabrino did not miss them for one thing the hut already boasted a generous oversupply of lice and bedbugs and fleas for another the dragonfliers were wearing the furs and leathers in which they rose high with their mounts those were warm enough to take the measure of even an unkerlanter winter sabrino lay down so did orosio the wing commander heard orosio start to snore then weariness and spirits rolled over him like an avalanche and he heard nothing more for a long time when he woke up he was lying on the floor by the bench he had no recollection of falling off but he must have done it orosio remained where hed lain down he was still snoring too the horrible noise made sabrino wince everything just then made sabrino wince the fire had died into embers but even their faint red glow seemed too bright for his eyes his head throbbed as if eggs were bursting inside it powers above he muttered talking hurt too he couldnt remember the last time hed done such a thorough job of damaging himself with spirits he started to crawl toward the jar then gathered himself got to his feet and walked over to it he poured some spiritsnot too muchinto his mug and swallowed as if he were swallowing medicine his outraged stomach tried to rebel but he sternly refused to let it after the first dreadful shock the spirits started cutting into his hangover instead of making it worse had he been an unkerlanter peasant he probably would have gone from hangover remedy straight into another drunk he was tempted to do that anyway but shook his head which also hurt the blizzard might end if the dragons hadnt frozen out there he might have to fly flying hung over was painful hed done that a few times flying drunk flying drunk was asking to get killed he might have felt like death but he didnt feel like dying he shook orosio the squadron leader groaned but then went back to snoring sabrino shook him again orosio opened one eye which was redder than the embers in the hearth go away he croaked his eyelids slid shut again duty sabrino said futter duty orosio answered im not fit for it anyway cant you see im diseased i need a healer i know what you need sabrino poured some more spirits into a mug it was the one from which hed drunk but he wasnt worrying about the niceties just then and the gurgle and splash got orosios attention the squadron leader opened both eyes he sat up when sabrino held out the mug to him he took it and gulped the spirits powers above thats foul stuff he said and then a moment later let me have some more no sabrino shook his head again which made him wish it would fall off the idea is to cure you not to start you down the slope again oh im cured orosio said in hollow tones into shoe leather i think im going to swear off spirits forever or at least until the next time i feel like getting drunk again he eyed the jar in sabrinos hand a little more no sabrino repeated and shoved the stopper into the jar again he sat down beside orosio his legs didnt want to hold him up any more i didnt take any more for myself than i gave youenough to take the edge off things but thats all youre a hard cruel man colonel orosio grimaced ive got demons ringing bronze bells in my head i know what you mean with an old mans spraddlelegged shuffle sabrino walked to a window he felt like a very old man just then when he undid the leather lashings that held the shutter closed he looked out on swirling white the snow hasnt let up good orosio said maybe well be somewhere close to human before we have to fly again right now i dont think the undertakers did much of a job embalming me you embalmed yourself same as i did sabrino answered i wonder how many men in the wing have gone and done the same nothing else to do in this miserable place orosio said nothing to do on this whole front but drink and fly if we cant fly that only leaves one thing he cast a longing eye at the jar of spirits dont remind me sabrinos laugh was half real amusement half something darker something grimmer when im drunk i keep looking around for my wife to hit the same as any unkerlanter peasant would he laughed again i wouldnt really hit gismonda mind you shed have the law on me in nothing flat but if fronesia were here but shes not your mistress anymore orosio said didnt you tell me shed taken up with a major of footsoldiers a major a colonel something like that sabrino made a fist well my good fellow what better reason to hit her than that ah orosio said again as if sabrino had offered him a philosophical revelation sabrino wasnt feeling philosophical he was just feeling battered and abused the last thing he needed was someone pounding on the door to the hut he flinched at the racket so did orosio the only way to make it stop was to open the door when sabrino did he marveled at how young and cleancut the crystallomancer looked well he growledsoftly the crystallomancer seemed oblivious to his fragile condition he said sir weve got ten new dragons and ten new dragonfliers coming in as soon as the weather clears enough do we sabrino said and the youngster nodded ten really sabrino asked the crystallomancer nodded again thats about half the strength weve got here now orosio said aye and it brings the wing up to something close to halfstrength sabrino added though at the start of the war hed never imagined it would be that was something to celebrate he went back into the hut poured a mug full of spirits and thrust it at the crystallomancer here he said have a drink im off to the boulevard of horsemen krasta said with as much gaiety as she could muster colonel lurcanio looked up from his paperwork but not for long try not to buy more than the carriage can carry back here he told her even for one of the algarvian occupiers he was notably cynical i was hoping one of the lingerie shops might finally have something new she said were you that got lurcanios notice as krasta had thought it would if it hadnt she would have been offended and she would have let him know about it too he ran his eyes up and down her as if imagining her in a new negligee or perhaps being peeled out of a new negligee heres hoping they do if you come to my bedchamber tonight maybe youll find out krasta purred maybe if i decide to open the door and let you in giggling she hurried out of his office enjoy your papers she called from the empty antechamber no new adjutant had replaced captain gradasso who was off somewhere in the barbarous wilds of unkerlant krastas driver greeted the news that he was to take her into priekule with something less than unrestrained enthusiasm oh very well milady he said itll be a bit though i have to get the horses ready when krasta went out to the stables she discovered not for the first time that getting the horses ready also involved getting his trusty flask ready but he still handled the carriage well enough so long as that remained true krasta didnt care if he drank he was a commoner after all and what were commoners but a pack of drunks the lingerie shop had the same wares it had displayed the last time shed shopped there a few weeks beforeand on her visit before that too shed sneered then today she bought a gown of filmy blue silk that would play up her eyesas well as some other assets shed seen it before aye but colonel lurcanio wouldnt have she didnt even harass the shopgirl while making the purchase which proved she had something on her mind carrying the parcel in her handthe silk folded up into next to nothingshe hurried out of the shop on the sidewalk she paused and looked around everything looked as normal and as dreary as could be shoes clicking on the slates she hurried off the boulevard of horsemen and onto a side street the blocks of flats there had a look of good breeding even wartime poverty and neglect couldnt mar people who lived in them were people to be reckoned with krasta looked around again she didnt see any of the people whod been on the boulevard when she left the lingerie shop satisfied she ducked into one of the blocks of flats and went up to the third floor itll be the one farthest from the stairs she reminded herself the hallway had carpeting thicker and softer than her mansion boasted she knocked on the door viscount valnu opened it well come in sweetheart he said smiling his bright predatory skeletally handsome smile no one followed you here i hope i dont think so krasta said before remembering that trusting him was liable to be even more dangerous than trusting lurcanio hastily she added if i dont come back ive left enough behind in writing to make sure you get what you deserve smiling still valnu said i dont believe you alarm blazed through krasta for she was bluffing before she could say anything before she could do anything valnu went on before the war though you never would have had the wit to come up with the lieso maybe it isnt a lie invasions are so educational arent they i dont know what on earth youre talking about krasta snapped valnu laughed well that sounds more like you but the question isnt what you dont know the question is what you do know and what you intend to do about it i know krasta paused and took a deep breath i know youre part of the underground because if you werent count amatu wouldnt be dead and so valnu asked what do you propose to do about that that algarvian colonels been in your bed ever since the redheads marched into priekule i dont care to have my name come up in pillow talk you know the parcel krasta was holding crinkled a little that reminded her of what was inside the paper her cheeks heated even so she said if you didnt care to have that happen you shouldnt have tried molesting me at one party or anotherat one party and another i should say molesting you valnu threw back his head and laughed my dear you didnt seem molested and who if i may ask was doing just what to whom krasta needed a moment to sort through that too once she did she put the parcel down on a table and walked right up to valnu the last time we got caught she said putting her arms around him i was doing something like this she kissed him he didnt respond for a moment then his mouth still joined to hers he started to laugh and he kissed her back thats better she said after a while i was starting to wonder if those handsome algarvian officers were the only ones who mattered to you any more i already said you have a handsome algarvian officer in your bed valnu replied why shouldnt i have some in mine he was as usual altogether flagrant and altogether unabashed why krasta said ill show you why she kissed him again this time so hard that she tasted bloodhers or his she neither knew nor cared whatever his interest in algarvian officers she knew shed excited him in the past by the bulge in his trousers she was exciting him again too now she laughed in the middle of a kiss laughed and ground her hips against him i asked you once who was molesting whom valnu panted his left hand cupped her right buttock his right squeezed her left breast oh shut up she told him and rubbed him with her hand deft and sure his right hand undid the wooden toggles that held her tunic closed he bent to her and teased her nipples with his tongue whatever his interest in algarvian officers he remembered how to excite her too she fumbled with his belt once she got it unbuckled she yanked his trousers down she fell to her knees in front of him but as she began as one of his hands went to the back of her head to guide her he said the last time you put your mouth there you threw me out of your carriage when you found out a pretty little shopgirl had done that before you and so krasta rocked forward and back a couple of times valnus breath sighed out of him krasta paused and said she was just a commoner she returned to what shed been doing his fingers tangled in her hair his hand urged her forward again urged her on in spite of it she paused again and looked up at him i presume all your handsome algarvians were of noble blood he gaped then he laughed he laughed so hard he lost the most obvious evidence of his excitement theres no one like you is there he said i should hope not krasta replied indignantly and set about repairing the damage it didnt take long she hadnt thought it would after a bit valnu pulled away shall we go back to the bedchamber he asked krasta considered no she said and pulled him down onto the floor with her she regretted that in short order thrashing about on the carpet wasnt so comfortable as it would have been on a soft resilient mattress but that regret was only a small thing especially after valnu poised himself above her her thighs clasping his lean flanks he had stamina and to spare and also had the courtesy to help her along with a finger so that she gasped and shuddered and stiffened at the same instant he drove himself deepest into her afterwards he didnt have the courtesy to keep all his weight on his elbows and knees that mattered more on a hard floor than it would have in bed too let me up krasta said and bit him on the shoulder to make sure she got the point across so much for romance valnu said but he did as she asked romance hasnt got anything to do with getting squashed krasta spoke with great conviction she rubbed her backside she hadnt noticed the carpet burn while she and valnu were making love but she did now he started putting on his clothes as he did up the toggles on his tunic he asked whose side are you on anyway mine of course krasta replied at once before she got dressed she used the privy as she returned she asked a question of her own did you expect anything else i never know what to expect with you darling valnu said running a comb through his hair he cocked his head to one side studying her i dont think anyone knows what to expect from you good she said which made him laugh again but then he sobered not necessarily he told her you ought to know youve almost had the same sort of unfortunate accident poor count amatu did people in the underground have wanted to kill you was what that meant krasta knew she had to keep up a bold front just remember she said that kind of accident wouldnt be unfortunate only for me without giving him a chance to answer she picked up the paperwrapped parcel and swept out of the flat her driver hadnt drunk himself into a stupor he touched the brim of his cap when she came up home milady or on to more shops he asked home krasta said he nodded and took her there without another word colonel lurcanio met her in the entrance hall i trust you had a successful campaign he asked as if shed gone to war rather than to the boulevard of horsemen how much did he know was he spying on her before that would only have infuriated her now it might be deadly dangerous as calmly as she could she answered aye and held up the parcel as if it were spoils of war ah lurcanios eyes lit up you will have to show me your plunder then tonight krasta promised doing her best to sound alluring lurcanio was a good lover shed first let him into her bed more from fear than for any other reason but shed come to want him too that wouldnt be so easy tonight though not after what had happened in the flat off priekules chief shopping boulevard she sighed and hoped he didnt notice the more she wished things were simple the more complicated they got after supper she went up to her bedchamber and put on the negligee lurcanio knocked on her door not much later when she opened it he looked her up and down a successful campaign indeed he said and surprised her by picking her up and carrying her back to the bed he surprised her again when his attentions gave her a full share of pleasure just as valnus had lazy in the afterglow she leaned over and kissed him if she was on her own side and no one elses shed won twice today ealstan glared at pybba you dont care he said bitterly youve never cared shes a kaunian as far as youre concerned the powers below are welcome to her the pottery magnate glared back at ealstan aye now that you mention it before ealstan could hurl himself at him pybba went on but youre worth enough to me that id do something for her if i could only thing is i cant you havent tried ealstan exclaimed what exactly do you think i can do pybba asked if shes still in forthweg at all shes here in eoforwic in the kaunian district right some of the guards there are algarvians the rest of the whoresons the forthwegians are the ones whore just a step away from plegmunds brigade they dont want to have anything to do with kaunians except maybe to blaze em and they dont want to have anything to do with me either im sorry kid but what does that leave he didnt sound particularly sorry and ealstan knew he wasnt particularly sorry but ealstan also knew he had a point or part of a point my father says you can always bribe an algarvian if you go about it the right way go ahead and try pybba said most of the time your old mand be right but theyve tightened up about the blonds they need em too bad to want to turn any more ofem loose he shrugged its a sign theyre in trouble if you think that breaks my heart youre daft he had a point there too ealstan didnt want to admit it not when pybba was talking about vanai but he began shut up pybba said flatly ive listened for as long as im going to listen get your arse back to work what you try by yourself you try thats all but if anything goes wrong you can bet ill kill you before the stinking redheads get the chance to squeeze you you know too bloody much i dont know enough to do what i need to do ealstan said though that wasnt what pybba meant you didnt know enough to keep from getting the hots for a blond girl the pottery magnate told him though that wasnt what hed meant before either pybba jerked a thumb at the door that led out of his inner office go on get out of here i havent got the time to waste on you and you havent got the time to waste with all the work piled on your desk if ealstan said he was caught up on his work pybba would just give him more he knew that he had no choice but to leave he slammed the door behind him pybba only laughed plenty of people slammed the door coming out of his office it was usually a sign hed got his way not this time ealstan muttered a couple of people in the outer office glanced at him but not with any enormous surprise plenty of people muttered to themselves coming out of pybbas office too to make things worse one of the first items ealstan had to enter in pybbas ledgers was the payment the algarvians had made for another large shipment of style seventeen sugar bowls the potter magnate made plenty of money from the redheadsmoney he turned around and used against them but would he do anything for vanai ealstan shook his head what you try by yourself you try thats all powers below eat you ealstan whispered he clenched his fist till his nails bit into the palm of his hand i will try and i will get her out too mechanically he worked through the day as hed worked through every day since coming home to find vanai vanished at last quitting time came he hurried out of pybbas establishment and onto the streets of eoforwic he didnt go straight home he saw no point in going straight home without vanai there his flat was only a place to eat and sleep he didnt want to spend time there not any more spending time there reminded him of what he was missing and that hurt too much to bear instead as he often did these days he hurried to the edge of the kaunian district prominently posted signs outside it declared that any forthwegians caught inside the district would be blazed without warning thus we thwart the kaunians vile sorceries the signs proclaimed they seek to conceal their evil but we shall not let them masquerade as decent people as forthwegians was what that meant most of the guards patrolling the edge of the quarter were forthwegians themselves pybba had been right about that hed also been right that they seemed enthusiastic about their work did that make them decent people ealstan couldnt see it one of the guards saw him the fellow swung his stick ealstans way not quite pointing it at him but ready to do just that you keep sniffing around here the guard said i catch you again youll be sorry you got that aye ealstan said and beat a retreat he cursed and kicked at pebbles all the way back to his fiat wishing each one of them were the guards face how could he get into the kaunian quarter to bring vanai out when his own countrymen were so determined to keep her and all the other blonds in there till the algarvians needed them once he got home he ate bread and olive oil and almonds and a chunk of smoked pork washing them down with red wine he hadnt bothered fixing himself anything fancier than that since the redheads had seized vanai he probably would have botched things anyhow hed never had to learn to cook for himself shes going to have a baby he thought as he washed his few dishes dont the algarvians care unfortunately he knew the answer to that only too well he thought about pouring himself more wine about drowning his worries in it but then he shook his head as if someone had suggested the idea to him out loud as far as a lot of kaunians were concerned forthwegians were a bunch of drunks i cant afford to get drunk now if im drunk i know i wont come up with any way to get my wife free the only trouble with that was even sober he couldnt find any way to get vanai free hed tried and tried and had no luck he wandered out of the kitchen and into the front room like the bedroom it had several cheap bookcases filled with secondhand books back before vanai had come up with the spell that let her look like a forthwegian shed had to stay in the flat all the time with words on paper her only escape from boredom ealstans eye fell on the slim book called you too can be a mage he scowled at it miserable useless thing he said vanai had tried to use a charm in it to make herself look like a forthwegian the one time she cast that spell all shed accomplished was the opposite of what shed intended for a little while shed made ealstan look like a kaunian fortunately shed figured out how to reverse that but then shed had to take apart the spell in you too can be a mage see where the bumbling author must have mistranslated from classical kaunian into forthwegian and reconstruct what the original kaunian had been that gave her a spell she could really use not one that offered hope and then immediately betrayed it ealstan had heard her use the spell dozens of times with a couple of bits of yarn he could have cast it himself but so what he already looked like a forthwegian turning himself into one wouldnt do him any good he took you too can be a mage off the shelf and found the sorcery vanai had modified in its original unchanged form it would let him look like a kaunian for a moment excitement blazed in him that would get him into the kaunian quarter it would let him see vanai it would let him be with her but it wouldnt let him bring her out that was what he needed above all else going into the kaunian district to keep her company was romantically splendid but altogether useless all it would accomplish in the long run maybe in the notsolong runwas getting both of them sent west that wont do he said as if someonesomeone inside himself perhapshad suggested it would the idea wasnt for him to die looking like a kaunian the idea was for vanai to live looking like a forthwegian or whatever else she had to look like to go on living ealstan nodded he did clearly see what had to be done he was the practical son of a practical father hestan would never have wasted time on a futile romantic gesture either fair enough ealstan thought i see what doesnt work what does though the algarvians had set things up so that no forthwegians could go into the kaunian quarter and no kaunians could pass out of it into the rest of eoforwicnot unless they seized them and took them to the leyline caravan depot their system wasnt slipshod as it had been before these days they couldnt afford to waste kaunians with the war in unkerlant not going well they needed every blond they could catch and hold no forthwegians inside no kaunians outside ealstan hurled you too can be a mage across the room he slammed his fist down on the little table in front of the sofa on which he sat pain blazed up his arm that left nothing there has to be something he shook his head he wanted there to be something that didnt mean it had to be how many kaunians had thought there had to be something how many of those kaunians were dead now too cursed many ealstan knew that wearily he got to his feet and picked up you too can be a mage the pages were almost ready to part company with the binding this wasnt the first time he or vanai had flung the book with a curse ealstan put it back on the shelf there has to be something he said it aloud even if hed already figured out it wasnt true the redheads had closed off every possibility involving forthwegians and kaunians and what else was there nothing not a stinking thing he said that aloud too to remind himself not to be a fool then he went to bed when he woke up he was smiling at first still half asleep he didnt understand why but as full awareness came the smile only got broader he knew what he had to do a moment later he paused and shook his head he knew what he had to try it might not work if it didnt work he was ruined but if it did he had a chance his breakfast was much the same as his supper had been only with olives as a relish instead of almonds he hurried downstairs hurried out of the block of flats hurried to the pottery works hurried into pybbas sanctum hed been sure the pottery magnate would be there before him and hed been right pybba sat behind his desk sorting through papers and muttering unhappily to himself he looked up at ealstan with no great liking what do you want before answering ealstan closed the door behind him pybbas eyebrows rose they rose higher when ealstan told him exactly what he wanted youre out of your bloody mind boy the pottery magnate said when he was through probably ealstan agreed can you get it for me noim sure you can will you get it for me id be crazy if i did pybba answered ealstan folded his arms across his chest and waited pybba said anything goes wrong and sliced his thumb across his throat ealstan didnt move then pybba said odds are id be well rid of you anyhow and ealstan knew he had won ukmerge had one parkor at least skarnu hadnt been able to find more than one in winter with the weather cold and the grass dead and the trees barebranched not so many people came there he could still walk through it though or sit down on one of the benches without drawing notice from the constables if he came at noon even in the wintertime some workers escaped from the nearby shoe manufactory to eat their dinners in the park the air stank of leather in ukmerge the air stank of leather so much that skarnu had almost stopped noticing it almost he still found himself wrinkling his nose every now and again most of the benches in the park faced a broad expanse of bare ground without trees without even much in the way of dead grass did something used to be here skarnu asked the underground leader who called himself tytuvenai after his hometown one noontime something worth looking at i mean tytuvenai nodded an arch from the days of the kaunian empire the algarvians put eggs under it and knocked it down same as they did with the column of victory in priekule same as theyve done all over valmiera all over jelgava too if half what we hear from there is true powers below eat them skarnu growled theyre trying to make us forget our kaunianity aye no doubt tytuvenai said theyre trying to make themselves forget it toothat we were civilized while they were just woodscrawlers but thats not why i asked you to meet me here today no eh skarnu tried to imagine what the arch had looked like he had no trouble getting a general idea hed seen plenty of imperial monuments in priekule and elsewhere but he didnt know what this one had been for what reliefs and statuary and inscriptions it had borne he wouldnt be able to find out now either nor would anyone else that growl still in his voice he said maybe it should have been maybe tytuvenai didnt sound convinced he explained why one of these days when we have time well worry about arches and columns and tombs we dont have that kind of time now weve got to worry about putting the algarvians in tombs and keeping them from putting any more of us into them isnt that more important than old marble and granite i suppose so skarnu said grudgingly its more urgent anyhow whether urgent is the same thing as important is something we can argue about another day its something wed better argue about another day tytuvenai told him i called you here to ask if you were ready to get back to work ah skarnu said that certainly was more urgent than marble as his comrade had done he got straight down to business here in ukmerge what have you got in mind planting eggs inside the shoe manufactories you laugh tytuvenai said and he was smiling himself if you knew how many shoes this towns made for mezentios men youd laugh out of the other side of your mouth believe you me you would itd be a shrewd blow against the algarvians if we can bring it off it will be a shrewd blow against the algarvians but it isnt what we have in mind for you what do you have in mind for me skarnu knew he sounded relieved the shoe manufactories the whole town of ukmerge oppressed him almost as badly as they did merkela he would have loved to see the manufactories go up in smoke but he didnt want to have anything to do with them himself youll know better than most how the algarvians will bring kaunians from forthweg through valmiera down to the coast of the strait when they want to strike a sorcerous blow against lagoas or kuusamo tytuvenai said skarnus answering nod was grim aye i know about that id better i sabotaged one of those leyline caravans before it could get where it was going and a lot of those kaunians escaped before the redheads got the chance to sacrifice them he spoke with more than a little pride tytuvenai nodded too aye id heard that and when you find a valmieran whos disappeared a valmieran whos got night and fog scrawled on his doorway hes off to be sacrificed too the algarvians want it to seem like a mystery but thats what happens is it skarnu said and the other underground leader nodded again skarnu went on i didnt know that but id be lying if i said i was surprised you still havent told me what its got to do with me though or what you want me to do about it im coming to that tytuvenai said not so long ago in spite of everything we could do the redheads got a couple of caravanloads of kaunians from forthweg down to the coast out about as far east as they could go its pretty plain they were aiming their sacrifice at kuusamo not lagoas and they made the cursed sacrifice and they stole the kaunians life energy and they used it to power their stinking sorcery and something went wrong good skarnu exclaimed what happened did one of their mages botch the spell so that it came down on their own heads by the powers above thatd be sweetand fitting too but now tytuvenai shook his head that was our first guess it doesnt seem to be so though not from the way the algarvians have been running around down there by the sea like so many ants whose anthill just got kicked no what it looks like is they made the sacrificemade the murdersand cast the spell and everything went just the way it was supposed to except that the kuusamans somehow turned the spell around and made it land on the redheads whod cast it either that or they had a counterspell waiting that was even more potent how could they skarnu asked then one obviousand dreadful possibility occurred to him are they sacrificing people for the sake of their life energy too the way the unkerlanters are doing no tytuvenai spoke with great certainty they arent doing that powers above be praised if they were wed know about it the mages say they can feel those sacrifices and they havent felt anything like that out of kuusamo but the kuusamans threw back whatever mezentios men sent them and the algarvians are jumping out of their kilts trying to figure out how mmm i can see why they would be skarnu said if theres something out there that can master their magecraft thats got to be plenty to set them shivering and shaking now youre getting the idea the other underground leader said were going to send you there you and palasta to see if you cant make them shiver and shake a little harder palasta skarnu knew hed heard the name before but where then he remembered oh the little mage who hid my trail when the algarvians were after merkela and gedominu and me in erzvilkas thats right tytuvenai said i know she looks like shed blow away in a strong breeze but shes as good as weve got the best all right skarnu said i wont be sorry to see the last of ukmerge and id be a liar if i said anything different and merkela will be even happier to get away from here than i am a bell rang in the nearby shoe manufactory the workers whod been eating their dinners in the park hurried away if they werent back before the bell rang again they might lose their positions all at once skarnu and tytuvenai seemed conspicuous skarnu looked around nervously he saw no constables algarvian or valmieran he relaxeda little and then he noticed the expression tytuvenai was wearing the other man didnt say anything but he didnt have to skarnu did it for him you dont want merkela to come along with me well now that you mention it no tytuvenai admitted i dont see what she can do to help you once you get down there and the redheads will be looking for a fellow traveling with his wife and baby not for somebody with a girl who could be his almostgrown daughter or his kid sister everybody would be better off if merkela stayed behind everybody except her and me skarnu pointed out tytuvenai shrugged this is still a war back before our army fell apart you went where you were ordered and you did what you were told and you didnt think twice about any of it now youve got a new set of orders my lord marquis will you follow them or wont you its not the same skarnu said in a certain sense that was true the formal structure of the valmieran army no longer existed back in the days when he was a captain his colonel had had authority to give him orders that they both recognized tytuvenai didnt he could request but he wasnt skarnus superior officer he couldnt command not unless skarnu let him despite that the other man from the underground had weapons had them and didnt hesitate to use them im not asking for myself you know this is for the sake of the kingdom this is for the sake of the war curse you skarnu said wearily he had no good argument against that he pointed a finger at tytuvenai im going to bargain with you in the valmieran army that would have got him cashiered tytuvenai just nodded and said go on first before i disappear im going to go back to the flat and say goodbye skarnu said he knew what tytuvenai would say to that and forestalled him i know better than to tell her where im going or what ill be doing all right the other man said mildly but first has second on its trail what else do you want get merkela and the baby out of ukmerge skarnu answered she cant stand it here and i cant say i blame her find her some place out in the country where she can stay shes lived on a farm all her life shes going crazy cooped up in a flat do that and he sighed do that and im your man agreed tytuvenai said at once there you see how easy that was futter you skarnu said tytuvenai laughed except for having to climb out of his cot earlier than he would have liked bembo faced each new day in gromheort with more zest that he would have imagined possible when he came west from tricarico as his unhappy leave back in algarve had reminded him he felt more at home here these days than he did in his own hometown of course constables back in tricarico didnt get rich plenty of graft came their way aye but it was all petty graft constables just werent important enough to get any more things were different here in occupied forthweg here algarvian constables often held the power of life and death over forthwegians and kaunians even with dour brutal oraste for a partner bembo had done amazingly well for himself he found himself grinning at oraste as they queued up for rolls and olive oil and red wine for breakfast no this isnt such a bad place after all he said oraste only grunted he wasnt at his best before hed had something to eat and especially before hed had something to drink hes not always at his best after hes had something to eat and something to drink either bembo thought and his grin got wider whats so fornicating funny oraste demanded ernothing bembo didnt want to quarrel with his partner in a brawl oraste would tear him in two with no remorse and with no great effort better not be oraste said he then clamped his jaw shut till hed got his food and his wine bembo kept quiet too though he liked to talk intimidation cast almost as powerful a spell as magecraft only after oraste had gulped down his wine and gone back for a second mug did he speak again thats more like it bembo sipped from his own mug he smacked his lips together as if he were a connoisseur we can afford better you know powers above we can afford anything we want he blinked back in tricarico hed never imagined being able to say anything like that but it was true oraste grunted again well so what he answered i still say we shouldve turned in that hestan item hes trouble hell go on being trouble aye no doubt bembo said but if we had turned him in what would he have done paid off somebody else thats what and you know it as well as i do go ontell me im wrong oraste let out one more grunt bembo wagged a ringer at him see you cant do it thats how the world works and since thats how the world works id sooner see his money in my belt pouch than anybody elses the clowns who give us orders have too much money already one of orastes eyebrows twitchednot much but enough for bembo to notice he glanced back over his shoulder one of the people who gave him orders sergeant pesaro was heading his way fortunately the fat sergeant couldnt have heard him hed had the sense to keep his voice down had pesaro ever found out how much his two constables had squeezed out of hestan he would have demanded a goodsized cut a large meaty hand fell on bembos shoulder another on orastes i want to see you boys in my office as soon as youre done with breakfast sergeant pesaro said and then went on his way his big belly wobbling as he walked alarm and anger blazed through bembo oh that son of a whore he whispered fiercely that stinking son of a whore he knows i bet if that turd of a hengist rang the bell on us hes going to be one dead forthwegian but oraste whose temper was usually shorter than bembos shook his head i dont think he knows anything he saidnot the first time hed expressed such sentiments about pesaro now though he amplified them look hes picking on other pairs too probably going to shake down everybody bembos voice remained bitter as if hed never shaken down anybody but if pesaro did have the goods on him he knew hed have to fork over getting your sergeant angry at you wasnt much different from having the powers below eat you along with the other constables bembo and oraste trooped into pesaros office they crowded it to the point of overflowing it was none too big to begin with sitting behind his rickety desk pesaro seemed almost trapped whats up sergeant somebody askedbembo couldnt see who he had trouble seeing pesaro too but the sergeant never had any trouble making himself heard he said ill tell you whats up whats up is they need more people to hold the lid on over in eoforwic theres a real live nasty kaunian underground on the loose there and forthwegian rebels and the unkerlanters have been sending dragons over the place and so you men are heading west theres a leyline caravan leaving from the depot here an hour before noon youre all going to be on it eoforwic half the constables in the crowded little office bembo among them howled out the name of the forthwegian capital in protest but their hearts werent in itor at least bembos wasnt he didnt much feel like packing up and going but one forthwegian town was likely to be much like another for any of the constables who didnt understand that sergeant pesaro spelled it out anybody who doesnt care for the idea can go put on a different uniform and get shipped a lot farther west than eoforwic protest was cut off as if sliced by a knife nobody wanted to go fight in unkerlant soldiers coming through gromheort cursed the constables and envied them their soft jobs bembo didnt envy the soldiers theirs which were anything but soft into the sudden silence sergeant pesaro said thats better you will be on platform three at the depot by an hour before noon no excusesnot a chance anybody who misses the caravan will go straight to unkerlant and thats a promise dont bring anything more than you can carry either questions why did you pick us sergeant someone asked because youre so sweet pesaro growled any more questions after that there were none pesaro waved a hand dismissed bembo went back into the barracks and started loading a duffel bag it got full long before hed gone through everything around his cot cursing he started editing his earthly goods he needed three tries before finally deciding he could do no better even then the canvas sack left him panting and sweating by the time hed lugged it to the caravan depot what have you got in there demanded the algarvian who checked his name off a list your wife bembo snarled he and the fellow with a clipboard cursed each other till grunting with effort he hauled the duffel bag onto the caravan car oraste was already aboard his sack held about a quarter as much as bembos have you got everything you need he asked no bembo said he would have flung his bag against the wall of the car but it was too heavy to fling he eased it over there and flung himself into a seat oraste who laughed at very little laughed at him bembo petulantly glared at his partner till the leyline caravan glided west out of gromheort before long he was in country hed never seen before he took a while to realize it the countryside didnt look much different from that around gromheort fields with growing wheat and barley slid past his window so did groves of olives and almonds and citrus fruit and so did villages full of whitewashed houses some with red tile roofs othersmore and more as he got farther westwith roofs of thatch war had touched the countryside only lightly peasants went about their business as they had when king penda ruled forthweg as the leyline caravan passed through townsit stopped three or four times to pick up more constablesthe ruined buildings nobody had bothered to repair stood out much more noticeably as they did in gromheort once the caravan got into the territory unkerlant had occupied before algarve went to war with her the wreckage got fresher and worse king swemmel s men had fought hard every inch of the way eoforwic surprised bembo who said i didnt think this miserable excuse for a kingdom had such a big city its still full of forthwegians oraste replied with a shrug them and kaunians he made as if to spit on the floor of the caravan car but reluctantly thought better of it when the car stopped at the depot he shouldered his sack and hurried out bembos duffel bag hadnt got any lighter while it lay there swearing bent almost double under it he followed his partner onto the platform another cheerful fellow with a clipboard checked his name off a list then the other algarvian said weve got carriages waiting for you people to take you to your barracks oh powers above be praised bembo said fervently i was afraid id have to walk he carried his duffel bag with jauntier style not least because he knew he wouldnt have to carry it far they did things with class here in the capital that impression lasted till he got to the barracks which were every bit as crowded and gloomy as the ones in gromheort he got an iron cot in the middle of a room full of constablesa room full mostly of strangers someone called his name in a loud voice here he answered and then seeing the pips on the other constables shoulder boards here sergeant he wondered what sort of a new boss he was getting im folicone the sergeant said he was younger and skinnier than pesaro of course even bembo was skinnier than pesaro so that didnt say much folicone went on im going to partner you with delminio here he nodded toward a constable whose cot stood only a couple of spaces away from bembos pleased to meet you delminio said and clasped wrists with bembo he wore bushy red side whiskers and mustachios and chin beard waxed to spikes pleased to meet you too bembo answered but then he turned to folicone and said sergeant oraste and i weve been partners a long time you know what i mean and maybe you will be again in a while sergeant folicone said but i want you with somebody who knows the ropes here while youre breaking in that made too much sense for bembo to argue with it he nodded and said no offense to delminio its all right delminio answered getting a new partner is a funny business i know that he eyed bembo the same way bembo was eyeing him what sort of partner will you be you want to go into the kaunian quarter with me delminio asked he hesitated you do know about the business with the kaunians oh aye bembo said and delminio visibly relaxed bembo added im not what youd call happy about it but what can you do its wartime sounds like youve got some sense delminio said sergeant folicone nodded bembo beamed hed made a good first impression delminio went on just come with me the quarter isnt far bembo went past the same sorts of warning signs he would have seen in gromheort the kaunian district here looked much the same as gromheorts too though it was larger he watched kaunian womens backsides as the blonds went around in trousers so did delminio they noticed each other doing it and they both grinned i think i can manage here bembo said his new partner nodded bembo wondered if he could find a kaunian wench for himself it might not be too hard up till the time when the redheads swept through the kaunian quarter of eoforwic vanai had been through only one roundup and back then she hadnt even known what the algarvian constables were doing when they took kaunians out of oyngestun theyd told soothing lies then theyd said they were sending people west as laborers some of her fellow villagers had even gone with them of their own free will it wasnt like that anymore the surviving kaunians knew the algarvians wanted them for one thing and one thing only their life energy and so when the redheads swarmed into the kaunian district the blonds did their best to hide the roundup of course came without warning anyone the hunters caught on the street was simply nabbed and grabbed and hauled away but the captured kaunians cries of despair and the algarvians shouts of triumph warned others of the raid like any hunted animals most of the kaunians who werent caught in the open had holes in which to hide vanai was no exception after she was captured and brought into the kaunian district shed expected something like this to happen sooner or laterprobably sooner and so shed gone exploring in the block of flats where the redheads had put her waiting quietly in her flat for them to come get her and take her away she shook her head by the powers above im not going to make it easy for them she thought exploring had been easier because so many of the flats stood empty she didnt like to think about that but it gave her a lot more choices than she would have had otherwise shed found a good spot in a vacant groundfloor flat a closet that had a lot more room than it seemed to and one where a searcher peering in even with a lamp wouldnt be able to spy her he would have to step all the way into the closet to notice it took an unexpected dogleg whoeverd made it that way might have had a hideyhole in mind when the first terrified cries rang out vanai knew at once what they meant what they had to mean she wasted not an instant she had to get downstairs and into her hiding place before constables started swarming through the building if she didnt she was ruined the baby she carried made her awkward and slow but she forced herself to hurry downstairs anyhow more kaunians many more were going up than down you fool its death on the streets a man said as she pushed past him moving against the tide he was bound to be right of course but vanai wasnt heading for the streets though she didnt say so she burst out of the stairwell and went down the hallway toward that empty flat at a lumbering trot just outside the open door panic nearly froze her what if someone else has found this place too it wont hold two and i wont have time to go looking anywhere else almost moaning in terror she dashed back to the closet no one cried out in fear even greater than hers believing her to be one of the hunters rather than the hunted and no one shouted for her to go away either she still had the place to herself powers above be praised she gasped making herself as comfortable as she could in the little hidden niche only then did another bad thought strike her if this hiding place was so splendid why did this flat stand empty the redheads must have caught whoever had been living here before would constables come casually walking in check the closet and take her away she couldnt run not any more it was too late for that footsteps in the hallway and loud algarvian voices said she had indeed made her choice now she would have to liveor diewith it miserable blonds a man growled his voice sounding as if it came from right outside the doorway to the flat in which she cowered finding the lousy buggers is getting to be like pulling teeth weve got to do it though another algarvian answered he might have been talking about any hard not particularly pleasant job till he went on the forthwegians here wont miss them anyhow well of course they wont the first constable said as if his friend were belaboring the obvious and then that first redheads voice came from inside the flat lets see what weve got here vanai shivered she forced herself to stopit might make a noise she tried not even to breathe not bloody likely well flush anybody out of this placekaunians usually like to run upstairs not hide down low the second algarvian spoke now as the voice of experience i know i know his pal said weve got to go through the motions though a piece of furniture went over with a crash the algarvian grunted nothing there let me check this closet here and then we can go on upstairs like you said he spoke his last few words just outside the closet where vanai hid the baby growing inside her chose that moment to kick the unexpected motion within her made her want to jump it made her want to scream she did neither she bit down hard on her lower lip and waited in dark dusty silence then she wanted to scream again for the silence while it remained dusty was no longer so dark that algarvian had a lamp which he used to illuminate as much of the closet as he could from the entrance to it just for a moment light touched the tip of vanais right shoe she started to jerk it back but checked herself motion and sound could betray her too anything the second algarvian asked doesnt look like it the first one answered the hateful light receded now we can go on upstairs and get down to business right his friend said here ill paint a cross on the front door to keep anybody else from wasting his time the two sets of footsteps receded im safe vanai thought dizzily for a little while im safe now she could shake once she started she discovered she had a hard time stopping and just because shed escaped the roundup for the time being didnt mean the other kaunians in the block of flats were so lucky she heard algarvians hauling them downstairs heard men cursing and begging heard women shrieking in despair neither curses nor pleas nor shrieks had the slightest effect on the constables except to annoy them then vanai heard bludgeons striking fleshwhich if they didnt quiet the curses and pleas did turn them to shrieks well thats not a bad bag one algarvian said to another in the groundfloor hallway not too bad anyhow his companion agreed how close to quota are we how should i know the first man answered you think our officers tell me anything more than they tell you fat chance the second man said screw em all theyre just doing their job vanai thought again they dont much like the people who give them the work but they do it how can the i dont understand could anyone understand silence returned vanai didnt dare move theyd said they were done with this block of flats but had all of them left if she came out before they had she was sure they would be happy enough to scoop her up how would she know when could she be sure she shook her head she couldnt be sure when would she have to take a chance she wished she had some way to gauge things inside the closet she feared her guesses werent worth much it already seemed as if shed been trapped inside here forever she was about to come out and see if she could sneak upstairs when she heard new voices in the hallway an algarvian spoke in his own language look at the crosses on the doorways sir theyve already searched this building the fellow who answered did so with aristocratic scorn you are looking with your eyes i look with more than that i look with senses you havent got and i shall find what youve missed tooyou wait and see a mage vanai thought with terror dulled only because shed already been through so much other terror she wasnt warded she hadnt imagined she would need to be warded if he started incantingno when he started incantingshe was ruined its not fair that was probably true but it would do her no good at all out in the streetvanai thought it was out in the street anyhowa shout rang out the same word repeated over and over hidden in the blind dogleg closet she couldnt make out what the word was neither could the algarvian mage how am i supposed to concentrate with this racket he snapped his voice peevish you dont need to concentrate sir the constable with him answered theyre yelling that theyve got their quota they dont need any more blonds this time around oh the mage said is that so well if i dont have to work im bloody well not going to work thats fair enoughbetter than fair enough by the powers above he began to whistle his footsteps along with those of the constable whod come into the block of flats with him faded in the distance as the two men left again vanai didnt move for a long time by then she wasnt sure she could move at last a bladder that threatened to burst drove her to her feet she came out of the closet ever so cautiously she came out of the flat even more cautiously when she saw someone come up the stairs and into the block of flats she almost jumped out of her skin but it was only another kaunian he waved to her so im not the only one they missed here eh he said sounding more cheerful than he had any business doing well good he saw vanai whod survived the roundup and resolutely didnt see all the people who hadnt she couldnt think like that when she went back up to her flat she found that the algarvians had turned it inside out she wasnt upset shed expected nothing less she had little that could be broken and even less that she minded losing before long she had the flat set to rights again and before long just as if the roundup hadnt happened bells clanged in the kaunian quarter summoning the blonds whod come through uncaught to get their food so they could stay strong and healthy till the algarvians needed more of them vanai didnt go in case it turned out to be another trap another betrayal the algarvians whod gone through the flat had been after her person not the couple of small chunks of stale bread and dried fruit shed secreted there she didnt have a lot to eat but she had some as she nibbled a dried apricot she looked out the window and down onto the street below not many kaunians could have escaped in this neighborhood but she saw a fair number of people heading for the feeding stations the algarvians had set up she grimaced if theyre that stupid they deserve to be caught then she grimaced again this time at herself why do they deserve to get caught for having empty stomachs and then she spotted the algarvian constable who came down the street chatting up every young woman who passed she muttered the foulest curses she knew and wished she knew worse ones even though she couldnt hear him she could guess what hed be saying come with me sweetheart give me what i want and you wont go west the same sort of vicious bargain major spinello had struck with her back in oyngestun the redheads were great ones for deals like that vanai shrank back from the window lest he see her when she peeked out again a few minutes later he was gone she let out a long heartfelt sigh of relief five night in the strait of valmiera a nasty night with rain and even a little sleet beating down windwhipped waves slapped against the habakkuks port side as she slid north along a ley line toward the derlavaian mainland secure in the bowels of the great sorcerously enhanced iceberg leino hardly noticed the motion when the kuusaman mage remarked on that xavega raised a scornful elegant eyebrow in a proper leyline ship we would not feel the waves at all she said using classical kaunian as he had we would glide above the water and not be subject to it she didnt add you ignorant kuusaman oaf but she might as well have leino sighed and didnt answer why did my fancy fix on someone who despises me and all my people he wondered one of his own eyebrows quirked in wry amusement because ive been away from pekka too long thats why and because xavega packs her bile in such a nicely shaped container ramalho was every bit as lagoan as xavega but he shook his head in a proper leyline ship those waves might capsize us or push us off the ley line and then sink us he said plenty of hulks on the bottom of the sea hereabouts and not all of them from the days when ships went by sail xavega glared at him she didnt just disagree with leino she was ready to take on the whole world what do you know about it she demanded of ramalho before the war i was a ships mage he said calmly my father spent some time as a ships mage and so did his father before him i might ask you the same question he might ask it but xavega didnt answer it she just tossed her head sending wavy coppercolored locks flying back from her face and went over to the tea kettle to pour herself a fresh cup she slammed the kettle back onto its iron stand almost hard enough to shatter it rain is a worse nuisance for habakkuk than for ordinary ships leino said trying to find something the mages could talk about without quarreling we always have to work to keep the sea from melting us but worrying about the air too makes the sorcery twice as complicated well that is true enough ramalho said xavega just sniffed and sipped at her tea she couldnt very well argue with what leino had said but she didnt care to agree with it either ramalho went on if we sailed habakkuk into setubal harbor back in the days of the six years war all the mages in lagoas would be going mad trying to figure out how we have done all this now there is a picture leino said rather liking it the same would have been true in kuusamo a generation agoor for that matter any time before the derlavaian war started a picture of nonsense xavega said a daft conceit ramalho had offered the conceit but she sounded as if she blamed leino for it with another sigh leino said i hope the dragonfliers will be able to leave the ship in this weather how would xavega take exception to that the storm will help shield them from the algarvians she said which was disagreement but of a relatively tepid sort she continued dowsers start tearing their hair when they have to find moving dragons in the midst of millions of moving raindrops true leino said also less true than it would have been in the days of the six years war though ramalho said our motionselectivity spells are much better than they used to be leino waited for xavega to start squabbling about that too instead to his astonishment she burst into tears no one ever lets me say anything without arguing she wailed and fled the chamber in which theyd been sitting what on earth leino said to ramalho i was hoping you might explain it to me the lagoan mage answered you are the married man after all does that not mean you understand more of women than we bachelors do i understand my wife fairly well i think leino said understanding one woman though does not mean i understand all women any more than understanding one man means i understand all men too bad ramalho said i was hoping it would be simpler than that he shrugged and rolled his eyes of course asking anyone to understand xavega is probably asking too much ah leino said his voice as neutral as he could make it i wondered if it was just me oh no ramalho assured him she can be difficult in fact there are times when i wonder if she can be anything else i knew her in setubal and she was the same way there was she leino asked ramalho nodded solemnly leino said how interesting and left the icy chamber interesting he jeered at himself as he walked down an equally icy corridor is that really the word you want to use the woman is trouble nothing else but even if you got her into bed shed be nothing but trouble shed be more trouble then most likely the only reason you care about her is the way she looks and isnt that reason enough a different rather deeper part of his mind asked in return he shook his head as if he were arguing with someone else and not with himself no it isnt he insisted pekka would laugh at you if she knew you were mooning over a badtempered lagoan just because she has long shapely legs and fills out her tunic nicely that deeper part of his mind didnt answer maybe that meant hed convinced it somehow he didnt think so those legs and the way xavega filled out her tunic stayed with him no matter how badtempered she was aye pekka would laugh at him but pekka wasnt a man and a good thing too he thought there at least both parts of his mind agreed completely he headed toward one of the chambers where the mages worked to keep habakkuk goingas opposed to the chambers where they gathered when they werent working he wasnt due back on duty for another couple of hours but he had the feeling they would welcome him if he came in early rain really did put a lot of extra strain on habakkuks structural integrity and hed done a lot of work while the ship was building to find out how best to foil the raindrops hed almost got there when the icebergturneddragonhauler jerked and shuddered under his feet as if it had run into a wall the next thing he knew he was on his backside in the hallway and all the lights had gone out somewhere in the distance an urgent bell began clanging what in blazes leino exclaimed as he scrambled to his feet his spiked shoes biting into the ice he laughed at himself once upright again he was a true mage all right even then hed spoken in classical kaunian all around him though men and women were crying out in lagoan and kuusaman pain filled some of those cries he realized he was liable to be lucky to have come away with nothing worse than a bruised bottom he hadnt thought about why something as immense as habakkuk might stagger in midocean that also proved him a mage a mage not a sailor some of the outcries in the dark had words in them too when those words were in kuusaman he could follow them two he heard most often were egg and leviathan powers above i am an idiot he saidstill in classical kaunian the dragons habakkuk carried had done nothing but give algarve grief ever since the strange craft first went into action when lagoas and kuusamo took sibiu away from king mezentio and restored king burebistu to the rule over his own island kingdom of course the algarvians would strike at the sorcerously enhanced iceberg if they got the chanceand an algarvian leviathanrider evidently had got it now leino knew he urgently needed to make his way to the chambers where his fellow wizards worked but how the darkness in the bowels of habakkukwas absolute he hadnt thought about how completely the strange vessel depended on magecraft to sustain it in every way till it was suddenly deprived of that magecraft then to his vast relief a lighta handheld lamppierced the gloom a woman called out in classical kaunian magesfollow me damagecontrol parties are forming here leino shouted first in kuusaman and then in classical kaunian he pushed past sailors toward the lamp using his elbows to force his way through them when nothing else worked when he saw the sorcerer holding the light was xavega he didnt stop to admire her he just asked what needs doing most everything she said at once which was probably true but wasnt very helpful then she got more specific you have worked on protecting the ship from rain damage is it not so aye leino answered i wrote that spell as a matter of fact good xavega stayed altogether businesslike for which he was duly grateful she gestured with her free hand come with me she led him back to one of the work rooms a kuusaman mage there used a little of her power and skill to keep another lamp faintly lit two more mages sat with her two lagoan men neither of whom leino knew well one of them had a cut on his cheek but hardly seemed to know it rain repair leino asked everyone nodded xavega left again shouting for more mages the other wizards in the chamber went back to their sorcery leino sat down and began to chant the lamp was so dim he could hardly see his colleagues but his minds eye reached up to the iceandsawdust surface of habakkuk reached up to the little bit of ice every raindrop melted he was glad to the very core of his being that the icebergturnedship remained on the ley line he drew energy from it and used that energy to preserve and restore habakkuks proper structure he could feel the other mages doing the same thing resisting the rain refusing to let it harm the vessel that carried them peripherally he also sensed other mages doing more things to keep habakkuk intact now that the first moments of surprise and dismay had passed they found things werent so very bad after all cheers rang out when the lights went back on all over the ship knocked a goodsized chunk out of the ice on our bottom a sailor reported smashed up some stuff but nothing we cant live with habakkuks not so bad another sailor said any regular ship and wed be sunk but ice floats no matter what unless it melts of course leino thought the sailor hadnt worried about that he took it for granted that such things wouldnt happen leino who knew better didnt but habakkuk did go on and that was all that mattered garivald threw more wood onto the fire in the hearth he and obilot both stood close to the flames enjoying the warmth he said we got lucky here obilot shook her head this isnt our good luck its somebody elses bad luck how many peasant huts are standing empty in grelz these days how many peasant huts are standing empty all over unkerlant powers below eat the stinking algarvians aye garivald would always say aye to that but he went on plenty of wrecked huts plenty of burnt huts but not so many huts just standing empty like this one i dont think nobody even plundered it powers below eat the algarvians obilot repeated but then she added and powers below eat king swemmel s inspectors too if it werent for them you could go on with your life again we could go on with our lives again maybe we can now he answered and set a hand on her shoulder nobody knows were here this place is in the middle of nowhere after the thaw well see what kind of planting we can do maybe well see if we can scare up some better tools some livestock maybe and well get used to wearing new names so nobodyll find out who we used to be who we used to be obilot tasted the words she nodded ive been a couple of people by now im ready to turn into somebody else i never much wanted to be an irregular garivald said i just wanted to go ahead and live my life hed had a family he didnt any more he glanced at obilot maybe shed had one too maybe the two of them would again she snorted what do you think what you want has something to do with what you get if the war hasnt taught you what a cursed stupid idea that is i dont know what would oh hush he said roughlyit wasnt so much that he thought she was wrong as that he just didnt want to hear about it then he kissed her that was one way to keep her from telling him things he didnt want to hear they ended up making love in front of the fire obilot didnt tell him anything he didnt want to hear then either afterwards they fell asleep if anyone told garivald anything he didnt want to hear in his dreams he didnt remember it when he woke up what woke him was rain beating on the roofand rain dripping through the roof and splatting down in little muddy puddles on the rammedearth floor the hut was amazingly sound for one that had stood abandoned for who could say how long before garivald and obilot found it but that also meant nobodyd tended to the thatching for whocouldsayhowlong have to fix it when i get the chance was garivalds first still sleepy thought then he sat up and spoke his second thought aloud rain rain obilot echoed she sounded blurry too but her gaze quickly grew sharp rain not snow thats right garivald said it really is spring before long were going to be kneedeep in mud and then well have to try to get some crops in the ground either that or we starve anyhow wed have starved already if we werent eating the seed grain this fellow brought into his hut before whatever happened to him happened obilot said i know garivald shrugged i thought of that too i didnt know what to do about it though i still dont when youre hungry now you worry about later later obilot nodded you have to once the snow all melts maybe well be able to find more grain buried somewhere not far from here we did that in my village whenever we thought we could get away with it to try to keep the inspectors from stealing quite so much aye we did the same thing in zossen garivald said i bet theres not a single village in unkerlant where they dont of course if the peasant who had this place hid his grain so the inspectors couldnt get their thieving hands on it we wont have an easy time finding it either he walked over to the jug they were using as a chamber pot well have to try though youre right about that if we dont find some more we cant stay here and the way things look the way that cursed tantris came after me im a lot safer in the middle of nowhere than i am in a village or a town i know skirting puddles obilot got breakfast ready she poured crushed barley and water into a pot and hung it over the fire for porridge sometimes she would make unleavened bread instead shed found the jar in which the vanished peasants wife had kept her yeast but the yeast was dead and useless not that barley bread ever rose much anyhow garivald had got sick of tasteless flatbread and equally tasteless porridge but they kept him going maybe i can kill a squirrel or two he said not as good as pork but a lot better than nothing and ill start making rabbit traps too birdlime obilot suggested now that its really spring the birds will be coming back from the north neither of them said anything about finding other people and getting chickens or pigs or other livestock from them maybe one of these days garivald thought once more but no he wasnt ready to try it any time soon as obilot put more wood on the fire to boil up the porridge another thought struck garivald maybe we could use sorcery to help us find the buried grainif theres any buried grain to find he said weve got grain here and like calls to like im no mage but i know that obilot raised a dark and dubious eyebrow all she said was remember sadoc im not likely to forget him garivald said with a shudder a member of the band of irregulars hed led sadoc was a peasant whod fancied himself a wizard and hed succeeded in casting spells too the only thing he hadnt succeeded in doing was getting them to perform the way he intended each one seemed to go wrong more spectacularly than its predecessor well then obilot said as if she needed to say no more and perhaps she didnt but garivald said sadoc liked big spells this would just be a little one and i can make songs after all thats an important part of casting a spell it could work it could obilot still didnt sound convinced it could burst like an egg too and scatter you all over the landscape the way an egg would id be careful listening to himself garivald started to laugh he sounded like a small boy trying to convince his mother he could do something she thought dangerous he sounded a lot like his own son syrivald in fact his laughter broke off as if cut by a knife syrivald was almost surely dead so was his mother by the time the rain stopped it had melted a lot of the snow the sun came out from behind the clouds and went on with the job the ground couldnt possibly hold all the water thus released as it did during every spring thaw it turned to porridge itself that didnt make garivald unhappy he said for the next few weeks nothing is going to happen very fast not till things dry out good obilot answered and he nodded but day by day the barley and rye and the little bit of wheat inside the hut dwindled before long it wasnt a question of having enough left to make a crop it was a question of how much longer they would have enough to eat the next time garivald said maybe i ought to try to make a spell obilot didnt remind him of sadocs disasters what she said instead was well be careful by the powers above i will garivald said though any magecraft at all was for him a long leap into the unknown it will be all right he thought why shouldnt it im not trying to kill anybody or do anything big the way sadoc always did itll work he had trouble making himself believe it but obilot he discovered hadnt quit trying to talk him out of it have you ever in all your born days used magic to try to find things that were hidden under the ground to what was surely her surpriseindeed to his own for hed almost forgotten till she askedhe nodded aye two springs ago it was waddohe was firstman in zossenand i had buried the villages crystal to keep the redheads from getting their hands on it i dug it up because i was afraid he might betray me on account of it i gave it to some irregulars operating in the woods not far from there i hope they got some use out of it did you she nodded too more than half to herself all right then maybe you do have some idea of what youre up to she still didnt sound as if she thought he had much idea of what he was doing he wasnt altogether sure he did either but he knew he had to make the effort he put some wheat some barley and some rye in a little clay pot then tied a length of twine to the handles and swung it pendulumfashion then doing his best not to let obilot fluster him by watching he began to chant like calls to likeso magics found let like show like down under ground show me now the grain thats hidden do it now as you are bidden on he went he knew it wasnt an outrageously good songhe knew it was likely a long way from a good songbut he hoped it would serve and it did serve or he thought it did the direction in which the pot of grain was swinging suddenly changed and hed done nothing to change it obilot let out a small surprised exclamation garivald felt like doing the same thing instead he moved from one side of the hut to the other the arc in which the pot swung changed as he moved so that it kept indicating the same direction garivald went outside into the rain and chanted again the swinging pot led him away from the hut and off beyond a low swell of ground a furlong or so away he nodded to himself the fellow whod lived here thought like a peasant all right he didnt want to make things easy for king swemmel s inspectors as soon as garivald started down the other side of the slope the pot stopped swinging and pointed straight down he hadnt found a spade in the hut he dug in the mucky ground with the edge of an iron pan if it hadnt been soaked and soft he couldnt have made much progress as things were as things were the edge of the pan clanked off fired clay before hed got down much more than a foot he set down the pan and softly and wonderingly clapped his hands together i did it he breathed and breathed in raindrops then he dug as if he were digging himself a hole while the algarvians tossed eggs at him grunting with effort he pulled out the great jar which weighed more nearly as much as he did pitch sealed the lid he had to hope the seal had stayed good he dragged the jar back to the hut inside he scraped away the pitch with a knife and levered up the stopper ahh he and obilot stared down at the golden wheat we wont go hungry she said well have something to plant he added and then this isnt likely to be the only hidden jar either maybe i can find more the same way maybe you can obilot agreed why not you can work magic she sounded awed by the powers above so i can garivald sounded awed too awed or not he hedged that as any canny peasant would a little anyhow but a little had proved enough colonel spinello was not a happy man as he rode east toward division headquarters to confer with his fellow brigade commanders the rain that pelted him and his driver did little to improve his spirits neither did the fact that even the local wagon with its curved boatlike bottom and high wheels had trouble negotiating the bottomless river of mud badly miscalled a road at last just outside the northern unkerlanter town called waldsolms cobblestones reappeared the wagon wasnt really made to cope with them it rattled and jounced abominably spinello didnt mind that so very much civilization he exclaimed and then well of sorts anyhow this is unkerlant his driver seemed less impressed a few miles of this jerking and wed both be pissing blood he said sir like most towns in unkerlant that had gone through the fire of war waldsolms had seen better days brigadier tampaste who commanded the division made his headquarters in what had probably been a merchants house what had been the local governors castle was no longer standing tampaste was young for a brigadier as spinello was young for a colonel no they would have been young for their ranks before the war nowadays a man could rise quickly if he lived like spinellos tampastes wound badge and ribbon showed hed been hit twice youre the first one whos made it here he told spinello ive set out smoked fish and black bread and spirits dont be bashful thats never been one of my vices sir spinello answered and helped himself the smoked fish was tasty but full of tiny bones the spirits packed enough punch to make his hair stand on end good he wheezed through a charred throat good but strong if were truly short on cinnabar we ought to feed the dragons this stuff to make them flame farther by what i hear people are talking about doing something along those lines tampaste said which took spinello by surprise the drawback of course is that drunken dragons are even wilder and stupider than they would be otherwise if such a thing is possible he sipped his own spirits without flinching spinello wondered if hed copperplated his gullet how do you view the situation in front of us colonel sir i dont like it spinello said at once swemmels men are up to something but i dont know what i dont like it whenever they try to get cute with us it means theyve got something up their sleeves do you think we can throw in another spoiling attack and disrupt them tampaste asked spinello shook his head not my brigade anyway were in no shape for it not after the attack on pewsum failed you handled your men well there colonel tampaste said no blame to you that the try didnt succeed just too many unkerlanters in the neighborhood weve sung that song before if we sing it again too often well have too bloody many unkerlanters in algarve sir spinello said tampaste grimaced you shouldnt say such things why spinello asked because theyre not true or because nobody wants to think about them even if they are true the division commander plainly didnt want to answer that at last he said because saying them makes them more likely to come true a mage would tell you the same thing spinello thought that held an element of truth but only an element too many things got said all over the world for any one of them to have much chance of swinging things one way or another before he could say as much tampaste changed the subject asking where in blazes are the rest of my brigade commanders stuck in the mud unless i miss my guess spinello replied whatever the unkerlanters are doing they wont do it right away he took another pull at his spirits which made it easier for him to sneer at anything and everything unkerlanter its not as if they bothered paving their roads so they could move on them all year long tampaste said captives claim one of the reasons swemmel didnt pave more of the roads was for fear we could move on them i hadnt heard that spinello admitted if its true we must have taught them quite a lesson during the six years war maybe now theyre teaching us some things wed rather not learn the brigadier said and then before spinello could call him on it and now whos speaking words of ill omen the gesture tampaste used to turn aside the omen dated back to the days when the algarvians skulked through the woods in the far south and the kaunian empire bestrode most of eastern derlavai spinello had seen it reproduced on classical kaunian monuments and on pottery in the museum at trapani two of his fellow brigade leaders did eventually show up the meeting that followed wasnt worth having not as far as spinello was concerned both other colonels like him had seen more going on among the unkerlanters opposite them than they would have liked but both of them also like him claimed to lack the force to do anything about it can you get us more men sir one of them asked tampaste the division commander unhappily shook his head ive got everything i can do to hold what strength i have he answered the bigwigs keep trying to rob me and send men south thats all they can think of thats where the worst of the fighting has been so they think it always will be theyre a pack of fools in that case spinello burst out as may be tampaste said dryly but theyre a pack of fools with fancier rank badges than yours colonel and fancier badges than mine too any other comments after his depressing remarks nobody said a thing he nodded as if he didnt seem surprised very well gentlemen dismissed spinello headed back toward his brigade east of pewsum thinking dark thoughts his mood did not improve when an unkerlanter dragon dove at his wagon he and the driver both leaped off into the mud had the enemy dragonflier timed his beasts burst of flame as well as he might have that would have done them no good as things were the unkerlanter waited too long and the flame kicked up steam east of the wagon he didnt come back for a second attack but flew on looking for another target dripping and cold and filthy spinello scrambled back up into the wagon he didnt think we were important enough to bother finishing off he said he went off to find something bigger and juicier his driver was every bit as wet and cold and dirty as he was are you complaining sir the fellow asked not complaining exactly spinello admitted but my selfimportance is tweaked i want the unkerlanters to think im worth killing if you know what i mean aye sir the driver nodded an algarvian who didnt think himself the center of the world was hardly an algarvian at all by the time spinello got back to the tumbledown hut in the village of gleina that he was using for his own headquarters he was shivering and his teeth were chattering the soldiers in the village made sympathetic noises so did jadwigai the brigades pretty little kaunian mascot what can we do to make you feel better colonel she asked come to bed with me thatd do a proper job of warming me up he thought ithe thought it very loudlybut he didnt say it what i door dont dofor my men the really annoying thing was he didnt think he would have to force her to slip between the sheets with him if he broached the idea he thought shed lie down beside him gladly enough vanai would never have opened her legs for him if he hadnt set her grandfather to building roads but jadwigai genuinely seemed to like him but the brigade came first if finding out hed bedded their pet would upset the men he couldnt do it powers below eat the brigade he thought not for the first time what came out through his clicking teeth though was tell them to heat up the steam room for me would you sweetheart of course jadwigai hurried away she came back in a few minutes and took spinello by the arm you get a fresh uniform and come along with me colonel youll be better for it id follow you anywhere darling he said but he made sure he kept his tone light jadwigai laughed so did spinello though it wasnt easy just as well for him that he did his driver waited outside the steam room too they scurried in together and shut the door behind them ahh spinello said stripping off sodden tunic and kilt the driver did the same few unkerlanters had their own bathing tubs they didnt go in for public bathhouses either the way their forthwegian cousins did instead they sat around roaring fires and sweated themselves clean a circle of benches surrounded the central fire in the hut that did duty for a steam room in gleina spinello and his driver sat down side by side and baked ahh this time the driver said it though spinello would have warmth flowed into him banishing the chilly damp then he began dripping again this time with sweat that felt better still he picked up a bucket and poured water onto the hot stones around the fire a great cloud of steam rose he sweated more than ever during the wintertime the unkerlanters would go out and roll in the snow after baking long enough in warmer weather they made do with a bucket of cold water spinello had always considered either of those more nearly deathdefying than anything else when he got warm he wanted to stay warm here though he couldnt or at least not indefinitely he had to put on his uniform and hurry back to his own hut once he couldnt bear the steam heat any more running through the rain wasnt all that much different from getting splashed with a bucket of water spinello failed to see how it improved things but when jadwigai asked him isnt that better colonel he found himself nodding so it is my dear he replied of course anything would be an improvement on the drowned puppy i was when i got back here she nodded she herself was a puppy saved from drowning unlike a puppy she had to know it she gave no sign though maybe she didnt want to think about it for which spinello could hardly blame her or maybe she never mentioned it for fear of giving ideas to the algarvians whod made a pet of her instead of flinging her into the river spinello could hardly blame her for that either what did brigadier tampaste say she asked as if she were one of spinellos regimental commanders he answered her as if she were one of his regimental commanders too he said that whatever the bloody unkerlanters are up to weve got to stop them with what weve gotno hope for reinforcements oh jadwigai considered that very much as an officer would have can we no spinello didnt care to admit that to her or even to himself so he leered and struck a pose my sweet when an algarvian sets himself between a beautiful girl and wars desolation he can do anything he said grandly jadwigai blushed bright pink well well spinello thought isnt that interesting when talsus mother came downstairs into the tailors shop where he worked with his father she caught him not working he was eating almonds dusted with sugar crystals and washing them down with citrusflavored wine since traku was doing the same thing talsu hardly felt guilty laitsina wagged her forefinger at both of them sadly she said my husband and my sonjust a couple of lazy bums i am not talsu would have sounded more indignant if he hadnt tried talking with his mouth full no his mother said well ill give you the chance to prove it i was going to walk over to the grocers shop for some olive oil and some capers but you can go if youre not too lazy to get there talsu hopped down off his stool sure he said and started for the door at something close to a run traku chuckled i just know his hearts breaking when you gave him an excuse to go see his wife before she gets back from work he looks heartbroken doesnt he like in a stage melodrama laitsina answered talsu was already out on the street when she called after him have you got any money oh he stopped feeling foolish and went through his pockets then feeling more foolish still he went back inside and took some silver from the cash box he went on his way again jingling the coins to prove he had them spring was in the air in skrunda jelgava was a northerly kingdom and not cursed with harsh winters but the bright sun the brilliant blue sky and the dry heat all looked ahead toward summer not back at the rain and clouds that did duty hereabouts for blizzards birds trilled in the bushes and from rooftops new leaves were on the trees and new graffiti were on the walls donalitu lives cried the hastily painted scrawls the true king will return king donalitu had lived in lagoan exile the past three and a half years back in the days when hed ruled jelgava talsu had taken him as much for granted as the weather and feared his storms a good deal more the algarvians hadnt needed to introduce dungeons to jelgava after he fled theyd just taken over the very respectable ones he already had running no talsu hadnt thought that much of donalitu while he reigned but when the choice was between oppression from ones own countryman or from foreign occupiers the exiled king didnt look so bad a choice without oppression in it somewhere hardly seemed real to talsu the grocers shop was only a couple of blocks away he must have seen six or eight scrawls in the little stretch whoeverd been putting up donalitus name had been diligent about it good he thought he was grinning when he opened the door to the shop gailisas father owned it as his family had for three or four generations predictably he was nowhere in sight leaving her to do the work she was putting jars on a shelf behind the counter when the bell over the door chimed to announced a customer hello she said without turning around what can i do for you today well you could give me a kiss talsu answered that made his wife whirl indignation vanished when she saw him she hurried out from in back of the counter and gave him what hed asked for there you are siryour order personally delivered she said mischief in her grayblue eyes can i give you anything else sure talsu squeezed her and let his hands wander a little but people would talk if they came in while you were doing that i suppose so gailisa sounded disappointed which in turn disappointed talsu now hed be counting the minutes till she got home till they could go back into the bedchamber that had once been his alone that was so much more cramped these days but so much happier too gailisa went on did you come in here with anything else on your mind aye he said virtuously olive oil and capers i can do that she said while she was doing it he asked did you see the new scribbles on the walls when you were coming over here when she nodded he went on for some reason people dont much like the redheads i wonder why he looked down to the floor planks the stain of his own blood there had been scrubbed at and had faded but he could still make it out an algarvian soldier had stabbed him after he objected to the fellows remarks to gailisa nothing had happened to the redhead of course in jelgava the occupiers could do no wrong here you are gailisa said brightly as if he were just another customer he made a face at her they both laughed he set silver on the counter she shoved the coins back at him whispering what my father doesnt know wont hurt him sometimes she would do that sometimes she wouldnt talsu had never figured out how she made up her mind he kissed her again then spoke regretfully id better get back to work after one more kiss out he went large jar of olive oil in one hand small jar of capers in the other he nodded every time he passed one of the graffiti proclaiming king donalitu s return after algarvian rule he would indeed welcome the rightful king with open arms hed just delivered the groceries to his mother and gone back downstairs to return to work when two algarvians came into the shop one of them pointed to him and asked you being talsu son of traku aye thats who i am talsu fought the impulse to mimic the way the redhead spoke jelgavan keeping a civil tongue in his head probably proved a good idea he didnt think so at the time for both algarvians whipped short sticks from their belts and pointed them at him you coming with us said the one whod spoken before what in blazes is this here all about traku demanded the other algarvian swung his stick toward talsus father who had something of the look of a bruiser to him we are investigating treason against king mainardo he spoke jelgavan almost perfectly if your son is innocent he will be released talsu had arranged the untimely demise of kugu the silversmith the man whod betrayed him to king mezentio s men if the algarvians knew about that he was in a lot of trouble if they didntand theyd never shown any sign of ithe thought he could hope to come home again in any case a needle was no argument against a stick he set it down and slid off the stool ill go with you he said of course you coming with we the first algarvian said all the redheads talsu had ever met were arrogant whoresons but then hed met only occupiers a role bound to breed arrogance as hed expected mezentios men took him to skrundas constabulary station most of the people working there were the jelgavans whod patrolled the town before algarve overran their kingdom they kept doing the same job but for new masters and with new purposes talsu wondered how they slept at night by the look of them they had no trouble one in fact was all but dozing at his desk now but the redheads didnt turn talsu over to his own countrymen as they had the last time they captured him instead they took him into a small windowless chamber and closed the door behind them he braced himself for a beating hed had several in the dungeon all from fellow jelgavans what do you know about these new foul scrawls on the streets of skrunda asked the algarvian who spoke jelgavan well nothing talsu answered ive seen themhe couldnt very well deny thatbut thats all liar shouted the algarvian who wasnt so fluent he brought out that word with ease hed doubtless had practice talsu shook his head no sir thats the truth and so it was he hoped its being the truth would do him some good you were released from imprisonment on condition that you cooperate with us the fluent algarvian said but we have not seen much cooperation from you do you wonder that we do not trust you i cant tell you what i dont know talsu said all i do is mind my own business by the powers above i wish youd do the same he thought liar the other algarvian shouted again we fixing you you and your lyings the door to the chamber opened another algarvian came in not a torturer as talsu first feared but a mage that might be even worse the redhead who spoke good jelgavan said because we do not trust you we shall have to interrogate you with a sorcerer present you lying you paying the second algarvian added slashing his thumb across his throat im not lying talsu said and then to the first redhead go on and ask your questions i cant very well stop you no matter how much i wish i could what do you know of the new graffiti that falsely claim the fled king donalitu will come back to jelgava the algarvian asked nothing except that ive seen them talsu repeated do you know who painted them no sir talsu said can you guess who might have painted them no sir i have no idea his interrogator glanced over at the mage whod been muttering to himself during the questions and answers the wizard spoke in algarvian punctuating his words with a fanciful shrug the other redhead the one who spoke jelgavan badly cried out in obvious disbelief the mage shrugged again talsus interrogator tried a different tack are you shielded against magecraft no sir talsu said have you ever had a shielding spell laid on you not since i went into the army talsu answered i know they tried to protect soldiers as best they could the algarvian waved that aside with an impatient gesture do you know of anyone in skrunda with reason to dislike algarve of course i do talsu exclaimed i dont much like your kingdom myself why should i after your soldier stuck a knife in me and then walked free more backandforth between the interrogator and the mage talsu knew hed told nothing but the truth of course the algarvian hadnt asked the right questions the interrogator said think what you will but we are not unjust you may go your answers set you free thanks talsu said and found himself meaning it this had indeed been easier than hed expected as he left the constabulary station he couldnt help wondering how the mages truth spell would have judged the algarvians claim of justice he didnt know but he had his own opinion back in the days when leudast was a common soldier or a sergeant nobody in the villages the unkerlanter army recaptured from the algarvians ever paid any particular attention to him now that he was a lieutenant he was discovering things were rather different when the spring thaw started his company was billeted in and around a village east of herborn called leiferde he knew they would be billeted there for a while too hipdeep mud glued unkerlanters and algarvians alike in place for weeks each spring as company commander hed chosen a house in the village as his own temporary home he would have donehe had doneexactly the same thing when commanding the company while still a sergeant but when hed done so while still a sergeant the peasants on whom hed been billeted had treated him like one of themselves that hadnt bothered him he was a peasant from a long line of peasants the only difference between him and these grelzer farmers was his accent which announced he came from the northeast of unkerlant up near the border with forthweg having those little brass stars on his collar tabs though put things in a new light the peasants in leiferde bowed and scraped before him as often as not they called him your excellency his own men figured out what was going on before he did with a grin sergeant kiun said do you know what it is sir when leudast shook his head kiuns grin got wider than ever ill tell you what it is what it is is they think youre a nobleman a nobleman leudast stared at his comrade that idea had never entered his mind not even for a moment youre bloody daft is what you are by the powers above im not kiun retorted look at me leudast said do i look like a nobleman to you i need a shave my tunics filthy theres dirt under my fingernails theres dirt ground into my knuckles too so deep no steambathll ever sweat it out you think nobles have dirty hands there is a war on in case you havent noticed kiun shrugged you can let em know youre just a nobody if thats what you want to do ill tell you something though youve got a lot better chance of getting the girl in that hut where youre staying to put out for you if she thinks she might have a barons bastard than if youre just hoping she decides youre a handsome whoreson sir leudast raised an eyebrow now kiun had his attention you think so he said alize isnt bad is she well i wouldnt throw her out of bed kiun said not that shes likely to end up in mine but i havent done too bad for myself i may not be an officer but i know what i want and i know how to get it if you want sir everybody in the companyll talk you up for a blueblood youve taken care of us we can take care of you you dont need to go that far leudast paused and scratched the side of his jaw but i dont suppose you have to go out of your way to tell people i know how to muck out a barn at least as well as they do either kiun laughed nodded winked and went on his way a nobleman me leudast still found the idea absurd it was in fact absurd for several reasons not least that unkerlanter nobility wasnt what it had been back in the days before the six years war a lot of nobles had fallen fighting algarve then a lot more had sided with kyot swemmels brother in the madness of the twinkings war afterwards few whod made that mistake remained among the living and king swemmel had gone right on getting rid of noblemen who met his displeasure all through his reign the algarvians had killed many more in this war one reason the unkerlanter army had so many officers without breeding was that there werent nearly enough nobles to fill the required slots then leudast stopped thinking of absurdities and started thinking of alize she was a few years younger than he which put her somewhere around twenty she had bright eyes and very white teeth and a shape even the long baggy tunics unkerlanter women wore couldnt disguise shed given him plenty of pleasant smiles if she wanted to give him more than smiles he wouldnt mind at all for the time being all he could do was think about it he squelched through leiferde and the surrounding fields making sure his men were ready to fight in case the algarvians attacked in spite of the mudand making sure they were ready to go forward in case his own superiors gave the word he hoped his own superiors would have the good sense to do no such thing but years as a common soldier and a sergeant had taught him not to rely on his superiors good sense when he got back to the house where he was billeted he was all over mud alizes mother a brisk handsome woman called bertrude gave him a bucket of hot water from the kettle over the stove and a rag here you are your excellency she said this may not be so fine as youre used to sir but it should do the job she sounded more deferential than she had before had kiun been telling tales leudast could hardly ask her all he said was it will do fine and cleaned himself off as best he could bertudes husband whose name was akerin rarely stirred from the bench where he was sitting he had a jar of spirits beside him leudast had never seen him without a jar of spirits beside him a lot of unkerlanter peasants passed their winters that way hed done it himself bertrude bustled over and poured leudast a mug of spirits this will help warm you up too sir she said well so it will leudast drank the spirits were potent but no more so than hed had back home he pointed to a pot bubbling beside the hotwater kettle the stew smells good im glad it suits you your excellency bertrude said and dropped him a curtsy as if she were a duchess herself aye kiun s been running off at the mouth leudast thought the peasant woman went on alize there put it together shes a fine cook alize is a fine cookbetter than i was at the same age im sure alize was mending a tunic hearing her name she looked up and smiled at leudast as an experiment he bowed to her though her skin was as swarthy as his own he saw her blush why dont you let me have some he said blushing still she hurried to get a bowl and serve him i hope you like it your excellency she said her voice so soft leudast had to bend toward her to hear she stood waiting nervously while he began to eat he wondered what an algarvian officer who didnt care for the stew might have done nothing goodhe was sure of that she had to fear his doing something just as dreadful he smiled at her and said very tasty her own smile was the sun coming out from behind thick clouds her lips shaped silent words powers above be praised she probably would have said the same thing after an algarvian officer approvedor after one of king swemmel s inspectors did that thought shamed leudast bedding alize when she hardly dared say no struck him as unsporting bertrude made a clucking noise and beckoned imperiously her husband came over to her she spoke too quietly for leudast to make out what she was saying whatever it was though she plainly intended to brook no disagreement when akerin started to say something she poked him in the chest with her forefinger and talked through him only when he started nodding did she look satisfied a lot of the time unkerlanter men slapped their women around not in this hut though after a little while bertrude fell silent her husband cleared his throat a couple of times and then spoke to alize your mother and i were going to go next door for a bit see if we can get back that pot the neighbors borrowed from us likely well chat some too all right father alize said youll be all right by yourself with the lieutenant here bertrude added he can protect you better than we could if you get right down to it come along akerin she all but dragged her husband out of the hut alize blushed again up till now her mother and father had made a point of not leaving her alone with leudast now they were making a point of going off leudast doubted alize needed protecting he thought bertrude and akerin were angling for a husband for her of course being an officer and being liable to get called away to fight as soon as the spring thaw ended he could enjoy himself with her without worrying about details like weddings she had to know the game her parents were playing she probably knew he could do what he wanted without concern for consequences too more roughly than hed intended he said you dont have to do anything you dont want to do alize sure enough his sense of shame was still working oh that she said i dont mind i dont mind at all if you want to know the truth youre the first one who ever bothered saying anything like that she made a wry face mother would slap me silly if she heard me telling you such things shed want me to make you think i was still a maidenand how likely is that after everything thats happened the past few years i dont know leudast answered though he had a pretty good idea well then alize said and pulled the tunic off over her head when leudast saw her deepbreasted sweetly curved form his shame melted like the snow outside only far faster and far more thoroughly he reached for her her flesh was soft and warm under his hands her breath sighed out when he tilted her face up for a kiss he soon shed his own uniform tunic clinging to each other he and alize went over to the padded benches along the wall that made up most of the furniture of an unkerlanter peasant house when they lay down together leudast discovered that alize would have had a hard time convincing him she was a maiden she knew too much of men and what pleased them because she did he enjoyed himself more than he might have otherwise he thought she did too if she didnt she was artful about hiding it after they finished he took his weight on his elbows and knees which made her nod in measured approval looking up at him she said youll be going away before long wont you probably he answered i didnt come to leiferde for this its more fun than fighting algarvians but its not why the king gives me silverwhen he bothers to give me silver i mean that made alize laugh she nodded again and then flipped back a lock of dark hair that had fallen in front of her face she said powers above keep you safe afterwardsif there is an afterwardsif you want to come back here and talk about things thats all right and if you dont her shrug was delightful to behold leudast caught her to him they began again he had no idea whether hed want to come back to leiferde if the war ever ended he had no idea if it would ever end powers above he thought i have no idea if her mother and father are going to walk in on us she wrapped her legs around him for the moment he didnt care about any of that either prince juhainen steepled his fingers as he studied pekka how soon will this sorcery be ready to use against the algarvians he asked his eyes flicked around her room in the hostel he didnt seem much impressed the seven princes of kuusamo were neither so rich nor so ostentatious as the kings on the mainland of derlavai but such bare little chambers had to be alien to them she answered your highness weve already used this sorcery against the algarvians when they tried to use their murderous magic against us that isnt what i meant juhainen said he was younger than pekka maybe that was why she had trouble taking him seriously or maybe it was just that she didnt reckon him a man to match his uncle prince joroinen whom hed succeeded when the algarvians sorcerous attack on yliharma slew joroinen with some effort pekka kept her temper what did you mean then your highness she asked how soon will ordinary mages be able to use the spells your group of sorcerers has developed juhainen did his best to make himself clear and that was a good question a question worth asking as soon as we make the spells as strong and as safe as we can well turn them over to the practical mages pekka promised but when will that be juhainen persisted how long will it take will it happen by the summertime will it be a year from now will it be five years from now you will understand i have an interest in knowing of course your highness pekka said but you will understandor i hope you will understandthe question isnt easy to answer the more we learn the more we find we can learn the more we do the more we find we can do i cant guess when that will stop or if it ever will whether it does or not you will understand that out beyond the naantali district we are fighting a war prince juhainen said we need the weapons you are readying here if they arent quite perfect we need them anyhow the sooner the better well do what we can your highness pekka said please do time is shorter than you might think without waiting for an answer the prince rose and strode out of pekkas chamber the door clicked shut behind him well well how intriguing she thought up till now the seven princes had paid little direct attention to her project every now and then they would ask questions every now and then too they would grumble about how much things cost other than that theyd left her alone not anymore and what did that mean only one answer occurred to her before very long were going to need that sorcery and need it badly as far as she could see that could mean only one thing too before long kuusaman and lagoan soldiers would be fighting on the derlavaian mainland it wasnt anything that came as any great shock ships and leviathans and dragons werent going to be enough to drive the algarvians out of valmiera and jelgava not without soldiers on the ground to go in and take those lands away from them she sighed there was so much left to learn about the relationship between the laws of similarity and contagion and about the inverted unity lying at their heart after that sigh though came a smile ilmarinen was ready to experiment endlessly to pursue his own theories about twisted time nothing likely to annoy him struck pekka as altogether distressing by the time she got down to the refectory prince juhainen had already left the hostel he could escape whenever he chose he didnt have to come here unless he wanted to pekka envied him oh how she envied him as things were she had to go on herding catsat least that was what dealing with her fellow theoretical sorcerers often felt like raahe and alkio sat in the refectory drinking tea they werent so bad pekka waved to a serving girl and asked for some tea herself then she went over and sat down beside the married couple as theorectical sorcerers went they were pretty well civilized their being husband and wife probably had a good deal to do with that what did his highness want raahe asked setting down her cup juhainen had told pekka nobody in the outside world knew where he was but keeping secrets inside the hostel was impossible pekka didnt try he wanted us to hurry toward turning our spells into something final ah that was alkio more often than not he let his wife do the talking now though he said theyre wondering how soon they can put men on the mainland unless i miss my guess i thought the same thing pekka answered what did you tell him raahe asked that we werent quite ready yet that we were still finding ways to make the spells stronger and safer pekka said i dont know if practical mages who used them could stand against the murderous magic the algarvians hurl around we did raahe said we didnt just stand against mezentios magic either we beat the algarvians back by the powers above aye we did every word of that was true but could practical mages match it if menaced by mezentios magecraft could my husband defeat algarvian wizards who were killing kaunians to try to kill him pekka didnt want to put it that way even if that thought was uppermost in her mind what she did say was were not ordinary mages i should hope not raahe glanced around to make sure nobody at the other tables was listening she lowered her voice to a whisper if ilmarinen were ordinary she rolled her eyes before pekka could get out more than the beginnings of a giggle alkio said the mages who attacked us probably werent ordinary either the algarvians knew we were doing something important theyd have thrown their best at us and we beat them raahe repeated that was also true i hadnt thought of it in those terms pekka admitted but alkio was likely to be right kuusaman and lagoan mages fighting on the mainland might well not face magecraft of the same vicious intensity as that which had surmounted the strait of valmiera and struck at the naantali district hadnt thought of what in which terms ilmarinen demanded hurrying toward the table where pekka sat youve got to think of everything either that or youve got to have someone who will do it for you by the way he preened as he sat down he had someone in mind raahe rolled her eyes again since ilmarinen did commonly think in terms that occurred to no one else under the sun pekka couldnt even get annoyed at himnot for that anyhow though she knew he was bound to give her some other reason before long she explained what the conversation had been about ah ilmarinen said when she was through he nodded to alkio aye that makes sensewhich doesnt necessarily mean its true their magic gets a large energy release any which way killing is good for that if youve got the stomach for it ours is different ours has to be done just right if it isnt you might as well not bother his gaze swung toward pekka and i hope you told prince juhainen as much not in those words no but i did say we werent ready pekka replied good ilmarinen said practical mages are a pack of thumbfingered fools they say the same thing about us pekka observed of course they do so what ilmarinen let out a wheezy chuckle everything they say about us is a filthy lie while everything we say about them is true raahe nodded ilmarinen chuckled again pekka felt sorry for raahe whod just proved she couldnt recognize irony if it walked up and bit her in the backside pekka said we do have to get ready pretty soon to turn out magic even those thumbfingered fools can use she waited would ilmarinen understand shed noticed his irony and respond in kind or would he singe her as hed just singed raahe or perhaps roast her as hed roasted so many others over the years he dipped his head and answered youre right the algarvians have already arranged things so that their thumbfingered fools can make the most of their magic powers below eat the algarvians alkio said do we want to imitate everything they do do we want to imitate anything they do we want to imitate everything they do that makes them likelier to win the war pekka said and then before the other mages could tear her limb from rhetorical limb everything we can imitate with a clean conscience the kind of magecraft they use is one thing the way they organize their mages is something else again its morally neutral not wicked the way the wizardry is alkio pondered that and nodded even the quarrelsome ilmarinen failed to find fault with it fernao came into the refectory just then he carried his stickhe would always carry itbut he didnt put much weight on it hed made a lot of progress getting around since first arriving in kuusamo whats wrong here he said in pretty good kuusamanhed made a lot of progress with the language too i see everybody nodding together so something must be no one seemed quite sure how to take that either pekka said nothing too serious only a visit from prince juhainen ah fernao nodded let me guess is he trying to make us hurry ilmarinen gave him a suspicious look how do you know that its what princes do fernao answered he frowned in thought but evidently couldnt come up with the words he needed in kuusaman for he switched to classical kaunian to continue princes do not bother to come when everything is fine they come only to try to make changes that is what they are for that is what juhainen did sure enough pekka kept on speaking her own language i think it means we will invade the mainland soon ilmarinen raised an eyebrow invade the mainland eh he glanced over at fernao is that what theyre calling it these days for a moment pekka had no idea what he was talking about even though hed spoken kuusaman too then she also turned toward fernao and watched him turn redwith his fair lagoan skin the flush was easy to trace raahe and alkio must also have figured out what ilmarinen meant for they were busy looking at the ceiling or out the window or anywhere but at her and fernao her own ears felt hot that will be quite enough of that she told ilmarinen in her frostiest tones he laughed at her she glared at him which only made him laugh harder then she looked at fernao again and caught him looking at her their eyes jerked away at the contact as if theyd been caught at something we havent pekka insisted to herself we really havent six spring came early to bishah and the surrounding hills hajjaj cherished it while it lasted not least because it wouldnt last long zuwayza was the kingdom of summer soon all too soon the sun would bake everything yellow and brown the foreign minister savored the brief brave show of greenery and bright flowers as much for its impermanence as for its beauty you algarvians are spoiled he remarked to marquis balastro at a gathering at the algarvian ministry one evening you get to enjoy your gardens and woods through most of the year well so we do your excellency balastro agreed tell me did you think we were spoiled when you went through your first winter at the university of trapani his smile showed sharp teeth spoiled no your excellency hajjaj shook his head how could you possibly spoil when you froze solid for a couple of months every year balastro threw back his head and laughed uproariously oh you are a funny fellow when you choose i could wish you chose to be more often i could wish i had more things to laugh about hajjaj replied and balastros own mirth cut off as abruptly as if sliced by a knife the war news from unkerlant wasnt good and not all of the algarvian ministers verbal gymnastics could make it good it wasnt dreadfully bad not lately not with the spring thaw miring mezentios men and swemmels alike but it wasnt good what little movement there was had the unkerlanters pushing forward and the algarvians falling back over in one corner of the reception hall a couple of stocky swarthy men in unkerlanter tunics were busily drinking themselves blind if you asked them they would insist they werent unkerlanters they were grelzers from the free and independent and algarvianbacked kingdom of grelz of course with king raniero horribly dead their insistence mattered very little the quondam kingdom of grelz mattered very little too hajjaj sighed typical of the algarvians to bring them up to zuwayza and try to make something of them after the collapse and not before doing his best to recover from the awkward moment marquis balastro said i am glad our dragons have helped keep the unkerlanter air pirates from troubling bishah they have done that and i do thank you for it hajjaj bowed the waistband of his kilt dug into his flesh as he moved nudity was far more comfortable he went on our own dragons flying south into unkerlant have noted what looks to be something of a buildup of unkerlanter soldiers in the northern regions of king swemmel s realm we have noted the same thing balastro didnt sound very concerned i assure you it is nothing we cant handle i am glad to hear that hajjaj said and hoped the algarvian minister was right we do keep an eye on things marquis balastro said as if hajjaj had denied it we also do our best to keep enemy air pirates from ravaging algarve itself aye of course hajjaj said if you hadnt lost sibiu youd have an easier time of it too he didnt say that it would have been most undiplomatic but that didnt make it untrue balastro bowed again algarvians were a punctiliously polite folk even if they didnt spend so much time on it as zuwayzin did king mezentio has ordered me to express his thanks to king shazli through you he said i shall be happy to do so hajjaj bowed in return ahh his thanks for what why for his help in keeping kaunian bandits here and more to the point keeping them out of forthweg of course balastro answered oh after a moment hajjaj nodded he is very welcome i speak for myself at the moment you understand but i shall convey your sovereigns words to mine and i am certain i speak in king shazli s name here he also wished he werent saying king mezentio was welcome as far as he was concerned the kaunians whod managed to flee from forthweg had every right in the world to try to hit back at the algarvians but when they hit back they unquestionably hurt the algarvians war against unkerlant that in turn hurt zuwayza as foreign minister hajjaj found himself forced to condemn what he personally condoned marquis balastro smiled believe me your excellency i do understand your difficulty and he probably did he was a civilized man in the best traditions of civilization in eastern derlavai had hajjaj not admired those traditions he never would have chosen to finish his education at the university of trapani that didnt keep him from wondering how such an eminently civilized man as balastro could approve of the way his kingdom slaughtered kaunians he did thoughhajjaj had no doubt of it his certainty oppressed him he bowed his way away from balastro and went over to the bar where an algarvian servitor who was almost surely also an algarvian spy gave him a goblet of date wine he was almost the only one in the room drinking the sweet thick stuff even the zuwayzi officers the algarvian military attache had invited to the reception preferred vintages pressed from grapes hajjaj enjoyed those too but the taste of date wine took him back to his youth for a man with white hair few things could work such magic sipping the date wine the zuwayzi foreign minister looked around the hall there stood horthy the gyongyosian minister to zuwayza in earnest conversation with iskakis his yaninan counterpart they were both speaking classical kaunian a language that had never been used in either of their kingdoms but the only one they had in common hajjaj took another pull at his goblet savoring the irony of that after a moment iskakis a short bald man with a mustache that looked like a blackwinged moth perched between his nose and upper lip sidled away from the large leonine horthy and started chatting up an algarvian captain one of the men on the military attaches staff the captain a stalwart handsome young man beamed at the yaninan iskakis was partial to stalwart handsome young men he was even more partial to boys his wife meanwhile was talking to marquis balastro she was about half iskakis age and extraordinarily beautiful such a waste that marriage hajjaj thought not for the first time balastro now balastro had the sleek look of a cat whod fallen into a pitcher of cream what hajjaj saw as a waste he saw as an opportunity however civilized balastro was no algarvian born had ever reckoned philandering anything but a pleasant diversionunless of course he found himself wearing horns rather than giving them balastro wouldnt have to worry about that here he stroked iskakis wifes cheek an affectionate gesture that said hed likely done other more intimate stroking in private hajjaj wouldnt have been surprised hed watched the two of them at a reception at the gyongyosian ministry the autumn before here though iskakis wife twisted away at first hajjaj thought that was playacting and clever playacting to boot iskakis might prefer boys but yaninans had a prickly sense of honor if iskakis saw balastro making free with the woman he thought of as his own he would certainly call out the algarvian minister that their kingdoms were allies wouldnt matter a bit either then hajjaj saw the fury distorting the yaninan womans delicately sculpted features that wasnt playacting not unless she belonged on the stage he hurried over toward her and balastro yanina and algarve were both allied to zuwayza too the things i do for my kingdom he thought everythings fine your excellency balastro said with an easy smile this man is a beast your excellency iskakis wife spoke fair algarvian with a gurgling yaninan accent that made hajjaj pause to make sure hed understood her correctly but he had her glare left no room for doubt shes just a trifle overwrought balastro said he is a swine a pig a pork a stinking rutting boar iskakis wife said without great precision but with great passion then she said a couple of things in yaninan that hajjaj didnt understand but that sounded both heartfelt and uncomplimentary hajjaj said i gather the two of you have quarreled balastro nodded iskakis wife dipped her head which meant the same thing among yaninans hajjaj went on you would be wiser not to show it you would be wiser still not to show each other any kind of affection in public balastro bowed as always your excellency you are a font of wisdom iskakis wife snarled you do not need to worry about that could looks have killed the algarvian minister would have died iskakis wife stalked away arched nostrils flared back ever so straight hips working with fury with a sigh balastro said well it was fun while it lasted never a dull moment in bed ill tell you that i believe you hajjaj said half the men in the room were eyeing that swiveling backside with one degree of longing or another iskakis otherwise preoccupied was not among them a good thing too hajjaj thought aye in bed tassis splendid out of bed balastro rolled his eyes a bursting egg for a temper and a razor for a tongue im not all that surprised iskakis would sooner stick it somewhere else he glanced over toward the yaninan minister and the officer with whom he was talking he made a face though not there by the powers above no accounting for taste hajjaj said a profoundly unoriginal truth before too long he took the opportunity to make his excuses and go back to his home in the hills above bishah getting out of the clothes hed worn and into the usual zuwayzi outfitsandals and for outdoors a hatwas as usual a great relief he was about to go down into the capital the next morning when someone knocked on the one door in the fortresslike outer wall to the sprawling compound that was as much clan center as dwellingplace tewfik the ancient majordomo who presided over the residence made his slow way out to see who was disturbing his master he sent a younger sprier servant hotfooting it back to hajjaj your excellency youve got to come see this for yourself the servant said and would say no more even when hajjaj barked at him and so grumbling under his breath hajjaj went out to the gateway there he found tewfik looking for once quite humanly astonished and there he also found tassi the wife of iskakis the yaninan minister polite as a cat she bowed to him good day your excellency she said i come to you sir seeking asylum from my husband and from marquis balastro and from everything and everyone outside zuwayza dododo you hajjaj knew he was stammering but couldnt help it he felt at least as astonished as tewfik looked tassi dipped her head as she had at the reception sure enough a yaninan nod i do you see i already begin to follow your customs by that she meant she stood before him wearing only sandals and a straw hat marquis balastro occasionally aped zuwayzi nudity with balastro the effect was more ludicrous than anything else with tassi all at once hajjaj understood that the algarvian words nude and naked were not perfect synonyms his own people who took their bare skin for granted were nude tassi was naked using her skin for her own purposes sensuality came off her in waves and she knew as much too and relished the confusionamong other thingsshe paused take me in your excellency protect me she purred and i will do anything you like anything at all take me in i beg you gracefully she dropped to both knees it wasnt exactly or solely a begging gesture it also promised something else she bowed her head and waited what will you do tewfik hissed in zuwayzi powers below eat me if i know hajjaj replied in the same tongue he switched back to algarvian get up milady the least you can do is have breakfast here afterwards afterwards we shall see he was an old man aye was he too old for such amusements and if he wasnt how much would domestic relations with tassi hurt foreign relations with yanina fernao woke to the sound of dripping hed fallen asleep to the sound of dripping too hed lived with it for the past several days he would have to go right on living with it for a good many more days to come no matter how much it made him want to go running to the jakes all around the hostel in the naantali district the ice and snow were melting they would take a while to finish the job and the ground would stay soupy for a while afterwards till the sun which spent more and more time in the sky every day finally dried up the accumulated moisture as it did in unkerlant and the land of the ice people spring announced itself in southeastern kuusamo with a great thaw a malignant buzzing penetrated the drips a mosquito landed on fernaos arm which lay outside the covers the buzzing ceased he slapped the buzzing resumed he cursed that meant hed missed the miserable thing mosquitoes and gnats bred in puddles of course during the spring thaw the naantali district was all over puddles for some time thereafter it was all over mosquitoes and gnats too no wonder birds coming back from the north chose this time to mate and lay their eggs they had plenty of food for themselves and for their youngsters too the only trouble was they didnt couldnt come close to catching all the bugs plenty were left to torment people with a sigh fernao got out of bed and splashed cold water on his face that wasnt torture as it would have been during the winter it still did help wake him up he put on clean drawers and a fresh tunic then pulled on his kilt tucked in the tunic and went downstairs to the refectory ilmarinen already sat down there eating smoked salmon and onions and drinking tea that looks good fernao said sitting beside him and waving to a serving girl it is ilmarinen agreed but its mine you can bloody well get your own i did intend to fernao said mildly the serving girl came up fernao pointed to ilmarinens plate ill have what hes having seeing a wicked glint in the other theoretical sorcerers eye fernao corrected himself not his helping but the same thing as hes having balked ilmarinen subsided the serving girl ignored the byplay she just nodded and went off to the kitchen fernao patted himself on the back he didnt win skirmishes with ilmarinen all that often neither did anyone else pekka walked into the refectory at the same time as fernaos breakfast arrived seeing him she smiled and waved and came on over he spoke quietly to ilmarinen could you let the two of us be for once lifes hard enough as is i could ilmarinen said but fernaos relief was shortlived for he added that doesnt necessarily mean i will pekka sat down by fernao the serving girlfernao was just as glad it wasnt linnawalked over and raised a questioning eyebrow pointing to fernao pekka said ill have what hes having without so much as looking at ilmarinen fernao shoved his plate and teacup over to pekka here he said deadpan and nodded to the serving girl you can bring me more of the same all right off she went again the vagaries of mages fazed her not in the least something is going on here and i dont know what pekka said darkly she cast ilmarinen a suspicious glance im just sitting here he told her why are you picking on me if something is going on and you dont understand it you shouldnt complain anyhow you should experiment to find out what it is his eyes flicked from her to fernao and back again all sorts of interesting experiments you might try fernao kicked him under the table pekka couldnt reach him to kick him but looked as if she wanted to fernao had imagined some of those experiments he didnt dare say so he wished he hadnt given her his breakfast now he had nothing with which to busy himself ilmarinen laughed which only irked fernao furtherhe knew he shouldnt have asked the kuusaman mage to go easy why are you getting upset ilmarinen asked i cant be saying anything the two of you havent thought of for yourselves there is a difference between what i think and what i do fernao switched from kuusaman to classical kaunian for the sake of greater precision if there were not i would be wringing your neck right now instead of quietly sitting here hed hoped that might alarm ilmarinen instead it amused the elderly theoretical sorcerer who laughed raucously fernao made himself stay in his chair so that ilmarinen never found out how close he did come to getting strangled ilmarinen finished his breakfast just as the serving girl brought fernao more food getting to his feet the master mage nodded to fernao and pekka in turn well im off he said cheerily im sure the two of you have a lot to talk about so you wont want me around anyhow away he went whistling a tune that sounded bawdy at least fernao did have something to do now and he did it he concentrated on his breakfast he concentrated so fiercely in fact that when pekka said something he didnt notice what it was and hardly noticed shed spoken at all im sorry he said looking up from his smoked salmon and blinking im afraid i missed that i said what are we going to do about ilmarinen pekkas voice was brittle she was looking past fernaos shoulder rather than at him i dont know he said the more i think about it the better the idea of wringing his neck looks we do need him for the work pekka said grudgingly since its hard to go out to the blockhouse and experiment with everything all over mud i was hoping to use the quiet time to start standardizing our spells so practical mages can use them that will make prince juhainen happy so it will fernao sipped tea he nodded he hoped judiciously it does need doing so many things need doing and we have so little time to do them pekka said anything that distracts us from them is a nuisance anything at all now she did look straight into fernaos eyes have i ever argued with that he asked no matter what hed been thinking hed always pulled his weight in the sorcerous research he wasnt so brilliant as ilmarinen and knew he wasnt but he didnt go around making people want to throttle him either no pekka shook her head youve always done everything i could have wanted except i mean now she wouldnt look at him anymore he finished his tea at a gulp wishing it were something stronger when he set down the mug he said come to my chamber with me pekkas eyebrows leaped upwards as he had with ilmarinen he went back to classical kaunian to explain exactly what he meant people have been gossiping about us for a long time now even though we have given them nothing about which to gossip if we make it seem as though something really has happened between us perhaps they will take it for granted and leave us be so we can go on about our business perhaps pekka echoed also in classical kaunian she sat beside him for half a minute or so her face closed in thought then abruptly she nodded worth a try she got to her feet so did fernao she slipped her hand into his it should look convincing she murmured in a low serious voice he nodded and smiled and squeezed her hand a little she squeezed back mages and servers in the refectory eyed them as they walked toward the stairway hand in hand either well stop the gossip about us fernao thought or else well start a lot more when they got to his chamber he was glad hed set the bed to rights and hadnt left anything but sorcerous tomes strewn about on the table and the stool and the chest of drawers that were the spare little rooms only other furniture i dont want to disturb your work pekka said and sat down on the bed while fernao paused to bar the door it wouldnt have mattered much he answered as he sat beside her now we just have to wait long enough so all the other people are sure they know whats going on in here aye pekka nodded they sat close together not touching at all not even looking at each other for a couple of minutes what happened next seemed likelier to have sprung from a threehundredyearold valmieran comedy of manners than real life fernao slipped his arm around pekka at exactly the same moment she leaned toward him an instant after that they werent sitting on the bed any more they were lying on it clinging to each other as if they were lodestone and iron when at last their lips separated fernao whispered ive wanted to do this for so long he trailed kisses across her cheek and down the side of her neck she shivered a little and sighed when he nibbled the lobe of her ear she wasnt looking at him she wasnt looking at anything her eyes were shut tight in a tiny voice she said please tell me you didnt have this in mind when you asked me to come up here with you by the powers above i didnt fernao exclaimed more truthfully than not it justhappened it justhappened pekka echoed her eyes were still closed but she nodded once more and reached for him if anything her kiss was even more desperate than his she shivered again when he unbuttoned her tunic and once more when his mouth descended on her left breast he teased her nipple with lips and tongue she pressed his head to her then panting and laughing she reached under his kilt when all her clothes lay scattered on the floor fernao wondered how he could ever have thought her scrawny she was what she wasa kuusaman woman made as kuusamans were and not much later he stopped thinking at all but leaned on one elbow above her for a moment while he guided himself in she let out a low breathy moan and clasped him with arms and legs she still kept her eyes shut tight he had to fight not to explode in the first instant once he managed that once he found a rhythm that suited them both he thought for a while that he could go on forever but pekkas mounting excitement spurred him toward the end too she called out a name and gave a short sharp cry of joy her nails scored his back he gasped and shuddered and spent himself only afterwards did he notice the name shed called wasnt his he stroked her cheek with a little luck she hadnt realized shed cried her husbands name there in the moment when all thought fled but she had she jerked away from his gentle hand and burst into tears leave me alone she said what have i done the answer to that was only too obvious fernao didnt point it out to her he dressed quickly and hurried out of the chamber even though it was his he fled it like an adulterer diving out a bedroom window when he heard footsteps on the stairs he was halfway down the hall before he wondered what sort of rumors that would start patrol somebody had to do it sidroc understood as much the unkerlanters had written the book on infiltration written it and revised it several times if you didnt go prowling forth and find out what they were up to and hold them at arms length youd wake up one fine morning with them bellowing urra from front rear and both flanks all at the same time but if you did go prowling forth they were liable to kill you for your trouble patrols didnt always come back sometimes they just vanished as if theyd never been sidroc was painfully aware of that he tried to tiptoe through the woods of the eastern duchy of grelz somebody had to go out on patrol aye he wished he werent one of the somebodies he also wished he and his comrades from plegmunds brigade didnt have to rely on the guide who walked through the woods with them some grelzer peasants hated king swemmel and his inspectors and impressers worse than the algarvians did others pretended to hate swemmel so as to lure the redheadsand the forthwegians who fought alongside themto destruction finding out youd trusted the wrong sort of guide was too apt to be the last discovery you ever made sergeant werferth spoke in algarvian where did you see these unkerlanter soldiers then he repeated the question in forthwegian which was at least related to the language spoken hereabouts i see by village the guide said in bad algarvian and pointed west and a little north two companies maybeso three he showed the numbers on his fingers to leave no room for error maybeso ceorl jeered maybeso youre leading us into an ambush eh with a shrug the guide answered you kill me then let him alone ceorl werferth said hes supposed to be on our side remember hes supposed to be aye sidroc said but is he ceorl looked at him in surprise they seldom agreed about anything sidroc went on i dont want him leading us down the primrose path either you know hed spoken forthwegian sure enough the local could follow bits of the language for he said no primroses then he said several other things in his own dialect of unkerlanter sidroc got only fragments of that but none of it sounded complimentary to king swemmel he kicked at the muddy pine needles underfoot the guide would sound the same way no matter how he really felt about the king of unkerlant he knows this country better than we do werferth said its his neck if the unkerlanters catch him after hes helped us if hes the straight goods sidroc thought if hes not if the guide wasnt the straight goods they could indeed avenge themselves upon him that wasnt likely to do them much good though off in the distance a wolf howled sidroc hoped it was a wolf anyhow so did the algarvian lieutenant heading up the patrol he said do they really let those cursed things run loose in this part of the world aye the guide answered sidroc wasnt altogether sure why anyone let the algarvian lieutenant run loose in this part of the world sidroc hadnt seen his twentieth birthday yet but he felt ten years older than the redhead even so the algarvian gave the orders as if to proclaim that his folk were the conquerors with the men of plegmunds brigade only along for the ride if they re the conquerors how come theyve spent most of the past year retreating sidroc wondered and what happens if they spend most of the next year retreating too he didnt want to dwell on that one of the reasons hed signed up for plegmunds brigade was that the algarvians had looked like worldbeaters back in forthweg if the world was theirs what better way to grab a chunk of it than fighting at their side he still couldnt imagine the world belonging to the unkerlanters they were too dowdy for that to seem possible another wolf howled this one in the direction where the guide said the unkerlanters were based i dont like that sergeant werferth muttered why not the algarvian lieutenant sounded curious a bright child might have sounded the same way we dont need a bright child leading our patrol sidroc thought we need a nasty old veteran who knows what hes doing and how to go about it but the young algarvian was what they had patiently werferth said because it sounds like signal and answer sir if it is signal and answer were liable to be walking into something wed be better off missing ah the lieutenant said as if that hadnt occurred to him he swept off his hat and bowed to werferth so maybe it hadnt sidroc sighed if the lieutenant lived hed learn in a hurry fighting against the unkerlanters you had to but if he didnt live he was liable to drag the whole patrol down in ruin with him very close by a jay jeered the guide froze so did all the men from plegmunds brigade that raucous cry made an even better signal than a wolfs howl the algarvian lieutenant took another couple of steps before realizing something might be wrong he looked around wildly his stick at the ready but then sidroc spotted the bird pinkish brown with a black tail fluttering from one pine to another as it flew it screeched again he breathed easier its a real jay he said nice to know somethings real werferth said nobody argued with him the algarvian lieutenant laughed and said if any unkerlanters heard it they probably started shivering thinking it was us sidroc nodded the lieutenant was likely to be right swemmels men alarmed sidroc but hed seen that mezentios men alarmed the unkerlanters too that was fortunate as far as he was concerned every so often it kept the enemy from pressing an attack as hard as he might have forward the young lieutenant said sidroc had heard the word too many timesmostly shouted and emphasized by shrilling whistlesfor it to spur him on as it had when hed first joined plegmunds brigade what was it but an invitation to get himself killed even the redhead seemed to realize as much for he spoke quietly as if to say the patrol needed to go on but shouldnt make a fuss about it even though that jay had been real unkerlanters lurked among the trees sidroc could feel their presence even if he couldnt see or hear or smell them the hair on his arms and at the back of his neck kept trying to prickle up he was almost panting as if hed run a long way but it wasnt exhaustion that had done it to him it was nerves he felt taut as a viol string about to snap beside him ceorl started cursing under his breath harsh monotonous vicious cursing all in a tiny voice no one farther away than sidroc could have heard you know theyre there too eh sidroc whispered ceorl looked astonished as if he hadnt realized what he was doing maybe he hadnt he nodded abruptly and went back to his oaths clearing the guide said first in his own language then in algarvian the unkerlanter word sounded like one that meant market square in forthwegian so sidroc supposed he understood the fellow twice well go on across it the young lieutenant said well follow that made good sense unkerlanter soldiers were far less likely to blaze a peasant than soldiers in the uniforms of their foes even so the guide gave the redhead a look full of hate and fear as he started across the muddy open space a couple of men at a time the troopers from plegmunds brigade followed the guide had got about halfway to the trees on the far side of the clearing when he trod on a cunningly buried egg afterwards sidroc realized that was what must have happened at the time all he knew was the sudden roar and flash of light as the sorcerous energies trapped in the egg suddenly released themselves all channeled upward to be as deadly as possible the luckless guide didnt even have the chance to shriek he simply ceased to be one of his bootsprobably not the one that had stepped on the eggflew high into the air before thudding back to earth that was the sole remaining sign hed ever lived in automatic reflex sidroc started to throw himself flat but he checked that reflex and stayed on his feet he was liable to throw himself down on another egg and to end as abruptly as the guide had done back the algarvian lieutenant hissed even more urgently than hed ordered the advance not long before he added every unkerlanter in the world is going to come see what happened here that was bound to be true and made a powerful incentive to retreat in a hurry again though sidroc didnt let himself be rushed he tried to retrace his steps as exactly as he could he hadnt stepped on an egg as he went west into the clearing if he was careful he wouldnt step on one going back east out of it hed just slid behind a palebarked birch when an unkerlanter trooper in a rockgray tunic stuck his head into the clearing sidroc whipped his stick up to his shoulder and blazed the unkerlanter toppled cries of alarm rang out from the woods on the other side of the open space nice blaze sergeant werferth said they wont think we all ran for home with our tails between our legs he was right the unkerlanters didnt think that because they didnt their eggtossers started lobbing eggs into the forest to try to keep the patrol from making its way back to the encampment sidroc had endured far heavier bombardments in the fight in the durrwangen bulge realizing that also made him realize this peppering shouldnt trouble him muchodds were it would do him no harm somehow the comforting logic failed to comfort each bursting egg made him want to flee more than the one before true the fighting by durrwangen had been far harsher but durrwangen had also been ten months before sidroc was ten months more battered ten months more frazzled hed seen ten months more disasters hed had ten months more to realize how easily disaster might visit him an egg burst not far away someone started screaming one more down he thought one more who signed up in forthweg for a lark or maybe to stay out of gaol he looked back in time trying once more to recall his own reasons for joining plegmunds brigade with eggs bursting all around with trees crashing down in front and behind they didnt seem good enough we did our duty the young algarvian officer said when they finally got back to the village from which theyd started we successfully developed the enemys position now that we know where he is our counterattacks stand a better chance of driving him back sidroc didnt want to think about counterattacks hed lived through another day he was contenthe was delightedto savor that captain frigyes prowled along the muddy beach of becsehely be ready men istvans company commander urged you must always be ready no telling when the kuusamans are liable to descend on us he pointed to istvan you wish to say something sergeant aye sir istvan nodded weve been hearing for months that the slanteyes would hit us and they havent done it yet why should we figure this time is any different because i say so would be reason enough captain frigyes answered and istvan winced hed meant no disrespect but then frigyes went on but theres more to it than that our mages have stolen emanations from their crystals theyre talking about becsehely in ways they never have before theyre serious this time no doubt of it ah istvan nodded again thank you sir youre welcome frigyes pounded a fist into the palm of his other hand are we going to lick those goateating whoresons when they try to take this island away from us aye most of the men in the company roared istvan had to roar too so did corporal kun and szonyi and a few other soldiers each of them bore an identical scar on his left hand a remnant of the purification and penance captain tivadar frigyes predecessor had inflicted on them for inadvertently eating goat from a captured unkerlanter stewpot tivadar was dead only the men whod committed the sindeadly by gyongyosian standardsknew of it these days but a cry like frigyes still made istvan sweat cold for fear hed be discovered well smash them like crocks well beat them like drums that was lajos he hadnt been in istvans squad when theyd eaten from that accursed stewpot hed never fought the kuusamans they were just a name to him he was young and brave and full of confidence life looked simple to him why not he didnt know any better we can beat them szonyi agreed hed been with istvan a long time ever since the fighting on obuda which lay a good deal farther west in the bothnian oceanand which these days belonged to kuusamo once more the difference between his can and lajos will was subtle but it was all too real kun didnt say anything behind the lenses of his goldrimmed spectacles his eyes were sober years of war had taught szonyi some few reservations kun seemed to have been born with more than most gyongyosians ever needed to acquire and what about me istvan wondered unlike kun he wasnt a city man his home village kunhegyes shared a mountain valley with a couple of other similar hamlets had it not been for the army he might never have left that valley his whole life long unless he went raiding into a nearby one his horizons now were wider than hed ever imagined they could be sometimes he thought that marvelous rather more often he wished it had never happened not much horizon here even when he climbed out of the trench all he could see was the low flat muddy island and the surrounding sea which looked bare of ships he found another question for frigyes captain are they bringing more dragons to becsehely to keep the slanteyes from pounding us the way theyve done before well have plenty of dragons sergeant the company commander replied and strode on down the line istvan beamed in considerable relief until corporal kun spoke in a low voice you do realize he didnt answer your question dont you he said istvan broke off and thought about what captain frigyes had said he kicked at the muddy ground youre right he didnt he might have been a father telling a little boy not to worry the comparison angered him he wasnt a little boy he was a man if he werent a man he wouldnt have been here with a stick slung on his back but kun s voice held only calm appraisal hes a pretty good officer he doesnt want people fretting about what they cant help i wouldnt have either if you hadnt opened your mouth now istvan was ready to be angry at kun rather than frigyes one thing being a mages apprentice taught me kun said what words mean and what they dont id sooner find out the truth whatever it is and whatever it turns out to be i expect i can look it in the eye you cant say that about everyone i suppose not istvan said how would kun take it if somebody pointed out the truth about his immodesty istvan didnt intend to do any such thing kun went on enough as things were and he had a gift for asking unpleasant questions he found one now suppose we look like were going to lose becsehely do you think our mages will start sacrificing us to build the sorcery they need to drive back the kuusamans thats as the stars decide istvan answered nothing i can do about it one way or the other and you did volunteer the same as i did the same as most of the men in the company did oh aye i volunteered kun s eyes blazed from behind the lenses of his spectacles how could i do anything else with everybody looking at me arent you the fellow who doesnt care what anybody else thinks istvan returned he usually enjoyed turning the tables on kun not least because he couldnt very often today though the corporal didnt rise to the bait he just scowled at istvan and strode off silent and gruff as if hed come from a mountain valley himself for the next couple of days everything on becsehely stayed quiet gulls wheeled overhead so did other bigger seabirds some of them with a wingspan twice as wide as a mans outstretched arms those enormous birds spent most of their time in the air istvan had seen them on obuda too when they did land they often rolled and tumbled watching them crash to the groundand watching them trying to get airborne againwas more entertaining than most of the things the gyongyosian soldiers had to do on the island alarm bells began clanging before dawn three days after captain frigyes delivered his warning troopers who werent sleeping in their trenches ran for them this is no drill the company commander shouted moments after the clanging started the dowsers see enemy ships out over the horizon he hesitated then shouted one thing more volunteers remember your oath you may be summoned istvan wished frigyes hadnt said that how was he supposed to concentrate on staying alive against the kuusamans if his own side was liable to kill him to drive back the invaders dragons that shout seemed to come from everywhere at once istvan hunkered down in his trench becsehely had been hit before it had been hit hard too but gyongyosian dragons flying off the little island had also struck back hard at the enemy not this time or not for long kuusamo seemed to have gathered every dragon in the world and put all those beasts in the air above the island that was how it felt to istvan anyhow the rain of eggs was the hardest hed ever known there were almost as many as if theyd been real raindrops or so it seemed to him the ground under him jerked and quivered as if in torment dirt flew into the air and thudded down onto him and his squadmatesso much dirt he feared being buried alive and the dragons swooped low too flaming whenever the men who flew them found targets they judged worthwhile shrieks rose from the trenches punctuating the roar of bursting eggs and the alarm bells brazen clamor before long istvan smelled charred meat he cursed he knew what meat that was then the bells redoubled their fury boats offshore the cry reached istvan as if from very far away but he understood what it meant it meant the gyongyosian crystallomancers had had the right of it this time the kuusamans were going to try to take becsehely away from gyongyos he stuck his head up out of the trench hed seen enemy boats approaching a gyongyosianheld island before back in the days when he was fighting on obuda it had meant trouble then it meant trouble now too and he saw no gyongyosian ships attacking the kuusaman vessels from which those invasion boats came its up to us he said if we dont throw the enemy back nobody will if we dont throw the enemy back the mages will cut our throats and hope they can do it kun said istvan glared at him but kun hadnt spoken loud enough to demoralize any of the other soldiers so istvan did no more than glare the sea was full of boats all of them seemed to be coming straight toward istvan the kuusaman naval vessels started throwing eggs at the beaches of becsehely istvan ducked down into the trench again but he couldnt stay down there if the kuusamans got soldiers ashore he was a dead man that their eggs might easily kill him too was only a detail make them pay captain frigyes shouted though his voice sounded small and lost amidst the endless roars of the bursting eggs by the stars itll cost them if they want to shift gyongyosian warriors as soon as the incoming boats got close enough istvan started blazing at them the kuusamans blazed back though the bobbing waves made most of their beams go wild well slaughter them szonyi said happily i hope so istvan answered and the gyongyosians did slaughter their foes at least those who tried to come ashore in front of the trench where istvan and his comrades crouched a good many enemy soldiers never made it to the beach alive none of the small dark slanteyed men made it off the beach alive not there but even while istvans company beat back the kuusamans shouts of alarm rose elsewhere on becsehely theyve landed the soldiers cheers turned to cries of alarm if the kuusamans had gained a foothold on the island they would prove far harder to dislodgeby any ordinary means that is no sooner had that thought crossed istvans mind than captain frigyes called back toward the mages my brave men we are warriorswe can give all that warriors have to give for gyongyos and ekrekek arpad for gyongyos and ekrekek arpad istvan echoed he followed frigyes from the trenches without hesitation if gyongyos needed his life from him gyongyos would have it and if fear made his legs feel as if they were made of gelatin and not flesh and solid bone he would pretend it didnt i told you this would happen kun said furiously istvan only shrugged hed thought it might happen too it bothered him less than it did the former mages apprentice getting burnt to nothingness by a bursting egg before his life energy could serve his kingdom worried him more plainly he would die on becsehely one way or another that being so he wanted to choose the way but then even that choice was denied him for a swarm of kuusamans a regiments worth at leastcame rushing up from the south they must have swept all before them there to surrender one of them shouted in bad gyongyosian istvan looked to captain frigyes had the company commander been ready to fight to the death he would have fought too but frigyes though ready to die to aid gyongyos didnt care to perish to no purpose he let his stick fall and raised his hands and istvan discovered he was not a bit sorry to do the same a crazy grin spread across his face that hed been ready to die made living all the sweeter pekka breathed a sigh of relief as she put a pad inside her drawers aye shed done something she wished looking back on it she hadnt but she wouldnt have to face the consequences nine months from now a frown made a small vertical line appear between her eyebrows it had nothing to do with the dull ache in her lower back or even with the cramps that would follow try as she would she couldnt make all of her wish she hadnt gone to bed with fernao despite the tears and regrets afterwards it had felt too good while it was going on it would have been just as good with leino it would have been even better with leino she nodded to herself while she finished dressing that was probably true but her husband however much she missed him and wanted him was far away and had been for much too long if she wanted fernao she had only to walk to his chamber and knock on the door she hadnt done it not since that first time and fernao hadnt come knocking on her door either more than anything else that made her believe he hadnt planned on seducing her when he invited her to his room she shook her head as she walked to the door it hadnt been a seduction curse it she couldnt claim it hadnt also been her fault not even to herself shed wanted the lagoan mage as much as hed wanted her and he still wanted her she knew as much what she wanted is nobodys affair but my own she murmured stepping out into the hallway she hadnt taken more than two steps toward the refectory before she stopped and kicked at the carpet she wished she hadnt used the word affair even if she didnt mean it like that when she got down to the refectory she saw fernao sitting at a table with raahe and alkio animatedly talking shop the table had four chairs around it alkio saw her and waved her to the empty one which was by fernaos she didnt see that she had any choice but to go sit there she would have before the two of them made love that was certain good morning fernao said like her he did his best to pretend in public that nothing too much out of the ordinary had happened good morning pekka made a particular kind of sour face fair morning anyhow fernao looked baffled so did alkio raahe softly chuckled into her cup of tea she understood thatbut then she was a woman too linna came bustling up what can i get you she asked her eyes traveled speculatively from pekka to fernao and back again tea pekka said ignoring that glance going to fernaos room hadnt stifled the gossipno indeed it just spawned more oatmeal with berries and plenty of honey she didnt feel like anything heavier linna nodded and went away fernao returned to the conversation hed been having with the husbandandwife team of theoretical sorcerers i still say that instance we sensed yesterday felt odd is the only word i can find for it alkio shook his head i dont think so its just that weve got too used to feeling those murderous sacrifices they dont jolt us the way they once did nodding pekka said i know for a fact that thats true with me and if its not a judgment on us all and on this whole sorry world powers below eat me if i know what would be a judgment aye no doubt fernao nodded too and so did raahe and alkio but stubbornly the lagoan mage went on it didnt feel right though i tell you of course not alkio said if it was wrong how could it feel right fernao exhaled through his nose in exasperation that is not what i meant he said switching from kuusaman to classical kaunian so he could get across exactly what he did mean i meant it did not feel like algarvian magecraft and it did not feel like unkerlanter sorcery alkio gestured dismissively who else could it have been no one but mezentios mages and swemmels uses those spells and powers above be praised for that before fernao could answerand for that matter before he could get any angrier for he was already irkedpiilis came into the refectory as he paused in the doorway pekka waved to him he waved back and walked toward the table where she was sitting she hooked a chair from another table with her ankle and scooted over to give piilis room to join her colleagues and her only after shed done it did she realize shed scooted closer to fernao was that wise its what i would have done before what happened happened she told herself whether that answered her question was a question in and of itself thank you mistress pekka piilis said i ran into one of the crystallomancers on my way over here so ive got some news well tell us pekka said if it werent for the crystallomancers we wouldnt know any of what was going on till it was already gone its not as if they send us news sheets every day the miserable gongs tried something new when we landed on that bothnian island called becsehely piilis pronounced the foreign name with care they were going to trot out the murderous magic the algarvians use but we overran them so fast they didnt have the chance to kill many of their own soldiers so the magic wasnt so big or so strong as it might have been and becsehelys ours ha fernao said and then ha again piilis looked confused he looked even more confused when fernao wagged a finger at alkio and declared i told you so well so you did alkio clicked his tongue between his teeth the gyongyosians are using this sorcery too that is not good at all and killing their own soldiers to power it pekka added that may be even worse than what the algarvians and unkerlanters do not to hear the gongs talk about it piilis said by the reports were getting from the captives weve taken they wont slaughter anyone who didnt volunteer ahead of timeand a lot of men did they think its an honor to let themselves get killed for their kingdom it makes the stars shine on them or some such nonsense with profound unoriginality pekka said gyongyosians are very strange people they think the same of us fernao said using classical kaunian again all the other strong kingdoms sharemore or less and sometimes at several removesthe culture that springs from the kaunian empire but the gyongyosians have their own when we bumped up against them a hundred and fifty years ago they borrowed stole alkio put in fernao nodded accepting the correction they stole some of our fancy magecraft nailed it onto everything else they already had and they went right on to make nuisances of themselves more than nuisances alkio said and all the other kuusamans at the table spoke up to agree with him he went on weve been squabbling with them over the islands in the bothnian ocean ever since they want everything they can get their hands on and a little more besides and what do they say about kuusamans fernao asked innocently who cares what gongs say alkio answered proving hed missed the point pekka hadnt but she had other things to worry about the next time we try to take an island the gyongyosians hold we may not be so lucky as we were at this bescewhatever place she said prince juhainen was rightall the more reason for us to get our own spells to the point where practical mages can use them all the more reason for us to get our own spells to the point when leino can use them pekka wondered if her husband wherever he was was looking at other women or even doing more than looking at them before shed made love with fernao the idea would have horrified and infuriated her it still horrified her but in a way she almost hoped he was then at least they would both feel guilty when they finally got back together raahe and alkio and i were talking about that before you got here fernao said he didnt sound as if he had any second thoughts about bedding her why should he pekka thought its not as if he betrayed his wife at least i dont think it is she suddenly realized just how much she didnt know about the lagoan mages past and background what kind of fool was i to go to bed with him one corner of her mouth quirked upward the answer to that was only too plain a hot fool a lickerish fool again she made herself think about what she had to do not about what shed already done what in particular were you talking about she asked ways to simplify the spell while keeping the energy level high fernao replied raahe has some good ideas i think piilis said ive been doing some calculations of my own along those lines he took folded papers from his belt pouch and spread them out on the tablethis just as linna came out of the kitchen with his breakfast the serving girl gave him a severe look if you dont eat sorcerous sir you wont be strong enough to follow whatever it is youve written down there sorry piilis cleared some room in front of him linna set down his smoked salmon and eggs and went off he promptly leaned over the plate of food so he could explain his line of thought the other theoretical sorcerers leaned forward too the only heed piilis gave the salmon and eggs was to keep from putting his elbow in the plate as pekka and fernao leaned toward his papers their knees and thighs brushed under the table pekka was acutely aware of it if fernao was he gave no sign he didnt press himself against her to remind her of what theyd done she nodded to herself it wasnt as if she didnt know let me have a look at those raahe said and turned piilis calculations so that she could read themwhich meant they were upside down for pekka but when pekka sighed and started to ease back in her seat she brushed up against fernao again that kept her leaning forward then raahe turned the leaves of paper back around once more remarking thats not the approach i was taking but you could be on to the same thing no fernao sounded regretful but very sure he sounded so sure in fact that all four kuusaman mages around the table bristled at him but then he reached out and tapped a line about halfway down the second leaf of paper this whole expansion sequence is forbidden in this context mistress raahe s approach will work this he shrugged following it will be like following a willothewisp you will never end up anywhere worth going but only in the middle of a swamp pekka took a longer look at the calculations you may be right she said so youll believe fernao even when he leads you into a swamp eh the voice from behind her made her start and whirl there stood ilmarinen looking down on her with a sardonic grin he shook his head how very strange you wouldnt have said that even a little while ago before you went to bed with him was what he meant pekka glared see for yourself she snapped i was trying to ilmarinen didnt bother with his spectacles but read at long range after perhaps half a minute he let out a soft grunt sorry piilis i dont think the lagoans the least bit cute but hes right you cant expand it that way for the life of her pekka didnt know whether to thank him or to brain him with a teapot by the look on fernaos face he was even closer to swinging the teapot than she was my my colonel sabrino murmured as his wing came spiraling down to land at the new dragon farm in southern unkerlant to which theyd been ordered isnt that fascinating hed let the wind blow his words away but now he activated his crystal and repeated himself for captain orosio isnt that simply fascinating thats one word colonel the squadron commander answered maybe not the one i wouldve used but one word who wouldve thought wed end up flying alongside yaninans again theyd been together a long time sabrino nodded we havent for a while now he said not since we were down in the land of the ice people i almost forgot the yaninans were still in the war orosios lip curled scornfully as any algarvians might have done while he contemplated his kingdoms allies his chuckle held scant mirth and dont you just bet all the cursed yaninans wish they could forget they were still in the war too heh sabrino saidone syllables worth of bitter laughter he did his best to look on the bright side of things ive seen plenty of dragon farms i liked less sure enough this one was bigger than most of those from which his wing had been flying it looked to have been here a while too heavy sticks ringed it sticks potent enough to blaze marauding unkerlanter dragons out of the sky the yaninan dragonfliers lived in huts not tents the only thing wrong with them is theyre yaninans sabrino thought had their dragons been painted green red and white instead of just white and red but sabrino shook his head even that wasnt fair down on the austral continent colonel broumidis dragonfliers had fought just about as well as the men sabrino himself led yaninan footsoldiers sabrino shook his head again this time for a different reason he didnt want to think about yaninan footsoldiers theyd proved less than algarve would have wished in the land of the ice people and theyd proved even less than that here in unkerlant if they hadnt given way at exactly the wrong time the great disaster at sulingen might not have happened if there were enough algarvians to go around sulingen wouldn t have happened sabrino thought a lot of other things wouldnt have happened either he was certain of that he was every bit as certain that there werent enough algarvians to go around though had there been his wings true strength wouldnt have stood at less than half of the sixtyfour dragons it carried on paperand that after reinforcement his own mount beat its great membranous wings a couple of times and settled to the ground his teeth clicked together hed known gentler landings but hed also known worse onesat least he hadnt bitten his tongue this time a yaninan dragon handler a swarthy little bandylegged fellow with a big black mustache and bushy side whiskers came hurrying up to the dragon and chained it to a stake so it couldnt fly off whenever the notion came into its tiny savage mind the yaninan did the job as well as any algarvian could have sabrino had trouble taking him seriously even so his tights and his tunic with big puffy sleeves were bad enough the shoes with bobbling pompom ornamentssabrino had to look away lest he burst out laughing and offend the little man as sabrino descended from the dragon a yaninan officer strode up to greet him the yaninan had a crown and star on each shoulder strap which made him a major he saluted sabrino and spoke in pretty good algarvian hello colonel welcome to plankenfels his wave encompassed the dragon farm and i have the honor to be major scoufas at your service sabrino returned the bow and gave his own name happy to be able to help my kingdoms allies he said politely something sparked in scoufas dark almost fathomless eyes you are gracious he remarked if all algarvians were like you we would be happier in our alliance believe me we already know we are your poor relations some of you want to remind us of it whenever you find the chance sabrino had seen that for himself hed also seen that some algarvians had good reason for treating yaninans with something less than perfect courtesy and respect he didnt say that scoufas wouldnt have appreciated it what he did say was i am sorry about that major of course your kingdoms other choice is unkerlant im sure king swemmel s men would prove the picture of politeness scoufas winced savages he muttered yanina feared unkerlant but did not love her the dragonflier pulled himself together your wing will be of great help in holding the river line there he pointed west to show where the front lay thats why were here sabrino agreed and now that we are here maybe you can give me a little more in the way of a briefing with a shrugnot an elaborate algarvian shrug but one in the yaninan style one that said things werent all they might be but nobody could do anything about itscoufas replied this is where the front was when the thaw pinned things in place we are trying to keep it here we have not enough men not enough behemoths not enough eggtossersbut we are trying not enough dragons either i suppose sabrino fought to keep irony from his voice yaninans werent the greatest warriors in derlavai but who came close to them when it got down to complaining no not enough dragons either major scoufas said gravely he bowed to sabrino your coming will make a difference there of course how big a difference sabrino wondered returning the bow but thinking about dragons naturally led him to his next question how are you fixed for cinnabar scoufas shrugged again not very well such is life these days the unkerlanters have plenty their dragons can flame farther than ours thanks to all the quicksilver they give them we fly better than they do though which takes away some of their advantage all right it wasnt all rightit wasnt even close to all rightbut sabrino couldnt do anything about it lets get my dragons seen to lets get my men settled and then youll show me the map everything shall be just as you say of course scoufas replied with another bow the yaninan dragon handlers did seem capable enough they fed the newly come algarvian dragons chunks of meat rubbed in ground brimstone and they gave them some meat rubbed in cinnabarabout as much or rather as little as their algarvian opposite numbers would have had available the yaninans had huts waiting and ready for sabrinos dragonfliers sabrino could think of major generals who would be sleeping rougher than he was but when he got a look at the map he forgot about everything else powers above he burst out if they push hardno when they push hardhow in blazes do you propose to stop them i am not a major of footsoldiers scoufas said which wasnt an answer we shall do everything in our power i assure you he added which wasnt an answer either then that rather nasty glint came back to his eyes of course you algarvians have had a certain amount of trouble stopping the unkerlanters too sabrino would have resented that more if it hadnt been true from the freezing narrow sea in the south to the warm garelian ocean in the north the algarvians were stretched too thin against their bigger foe this thoughwhat passed for the yaninan line looked like a wool tunic after an army of moths had found it in a closet scoufas added you algarvians often say yaninans cant fight then you go to war with your great plenty of all the tools the unkerlantersthey too have a great plenty of all the tools and what have we bodies with bodies colonel we do what we can sometimes what those bodies did was run away as fast as they could go sometimes even throwing away their sticks to flee the faster sabrino knew that scoufas doubtless knew it too even if he didnt feel like owning up to it like a lot of yaninan officers he had pride and to spare and he needed it for it was about the only thing of which he had plenty my men and i will do what we can for you major sabrino said the yaninan shrugged another pessimistic shrug if your wing were not battered and used up your superiors would never have sent it here he said we know we get your leavings he waited for sabrino to argue sabrino didnt he couldnt that was also true when he didnt scoufas raised an elegantly arched eyebrow and asked tell me if you would be so kind what you did to get yourself sent among yaninans do you want to know the truth sabrino asked and scoufas dipped his head yaninans often did that instead of nodding sabrino had seen as much down in the land of the ice people he went on i told king mezentio he was wrong about something and i happened to be right ah scoufas said if you had done such a thing with king tsavellas it might have proved a fatal error who says it isnt sabrino thought but he would not say that to a yaninan instead he said ive been a colonel a long time ill keep right on being a colonel for a long time to come unless i get killed of course he shrugged have only my wife to provide for these days now that fronesias squeezing money out of that footsoldier instead what did you ah say to your king to fall from his good graces scoufas asked sabrino didnt intend to answer that but decided it couldnt make any difference i told him sacrificing kaunians for the sake of strong sorcery would turn out to be a mistake and it did well whatever scoufas had expected that plainly wasnt it you surprise me colonel i thought all algarvians killed kaunians with a smile on their faces i have not seen any who did not at any rate not till now life is full of surprises sabrino said at which scoufas dipped his head again two days later when sabrinos wing flew their first mission alongside scoufas yaninan dragonfliers he got another surprise it wasnt that the yaninans performed well enough hed looked for that remembering how well colonel broumidis men had flown down on the austral continent what really startled him was how weak the unkerlanter forces opposite the yaninans were his wing came back from smashing up the enemys outposts not only without losing a man but also without the feeling of having been in real danger maybe i should have said even more rude things to his majesty sabrino told captain orosio once they got back to the dragon farm this isnt warits more like the rest cure they give consumptives swemmels whoresons sure fight us a lot harder than they go after these buggers orosio agreed till we got here i didnt think the unkerlanters had a second team weve never seen it before by the powers above of course sabrino said musingly it is all they need against the yaninans oh ayeno doubt about that his squadron commander didnt bother hiding his scorn powers above if swemmel had a third team he could get away with using that too hit tsavellas odds and sods with a real army and theyd break like a dropped pot aye they would wouldnt they sabrino looked around more than a little nervously he wished orosio hadnt put it quite that way seven bembo swaggered through eoforwic exactly as hed swaggered through gromheort farther east thanks to delminio his new partner hed already made the acquaintance of a good many taverns and eateries and bakeries where a hungry man could get what he needed to sustain himself through a long hard wearying shift on the beat he was sustaining himself so much he was thinking of letting out the belt that held up his kilt another notch he didnt enjoy going into the kaunian quarter when his partner and he drew that duty but he didnt shrink from it and it had compensations patrolling the rest of eoforwic didnt offer as delminio put it the blond women throw themselves at our feet or on their knees or however we want them by the smug smile on his face hed had no trouble getting at least one exactly how he wanted her aye no doubt about it bembo agreed hed had good luck with kaunian women too as an algarvian constable one could hardly help having good luck with kaunian women hardly seems sporting does it theyll do anything or a lot of em will on account of they think we can keep em alive if we want to sporting delminio shrugged who cares about sporting what i care about is getting my ashes hauled sounds right bembo said delminio didnt hate kaunians the way oraste his old partner had but delminio didnt hesitate in taking advantage of the blonds whenever he saw the chance either since bembo rarely hesitated himself when he saw that kind of chance they got along fine after walking on for a few paces bembo said there are times i wish we hadnt started sending em west i dont know what in blazes its got us the unkerlanters are doing their own dirty work and it pretty much cancels ours out with another shrug delminio said i dont worry about stuff like that if its good enough for king mezentio i figure its good enough for me too youve got a sensible way of looking at things bembo said that was plenty to make delminio strut and preen as if hed just been named a duke bembo wished he could take the whole kaunian business so lightly he could sometimes as when he was getting a blond woman to go to bed with him but he had more trouble shutting down his mind the rest of the time than delminio seemed to a kaunian woman came out of a block of flats as soon as they saw her golden hair shining in the sun bembo and delminio both swung their heads toward her a motion as automatic as breathing to them and then when they noticed she was very pregnant they both looked away again too as for her she looked through them as if they didnt exist that was the common reaction among kaunian women who didnt care to give themselves to the algarvians wonder if one of us stuck that baby in her delminio remarked i doubt it bembo said as the young woman waddled around a corner she doesnt look like she hates us enough for that he fancied himself a connoisseur of such reactions mm youre probably right delminio said either he agreed with bembo or he didnt feel like arguing odds are he thinks im right bembo thought we algarvians were an argumentative bunch bells began ringing not just in the kaunian quarter but all over eoforwic blonds started running delminio started cursing so did bembo stinking unkerlanter dragonfliers he snarled over in gromheort we didnt have to worry about this much over in gromheort you were a lot farther east delminio pointed out just thank the powers above that our dowsers are getting better at spotting swemmels dragons before the whoresons are right on top of us even if they werent i suppose we could always duck into a cellar with the kaunians bembo said go ahead if you want to delminio said me id sooner take a chance on unkerlanter eggs not long before you got here a couple of constables went into a cellar full of blonds they didnt come out againnot alive i mean and of course the cellar was empty by the time anybody found em they werent pretty he added in meditative tones and we still dont know just who did for them oh bembo kicked at the slates of the sidewalk i hadnt heard about that no you wouldnt have delminio agreed they dont go out of their way to talk about it if you know what i mean the clanging of the bells grew more urgent but we ought to look for a cellar ourselves right about now and that means one outside the kaunian quarter oh bembo said again right he pointed to his partner well lead the way youre the one whos supposed to know whats where in this town if you dont know where the closest handy cellar is what good are you neither of them ran from the kaunian district but neither of them dawdled either they ducked into a cellar already rapidly filling with algarvian constables and soldiers and a few trusted forthwegians just as the first eggs fell on eoforwic the floor beneath bembos feet shook lanterns swung on their mounting brackets shadows swooped and danced bembo tried not to think about what would happen if an unkerlanter egg landed right on top of the cellar savagely someone said i hope were paying the unkerlanters back ten for one someone else spoke in reassuring tones of course we are bembo wished he knew where that of course came from blind optimism probably had the war been going altogether in algarves direction the unkerlanters wouldnt have been able to drop eggs on eoforwic had the war been going altogether in algarves direction unkerlant would long since have been conquered and so bembo decided there were worse things than huddling in a cellar while dragons painted rockgray flew overhead he could have been huddling in a trench waiting for soldiers in rockgray tunics to swarm over him after a while the dragons above eoforwic would be gone in a trench the danger never went away we ought to have more dragons and heavy sticks around eoforwic delminio said this is an important place do we let the unkerlanters knock chunks of it flat whenever they please if we put more dragons and heavy sticks back here pal we wouldnt have em at the front a soldier said theres not enough to go around as is in case you havent noticed having swemmels whoresons tear a hole in the line is a bigger worry than anything else believe you me it is that echoed bembos thought too closely for comfort after what seemed like forever but couldnt have been much above half an hour the eggs stopped falling on eoforwic bembo could barely hear the bells announcing that the unkerlanter raiders had flown back toward the west all through the cellar people sighed and stretched getting ready to resume their interrupted lives somebody put it pretty well we got through another one now lets go see how many pieces need picking up bembo said to delminio therell be some delminio predicted there always are he did his best to sound like a jaded veteran as far as bembo was concerned he succeeded but then a soldier let out a snort delminio gave the fellow a dirty look but the damage was done when they came out into the fresh air it didnt seem so fresh any more the stink of smoke made bembo cough looking around he saw several plumes rising into the sky more bells jangled as crews hurried to try to cope with the fires looks like they hit us a good lick he remarked theyve done worse delminio said but his bravado didnt last with a sigh he went on they are hitting us harder and more often than they were a year ago we have to carry on i dont know what else we can do at the edge of the kaunian quarter algarvian constables eyed bembo and delminios kilts and reddish hair making sure of who and what they were before waving them on into the district bembo looked around in disgust hardly seems like anything fell here swemmels whoresons dont usually hit the kaunians hard delminio answered they know the blonds give us trouble and they know what we do with those blonds too so they dont see much point to dropping eggs on em stupid if you ask me bembo said if the unkerlanters know were killing kaunians to give em grief they ought to do their best to kill em before we get the chance why dont you write a letter to marshal rathar delminio said bembo made a horrible face at him they both laughed just as they were rounding a corner another redheaded fellow in constabulary uniform hurried into a block of flats boy he didnt waste any time getting back here did he bembo said delminio chuckled hes probably got himself a sweet little kaunian tart stashed in there his hands expressive as any algarvians shaped an hourglass in the air has to make sure his darling is all right dont you know makes sense bembo agreed you want to know what i think though what doesnt make sense is getting that stuck on any one blond girl how long is she likely to last before they ship her west you know what your trouble is delminio said he waited for bembo to shake his head then continued your trouble is youve got your head on too straight a lot of fellows they screw a girl a few times and then they decide they have to be in love with her you know what i mean bembo nodded oh sure ive seen that powers above back when i was a kid id do it myself but its especially stupid here i wont tell you youre wrong delminio said back before you got here a couple of constables got caught tipping off their kaunian girlfriends that roundups were coming or else hiding them so they wouldnt get shipped out officers do that kind of stuff all the time bembo said if these had been officers they wouldve got away with it delminio said but they were just ordinary sods like you and me the wenches went out on the next leyline caravan west and the bigwigs decided those constables had volunteered for the infantry so theyre somewhere off in unkerlant tooif theyre still breathing they are i mean bembo grunted thats probably worth knowing he said at last what went through his mind was you can enjoy yourself with these kaunian gals but dontby the powers above dontdo anything stupid he didnt expect he would his mother hadnt raised him to be a fool delminio had been eyeing him after a moment his new partner nodded i said you had your head on straight youd best believe it bembo boasted which made delminio snort that pregnant kaunian woman emerged from her cellar and made her way back to the block of flats next door to the one the algarvian constable with the blond girlfriend had entered delminio pointed to her what do you suppose shes thinking right now when you get right down to it that doesnt make much difference does it bembo pointed in the direction from which the unkerlanter dragons had come the direction in which so many kaunians were going delminio thought it over he didnt need to think long after only a couple of heartbeats he nodded how are you this morning milady bauska asked sleepy krasta said around a yawn very sleepy she gave the yawn full rein funnyi didnt get to bed all that late last night or the night before either she yawned again if she wanted to go back to bed who would stop her but her maidservant annoyingly persisted how are you feeling today bauskas question had a certain eager avidity to it no matter how tired krasta felt she noticed that i already told you she snapped why dont you go away and leave me alone aye milady shall i bring you some tea to help you wake up the serving woman asked no krasta shuddered the cup i had yesterday tasted most shockingly bad i know theres a war but the blenders will simply have to do better than that or they shall hear from me aye milady of course milady bauskas nod was obsequiousness itselfor so krasta thought till her maidservant asked the next question when the baby comes do you hope for a boy or a girl milady krastas jaw fell open all at once she wasnt sleepy any more shed just begun admitting that possibility to herself and she still didnt care to think of it as more than a possibility how did you know she blurted milady i handle your clothes bauska said patiently as if to a foolish child do you think i dont notice what happensand what doesnt oh krasta couldnt remember the last time shed spoken to bauska in such a small voice she hated the feeling that bauska had the advantage of her but couldnt very well escape it her maidservant went on does colonel lurcanio know yet of course not krasta exclaimed bauska raised an eyebrow and said nothing krastas face heated she hated the idea that other people knew more about her life than she wanted them to or than she thought they did but then still unusually subdued she changed her answer i dont think so bauskas nod was businesslike im sure hell look after you and the baby very well she said as long as hes in priekule krasta glared at her for that addition bauskas captain mosco had been very attentive to hertill he got sent to unkerlant not long before her little bastard was born from that day on bauska had never heard a word from him im sure he will too krasta did her best to sound sure it wasnt so easy as she wished it were conceiving by her algarvian lover would prove inconvenient any which way she was already sure of that what she wasnt altogether sure of and what could prove worse than inconvenient was whether shed conceived by lurcanio or by viscount valnu shed thoroughly enjoyed her infidelity and hadnt worried in the least about consequences but if she had a consequence growing somewhere behind her navelshe was vague about such details although she supposed she wouldnt be able to stay vague much longerthat could end up complicating her life more than she wanted what would lurcanio do if she bore a child who looked nothing like him nothing like any algarvian it was a mild spring morning but krasta shivered anyhow she didnt want to think about that to keep from thinking about it she said im going down to breakfast and to keep bauska from nattering at her any more she chose a tunic and trousers without any help from her maidservant bauska seemed content to stand back and let krasta do things for herself of course she does the lazy slut krasta thought if i do the work it means she doesnt have to when she got down to the breakfast table lurcanio was already there he sat sipping tea nibbling on a roll he kept dipping in honey and reading a news sheet written in algarviankrasta couldnt make out a word of it punctilious as usual he got to his feet and bowed how are you my sweet he asked still sleepy krasta answered yawning yet again she sat down and accepted a cup of tea from the hovering servitor even if it didnt taste good to her it would help her wake up what else would you care for milady the fellow asked something that will stick to my ribs krasta answered valmierans ate more heartily than algarvians were in the habit of doing a ham and cheese and mushroom omelette i think she nodded aye that will do splendidly just as you say bowing the servant took krastas request back to the kitchen is the news good she asked lurcanio pointing to the sheet she couldnt read ive seen it better he answered but on the other hand ive also seen it worse these days one takes what one can get krasta could hardly disagree with that shed taken what she could get and had got more than shed bargained for thinking of captain mosco and his journey to unkerlantdid he even remain alive these days or had he given everything he could give for king mezentioshe asked how does the war against king swemmel go lurcanio shrugged largely quiet right now the good news is that we arent losing any ground the bad is wondering why its quiet and what the unkerlanters are building up for and what youre building up for yourselvesyou algarvians i mean krasta said of course lurcanio seemed a little taken aback at the suggestion but he nodded then he said here comes your breakfast how you valmierans can eat such things day after day and not turn round as balls is beyond me but you do seem to manage i must admit he dipped his roll in the honey and took a small deliberate bite krasta was not in the mood to be deliberate especially since the tea hadnt tasted right despite more sugar than usual no matter what the dealer says the blend is off she thought its on account of the war everything is on account of the war without the war lurcanio wouldnt have shared a breakfast table with her that was certain he wouldnt have shared a bed with her either and certain other consequences might not have ensued not caring to dwell on that krasta attacked the buttery omelette she gobbled down three or four bites before she paused to listen to what her body was telling her she gulped spit flooded into her mouth the room seemed to spin are you all right my dear lurcanio asked you look a little green im fine krasta said more cautiously than she had before she ate another couple of bites of egg and ham and cheese that was a mistake she knew it was a mistake as soon as she finishedwhich was a bit too late she gulped again this time it didnt help excuse me she said in a muffled voice and bolted from the table she got where she was going barely in time to keep from making the disaster worse when she returned to the table her mouth still burned and tasted nasty in spite of her having rinsed it again and again she looked at the omelette and shuddered she wouldnt have one again any time soon colonel lurcanio gave her another bow are you all right he asked again this time with more concern in his voice krasta managed a wan nod lurcanio waved to the servant bring your lady some plain bread the man hurried off to obey lurcanios gaze swung back to krasta i take it this does mean you will be having a child aye she said dully and then you dont sound surprised im not he answered not after i noted the way the veins stand out so much more than usual in your breasts the other night did you krasta saidafter letting out a small indignant squeak everyone around her paid more attention than she did she hadnt noticed any changes in her breasts except that they were more tender than usual i did indeed lurcanio raised an eyebrow he waited for the servant to give krasta the bread and depart then said tell meis it mine of course it is krasta said indignantly doing her best not to show the alarm that blazed through her taking a wary bite of bread helped she gulped again as she swallowed but the bread unlike the omelette seemed willing to stay down whose else could it be she added in tones suggesting the only possible answer was no one that scrawny viscount we should have executed comes to mind lurcanio smiled at krasta she wished he hadnt the curve of his lips reminded him how little luck shed ever had trying to outmaneuver him nonsense she said i never did im only off by one she thought thats hardly worth noticing trueunder most circumstances here though the difference between never and only once might prove all too noticeable lurcanio sipped his tea it evidently tasted fine to him he shrugged an elaborate ever so algarvian shrug and made a steeple of his fingertips i am a patient man he said i am willing to give you the benefit of the doubt for nine months i am willing to give you the benefit of the doubt after that i will know one way or the other if the baby bears some passing resemblance to me well and good if not milady you will be sorry i am not one who appreciates a cuckoos egg being raised in his nest do i make myself clear unpleasantly so krasta said most unpleasantly so in fact she ate more bread sure enough it sat quiet in her stomach that made it easier for her to sound like her usual haughty self as she went on i assure you i have told you the truth some of iti hope if you are going to be boring about this business lurcanio threw back his head and laughed guffawed in fact not at all milady by no means to krastas amazement he sounded as if he meant it i told you i would give you the benefit of the doubt and so i shall if i say even a word to you between now and the day you may bring me up as sharply as you like ill remember that krasta said ill hold you to it too fair enough colonel lurcanio nodded but you must also remember the rest of what i said because i am going to hold you to that and i think i shall give you one more thing to remember which is krasta did her best to keep on sounding haughty the alternative was sounding frightened which would not do at all the algarvian officer pointed at her aiming his right forefinger as he might have aimed a stick nothing is to happen to the child until such time as we are able to know what needs to be known if anything should happen before that time i shall make all the assumptions you least wish me to make and i shall act on them is that plain milady curse you lurcanio krasta thought what hed just forbidden would have been the most convenient arrangement all the way aroundexcept that hed just forbidden it aye she said coldly and will you let your wife know youve sired a brand new bastard i may lurcanio replied if it turns out i have and now if you will excuse me i have work to do he rose bowed once more and departed krasta quietly cursed him again this time for being so invulnerable so impenetrable a moment later she started to giggle if only id been impenetrable myself i wouldnt have anything to worry about then she wanted to call lurcanio back so she could tell him the joke even as things stood he would have laughed she was sure of it but she sat where she was and didnt say a word kolthoum looked at hajjaj and slowly shook her head with a sigh she said you really are going to have to do something about this impossible situation you know of course i am the zuwayzi foreign minister agreed but i have no idea what i am most open to suggestions he hoped his senior wife would have some he and kolthoum had been together for half a century he told anyone who would listen that she was wiser than he few zuwayzin seemed to want to hear that as happened so often the truth made people nervous they dealt with him so they wanted to think he had all the answers as i see it kolthoum said you have four choices really hajjaj said his surprise altogether genuine try as i would i could find only three tell me my dear by all means tell me now you truly have my interest his wife laughed her body shook shed never been a famous beauty and shed put on flesh over the years hajjaj didnt care hed never cared she understood him perfectly he couldnt say that about anyone else in the world she began to tick off points on her fingers first you could send tassi back to minister iskakis that would make him stop screaming at everyone from king shazli down to the zuwayzin who walk past the yaninan ministry well so it would hajjaj said it would also probably be dangerous for tassi she didnt show up on my doorstepshe didnt show up naked on my doorstepbecause she was madly in love with iskakis you know that as well as i do she was just a bauble to him and how will he use her now that shes offended him by running off and showing the world a side he wanted hidden away every word of that is true kolthoum said which brings me to the next possibilitysending her to marquis balastro he would take good care of her for a whiletill he got bored hajjaj said kolthoum laughed though neither of them thought it was funny but he and tassi have already quarreled and if he flaunts her to infuriate iskakisand he will being an algarvianhell just make things between algarve and yanina worse than they are already theyre both supposed to be our allies you know i cant think of anything yanina can do to hurt our kingdom but i can think of plenty of things king tsavellas might do to hurt algarve would tsavellas do them his senior wife asked in the war against unkerlant anything that hurts algarve hurts yanina too when yaninans go after revenge theyre even worse than we are hajjaj said they dont care what happens to them as long as something worse happens to their foes that does make things harder kolthoum admitted and you are rightbalastro wouldnt keep her next choice is to bestow her on some zuwayzi noble then wouldnt you say i might do that ive been trying to do that hajjaj replied but there are only so many nobles who might be interested in a foreign woman and its not obvious that tassi would be interested in any of them which leaves as far as i can see nothing no kolthoum looked amused you could just keep her here you know for your own pleasure shes young and pretty and you havent had a woman like that since you sent lalla back to her clanfather do you know i havent thought about that in any serious way hajjaj said slowly he looked down at his hands at the dry wrinkled skin and prominent veins and if my not having thought about it seriously doesnt prove ive got old i dont know what would youre not so old as all that kolthoum said hajjaj smiled youre sweet to say so my dear the two of them hadnt bedded each other in something close to a yearbut then they needed less physical reminding of what they shared than they had when they were younger he went on things do still work occasionally well then kolthoum said as if everything were all settled but hajjaj shook his head its not so simple you know where i might see tassi as my reward shes more likely to see me as her punishment no his senior wife shook her head too not when she came here to your house and showed herself off to you without her clothes i know what that means for people who arent zuwayzin hajjaj grunted the same thought had crossed his mind when he saw the young yanina woman naked tassi hadnt done anything to discourage it either on the contrary were he younger himself he supposedno he knewhe would have done more to explore her halfpromises as things were as things were he shook his head again and said i dont think im in urgent need of a pet even one of the twolegged sort besides i would feel as if i was taking advantage of her as if you were kolthoum corrected as if i was hajjaj repeated i dont think the condition would be contrary to fact and so it doesnt need the subjunctive he grinned at kolthoum not even qutuz his secretary quibbled with him over grammar she grinned back unabashed and stuck out her tongue at him as if she were a cheeky young girl herself you dont know whether the condition is contrary to fact or not because you havent bothered finding out she said truei havent he said and doesnt that tell you something all by itself it tells me you are an oldfashioned gentleman kolthoum answered which is nothing i havent known for a good many years but if you are going to make choices for this woman dont you think you ought to know what she wants for herself now i know why you let me win the grammatical arguments hajjaj said kolthoum made a small questioning noise he explained so i wont feel too disappointed when you win the ones that matter his senior wife hid her face in her hands my secrets out what shall i do she asked her voice muffled behind her palms slipping an arm around her shoulder hajjaj said when we have this between us why do i need a young woman a stranger why kolthoum reached out and gently stroked him between the legs thats why there you see i already have a shameless woman too hajjaj kissed her more than a little to his own surprise he found himself rising to the occasion he and kolthoum made love slowly lazily somehow the lack of urgency the lack of fuss added to his enjoymentand he hoped hersrather than taking away from it afterwards he said i didnt expect that to happen neither did i kolthoum wagged a forefinger in front of his nose but youre not going to use it as an excuse to keep from asking tassi what she wants aye my dear hajjaj answered under the circumstances he could hardly say no having made the promise he had to keep it a couple of days later he asked tewfik to bring tassi into his study the majordomo nodded just as you say your excellency his wrinkled jowly face gave no hint of what he thought he shuffled off and returned a few minutes later with minister iskakis runaway wife good day your excellency she said in her careful algarvian dipping her head to hajjaj she was still bare and still seemed barer than any zuwayzi would havebut then she would also have seemed out of place in his house had she chosen to wear clothes and a good day to you hajjaj replied in the same language sit down make yourself comfortable would you care for tea and wine and cakes when she dipped her head in yaninanstyle agreement hajjaj nodded to tewfik who waited in the doorway the majordomo left and returned with a silver tray bearing the essentials of zuwayzi hospitality while tassi and hajjaj ate and drank they stuck to small talk he wondered if she knew the social rules of his kingdom he had from time to time used them to annoy foreigners now she seemed as content with delay as he was but at last he could avoid things no longer tell me he said what am i to do with you whatever suits your kingdom best of course tassi answered that is the way of such things is it not so she spoke with a curious bitter resignation hajjaj shook his head not necessarily not entirely if i thought only about what suited my kingdom best i would have sent you back to your husband at once do you doubt it even for an instant no she said in a small voice all right then hajjaj said we understand each other at least so far if you had your choice what would you do blaze my father when he made the match with iskakis tassi replied without hesitation he could not have done worse if he tried for a hundred years you cannot do anything about that now of the things you can do what would you do i have no good answers for you tassi said and hajjaj nodded he hadnt expected her to have any good answers she went on if you are willing to let me stay here i would like to do that no one bothers me here until now i have never been in a place where no one bothers me well hajjaj thought with wry amusement this is hardly the time to ask if she wants to keep my bed warm not even kolthoum could argue with me about that not after what she just said even so his eyes traveled the length of her maybe it was the way her nipples and the hair between her legs stood out against her light skin that made her seem more naked than a zuwayzi woman would have that was the closest hed come to an explanation that made sense anyhow she mistook his silence for one of a rather different sort or perhaps it wasnt so different after all as she had when she dropped to her knees in the doorway she said i would do anything to be able to stay here anything you might ask me that could mean only one thing hajjaj said if i took you up on that you would not be able to say that no one here bothered you i do not think it would be much of a bother tassi said and what is that supposed to mean hajjaj wondered that she wouldnt mind doing whatever he wanted or that she didnt think he would want anything very often he didnt ask the question not asking was better when he didnt really want to know the answer instead he said you are welcome to stay here for as long as you like but i do not think you can make this your true home you are a young woman one day very likely you will want to start a family of your own and you will need to meet a man whose family is of a rank to match yours tassi tossed her head so vigorously her dark curls flew yaninans used that gesture when they meant no she said bloodlines are splendidin a horse or a unicorn a zuwayzi would have spoken of camels but iskakis has some of the best blood in yanina and how much joy did my marriage to him bring me iskakis also has some special tastes hajjaj pointed out as delicately as he could i know she grimaced he tried them with me a few times they hurt if you must know but even so i did not much interest him that way then he was a fool but hajjaj did not say that aloud tassi was too likely to judge he wanted pleasure from her body and he knew he might though taking it seemed more trouble than it was worth you may stay here unbotheredfor as long as you like was what he did end up saying thank you tassi said softly you are welcome hajjaj replied and you may take that however you like the leyline ship slid to a halt since it wasnt moving any more it settled down into the water instead of gliding above all but the worst of the waves well were here istvan said wherever here is and whatever the kuusamans are going to do with us now they dont dare treat us too badly kun said gyongyos has plenty of kuusaman captives and our people can take revenge on them they havent done anything too horrible yet szonyi said theyve given us plenty of food even if it is accursed fish all the time if i eat any more fish ill grow fins captain frigyes said they are islanders they eat fish themselves they give us the same rations they give their own warriors that is honorable no matter how honorable it was istvans company commander had been sunk in gloom ever since the kuusamans captured him on becsehely hed been ready to lay down his life to power the sorcery that would help drive the enemy off the island hed been ready aye but he hadnt got the chanceand becsehely had fallen as so many other islands in the bothnian ocean had fallen to kuusamo we did all we could captain istvan said not for the first time the stars will still shine on us we didnt do anything to make them want to withhold their light we failed frigyes said we should have held becsehely and we failed too many kuusaman ships kun said reasonable and logical as usual too many kuusaman dragons too many kuusaman soldiers once they got ashore sir how could we hope to hold the island with our lifes blood frigyes answered but we had no chance to give it he held his head in his hands not bothering to hide his misery the iron door to the compartment housing the captives came open with a nasty squeal of hingeseven a lubber like istvan could tell this ship had seen better years a couple of kuusaman troopers aimed sticks at the gyongyosians to come out one of them said speaking istvans language very badly to go off this ship to movenow the last word held the snap of command one by one istvan and his countrymen got to their feet and filed out of the compartment and into the corridor beyond the kuusamans stepped back if anyone thought of seizing a stick and raising a revolt he never got the chance istvan didnt even think of it he walked along the corridor and up the narrow iron stairway to the deck of the transport it was the first time hed seen the sky since going aboard the ship after becsehely fell then he saw the skylineand started to laugh a kuusaman guard on deck swung his stick toward him why you to laugh the little slanteyed fellow asked by his tone no captive had any business laughing istvan didnt care why because this is obuda thats why he answered he knew the shape of mount sorongnot much of a mountain by his standards but still a peak of sortsas well as he knew the shape of his own foot i fought here i didnt expect to see the place again ill tell you that you soldier here the guard said and istvan nodded the guard shrugged soldier no more now you to be captive here kun said this harbor wasnt here when we were fighting on obuda istvan nodded since the island fell the kuusamans had run up an enormous number of piersand all of them looked to have ships tied up at them gyongyos and kuusamo had fought over obuda not least because several ley lines converged there making it important for one navy or the other to hold the place the kuusamans werent just holding it these daystheyd taken it and made it their own they couldnt have got this much work out of the obudans istvan said as the guards marched him and his comrades toward the gangplank there werent that many of them and theyre lazy buggers anyhow he never had thought much of the islanders they didnt even bother kun said positively most of this port was hammered together by sorcery how can you tell istvan asked because all the piers and all the pilings are just alike kun answered that means they used the law of similarity a lotit cant mean anything else he scowled i wish we could afford to throw magecraft around like this wed stand a lot better chance in the fight ill tell you under the sticks of the kuusaman guards the captives marched off the pier and onto the beach of obuda more kuusamans waited for them there one of the little men turned out to speak pretty good gyongyosian i am colonel eino he said i am the commandant of the captives camp here i want you to understand what that means what that means is that as far as you are concerned i am the stars above if anything good happens to you it will happen because of me and because of whatever you have done to please me and if anything bad happens to you it will also happen because of me and because of whatever you have done to make me angry do not make me angry you will be very sorry if you do blasphemous goateating son of a whore istvan muttered the captives around himeven kun that hardboiled city mannodded colonel eino might know the gyongyosian language but he didnt know gyongyosians istvans close comrades werent the only ones to be appalled more mutters rose from other soldiers captured on becsehelyseveral hundred of them had filed off the transport some of them shouted instead of muttering those shouts bothered eino not at all i care nothing for what you think of me he said i care only that you obey me when the war is overwhen we have won ityou will go back to gyongyos again until then you belong to kuusamo remember that he turned his back ignoring the new shouts that rose from the captives the kuusaman guards didnt speak so much gyongyosian of course they didnt need to either they shouted to marchand march the captives did somewhere not far from here we beat these buggers back from the beaches istvan heaved a sigh but theyre like roaches seems like stomp em once and they just come back again hed expected to have to march all the way to the captives camp wherever on the island it turned out to be he looked toward the forest that grew almost down to the beach parts of it were still battered from the fight his countrymen had put up before the kuusamans finally seized obuda his own memories of that losing campaign were of hunger and fog and fear to his surprise though the guards marched his comrades and him only as far as what proved to be a leyline caravan depot in to go in the kuusamans commanded into the caravan cars went the gyongyosians kun kept shaking his head as he had at the harbor this is plainly the extension of the ley line the ship that brought us from becsehely used he said though no such thing was plain to istvan the kuusamans use every bit of sorcerous energy they can we dont no wonder the war isnt going the way we wish it would silence there captain frigyes said sharply ill hear no talk of defeatism have you got that corporal aye captain kun answered the only thing he could sayout loud at any rate to istvan he murmured no defeatism is it how does he think we got here have we invaded obuda again we got caught but that doesnt mean weve got to give up istvan said his own attitude lay somewhere between kun s and frigyes obviously gyongyos had lost the fight for becsehely and the whole war in the bothnian ocean was going kuusamos way even so if we let the slanteyes think well do whatever they say theyll end up owning us do you know what i mean kun just grunted whether that meant he agreed or he didnt think the remark worth wasting words on istvan couldnt have said the ley line went through the forest straight as the beam from a stick it passed by a couple of little obudan villages the natives hardly looked up from their fields to watch it go past before the derlavaian kingdoms came to their islands theyd lived a simple life they hadnt known metalworking or much magecraft past exploiting obvious power points or how to tame the wild dragons that flew from one island to another and preyed on men and flocks alike by now theyd grown so accustomed to the marvels of modern civilization they took them for granted when at last the leyline caravan stopped it had climbed halfway up the slope of mount sorong istvan thought they were somewhere near the town of sorong the largest native settlement he wondered how much of sorong was left these days then he shrugged the obudans hadnt been strong enough to hold gyongyos or kuusamo away from their island whatever happened to them they deserved it out to go out shouted the guards on the caravan cars out istvan went there straight ahead stood the captives camp behind a palisade with nails sticking out of the timbers like hedgehog spines to make them all but impossible to climb istvan looked around and started to laugh again what to be funny a guard demanded this used to be my regiments encampment istvan answered the kuusaman nodded to show he understood then shrugged to show he wasnt much impressed after a moment istvan wasnt much impressed either the gyongyosians hadnt been strong enough to hold kuusamo away from obuda didnt that mean they deserved whatever happened to them that was a chilly thought with which to enter the captives camp some of the gyongyosian barracks still stood the guards took istvan and his comrades to a newer less weathered building he turned out to have a better cot and more space as a captive of the kuusamans than hed had as a gyongyosian soldier on obuda he didnt know what that said about the relative strength of the two warring kingdoms nothing good probably not from a gyongyosian point of view i wish to speak to colonel eino frigyes told a guard the kuusaman went off to see if the camp commandant cared to speak with a captive captain to istvans surprise eino came to the barracks what do you want he asked whatever it is it had better be important it is frigyes said i want your word of honor as an officer that you do not abuse us by feeding us the filthy forbidden flesh of goats we are in your power i hope you are not so vile as to make us either starve or become ritually unclean alarm blazed through istvan he glanced at kun and szonyi they looked alarmed too the scar on his hand seemed to throb his gaze swung back to colonel eino the camp commandant laughed many of your people ask this i give you my word it does not happen he laughed again less pleasantly you may ask what is a kuusamans word worth off he went leaving appalled silence behind him colonel spinello was bored hed been a great many things since the war took him to unkerlantwounded hungry freezing terrifiedbut never bored never till now he yawned till his jaw creaked he felt like ordering another attack on pewsum just to give his menand himselfsomething to do no matter what he felt like he refrained he had no doubt whatever that his brigade was glad about the lull in the fighting it didnt break his heart either hed more than half expected king swemmel s men to have laid on an attack against waldsolms by now maybe the unkerlanters were enjoying the lull too if i want something to do i ought to get jadwigai into bed with me he thought not for the first time not for the first time he turned the thought aside tampering with the brigades luck would only be bad for his own he even believed that which made it easier for him to resist temptationbut not a great deal easier then a shout rang out that sent him springing to his feet field post the field posts here spinello hurried out of the unkerlanter hut where hed been brooding he hadnt even reached the unpaved street before turning into his usual jaunty self come on boys he called to the other soldiers also hurrying toward the wagon that brought letters from home time to find out how much your girlfriends are trying to squeeze out of you this time the men in the wagon started calling out names spinellos clerks took care of most of them sorting the envelopes and packages by regiment and company so they could go on up to the front every so often one of the clerks said hes wounded or hes dead or he got transferred six months ago anybody whos looking for him here is out of luck heres one for colonel spinello one of the field postmen called thats me spinello happily reached for it before giving it to him the fellow in the wagon held it under his nose perfumed he exclaimed which made all the algarvians in the muddy main street whoop and sigh and roll their eyes and pretend to swoon powers below eat every bloody one of you spinello said youre just jealous and you bloody well know it none of the soldiers argued with him they probably were jealous but not in a bad way any officer in the algarvian army who got a perfumed letter only saw his prestige riseit made his men think he was good at some of the things that made life worth living you going to read it to us colonel somebody called a chorus of baying whoops followed that suggestion read your own lettersif you know how to read spinello replied with dignity im going to enjoy this one myself it came from fronesia if the scent the same one she used herself hadnt been enough to tell him as much her flowing script would have he smiled hed had a splendid time with her back in trapani the sort of time that would have made his men whoop even more than they were already whooping if hed chosen to tell them about it before he tore the envelope open he glanced up and saw jadwigai peering out through one of the small windows in the peasant hut she used as her own she rarely come out onto the street when algarvians from outside the brigade could see her one more proof she knows what happens to most kaunians spinello thought something that hadnt occurred to him before he took out the letter from his mistress unfolded it and began to read the first part was all conventional enough fronesia missed him she hoped he was safe she hoped he got leave soon so she could see him she suggested several things she might do to make his leave more entertaining if he got it a couple of the things she suggested sounded entertaining enough to make him want to head back toward trapani whether he had leave or not and then three or four paragraphs into the letter fronesia got down to business someone has been ungenerous enough to slander or libel me to colonel sabrino and he in his ingratitude has seen fit to cut off the allowance he used to give me while i know i can rely on your kindness i wonder if you might be sweet enough to send me just a little more than usual over the next couple of months to help me wean myself away from sabrino for ever and always i promise you dear that i will show you just exactly how glad i am to have finally fallen into the arms of a true man not a coldhearted calculator who holds the least little thing against me spinello read that several times no matter how many times he read it it always added up to the same thing why you little tramp he said half annoyed half admiring squeeze indeed he thought mistresses of course were and had to be mercenary they had custom on their side but the law had never heard of them fronesia though managed to turn greed into something uncommonly like art to how many other officers was she sending similarly artful letters in peacetime having multiple protectors was almost impossibly difficult for a mistress but the war made it easy what were the odds that two friends would come into trapani wanting to see a woman at the same time slim no doubt about it a canny woman or a grasping one could do very well for herself he had no proof only the tone of the letter in his own prewar days though hed studied the kaunian classics which left him uncommonly sensitive to tone if fronesia didnt have more than one protector it wasnt solely because of love for him he was sure very sure of that instead of crumpling up the letter and tossing it into the mud he took it back to his hut he kept his head up and his stride brisk he wouldnt let the men see that fronesia had written anything to upset him when he got inside though he tossed the letter on the embers of the fire those were plenty to make it char and crackle and flare and burn for a moment he smelled or imagined he smelled scorched perfume then the sharp odor of burning paper overwhelmed it and then that too was lost in the usual smoky stink of the hearth he sat down at a folding tablealgarvian army issue unkerlanter peasant huts didnt boast such amenitiesinked a pen and began his reply halfway through the first paragraph he set down the pen shaking his head if he wrote while angry he would regret the letter as soon as he posted it fronesia didnt need to hear from him right away if she didnt hear from him right away she might worry a little that wouldnt be so bad after a bit the fieldpost wagon rattled off to deliver letters and packages to some other brigade half noticing the noise spinello nodded to himself the military postmen were good solid fellows even footsoldiers respected them they carried sticks when they got near the front and they knew what to do with them too someone knocked on the door colonel spinello started he wished one of his regimental commanders would have picked a different time to bother him he also sniffed a couple of times before going to the door no he couldnt smell the perfume from fronesias letter that was something anyhow but when he opened the door no grimy poorly shaved algarvian officer stood there jadwigai did oh spinello said in surprise he managed a bow come in milady what can i do for you he intended to leave the door to the hut open so the men in the brigade could see he was up to nothing nefarious with their mascot jadwigai though closed it after herself as she walked in are you all right colonel she asked in that disconcertingly fluent algarvian of hers why shouldnt i be spinello asked in return more surprised than ever when the field post came i saw you didnt like the letter you got the kaunian girl answered i was afraid it might be bad news from your family this is a very large war if it hadnt been a very large war a kaunian girl from forthweg would never have found herself in the wilds of northern unkerlant but that wasnt what jadwigai had meant touched spinello said no no its nothing like that really she didnt sound as if she believed him maybe shed heard other algarvian officers making light of losses but very firmly spinello said really my father and uncles are too old to fight my brother and my cousins are all fine so far as i know so are my aunts and my sister for that matter all right jadwigai saidactually the soldiers expression she used had a literal meaning a lot more pungent than that im glad even so though you cant tell me that letter made you happy no it didnt spinello admitted the kaunian girls face bore an itoldyouso expression hoping to cure her of it he went on if you really must know what the trouble is my mistress back in algarve is trying to squeeze more money out of me oh she turned red for a moment he thought it was embarrassment then he realized it was outrage the nerve of her doing something like that when youre out here where youre liable to get killed that did cross my mind aye spinello said of course from fronesias point of view my being out here only makes me a poor longterm investment jadwigai said something inflammatory in algarvianshed learned it from soldiers sure enough then she said something even more inflammatory in classical kaunian it was the first time spinello had heard her use her birthspeech he answered in classical kaunian himself letting such small things pierce one to the heart merely burdens the spirit to no purpose jadwigai looked astonished i didnt think you knew my language not when she didnt go on she didnt need to go on she had to know what happened at the camps the algarvians politely termed special sure enough spinello grimaced how was he supposed to respond to that at last after some thought he said a kingdom will do what it thinks it has to do to win to survive afterwards maybe it will look back and count the cost of what it did to his surprise and more than a little to his relief jadwigai nodded or if it wins it wont bother to count the cost at all that jerked a nod from spinello the kaunian girl went on its the same for people you know you do what you have to do first and then you count the cost later he nodded again any soldier whos ever been blazed at will say the same thing not just soldiers jadwigai stepped up to him and put her hands on his shoulders she was if anything an inch or two taller than he you can have me if you want me you know and youll count the cost later he asked quite seriously she nodded of course if there is a later sleeping with you would improve my chances of having a later spinello had had no compunctions whatever about making vanai bribe him with her body to keep her miserable grandfather alive he hesitated now and wondered why the answer wasnt long in coming not least because hed seen so much more soldiering than he had when he was stationed in oyngestun gently he kissed her she stiffened in his arms that had excited him with vanai here it just left him sad he said im afraid youre not my petyoure the brigades pet she stared at him then started to cry stop that he exclaimed and he wasnt acting at all if the soldiers think ive done something to you that you didnt want im a dead man too late he realized hed just handed her a weapon but she didnt seem interested in using it thank you she said oh thank you for what for being a fool he said and was relieved again when that made her laugh she was still smiling when she left the hut later he thought standing there all alone you count the cost later skarnu turned to palasta if we go much farther we fall off the edge of the world he said the young mage smiled at him she looked as if a strong breeze would blow her away here at the southeasternmost reach of valmiera there were plenty of strong breezes most of them off the strait of valmiera that separated the derlavaian mainland from the great island holding lagoas and kuusamo the wind didnt stagger her but it did blow her long blond hair into a mares nest of tangles brushing a strand that escaped her flat knitted wool hat back from her eyes she said back in the days of the kaunian empire they really thought they would i suppose so sis he said which made palasta smile again theyd decided to travel as brother and sister he would have had to have started very young to claim her as a daughter he wished she were his sisterhe vastly preferred her to the one he really had palasta would never have given herself to the algarvians not for anything she said if we go to the top of that little hill thereshe pointedwe might be able to see something interesting maybe skarnu said up to the top of the hill they went the path was muddy skarnu almost slipped once they did get to the top he shaded his eyes with the palm of his hand and peered south and east toward the beach where the algarvians had murdered their kaunian captives to assail the kuusamans and where somethingno one on this side of the strait of valmiera seemed to know whathad gone wrong for the redheads even shading his eyes against the wan southern sun he couldnt see as much as he would have liked i wish i had a spyglass he muttered not safe palasta said and he could hardly disagree shaggy green fields rich and lush stretched down toward the sea a circle of tall crudely shaped stones stood in one of those a few hundred yards away a monument a thousand years older than the kaunian empire maybe more lichen scrawled red and yellowgreen patterns up the sides of the stones palasta pointed toward the monument thats a power point even all those years ago they knew about such things whoever they were skarnu said that was another riddle archaeological mages still labored to unravel some of them at least had not been of kaunian stock that much seemed plain even nowadays a few folk here showed signs of blood more like that of the kuusamans than of valmieras kaunian majority southeasterners had a way of staying on their land skarnu hadnt seen many before coming to this part of the kingdom dark hair slanted eyes and high cheekbones showed up often enough to disconcert him they were certainly more common than hed thought between him and palasta and the monument a woman drove a couple of goats toward a farmhouse she was a kaunian her yellow hair peeped out from under the white lace cap she wore but that cap set her apart from most valmierans every tiny district here in the southeast had its own particular style each striving to be more ornate than its neighbors the goats were of a peculiar breed tooshaggier than the ones hed known around pavilosta and with thicker more twisted horns but he couldnt keep eyeing the local landscape forever even if he wanted to his eyes rose to the gray beach and the graygreen rockstudded sea beyond and to what had been the camp where the algarvians housed their kaunian captives before killing them to capture their life energy some of the fences that had surrounded the camp still stood others were flat or had been hurled some distance away by the force of the magic that had come back from kuusamo as far as he could see at this distance none of the buildings inside the perimeter still stood neither those that had housed the redheads nor those where their victims had dwelt what do you see he asked palasta the young mage was the one whod needed to make this journey skarnu was along because hed been fighting for a long time to keep mezentios men from massacring kaunians from forthweg and because sending a girl on her owneven a girl who was also a magehad risks the underground hadnt felt like facing power she answered absently great power the kind the algarvians get from killing skarnu asked oh that too palasta said though she sounded as if she needed to be reminded of it aye that too but something else something brighter cleaner she frowned groping for the word she wanted can you tell what it is palasta shook her head its nothing ive run into before i dont think its anything anybody ever ran into before she seemed very certain skarnu studied not the camp where the kaunians from forthweg had been but palasta she couldnt have been more than sixteen how could she know about what trained mages had run into over the years over the centuries over the millennia those lichensplashed standing stones made skarnu think in longer stretches of time than he might have otherwise carefullyhe didnt want to offend herhe asked how can you be sure of that suppose youve eaten beef and pork and mutton and chicken palasta said if someone serves you fresh oysters will you be sure youve never had them before aye skarnu nodded but i wont be sure no ones eaten them in all the history of the world ah i see what youre saying palasta looked at him as if he were a bright pupil in primary school absurdly that affectionate forgiving glance made him proud not angry the young mage said i know what i know what i know is based on what all the sorcerers before me have known all the way back to the people who raised those stones whoever they were they were on her mind too she went on i can tell whats new and what isnt whatever did thatshe pointed to the ruined campis something new all right and i see what youre saying too now skarnu believed her she sounded as sure about what she knew and what she didnt as sergeant raunu ever had as it had with the veteran underofficer her conviction carried weight with skarnu he asked do you want to get closer if we can do you think it would do any good id like to try palasta answered i dont see any algarvians around there right now or sense any of their wizards either if we spot soldiers when we come up to the camp we can always walk off in some other direction fair enough skarnu started down the slope that led to the camp palasta stayed at his side after a few steps she said we may not need to do this after all now that i think about it the answers im looking for are probably on the other side of the strait of valmiera so if you want to go back skarnu kept walking lets try it weve come all this waytytuvenai yanked me away from my wife and sonto try to find out what happened here and whether we can use it against the redheads too it would be a shame to stop half a mile short if we do stop half a mile short ill wring tytuvenais neck the next time i see him that makes good sense palasta sent him a speculative look you seem to have a very logical mind why didnt you ever think about becoming a mage i dont know skarnu answered i never did thats all ive never seen any signs id have the talent for it either as a marquis of course hed never had to worry about making a living since his parents untimely death hed never had to worry about anything till he took command of his company when war broke out hed done that as well as he could and done a lot of other things since krasta nowkrasta hadnt worried about anything but shops and lovers her whole life long the corners of his mouth turned down as he thought about his sisters latest algarvian lover talent does count palasta said but only so much as may be skarnu said its too late for me to worry about it now palasta looked at him as if hed suddenly started speaking unkerlanter too late meant little to her a telling proof of how young she was more roughly than hed intended to skarnu continued come on lets see how close we can get you palasta didnt say anything as they walked on toward the ravaged camp she didnt have to watching her face was fascinating she either didnt know how to or else didnt bother with hiding anything she thought or felt she seemed to grow more astonished more interested more excited with every step they took she also grew more puzzled i dont know what they did she said i dont know how they did it but i dont think magecraft will ever be the same skarnu wanted to laugh at her she was much too young to speak with such selfassurance but she was also too selfassured for him to dwell too much on her youth shed shown him she knew what she was talking about what would she sense what would she learn if she could walk through the heart of the shattered camp he didnt get to find out about a quarter of a mile short of the camp an algarvian soldier popped out of a hole in the ground so well hidden by bushes that skarnu had no idea he was there till he emerged no going farther he said in accented valmieran forbidden military area by ordering of grand duke ivone ivone was the highestranking algarvian in valmiera as a man of the underground skarnu knew that would he have known it if he were as ordinary as he wanted to seem maybebut maybe not too he said my sister and me we just want to go on down to the beach to hunt for crabs he deliberately tried to sound none too bright the soldier shook his head not here forbidden you wanting crabs you going back to town finding wrong girlfriend he guffawed at his own wit try to bribe him skarnu wondered he decided against it more redheads were surely lurking around the camp plenty of good crabs on this beach he grumbled for the algarvians benefit lobsters too when the soldier shook his head again skarnu took palastas arm come on sis well find em somewheres else you leaving her with me you go looking the algarvian suggested that made skarnu retreat in a hurry the redhead had thrown out the notion in a casual way skarnu hustled palasta away from him before he decided she ought to be his because he was an occupier and he had a stick in his hands to skarnus relief she waited till theyd got out of earshot of the guard to ask can we sneak around to the camp some other way i doubt it he answered regretfully theyre bound to have more than one man keeping an eye on it if they send us away from it once that probably wont mean much to them if they catch us trying to get there once theyve told us no thats liable to be a different story he hesitated unless you think you really have to get inside if its that important ill do my best to get you past the guards you might have to use some of your magecraft too no palasta said after brief thought ive learned enoughand perhaps the biggest thing ive learned is how much i dont know she spoke in riddles but she sounded pleased doing it so skarnu supposed he should be pleased too and he was for his own reasons now he could go back to merkela and little gedominu eight not for the first time marshal rathar reflected on how glad he was to get out of cottbus to get away from the direct influence of king swemmel away from the capital he was his own man inside cottbus inside the palace he might have been fitted for strings at the wrists and ankles at the elbows and knees for he knew himself to be nothing more than the kings puppet even in getting away from cottbus though rathar followed swemmels will rather than his own he would sooner have gone back to the duchy of grelz to finish driving the algarvians from it but swemmel was convinced unkerlant had the battle in the south well enough in hand to entrust it to general vatran vatran was a capable commander he and rathar had worked well together down in the south for a couple of years still rathar wanted to finish what hed started as usual king swemmel cared nothing for what his subjects wanted hed sent rathar up to the north to a region where he hadnt laid his hand on the fighting and hed sent with him general gurmun whod proved himself the best commander of behemoths unkerlant had the two of them rode horses east toward pewsum a town the unkerlanters had taken back from algarve and then held in spite of counterattacks delivered with the redheads usual skill and ingenuity looking around at the devastation through which he rode rathar said nothing comes easy fighting mezentios men it never has by the time we drive them off a piece of ground its not worth having any more gurmun pondered that he was younger than ratharin his early fortieswith hard blunt features and cold cold eyes hed risen through the ranks despite or perhaps because of king swemmel s purges he said theyre tough aye but we can whip them weve done it before well do it again and every time we do whip them we leave them that much less to fight back with ten months ago his behemoths had stopped the algarvians last desperate push in the durrwangen bulge the push that might have torn the whole position open had it succeeded hundreds of the great beasts from both sides were left dead on the field unkerlant had been able to make good its losses the algarvian behemoth force hadnt been the same since the battles by durrwangen rathar said i just wonder how much of our kingdom will be standing by the time the war ends gurmun shrugged as long as some of its standing and theres nothing left of algarve that was also swemmels attitude rathar could hardly disagree with it in fact he didnt disagree with it but he did say the more we have left standing the better well of course gurmun said the better we keep our secrets the more well be able to manage there the redheads couldnt have been plainer about what they had in mind around durrwangen if theyd hung up a signwere going to attack here stupid buggers he spat in the muddy roadway his scorn made marshal rathar blink to rathar the algarvians were the touchstone of the military art hed spent the first couple of years of the war against them learning how they did what they did well enough to imitate it had he failed unkerlant would have gone under that gurmun could show contempt for the redheads proved hed succeeded it still disconcerted him though ropes dyed red warned soldiers and surviving locals away from a field by the side of the road rathar said one of these days well have to clear out all the eggs we and the algarvians have buried the red ropes said that field was sown with algarvian eggs a crater not far from the road said some luckless fellow had discovered at least one of them the hard way gurmun spat again it can wait right now we havent got the dowsers to spend clearing the buried eggs weve already passed weve hardly got enough dowsers to clear the ones that are still in front of the redheads i said one of these days rathar answered as far as gurmun was concerned the waste of having dowsers go up in bursts of sorcerous energy while clearing unimportant fields made that not worth doing as long as they died doing something important he didnt worry at all a lot of the younger officers the men whod lived their entire adult lives during king swemmel s reign thought the same way since swemmel thought that way too rathar knew he shouldnt have been surprised but every so often he still was if we had more dowsers gurmun went on i wouldnt have to run peasants across fields ahead of my behemoths the way ive done a couplethree times that doesnt always work as well as youd likesometimes the algarvian mages make their buried eggs sensitive to behemoths not people his horse walked on for a few paces before he added very much as an afterthought and its wasteful too so it is rathar had used such tactics himself he didnt know many unkerlanter generals who hadnt but he didnt take them for granted the way gurmun did with a sigh he went on i wonder if the kingdom will have any peasants at all left by the time this war finally ends it doesnt matter if we only have a few so long as algarve hasnt got any gurmun said once more aye those words might have come straight from king swemmel s lips at the outskirts of pewsum a sentry stepped into the roadway stick in hand and snapped this is a forward area show me your pass general gurmun undid the top couple of buttons on his rockgray greatcoat so that the generals stars on his collar tabs showed are these pass enough the sentry deflated like a pricked pigs bladder he lorded it over those beneath him and groveled to those above such was life in unkerlant aye sir he muttered and got out of the way in a hurry powers above help the next couple of common soldiers he lands on rathar remarked as he and gurmun rode past gurmun laughed and nodded he was on top almost all the time so he found such things funny inside pewsum unkerlanter artisans and mages still labored to repair the leyline caravan depot before pulling out the algarvians had done their ingenious best to make sure their foes would get as little use from the town as possible and that best as usual proved quite good stinking redheads gurmun growled that depot had better not slow us down come the day if it does some of those worthless wizards will join these beauties here he pointed to a couple of corpses hanging from a gibbet in the market square theyd been hanging for some time by now they were more bone than meat and didnt stink too badly each was draped with a placard reading collaborator soldiers and civilians walked past them without so much as a glance they caught two gurmun said i wonder how many are still running loose a good many odds are rathar answered the inspectors will root them out general gurmun nodded as rathar had been sure he would swemmels inspectors were trained to sniff out treason whether it was there or not when it really was a soldier was reading a news sheet one prepared by the local army headquarters he started to wad it up and throw it away gurmun called here fellow let me have a look at that sure pal the trooper said agreeably his rockgray tunic had faded almost to white a scar seamed his cheek another his leg below the hem of the tunic more than any of that though his eyes marked him as a veteran they never stopped moving had the algarvians flown dragons over pewsum he would have known exactly where to dive for cover gurmun reined in to look at the news sheet rathar also stopped and leaned toward him so he could see some of it too gurmun read aloud in the north the strong defense the brave soldiers of unkerlant have shown under the glorious leadership of king swemmel against the savage algarvian invader has kept the enemy from making progress and has tied down his forces so that he cannot move men to the south to hold off our victorious thrusts there thats good rathar murmured thats very good general gurmun nodded ive seen worse here waittheres more constant vigilance is vital in these hard defensive struggles although we often fight with the odds against us our sacrifice ensures victory elsewhere always remember that a victory in the south is a victory for the whole kingdom someone should get a commendation for that marshal rathar said he called up the map in his head headquarters should beover there he pointed he and gurmun rode in the direction hed chosen his gift for turning map into terrain didnt let him down at the headquartersa battered building that had once been a greengrocersanother officious sentry tried to stop rathar and gurmun this time rathar was the one who flashed his collar tabs at the sight of the big stars he wore the sentry turned pale he couldnt step away as the one on the road had but he did his best to disappear in plain sight inside brigadier sigulf saluted an honor to make your acquaintance gentlemen he said youve done great things for the kingdom more needs doing gurmun said his voice flat almost hostile sigulf looked alarmed though he made a good game try at holding his face still he was some years younger even than gurmun except for vatran all our generals are years and years younger than i am rathar thought the war had killed some of his contemporaries king swemmel had killed many more he took the news sheet from gurmun and waved it this is a fine piece of work thanks lord marshal sigulf answered weve done our best to follow the directives we got from cottbus weve followed all the directives from cottbus as closely as we could that too was the unkerlanter way good gurmun said like sigulf he was steeped in the idea that orders should always be followed exactly rathar sometimes wondered one of the reasons the algarvians got better results with fewer men was that their officers thought for themselves and didnt feel paralyzed when they had no one above them telling them what to do but that was how they were trained rathar wished his commanders were better at seizing the initiative but that seemed beyond the mental horizon of most of them sigulf went on we are making sure we move only at night and our crystallomancers are sending more messages to regiments that arent in place than to ones that are it gets confusing sometimes but were doing our best those are important orders to follow rathar meant every word of it you can bet anything you care to name that the algarvians are stealing as many of our emanations as they can if your men are confused think what it must be like for the redheads aye sir brigadier sigulf said earnestly i do think about that i think about it all the time if it werent for confusing the redheads all this would be more trouble than it was worth dont say that general gurmun growled dont even think it youve been told what to do and youll bloody well do it if you dont feel like doing it there are plenty of penal companies that can always use one more stupid fool with a stick have you got that aye sir sigulf repeated this time with a distinct quaver in his voice he sent marshal rathar a look of appeal rathar stared back stonily gurmun was an ironarsed son of a whore no doubt about it but he got results in war that counted for more than anything else this is important brigadier rathar said if everything goes well it may prove as important as sulingen have you got that wideeyed sigulf nodded so did rathar good see that you do gurmuns right youd better not get in the way of this nothing and nobody will get in the way of this garivald kicked at the dirt he was worn and sweaty and filthy and more frustrated than hed ever been in his entire life its no good he said its just no cursed good weve done a lot obilot said she was every bit as tired and grimy as he was we can do more every day is longer than the one before planting time is always like this no garivald shook his head i dont care how much we do with hoes and spades and such well never get enough planted to bring in a crop we can live onnot all by ourselves we wont weve got to have a donkey or an ox to pull a plow that means going into a village obilot said going into a village means getting noticed and getting noticed means trouble for you its liable to mean trouble for me too youre higher up on the inspectors lists aye but whos to say im not on em with you after all i was fighting against the algarvians without taking orders from any of king swemmel s precious soldiers just the same as you were every word of that is true garivald said but none of it matters if were going to starve for sure then we have to take our chances with the villagers and with the inspectors powers below eat em all they might recognize us but they might not too and thats the gamble were stuck with he waited for her to tell him he was wrong and for her to tell him exactly how he was wrong theyd had this argument several times before obilot had always stayed dead set against stirring from this hut in the middle of nowhere now now with a long sigh she said maybe we do have to try i still wish we didnt for one thing we havent got much moneynot enough for an ox sure as sure well make some garivald said i was doing odd jobs in tolk before tantris curse him came sniffing around chopping wood mucking out barnstheres always work people would sooner pay somebody else to do than do inemselves and youre a fine hand with a needle i saw that in the wood where you had next to nothing to work with if you have decent cloth proper thread obilot sighed again all that helps aye but do you know what will help even more tell me now that garivald had talked her around or thought he had he was more than willing to yield on as many of the little details as he could obilot wasnt pleasant to be around when she was brooding about losing an argument remembering the names well be using she said garivald laughed but it wasnt really funny the less his own name was heard these days the better off he would be and the same was liable to be true for obilot as well without a doubt she was right about that they took such silver as they had and headed for linnich the nearest surviving village it was three or four hours away garivald discovered hed lost the knack for marching not like it was when wed go out of the woods to pay a call on some village that got too friendly with the redheads he remarked as he sat down on a stump to rest no not even close obilot sat down beside him she looked glad to take the weight off her feet too suddenly though she snapped her fingers in alarm the redheads weve still got some of false king raniero s money if we pass it she slashed a finger across her throat maybebut maybe not too garivald answered some people will still take it some people figure silver is silver aye we have to be careful i know i brought it along but ive got it wrapped in a rag so its not mixed in with swemmels money obilot pursed her lips then nodded garivald grinned he seldom got the chance to feel he was one step ahead of her and enjoyed it when he did like almost every peasant village in the duchy of grelz that garivald had seenand hed seen more villages than hed imagined he would back in zossen before the warlinnich was battered neither the unkerlanters nor the algarvians had dug in there or the village wouldnt hive still stood but craters showed where eggs had fallen and ruins or sudden empty places like missing teeth in a jaw marked what had been houses a lot of the peasants were already in the fields it was planting season for them too when garivald walked up to a fellow guiding a plow behind an ox the other peasant seemed glad enough to stop he shook his head though when garivald asked if anyone had a beast he might sell dont know about that stranger he said them as still has em left alive are mighty glad to be using em you hear what im saying i hear garivald answered stranger he would have used the word back in zossen then though he wouldnt have known how being on the wrong end of it burned he let coins jingle i can pay he didnt say he couldnt pay enough he wouldnt say anything like that till he had to like i say moneys not the only thing going on the other peasant told him then he snapped his fingers as if reminding himself of something dagulf s got a mule though hes been hiring it out and drinking up the money he makes maybe hed sell dagulf garivald echoed it wasnt an unusual name but he pointed at the peasant from linnich is this dagulf a short skinny fellow with sort of a sour smile and with a scar on his face aye the local nodded you know him never heard of him garivald said solemnly the other peasant stared scratched his head and at last decided it was a joke and laughed then he nodded so you know him do you hes some of the riffraff thats been coming through here ever since the war stirred things up that hed just in effect called garivald and obilot riffraff too never entered his mind garivald gave a mental shrug hed been called worse than that he said so dagulf drinks up his money does he would i find him in the tavern its a good bet the man from linnich flicked his oxs back with a long springy branch and started it down the furrow hed done all the talking he intended to do this dagulf is from your village obilot asked as she and garivald started off toward linnich itself thats right hes a friend of mine garivald checked himself he used to be a friend of mine anyway obilot thought about that then nodded do you want him to know youre still alive is it safe for him to know youre still alive before the war it would have been garivald answered before the war though he wouldnt have spent all his time in the tavern but he kept walking toward the village for one thing any unkerlanter man was likely to spend a good deal of time in a tavern for another it hes from your village hell know what happened to your family wont he obilot said maybe that thought had been uppermost in garivalds mind too almost apologetically he went on i do want to find out you know do you are you sure obilots voice was harsh her eyes bleak and far away sometimes youre better off not knowing believe me you are that was as much as she ever said about what had happened to her before she joined munderics band of irregulars i want to find out garivald repeated obilot only shrugged as if to say shed done her best to warn him by then they were walking into linnich eyes bright with suspicion women looked up at them from their vegetable plots dogs barked garivald stooped and picked up a stone ready to throw it in case any of the dogs did more than bark none did the whole scene achingly reminded him of zossen only the faces were different he had no trouble finding the tavern it stood by the village square and was one of the two biggest buildings in linnich the other being the smithy across the square from it the drunk passed out a few feet from the entrance was another strong clue garivald could have seen men drunk into a stupor in zossen too do you want me to go in and try to get the mule obilot asked once more that way he wouldnt have to see your face garivald shook his head no it will be all right obilot looked at him then shrugged and let him walk into the tavern ahead of her his eyes needed a moment to adjust to the gloom and to the smoky air not all the smoke from the hearth went up the chimney four or five men and a couple of women looked up from their mugs to give him and obilot a onceover sure enough one of them was dagulf garivald walked up to him hand outstretched you recall your old friend fariulf dont you he bore down heavily on the false name he was using he didnt want his real one blurted out for everybody to hear dagulf had never been a fool his eyes narrowed now but then he smiled and nodded fariulf by the powers above he exclaimed its been awhile i didnt know if you were alive or dead he pointed to obilot whos your friend she answered for herself im bringane bringane he repeated waving to the fellow behind the bar he called spirits for my friends here the tapman nodded and waved back dagulf eyed garivald i really thought you were dead what do you want as he sank down onto a stool by dagulf garivald answered somebody told me youve got a mule you hire out or that you might sell i could use one could you dagulf said ever since i got out of zossen that mules helped keep me alive you have a plow he took it for granted that garivald was working an abandoned farm somewhere no but i can slap something together garivald answered ive got enough iron to hammer something into a plowshare or i could have the smith here do a better job for me the woodwork is just woodwork i can handle that but i cant plant enough ground to get a decent crop without a mule or an ox i might hire him to you dagulf said i wont sell him i make more letting him out for a few days at a time he slid silver across the table to the taverner when the man brought mugs for garivald and obilot thanks garivald said and obilot nodded after sipping the fiery stuff garivald asked what did happen in zossen he phrased it no more directly than that but dagulf understood what he meant the redheads dug in thats what they had a few behemoths and maybe a companys worth of men and they made a stand i was lucky i was out chopping wood when our heroes hit em he sounded patriotic not sarcasticthat was the safe way to sound i had the mule along to haul the wood back but i got the blazes out of there instead from what i hear nothings left of the old village thats true ive seen it garivald gulped his spirits and then slammed a fist down on the table obilot set a hand on his shoulder he wanted to shake her off but he didnt scowling at dagulf he said curse it i was hoping you knew more sorry garfanuli dagulf said i dont think the news is good though garivald scowled again both at the slip and because he didnt think the news was good either unperturbed dagulf went on now do you want to hire the mule or not they haggled for a while garivald let obilot take most of the burden she was better at dickering than he was anyhow and his heart wasnt in the haggle to have his hopes of learning what had happened to his wife and children raised raised and then not fulfilled it was very hard indeed obilot got a bargain with dagulf garivald knew he should have been pleased but all he wanted to do was drink himself blind but that is not possible the kuusaman mage said in classical kaunian rather less fluent than fernaos plainly he wasnt so used to speaking the international language of sorcery and scholarship a practical mage out in the provinces wouldnt have to use it very often gathering himselfand perhaps also gathering the vocabulary he neededhe went on it violates every known law of magecraft six or eight other kuusaman wizards in the class of twenty nodded in solemn agreement most of the rest looked as if they agreed too even if they were too polite to say so a class full of lagoan mages hearing similar things would have been an argument a class full of algarvian mages hearing similar things would have been a riot fernao was glad thenmostly glad at any rateto be teaching stolid kuusamans smiling he said some of the laws now known are not the ones you learned when you were training since gray streaked the kuusamans hair he might well have trained back before the six years war he looked indignant nonetheless if what you say is true why has none of this been published it is too important to be kept a secret no sir fernao shook his head it is too important to be published what would the algarvians have done had they got their hands on a couple of journal articles to his astonishment the kuusaman got to his feet and bowed you are correct i was mistaken please go on he sat down again i would never have heard that from lagoans fernao thought no one has heard that from algarvians since the beginning of the world theyre always right if you dont believe it just ask them he brought himself back to the business at hand gentlemen ladies not quite half the sorcerers in the class were womenyou do not need to learn much of the theory behind what you will be doing in fact if would be better if you did not because what you do not know you cannot tell the enemy if captured you will need to know how to cast the spells as given to you how to protect yourself from the things likeliest to go wrong and how to teach these same things to classes of your own you are the first cadre many more will come after you some of the mages dutifully wrote that in their notebooks the notebooks stayed in the lecture halla part of the hostel of whose existence fernao had been ignorant till the classes began and one that showed good planning on the kuusamans part no one took anything in writing out of that hall we shall try small demonstrations today fernao continued even the smallest will show the large amounts of sorcerous energy that can be liberated by exploiting the inverse relationship between the laws of similarity and contagion he went through the chant and passes in the demonstration working slowly and carefully to show the students how the spell operated and also to make sure he didnt slip up even with this toneddown spell a mistake could be dangerous a glass beaker of water suddenly began to boil a couple of the kuusamans applauded fernao felt he ought to bow as if he were a stage conjurer rather than a real wizard instead he said as you see i produced the desired result with much less effort than i would have had to use with more conventional sorcery now each of you will try it kaleva please come forward as the woman rose and walked up behind the counter fernao set up the sorcerous materials she would need and also put a fresh beaker of water on the stand for her she went through the spell competently enough and set the water boiling about as fast as he had very good she said however strange the theory it does work shed spoken kuusaman so it does fernao agreed in the same tongue she gave him a surprised look i know some of your speech he said but this teaching needs me to be precise so i use classical kaunianexcept for the spells themselves of course you did very well switching back to the classical tongue he went on next please he pointed to the man in the chair next to kalevas everything went well till the seventh mage another woman turned the water to ice instead of boiling it what did i do wrong she asked anxiously i think it was your pass in the second versicle fernao answered the motion needs to be across and then under and i believe you went over with your left hand try again please the woman did and succeeded after all had gone through the demonstration fernao dismissed them and went looking for pekka he found her in the refectory eating a sandwich made of a round chewy roll smoked salmon a sliced gherkin and onions she looked tired she was teaching practical mages too as well as doing the administrative work for the project she nodded to him as he came up hello she said you have something on your mind i can see it so i do fernao nodded he looked around the refectory was crowded with practical mages a lot of whom hed never seen before when youre done here can we go someplace quiet and talk pekka hesitated fernao winced she hadnt come knocking at his door after theyd made love that once he hadnt knocked on hers either however much hed wanted to about what she asked at last something important i dont want to talk about here he answered but not that in case you were wondering all right i trust you but pekkas voice held doubtshe still had to be wondering whether hed planned to seduce her when hed invited her to his chamber she finished the odorous sandwich in a few bites took a gulp of tea to wash it down and stood come to my chamber with me then when they got there pekka sat down on the bed fernao would have liked to sit beside her but didnt think she would like it if he did he perched on the stool instead even as pekka raised a questioning eyebrow he asked why are all the mages were training kuusamans why arent there any lagoans ah pekka visibly relaxed that was important and it had nothing to do with their going to bed with each other she ticked off points on her fingers itemthe spells are in kuusaman until they get translated into classical kaunian or lagoan my folk will have an advantage itemeven if that werent so your guild of mages hasnt sent any sorcerers for training item the algarvians would have an easier time planting a spy among lagoans because you are also an algarvic people shall i go on those were all good reasons fernao wished he could have argued otherwise he said you do understand why im worrying if your mages all learn these spells and my countrymen dont who has the advantage if we quarrel after the war aye i see that pekka answered the first two points can and should be addressed i dont know how you can help looking like algarvians though she winked at him he grinned she hadnt done anything like that since they became lovers and the only reason he could think of that she hadnt was that she didnt want to encourage him but the grin didnt last he said if we had more lagoan mages here the problem of translating the spells would be smaller your people have not seemed to want to let my countrymen join me though with candor that surprised him she said we arent very eager no you worry about what kuusamo might do here we worry about what lagoas might do why fernao asked youre bigger than we are nothing we can do will change that bigger aye but with this spell even a small kingdom will be able to wreak havoc on its neighbors andpekkas nose wrinkledlagoans are lagoans after all who can guess what you people will do next youre right of course fernao slid down off the stool took two steps forward gave her a quick kiss and backed away again while she was still letting out a startled squeak he was glad his leg had healed enough to let him move fairly fast she might have hit him had he lingered as things were she shook her head and said fernao in such a way that his name couldnt mean anything but i wish you hadnt done that he didnt wish he hadnt done it he wished hed done more pekka he said and got that into her name too she shook her head shed heard what he meant just as hed heard her its no good she said its no good at all thats not what you thought then fernao answered he was in no doubt whatever about that pekka didnt try to deny it instead she said that makes it worse not better i was stupid now everybodys life is more complicated than it would have been but fernao struggled for words hed never tried dealing with a woman whod enjoyed going to bed with him but still didnt want to do it again pekka shook her head again no it was good but that isnt enough she held up a hand before he could snort in disbelief or do anything else in like vein it isnt for you maybe but for one thing youre a man and thank you so much he said she talked right through him and for another youre not a married man your life isnt so much more complicated than it was before mine is fernao started to protest but what complicated his life at the moment was pekkas unwillingness to sleep with him again somehow he didnt think that would impress her she sighed and said if i werent happy with leino that would be something different but i am its just that we were apart too long sometimes your body can make you stupid i think it happens more easily with men but it happens to women too i suppose so fernao said dully he didnt much care to be reckoned no more than the object of her stupidity pekka pointed a finger at him maybe we ought to get more lagoans to the hostel here after all i know how lagoans think about my people if you had those tall round lagoan women here you wouldnt look twice at me but now fernao shook his head i started wishing i could meet you back when i was reading your journal articles before you kuusamans stopped publishing all of a sudden it isnt just that i think youre beautiful he hadnt quite intended to say that which didnt mean it wasnt true pekka looked down at the floor directly between her feet in a very small voice she said youre not making this any easier you know im sorry fernao shook his head he wasnt sorry he was about as far from sorry as he could be and wanted to make things as hard as he could most of all he wanted to bed her again and again and again and let whatever happened afterwards take care of itself that must have been very plain pekka said i think youd better go she laughedbriefly in the romances id throw yourself into your arms now either because you were here and my husband wasnt or because you made me so passionate i couldnt help myself but life isnt always like the romances you did make me passionateid be lying if i said anything else its not enough though and im not going to let it be enough i know where i belong he heard the finality in that he wished he were so sure of such things he didnt see that he could do anything but what she asked now she looked relieved when he got up and started for the door relieved he was going or relieved he wasnt making her make hard choices he wished he could believe the latter every fiber of him wanted to every nerve ending he had told him hed be wrong if he did if only i hadnt been after anything but seducing her he thought as his hand fell on the latch but if there were two more dismal words than if only in lagoanor kuusaman or classical kaunian or any other languagehe was cursed if he knew what they were a band stood on the deck of the habakkuk thumping away in the emphatic style the kaunian kingdoms favored to leino the jelgavan royal hymn sounded like a lot of raucous noise not far away from him xavega twisted her face into a sneer she looked pretty even while sneering no mean feat i really have been away from pekka too long leino thought but looking at xavega was more pleasant than looking at king donalitu of jelgava whose presence aboard the habakkuk occasioned the band donalitu was pudgy and graying neither his face nor his body seemed to match the splendid dazzlingly bemedaled uniform he wore xavega sneered at king donalitu too lagoas might be at war with algarve but that didnt mean lagoans loved and admired folk of kaunian blood any more than they loved and admired kuusamans as far as leino could see lagoans loved and admired nobody but other lagoans and often not too many of them he didnt love or particularly admire xavega all i want to do is get it in he thought she started to glance toward him he looked away he didnt want to see her sneer aimed at him he knew it would be but he didnt want to see it captain brunho who commanded the habakkuk was also a lagoan which meant he towered more than half a head over leino he led king donalitu up to the kuusaman mage and spoke in classical kaunian your majesty i present to you leino of kajaani one of the sorcerers who designed and created this ship here leino bowed i am honored to meet you your majesty he said it was at least theoretically true the exiled king of jelgava looked him over by donalitus expression what he saw didnt much impress himhe could have given xavega lessons in sneering he said so you will help me get my throne back you will help drive the filthy barbarous usurper from the high place that is not his uh i will do what i can your majesty leino said beside donalitu captain brunho turned a dull red the color of hot iron when donalitu called algarvians filthy barbarians he also indirectly called lagoanshis protectors and another algarvic peoplefilthy barbarians he seemed unaware that might prove a problem odds were hed been unaware of it ever since going into exile leino had no intention of being the one to enlighten him donalitu said what good is this big icy boat i hope i shall not catch cold here now leino suspected he was turning a dull red by all appearances no one had ever taught donalitu anything resembling manners maybe kings didnt need them though leino had his doubts about that keeping a careful grip on his temper he replied habakkuk can carry many more dragons than any ordinary ship your majesty this ship is also harder to damage than any of the ordinary sort but it will melt donalitu exclaimed patiently leino said not if we have mages refreshing the iceand we do maybe no one had ever taught king donalitu to think either donalitu turned to captain brunho and said i shall be glad to go back aboard a proper ship a natural ship when this inspection is done aye your majesty brunhos face and voice were wooden leino held his face straight too though it wasnt easy donalitu assumed an iron ship was a natural ship what kind of sense did that make when ice floated and iron sank he almost said as much but somehow managed to keep his mouth shut captain brunho led the king of jelgava off to inspect the dragonfliers and their mounts with any luck at all a dragon will bite off his head leino thought that would do his kingdom some good as soon as king donalitu was out of earshot or perhaps rather sooner xavega said something in lagoan the mages who spoke her language snickered not wanting to be left out leino asked what was that in classical kaunian i said what a horrid stupid little man she replied in the same tongue in her loathing of donalitu she was willing to treat leino as an equal it was the first time shed done that since the algarvian leviathanrider planted an egg on the habakkuk plainly she needed something drastic after what seemed like forever king donalitu left the icebergturneddragonhauler he went down a rope ladder into a little patrol boat that took him back to the leyline cruiserthe iron ship the natural ship leino thought with amusementin which hed come out to visit habakkuk the cruiser sped away leino waved after it goodbye he called in classical kaunian with any luck we shall never see you again goodbye may it be so xavega said she beamedshe actually beamedat leino his hopes or something close to his hopes rose common sense quashed that xavegas smile wasnt likely to show how much she liked him it would show how much she despised donalitu of jelgava captain brunho came up behind them that will be enough of that he said that will be more than enough of that in fact he insulted you he insulted the ship he insulted all of us he is a moron xavega snarled are we supposed to put our lips on his posterior he is a king he is an ally he deserves respect brunho said formally powers below eat him xavega said even leino here could tell he is more like a leg of mutton than a proper man a leg of mutton leino wondered maybe it was a lagoan insult translated literally maybe it just meant xavegas command of classical kaunian wasnt quite so good as she thought it was whatever it was leino felt he had to say something and did the land of the seven princes would be ashamed to have him as one of the seven you are welcome to your opinion brunho said you are not welcome to express it on my ship not where others can hear it not where it can affect the morale of my crew you would not have a shipyou would not have this shipif it were not for us mages xavega pointed out that is true but i do have it now maybe such relentless precision made brunho a good captain for his sake for habakkuks sake leino hoped so nevertheless he observed bringing king donalitu aboard will do more to hurt morale than i could if i talked for a month xavega laughed and clapped her hands and nodded captain brunho stared down at leino out of cold green eyes this was done at the command of my sovereign king vitor i prefer his opinion to yours he swung that disapproving stare toward xavega king vitor is your sovereign too in case you have forgotten i remember perfectly well she snapped but if he approves of that donalitu creature he has less in the way of taste than i would have thought she flounced off leino watched her do it he watched carefully captain brunho was made of stern stuffhe kept his attention on leino you mages are an insubordinate lot he said thank you leino answered whatever brunho had been expecting by way of a reply that wasnt it he spun on his heelcarefully so as not to fall on the icy deck of the habakkukand stalked away before long leino went below to serve a shift fighting habakkuks unfortunate tendency to melt that tendency was more in evidence than ever lately as the ship cruised the ley lines in warmer more northerly waters without constant attention from mages habakkuk would have ceased to be we arent too insubordinate to keep you from swimming captain brunho leino thought xavega was also part of this antimelting shift the magecraft by now was routine though it hadnt been when leino helped develop it down in the land of the ice people the sorcerers didnt need to give it all their attention they could gossip while they worked a pity we have donalitu for an ally xavega said he would make a much better enemy he does think the world of himself does he not ramalho said shaking his head the lagoan mage continued he thinks the world spins around him too if you told him that back in jelgava you would have ended up in one of his dungeons faster than you could blink essi remarked her hands never faltered in the passes she needed to support the spell all the more reason for throwing him into one of those dungeons himself xavega stopped reviling donalitu in classical kaunian long enough to chant her portion of the spell that kept habakkuk solidalso in classical kaunian he is a useful tool against algarve ramalho said his countrymen dote on him which only goes to prove jelgavans are not so smart as they would have other people believe leino said the other mages chuckled xavega said no one who has donalitu for a king could be very smart and if our precious captain brunho cannot see that may the powers below eat him to leinos surprise she nodded his way you could see it whether brunho could or not thank you for trying to get him to be sensible eryou are welcome leino answered in some surprise shed actually talked to him in friendly fashion he couldnt remember the last time shed done that for a moment he couldnt imagine why shed done it but that didnt take long to figure out hed agreed with her about donalitu and hed said as much to captain brunho s face what could be more calculated to endear him to her than agreement nothing he could think of offhand as if to confirm that calculation xavega went on i had not realized you were such a sensible man the look she gave him was frankly appraising i do my best to hide it leino said which made her laugh out loud if im so sensible why do i want to flip up her kilt but there was more than one kind of sense and he knew it bedding a goodlooking woman needed no fancy justifications it was its own best argument he performed his share of the maintenance spell with casual competence his eyes kept sliding xavegas way hers kept meeting his and she wasnt looking at him as if she wanted to go wash her hands afterwards any more either was it really that easy he wondered did i just have to make her think i thought she was right to make her forget im a kuusaman he wasnt used to people who responded so simply do i really want anything to do with somebody who responds so simply if pekka were here if pekka were there xavega wouldnt have done anything but amuse him he was sure of that but pekka was far away and had been for quite a while every time leino looked at xavega and every time he caught her looking at him he was reminded of just how long hed been away from his wife xavega was never one to beat around the bush when the shift ended she waited for leino in the corridor i was wrong about you she announced oh his heart pounded how i never thought kuusaman men could be so interesting she said sure enough i agreed with her leino marveled that was all i needed to do it was probably all he should have done too part of him knew it anyhow but that wasnt the part that said now that we have spent all this time keeping habakkuk solid will you come to my cabin and see how much ice we can melt she couldnt very well misunderstand that if she didnt care for it shed slap him across the icy hallway instead she said aye and set her hand in his ill be sorry for this later leino thought but that would be later now now he hurried toward the cabin xavega at his side leave the algarvian lieutenant stared at sidroc you want leave aye sir sidroc answered stolidly speaking the redheads language he had to be stolid he wasnt all that fluent i have had none since i came to unkerlant more than a year and a half ago have any of your comrades had leave his company commander asked and sidroc had to shake his head the algarvian went on there are two ways to stop fighting here in the west you can be wounded then you stop long enough for them to repair you or you can die but if they could call you back from that believe me they would now go back go your squad and stop troubling me with foolish notions have you got that aye sir sidroc repeated back to his squad he went ceorl was stirring the stewpot he looked up well two ways to get leave sidroc reported you can get wounded or you can get killed otherwise forget it told you so sergeant werferth said theyre going to use us up thats what were here for id hate it even worse if they didnt treat their own soldiers the same way wonderful speaking forthwegian sidroc had no trouble sounding as sarcastic as he pleased i want to go home for a while curse it id come back of course you would werferth said its not like anybody except our own kin loves us back thereand even some of them dont futter em all ceorl said giving the pot another stir futter em all is right sidroc muttered the trouble was werferth was also right most forthwegians had no great use for either the algarvians or the men from forthweg whod taken service in plegmunds brigade ungrateful whoresons if it werent for the redheads wed still be stuck with all those stinking kaunians back in our own kingdom well thats the truth ceorl always sounded surprised when he agreed with sidroc he tasted the stew and nodded its as good as itll get not that thats saying much sidroc dug out his mess kit ceorl filled the tin tray with carrots and turnips and onions and bits of meat what is this stuff sidroc asked prodding one of those bits with his spoon unicorn horsemeat no its mutton ceorl said sidroc laughed in his face the ruffian grinned back unabashed well close anyhow its goat after tasting and chewingafter chewing for quite a whilesidroc nodded all right ill believe that it must have been in the pot a good long time its not too gamy and its all the way down to tough werferth methodically emptied his mess kit next to some of the stuff weve eaten this is downright good remember that behemoth that had gone over he wrinkled his nose in disgust which one sidroc asked his own tin was almost empty too its not like weve only done it once werferth laughed so did ceorl after a moment so did sidroc werferth said ah the happy stories well have to tell our grandchildren that made ceorl laugh harder than everharder than the joke deserved as far as sidroc was concerned he asked whats so funny grandchildren ceorl answered whos dumb enough to think well live long enough to have kids let alone grandchildren oh that brought sidroc back to earthto the muddy earth of unkerlantwith a bump it wasnt that ceorl was wrong ceorl was too likely to be right sidroc turned to werferth see sergeant theres another reason i need leave i should have told the lieutenant how am i going to meet a girl in this miserable country drag one down on the floor and have a couple of your pals hold her werferth said its not like we havent done that before either curse it thats not what i meant and you know it sidroc said even if we do father brats on these unkerlanter women well never find out about it i want to meet a nice girl settle downif i live i mean if you dont you wont have to worry about it thats bloody sure ceorl laughed again nastily showing off bad teeth and sergeant werferth let out the grunt he used to show his patience had run short powers above sidroc you come home from the war what in blazes makes you think a nice girld want anything to do with you this time ceorl practically wet himself he thought that was so funny sidroc started to scowl at werferth then carefully made his face blank instead youll pay for that sergeant powers below eat youand they will aye youll pay itll look just like an accident or like the unkerlanters got you plenty of chances to make that happen he went off to a little stream not far away to clean out his mess kit by the time he got back his face wasnt even blank any more he looked like his usual self instead if he seethed inside nobody needed to know it in fact werferth needed not to know it or sidroc wouldnt get his chance werferth hadnt lived long enough for gray to streak his beard by being careless behemoths the cry made everybody in plegmunds brigade who heard it grab for his stick sidroc was no slower than any of his comrades he might want to make something unfortunate happen to sergeant werferth but he didnt want the unkerlanters to make anything unfortunate happen to him here came the thump of the great beasts feet against the ground the rattle and clank of their chainmail panic seized himthe noise came from the east from the direction hed thought safe if swemmels soldiers had managed to bring behemoths into the rear of plegmunds brigade if theyve done that we re all dead men right now and i wont have to worry about killing werferth because theyll take care of it for meand theyll get me while theyre at it then somebody let out another shout this one holding nothing but relief theyre our behemoths powers above be praised sure enough the behemoths that tramped into the clearing had algarvians atop them the redheads looked as nervous about encountering the men of plegmunds brigade as the forthwegians did at their unexpected appearance you boys look too much like unkerlanters for your own good one of them called your behemoths look too much like unkerlanter beasts for your own good a trooper retorted sidroc nodded but then hesitatedthat proved true only at first glance it wasnt only that algarvian behemoth armor differed from what the unkerlanters used but the behemoths themselves seemed different after a moment he figured out how and why theyre young beasts he blurted an algarvian on one of those behemoths heard him and nodded if the world were a perfect place wed leave em on the farm for another year maybe for another two years he said but the worlds not perfect ready or not theyre got to go into the fight thinking back on all the behemoths algarve had left dead on the field on both sides of the durrwangen bulge sidroc nodded true the unkerlanters had also lost a lot of behemoths there but unkerlant seemed to have plenty left the same didnt hold true for algarve erwhere is the fight sidrocs company commander asked he should have been left on the farm a while longer too but here he was didnt they tell you asked a fellow on behemothback and the young lieutenant shook his head so did the behemoth crewman who went on were supposed to make sure swemmels buggers dont cross over the river line what do they call that river the fliss no the fluss the algarvian lieutenant said but the unkerlanters already have a bridgehead on this side now the men on the behemoths cursed nobody bothered telling us that one of them said its a demon of a lot harder to dig them out of a bridgehead than it is to keep them from getting one in the first place that was only too true sidroc wondered if the algarvians would call off the attack on realizing they were walking into a saw blade no such luck mezentios men didnt seem to think that way sidrocs company commander said well do our duty of course lets go do it then or try the behemoth crewman looked up to the heavens as if he were a gyongyosian they dont let us know the bridgeheads already in place powers above sometimes youd think they really want us to get killed forward said the lieutenant with plegmunds brigade he didnt blow his whistle which proved he had some measure of sense forward sidroc went hed probed unkerlanter bridgeheads before going after one of them was like grabbing a porcupine but then ceorl said well better drive em back over the river if we can if we dont theyll flood men through and swarm all over us theyve done it before the whoresons sidroc wished he could have disagreed unfortunately the ruffian was right sidroc eyed a spot on the back of sergeant werferth s tunic right about there he thought aye right about there especially if they drive us back itll look like one of their beams the unkerlanters were indeed on the eastern side of the fluss and there in greater numbers than even the men of plegmunds brigade had thought they had behemoths on this side of the fluss too behemoths that promptly got into a brawl with their algarvian counterparts and made the algarvian beasts useless for spearheading any further advance we have to do it ourselves sidroc said bitterly isnt that how it always works whenever they find a tough job who do they hand it to us thats who theyd sooner spend us than their own men werferth said as he had before sidroc came close to forgiving him for thatclose but not close enough before long the unkerlanters proved to have enough behemoths on this side of the river not only to keep the algarvian behemoths in play but also to mount attacks of their own they lumbered forward to toss eggs at sidroc and his comrades at a range from which the forthwegians couldnt reply sidroc went to earth digging himself in behind a fallen tree the other men of plegmunds brigade were quick to do the same on came the unkerlanter behemoths footsoldiers trotting along behind those men on foot should be up farther sergeant werferth said from close by sidroc as if the unkerlanters were his troops were going to make them pay sidroc intended to make them pay he waited quietly in his hole till an incautious behemoth drew too close then he flung one of the little potteryencased sorcerous eggs the algarvians had been issuing lately as hed hoped it landed right under the behemoth rolling beneath the animals armored skirt before bursting mad with pain and fear the behemoth rampaged back the way it had come trampling a luckless footsoldier who stood in its path other unkerlanter footsoldiers started blazing at sidroc when he stayed up too long to admire his handiwork werferth knocked him down back in your hole sonny boy the veteran said well need you next time around right sidroc said thanks sergeant only after the words were out of his mouth did he remember how angry at werferth he was supposed to be he shrugged he didnt have to do anything about it now if he decided he still wanted to later he could take care of it hed have more chances he was sure of that lieutenant leudast sprang to one side away from the wounded behemoth that now ran wild far out of its crews control trailing blood the behemoth thundered west back toward the fluss river it would keep spreading chaos through the unkerlanter bridgehead till its injuries made it fall over or till someone finally killed it steady men leudast called keep up the advance we can do it in spite of his words the unkerlanter counterattack faltered the algarvians and their forthwegian flunkies werent going to be able to smash in the bridgehead and drive his countrymen back over the river that much seemed clear the enemy lacked both men and behemoths for the job but no breakthrough was coming here either not until more unkerlanter men and beasts and eggtossers made it over the fluss little by little both sides realized they wouldnt accomplish much and the fighting tapered off what point to risking your neck when getting killed wouldnt get you victory what point to risking your neck even when getting killed will get you victory leudast wondered he shook his head that was a subversive thought for a soldier to have sergeant kiun said i dont like fighting those fornicating forthwegians for beans for one thing they always fight hard theyre volunteers leudast answered they arent conscripts the way the redheads are he didnt mention how impressers went through unkerlanter villages herding young men into swemmels army he didnt need to mention it hed joined the army that way so very likely had kiun and so very likely had most of the men they led other thing is kiun went on they look more like us and they dress more like us than the algarvians do that means youre liable not to figure out who they are till too late thats so leudast said its not as bad as with the grelzers but its so grelzers kiun rolled his eyes may we see the last of the stinking traitors and soon leudast nodded he hadnt had anything in particular against the folk of the duchy of grelz before entering it all hed known about them was that they had what was in his ear a funny accent capturing raniero the redhead whod called himself their king had won him wealth and rank no matter what it had done to raniero himself after king swemmel paraded him through herborn but fighting grelzers at the beginning of the war through the duchy some of the men who wore the dark green tunics of what called itself the kingdom of grelz had been halfhearted about fighting their unkerlanter brethren a good many had thrown down their sticks and surrendered the first chance they got that didnt happen anymore with most of grelz in king swemmel s hands these days the grelzers who kept on fighting against him were the ones whod joined the late not much lamented raniero because they hated the king of unkerlant with a deep and abiding passion not because theyd been looking for advantage from the algarvians few of the ones who wore dark green these days bothered trying to surrender few of the ones who did yield went back to captives camps with a sly grin kiun said bet you almost wouldntve minded getting chased back over the fluss lieutenant you cant say things like that leudast answered which didnt mean the underofficer was wrong i just thought youd like to get back to leiferde and your lady friend there kiun said his smile disarming now ive got a lady friend back there myself matter of fact have you leudast said and kiun nodded i didnt think you meant anything you shouldnt have leudast continued but you never can tell who may be listening kiuns grimace said he understood exactly what leudast meant king swemmel saw traitors everywhere that he saw so many had helped create a good many here in the duchy of grelz it had probably helped create a good many elsewhere in unkerlant too but any swemmel could reach suffered for it a potent argument against treason captain recared the regimental commander came up to leudast i think things here have settled down for a while he said aye sir leudast nodded just one more little fight one more little fight im lucky i lived through how many didn t this time how many have i got left weve held the bridgehead recared went on and leudast nodded again his superior said thats what really matters sooner or later well break out and give the algarvians another good kick in the teeth weve given them a lot of kicks the past year and a half leudast said feels good to be the foot and not the backside recared laughed hed seemed impossibly young when he first took command of the regiment where leudast commanded a company his features were still youthfulhe couldnt have been much above twenty years old but hed been through a lot since then just as all unkerlanter soldiers had all of us who are still breathing anyhow leudast thought you saw how they threw a few behemoths at us and tried to make them count for a lot recared said thats what theyre reduced to these days theyre still dangerousi expect theyll always be dangerousbut we can beat them theyre still dangerousbut we can beat them almost three years before leudast had been near the border between unkerlanter and algarvianoccupied forthweg he and his comrades had been on the point of attacking the algarvians but the redheads struck first after that leudast had done nothing but retreat for a long time till mezentios men finally stalled in the snow of an unkerlanter winter just outside cottbus hed done more retreating the following summer down in the south and missed some of the fight in sulingen because hed been down with a leg wound that still pained him now and again but hed come a long way east since then theyre still dangerousbut we can beat them it would have seemed absurd in the days when the algarvians swept all before them now it was simply truth do you know what i wish sir leudast asked probably recared answered you wish you were back on the other side of the fluss finding some way or other to be alone with that girl you met there am i right or am i wrong he chuckled he knew he was right and leudast could only nod once more if i live through the rest of the war i think ill come back here who knows whether youll think the same way then recared said a girl goes to bed with you a few times you decide youre in love that was cynical enough to have come from an algarvians throat before leudast could say anything or even shake his head the regimental commander changed the subject do you know lieutenant weve been promised a new field kitchen and it never did show up sir leudast said blankly this was the first hed heard about a field kitchen it was news to him that the unkerlanter army boasted such things in the field even the algarvians mostly cooked catch as catch can but captain recared nodded ive sent complaints west by crystallomancer but you know what thats worth they might as well be written on the air i really need someone to look into it why dont you commandeer a horse or a mule or a unicorn and go raise a stink me sir leudast squeaked im just a youre a lieutenant recared said and youre not just a lieutenant marshal rathar personally promoted you and everybody knows why youll have my written authorization too ill make sure you take it with you he smiled a small thoughtful smile the cursed thing is supposed to be somewhere not too far from a wide spot in the road called leiferde i expect youll be able to track it down in those parts eh leudast stared at him recared looked back no he wasnt so young and innocent as he had been thank you sir leudast said for what recared answered you came back with that field kitchen and ill thank you with it or without it be back here in three days aye sir leudast saluted leiferde was about a day away that would leave him a dayor whatever was left of a day after he chased after a field kitchen was there one somewhere near alizes villageto do what he pleased and he knew exactly what he pleased let me round up a mount he wasnt much of a rider but he would manage after all he had an incentive you do that recared sounded professionally brisk while youre doing it ill prepare your orders leudast took charge of a horse that had been pulling a wagon now down with a broken axle getting riding gear took rather longer than scaring up the animal he felt very high off the ground when he rode back to recared here you are recared said now youre official go find that field kitchenand whatever else you happen to find around leiferde that was as close as he came to admitting he knew leudast might have anything else in mind saluting again leudast rode off he wanted to boot the horse up to a gallop to get to alizes village as fast as he could only the accurate suspicion that he would fall off on his head long before he got to leiferde kept him at a more sedate pace unkerlanter artisans had thrown a couple of quick bridges of precut lengths of timber across the fluss military constables stood at the eastern end of the one leudast approached they inspected the order recared had given him then nodded and stood aside pass on lieutenant one of them said and grudged him a salute you are authorized he sounded as if hed turned back plenty who werent he probably had more artisans were bringing up the timbers for another bridge leudast waved to them as he headed west past their wagons he neared leiferde early the next morning after sleeping rolled in his cloak by the side of the road before going into the village he went to the supply dump in search of the possibly mythical field kitchen to his amazement he found a sergeant who knew what he was talking about aye lieutenant your regimental commanders been bending everybodys ear about the cursed thing the fellow said were bloody short of draft animals is the trouble you can haul it away with your horse there right now if you want to ive got some other business on this side of the fluss i need to take care of first leudast said ill be back for it tomorrow morning suits me the supply sergeant said itll be ready and waiting it suited leudast too he mounted the horse and rode into leiferde most of the peasants ignored him what was one more soldier after so many he found alize weeding the vegetable plot by her fathers house she let out a squeal of delight and sprang to her feet what are you doing here she asked he grinned i was in the neighborhood so i just thought id drop by nine some people had always turned their backs on talsu when he walked through the streets of skrunda they were the folk who thought no one could come back from a dungeon without giving himself to the algarvians now that hed come out of the constabulary building without visible damage more people turned their backs on him they thought no one could do that without telling the redheads what they wanted to hear most of the time talsu was able to ignore such snubs but when they came from young men who had been his friends before he was seized they tore at him no matter how much he tried not to show it he sometimes wanted to scream at them mezentios men grabbed me because i was trying to fight back echoed through his mind what have you done since the algarvians occupied jelgava not a cursed thing thats what holding in his fury led to a bad temper and a sour stomach itll all get sorted out when king donalitu comes back gailisa said one evening trying to soothe him after hed snarled at everyone in his family will it talsu asked bitterly of course it will she answered in the quiet of the cramped little bedchamber they shared thats why hell come backto sort things out i mean she had a touching faith in the king once upon a time talsu might have had a similar faith in donalitu he tried to remember when hed lost it before he went into the army he was sure of that if he does come back hell probably throw me in the dungeon for being too friendly with the redheads that exercise in cynicism got him an appalled look from his wife he wouldnt do such a thing she exclaimed hed never do such a thing the only reason you ever got in trouble was because you wanted to do something to the algarvians well lets hope youre right about that talsu didnt think she was but he didnt feel like arguing with her either he had other things on his mind the other things ended up making him happy and then sleepy the bed wasnt really big enough for the two of them but they were young enough not to mind sometimes waking up all tangled together they were tangled together when they woke up that night it was still dark that was the first thing talsu noticed it was in fact pitch black for a moment talsu couldnt imagine why hed awakened then he heard the bells clanging out an alarm fire somewhere gailisa asked talsu listened then shook his head i dont think sotheyre ringing all over town that means dragonfliers overhead aye youre probably right gailisa untangled her legs from his and got out of bed wed better go downstairs theyd huddled behind the counter in the tailors shop during other visits from kuusaman and lagoan dragons as talsu got up too he said i wish we had a cellar here the way your father does do you want to try to get over there she asked he shook his head getting caught in the open when eggs start falling is the last thing you want to do i saw what happens then in the armyand the first time the dragons came over skrunda during the promenade in the square he swatted gailisa lightly on the backside come on lets get moving i was she said talsu chuckled he hadnt had to swat her hed just liked doing it he would have pounded on his mother and fathers door and on his sisters to get them moving but they all met in the hallwaytraku had been coming down the hall to make sure he and gailisa were awake after some confusion they hurried downstairs they huddled between the counter and the wall just as the first eggs started bursting all over skrunda heres hoping they come down on the algarvians heads talsu said powers above make it so his mother said but laitsina added heres hoping not too many come down on ordinary people like us they do aim as well as they can talsu said that was true but dragonfliers high in the air and aboard badtempered beasts that tried to do what they wanted not what the fliers wanted couldnt aim any too well that was also true but talsu didnt mention it it was one more thing he didnt care to think about an egg burst down the street close enough to make the floor shake under talsu the front window in the tailors shop rattled in its frame but didnt break theyre coming over more often than they used to talsus sister said ausras right laitsina said as another egg burst this one a little farther away theyre sending more dragons each time too its these habakkuk things unless i miss my guess talsu said they can carry a lot of dragons the algarvians dont like em thats for sure traku agreed they spend a lot of space in the news sheets screaming about em anything the algarvians scream about cant be all bad talsu spoke with great conviction no one in his family disagreed not many jelgavans in skrunda would have disagreedonly those few whod ended up in bed with the redheads i hope they have a couple of squads of soldiers right where the arch from the kaunian empire used to be traku said and i hope an egg comes down right on those buggers that would be good talsu agreed that would be very good hed watched when the algarvian mages toppled that arch the redheads hadnt cared for what it said about their ancestors they probably didnt care for what a lot of modern jelgavans had to say about the descendants of their ancestors either at least we get a little warning when the lagoans and kuusamans come over now gailisa said as the shop shook again theyve got dowsers here now i suppose talsu said they arent doing it for us though theyre doing it for themselves before she could answer several eggs landed close together and all of them close to the tailors shop the window blew in fragments of glass clattered off the front of the counter more fragments clattered off the wall behind it whos going to pay for that traku growled i am thats who curse em all all things considered talsu thought they were fairly lucky had those eggs burst a little closer the shards of glass might have sliced right through the counterand through the people behind it too he didnt say that his father hadnt seen real war facetoface and didnt know everything it could do as far as talsu was concerned traku didnt know how lucky he was and then an egg did burst close by close enough to slam the counter back against the people huddling behind it everyone shrieked it didnt quite go over onto them and it didnt quite crush them against the wall but it came much too close to doing both talsu felt not the least shame in yelling along with the rest of his family for a dreadful moment he thought that yell would be the last cry that ever passed his lips when he realized he would live a little longer he said were going to have to remodel the shop right this minute son thats the least of my worries traku said gailisa pointed to the wall above the counter whats that funny light talsu looked up too it should have been dark skrunda left lights out at night to make it harder for lagoan and kuusaman dragons to find the town not hard enough talsu thought but that orange flickering glow was easy enough to recognize once you got over not expecting to see it there fire he said it got brighter fearfully fast too its close gailisa said and then we cant stay here youre right talsu scrambled to his feet eggs were still falling but that didnt matter the eggs might miss if he and his family stayed where they were they would burn he hauled gailisa up too then reached for his sister weve got to get out while we still can but his mother wailed hes right laitsina traku said come on as long as we get out in one piece we can worry about everything else later he got up and after a moment his wife did too by then talsu was already at the front door it didnt want to open the blasts of sorcerous energy left it jammed in the frame but the window beside it was bare of glass talsu helped gailisa through the emptiness there ausra went through by herself laitsina started to balk traku slapped her on the behind hard she squawked and scrambled out into the street talsu gaped hed never imagined his father hitting his mother go out there son or ill give you the same traku growled youre the one who said weve got to get out and youre right aye father talsu said as he might have to a sergeant giving him orders in combat out through the glassless frame he went his father followed the shop across the street was burning so was the one two doors downand even as traku watched the shop next door caught fire where are the water brigades a neighbor asked probably busy somewhere else talsu said this cant be the only blaze burning water brigades were splendid for fighting the occasional fire that broke out during peacetime if half a dozen or a dozen or two dozen fires broke out all at once they were going to be hopelessly overmatched but my shop will burn if the water brigades dont come the neighbor said our shop will burn too laitsina said she was clutching trakus hand very hard she wasnt angry about what hed done to get her moving if she wasnt talsu supposed he didnt have any business being angry either sweetheart theres nothing we can do about it traku said not one fornicating thing an egg bursting a couple of streets away punctuated his words shaking his head he went on were alive thats all that matters right now gailisa said heres hoping the algarvians here in skrunda caught it as hard as we have aye by the powers above talsu said a woman who lived a few doors away said its a terrible thing when the people you want to win the war are dropping eggs on your head everyone nodded talsu had been thinking the same thing he hadnt dared say it though if he said anything too harsh about the redheads and it got back to them what might happen to him he could go back to the dungeon and he knew it he made himself think about what was going on here and now not what might happen later wed better get moving before the fire catches us he said no one argued with him he rather wished someone had he also wished he could have gone back into the shop gone back upstairs for what everything that truly counted was here in the street with him only then did he notice his feet hurt and that he was barefoot he wondered how much glass hed stepped in and how badly cut his feet were he shrugged he could worry about that later too gailisa gasped and clutched at his arm the corpse the firelight showed wasnt pretty bloodit looked blackpuddled in the gutter by the body talsu said were lucky and meant it traku looked back over his shoulder there goes the shop he said quietly laitsina started to cry talsu felt like crying too hed thought he would grow old himself as a tailor in that shop but he still counted himself lucky for he still had a chance to grow old half the time vanai hoped unkerlanter dragons would smash the kaunian district in eoforwic to rubble that way the algarvians wouldnt get the chance to use her life energy for their own needs but then she would shake her head and wrap her arms around her swollen belly not just her life was involved hereshe would have her baby soon and she fiercely wanted the baby to live what happened to her didnt seem nearly so important as what happened to it the algarvians hadnt staged another roundup in her part of the kaunian quarter though theyd swept through other parts of it whenever cries and screams rose elsewhere in the district vanai felt a horrid sense of reliefit was happening aye but not to her afterwards she always hated herself for that relief but she could never stifle it at the time she looked out the window of her flat then shrank back again a couple of algarvian constables strolled along the street they twirled their bludgeons as they passed if they didnt own the world they werent about to admit it she muttered a curse under her breath even though shed already seen that curses wouldnt bite on algarvians that hardly surprised her they cursed themselves doing what they did to the kaunians didnt they one of the redheads was uncommonly plump vanai took a long look at him though she was careful enough not to get close enough to the glass to let him have a good look at her she nodded shed seen him before back in oyngestun she and her grandfather had almost been sent west but hed spoken up on their behalf and two others had gone instead now he was here what did that mean nothing goodshe was sure of it were any kaunians at all left alive in and around gromheort maybe the algarvians didnt need constables there anymore vanai didnt want to think that was true but it made an unpleasant amount of sense along with his partner the plump constable strolled around the corner and disappeared vanai let out a sigh of relief though she didnt know why how was she in less danger now than she had been while the constables remained in sight in no way she could see but she did feel better regardless of whether she had any rational reason to do so my grandfather would not approve of such irrationality she said more and more these days shed fallen into the habit of talking aloud to the baby she seldom had anyone else to talk to not many kaunians were left in this block of flats not after the latest roundup i suppose seeing that constable made my grandfather come into my mind vanai thought normally brivibas didnt enter her thoughts very often when he did she usually tried to force him out of them again he would have disapproved of much more than a momentary lapse of irrationality her hands went to her belly once more having a child by a forthwegian would have topped his list she was sure of that bnvibas would have thundered on and on about diluting kaunianity but dont you see my grandfather vanai said as if he stood beside her the algarvians have done more to dilute kaunianity in forthweg than the forthwegians could have done if theyd made half our maidens marry their young men her grandfather would have said something stuffy about that being beside the point she didnt think it was back before the warthat magical phraseperhaps one in ten of king penda s subjects had been of kaunian blood how many kaunians would be left alive by the time the war ended any at all even if there were some scattered handful would they have any weight in forthwegassuming a kingdom of forthweg ever existed again penda had had to notice a tenth of his subjects would he have to notice a thirtieth or a fiftieth or whatever remnant of blonds was left vanai laughed bitterly not being noticed by king pendaif penda ever came back from exilewas at the moment the least of her worries and of the forthwegian kaunians worries too surviving till he returnedif he returnedtook pride of place there the baby kicked inside her strongly enough to make her hand move on her belly she nodded to herself the baby kicked hard these days once or twice it had kicked in just the wrong place and made one of her legs go weak beneath her for a moment she counted herself lucky that she hadnt fallen patting her swollen stomach she said and you ought to count yourself lucky that i didnt fall too the baby rewarded her with another kick and a wriggle it wasnt listening to her she sighed no one did these days the only person whod ever really listened to her as long as she could remember was ealstan tears welled up in her eyes shed known terror after the algarvians captured her shed expected that what she hadnt expected was the most crushing loneliness shed ever known shed got used to having someone with whom she could talk someone to whom she really mattered someone to whom she wasnt just a research assistant or a convenience or occasionally an inconvenience she hadnt realized how important how marvelous that was till she didnt have it any more she wiped the tears on her sleeve before she got pregnant they would have embarrassed her now she almost took them for granted they came more easily these days she didnt know why that was so but she knew that it was so even back in the days of the kaunian empire people had noticed the same thing a couple of quotations from the days of the empire flashed through her mind her mouth twisted that she knew such things was her grandfathers doing and what had it got her a flat in the kaunian district a wait till the algarvians caught her and took her away for that matter what had brivibas erudition got him first the attentions of major spinello whod had plenty of attentions to give vanai too curse him and last a makeshift noose in an algarvian gaol cell after he got recognized in spite of his sorcerous disguise as a forthwegian so much for scholarship she said though she did wonder how her grandfather had been recognized had the magic worn off as hers had done she found that hard to believe brivibas was nothing if not careful and precise had someone known his voice in spite of the way he looked that seemed more plausible but who could have major spinello might have vanai shuddered spinello had gone off to the west to fight the unkerlanters she hoped he was dead horribly dead but even if he wasnt he was there in the west not in gromheort who else that plump constable would he have had any special reason to remember and recognize brivibas vanai could only shrug how could she know what had happened in oyngestun after she left with ealstan the baby wiggled and twisted inside her the sensation was like none shed ever known she wondered how she could put it into words for someone who hadnt known it after a moment she shook her head she didnt think there were any such words oh stop she said when the baby seemed to be trying to learn to dance inside a space that didnt have room for fancy steps if it werent for you id be back at my own flat not here she was sure the baby made the masking spell shed devised fade away faster than it would have otherwise she wondered how long the spell would hold if she tried it now with the baby so much bigger shed probably have to renew it every half hour maybe even more i could she said i would but anyone who looked like a forthwegian caught inside the kaunian quarter would be blazed no questions asked if it werent for that i really could vanai repeated she had the dark brown strand of yarn and the yellow one she even had a forthwegianstyle womans tunic shed found it going through a nowempty flat in the building she sometimes wore it when the weather got warm shed always despised those baggy tunics but they were a lot more comfortable for a pregnant woman than any trousers here came that algarvian constable and his partner back along the street they were both talking and gesturing animatedly as algarvians did the plump constable laughed at something the other one said how can you do that how can you laughvanai wondered you must know what goes on here how can you not care bells began to clang then not just in the kaunian quarter but all over eoforwic the two algarvian constables stopped laughing the plump one shouted a phrase vanai didnt understandone she judged unlikely ever to have appeared in polite literatureand shook his fist at the sky then he and his partner stopped strolling along and started hurrying away from the kaunian quarter blonds on the street started hurrying too hurrying toward those blocks of flats that had cellars from the gossip at the feeding stations the algarvians maintained vanai had heard that her own people had killed a couple of constables rash enough to go down into a cellar with them she didnt know if that was trueit sounded almost too good to be truebut she hoped so there wasnt quite the desperate dash and scramble there would have been a few months before for one thing the redheads dowsing techniques had improved which gave people a little more time to take shelter and for another unkerlanter dragons over eoforwic were no longer a horrid surprise theyd come often enough by now to let folk know what to expect one of the things to expect was disaster if you had the misfortune to be on the upper story of a building that a bursting egg leveled vanai started for the door intending to go downstairs into a cellar herself as pregnant as she was she couldnt go anywhere very fast and so was grateful for the extra warning time the algarvian dowsers gave not that theyre doing it for the likes of me she thought with a hand on the latch though she checked herself shed seen those constables leave the kaunian quarter she suspected the pair shed seen hadnt been the only ones getting out either how likely was it that the guards around the edge of the district were all staying at their posts not very unless she missed her guess which meant which means that if im lucky if theyre in cellars if an unkerlanter egg doesnt tear me to pieces this is the best chance ill ever have to get out of the quarter vanai breathed once the idea came to her she didnt hesitate for a moment she grabbed the long forthwegianstyle tunic then checked her pockets to make sure she had the brown yarn and the yellow it was death to look like a forthwegian inside the kaunian quarter it was also death to look like a kaunian out of it but if no one saw her appearance change from the one to the other i have to try she thought what have i got to lose she left the block of flats and came out onto the street just as the first eggs began bursting in eoforwic looking up she saw rockgray dragons wheeling in the blue sky get into a cellar you cursed fool somebody shouted to her but vanai had no intention of getting into a cellar and didnt think herself at all foolish at the awkward waddle that was the fastest gait she had she hurried toward the edge of the kaunian quarter only a few blocks away more and more eggs fell some of them quite close she moaned with fear but kept going someone else behind her shouted something she looked over her shoulder and moaned againan algarvian constable a plumpish one but he wasnt close and he might not have been shouting at her she still had a chance she ducked into a doorway tore off her kaunian clothes and threw on the forthwegian tunic then she raced through the spell that let her look forthwegian too she stepped out onto the sidewalk and trotteda lumbering trot but a trot nonethelesstoward safety barring eggs of course now only half a block away another shout rang out behind heranother shout and the thud of boots on flagstones however much she didnt want to she turned her head a stick in his hand that algarvian constable came thundering after her ealstan felt as if hed been running for a hundred miles his heart sledged in his chest hed been wrong before so often that hope was almost dead he didnt think he could stand to be wrong again but i have to try he thought and kept running as hard as he could he rounded a corner and saw no one ahead of him panting he cursed loudlyin algarvian then somebody ducked out of a doorway and hurried toward the edge of the kaunian district ealstan cursed again louder and more furiouslybut still in algarvian hed been running after a blond woman and this was a forthwegian if she hadnt been so very pregnant she would have looked a lot like his sister conberge he started running as if hed never run before he let out another great shoutvanaias he thudded toward her she glanced back over her shoulder and came to a stop every inch of her sagging her face full of hopeless despair vanai he yelled again and then thelberge and then most important of all darling she stared she swayed for a moment he thought she would faint an egg burst only a block or so away ealstan hardly noticed it he didnt think vanai noticed it at all ealstan she whispered as he dashed up and swept her into his arms i dont believe it she went on though the words were muffled because he was doing his best to smother her with kisses its true by the powers above he said in the brief moments when he wasnt otherwise occupied but youre an algarvian she said i mean you look like an algarvian how can you be you too can be a mage ealstan said solemnly im an algarvian the same way youre a forthwegian he took her by the elbow and steered her in the direction she was already going come on lets get you out of the quarter here as soon as weve done that we can worry about everything else if he ran into any guards at the edge of the quarter ealstan intended to talk his way past them the constabulary uniform he was wearing which pybba had got him despite grumblings would give him a long head start toward that but there was no need like any men of sense the guards had sought shelter from the unkerlanter eggs so had everybody else but for the two of them the streets were empty out he said triumphantly as they passed into the part of eoforwic where forthwegians could go and kauniansat least kaunians who looked like kaunianscouldnt out vanai echoed she raised an eyebrow in an expression unmistakably hers no matter how much the magic made her look like conberge i could have done this myself you know i know sweetheart ealstan said now i know but i didnt know before i started coming into the quarter looking for you his chuckle was grim any algarvian constables who saw meany real algarvian constables i meanmust have figured i had a kaunian girlfriend he squeezed her hand how fine the touch of her flesh felt and they were right but not the way they thought eggs burst only a couple of blocks away ealstan waved to the unkerlanter dragons still circling overhead still looking for targets in eoforwic the longer they stayed up there the better his chances of getting back to his flat with vanai he poked his head into the lobby of a block of flats just outside the kaunian quarter as hed hoped it was empty everyone there had run for a cellar he pulled vanai inside and stripped off his constables uniform after pulling out a proper forthwegian tunic from a pouch on his belt he stuffed the algarvianstyle tunic and kilt and hat into the pouch pybba may need them again he told vanai pybba she said but pybbas got no use for kaunians i dont know how many times youve told me that no but he hasnt got any use for algarvians either ealstan answered and he has got some use for me and so i managed to persuade him to get me this he hugged his wife i know whats important by the powers above from another smaller pouch he took a length of coppery yarn and one of dark brown he went through the spell hed devised to shift him back from looking like an algarvian to his usual self vanai clapped her hands together which told him hed succeeded she said you patterned that charm after the one i made well of course i did he answered i know what worksand having a model helps when i compose in classical kaunian you did splendidly vanai said which warmed him all over you must have done splendidly twice in fact or you wouldnt have been able to look like an algarvian in the first place he kissed her even as he did though something else struck him youd better renew your spell too while youve got the chance no telling how long youll keep looking forthwegian we need to be back to the flat before you go back to looking like your regular self youre right she said and did just that her looks didnt change but she would keep on looking a lot like his sister for a while longer long enough maybe ill have her renew it again before we get home if i see a chance ealstan told himself vanais thoughts were running along a different ley line ill have to get a new bottle of hair dye no point to dyeing itno way eitherwhen i was caught there ealstan shook his head no you wont theres still plenty left at home i didnt throw it awayi thought youd be back i hoped youd be back was closer to the truth but he said it the way he wanted to vanai kissed him for it that made it worthwhile and more than worthwhile she took his hand come on lets go eggs were still bursting all over eoforwic ealstan said now that ive got you back i want the unkerlanters to go away and leave us alone before all i wanted them to do was knock eoforwic topsyturvy so did i vanai said as they went out onto the street once more she grinned at him i wanted to get back to the flat by myself and be there waiting when you walked in you spoiled my surprise the grin disappeared you almost frightened me to death too im sorry ealstan said im so sorry but looking like one of the redheads was the only way i could find to get into the kaunian district he drew himself up it worked too vanai couldnt argue with that and she didnt try the unkerlanter dragons did fly away after the eggs stopped falling people started coming back out onto the streets no one looked twice at ealstan and vanai the only thing in the least out of the ordinary about them was her pregnancy they stopped in a tavern for a glass of wine to celebrate though they didnt say why they were celebrating when vanai asked if she could use the pot the fellow behind the bar just nodded and pointed to the right door my wife was always running back and forth when she was expecting too he said thank you vanai closed the door behind her when she came out she nodded to ealstan the spell would last a while longer it lasted long enough for them to climb the stairs to the flat ealstan made vanai hold the splintery bannister with one hand and his own hand with the other im not made of glass you know she said tartly weve come this far he said i dont want anythinganythingto go wrong now is that all right vanai made a face at him but she didnt say anything more so he supposed hed won his point he opened the door to the flat he stood aside to let vanai go in ahead of him he closed the door he barred it he turned back to vanai i love you he said they held each other for a long time then vanai said thank you and squeezed him harder than ever there were times when i didnt think i would ever see you again ealstan knew what that had to mean vanai trembled against him he felt like trembling too he stroked her hair youre safe here he said dont be silly she answered im a kaunian im not safe anywhere how are you going to bring a midwife here when the baby comes im liable to start looking like what i am right in the middle of labor he hadnt thought of that somehow or other well manage he said well manage without a midwife is what well do vanai said i suppose so ealstan kept his reservations to himself if anything looked as if it was going wrong he vowed he would get a midwife and think about everything else later he had a good deal of silver he could bribe her enough to keep her quiet for a little while and then move before she brought the redheads down on vanai and him and the baby vanai said we can worry about that when the time comes she smiled at him i know what youre thinking now that wasnt thought that was automatic bodily response to holding the woman he loved in his arms should you so close to your time he asked once wont hurt she answered and if you think i havent missed you too youd better think again she pulled the tunic off over her head her body startled him because shed been locked away in the kaunian quarter he hadnt been able to watch it change day by day he hadnt realized just how much her belly bulged and is your navel supposed to stick out like that ealstan reach out a gentle cautious finger to touch it i dont know vanai answered all i know is that it does when ealstan pulled off his own tunic and drawers she laughed im not the only one sticking out either i know im supposed to ealstan said an odd mix of dignity and eagerness in his voice he led her back to the bedchamber because of her bulging belly they fumbled a bit before finding a way that suited them both she lay on her back a pillow under her bottom he poised himself on his knees between her legs oh she said softly as he went into her i love you he said which meant about the same thing slowly and carefully he began to move the posture made it easy for him to tease her with a fingertip at the same time his pleasure built by her sighs vanais did too then all at once he laughed in surprise and lost his rhythm vanai made a noise wordless but indignant im sorry he told her your magic just wore off i didnt expect it to oh she said this time thoughtfully all right they resumed not much later it was a great deal better than all right when vanai gasped and quivered her belly went tight and hard for a little while ealstan laughed again when her flesh rippled from the inside out i can really see the baby move now he said i can really feel it vanai said we made things crowded in there for a little while it will be all right everything will be all right for the first time since coming home to an empty flat ealstan dared believe that too how are you feeling this morning my sweet colonel lurcanio asked at the breakfast table krasta found his solicitude cloying hes worried because he thinks its his brat in there she thought she thought it was lurcanios too but she knew she had reason to be uncertain where the algarvian officer had only a nasty suspicious mind making him doubt but she had to answer him straightout defiance didnt work shed found that out a good many times always to her dismay im fairly well she said good lurcanio said briskly food staying down better his manner declared that hed been through this business a good many times and was somewhere between amused and annoyed at having to go through it again so far krasta said so far today anyhow her voice turned petulant as she went on i dont know why they call it morning sickness it can happen any time and its always disgusting when it does her stomach quivered nervously at the mere thought of being sick again colonel lurcanio laughed of course hes laughing krasta thought hes a man he never has to worry about things like this the only thing hes got to do with babies is having fun while they start obliviousor at least indifferent to what was going through her mind lurcanio said im afraid i must tell you goodbye for some little while i have business to attend to down in the south oh that made krasta forget her belly at least for a while she hoped she didnt sound too alarmed one of the reasons lurcanio had left priekule for the south was to go after her brother the algarvians called the valmierans who fought against them bandits krasta had thought of them the same way till she found out skarnu was among them aye trouble brewing down there lurcanio didnt sound happy for once he didnt sound as if he were trying to pry information out of her either his long face seeming even longer than usual he continued something nasty is going on across the strait of valmierathe lagoans and kuusamans are gathering ships and men in their northfacing ports even krasta unschooled in every military art saw what that meant an invasion she exclaimed maybe lurcanio said on the other hand maybe not too it may just be a bluff to make us shift men around i happen to know kuusamo is also fitting out a big fleet in kihlanki in where krasta broke in in kihlanki he repeated its their easternmost port so thats surely bound against gyongyos can the islanders do two big things at once i doubt it if if they do invade can you beat them krasta asked most of what shed done since the algarvians marched into priekule shed done on the assumption that they would win the war if that assumption turned out to be wrong but lurcanio just smiled and said thats why im going down there my dear to help make sure we do exactly that i promise you they shall have a very hard time of it indeed if they try to cross the strait and land in valmiera he got up from the table kissed her and reached down to fondle her breasts through the silk of her pyjama tunic she yelped she couldnt help herself be careful she said theyre sore theyre always sore these days im sorry lurcanio said she judged he meant it he was always sorry when he hurt her without intending to those occasional other times hed burned those into her memory forever off he went as if he owned the mansion hed been here close to four years krasta had grown very used to having him around shed grown fond of him too most of the time of itself her hand flattened on her belly if she hadnt grown fond of him she might not have been carrying a child there of course she might have been too she sipped at a mug of apple cider as she set the mug down she glowered at it apple cider didnt come close to matching tea as a way to start the morning but tea refused to taste the way it was supposed to these days as long as it tasted nasty to her she had to stay away from it shouting for bauska she went upstairs to change the maidservant hurried into her bedchamber how may i help you milady she asked something in her tone of voice rubbed krasta the wrong way it had been there ever since bauska found out she was pregnant it was as if without words the serving woman was saying i had a baby by a redhead and now youre doing the same thing how are we different then but krasta couldnt punish her for a tone of voice she said help me find something to wear im going into priekule aye milady bauska saidand sensibly no more than that every time krasta did go into priekule the city looked sadder and shabbier than it had the time before maybe that was because her prewar memoriesher standard of comparisonreceded ever further into the past and seemed ever rosier but maybe too it was because priekule after going on four years of algarvian occupation did grow sadder and shabbier every day the redheads took whatever they wanted whatever they needed whatever chanced to be left after thatif anything chanced to be leftthey grudgingly let the valmierans keep even the boulevard of horsemen wasnt what it had been priekules chief avenue of splendid shops still showed more wealth than the rest of the city but it had also fallen further from what it was some shops had been shuttered for years others were still selling goods from long ago unable to get more and othersthe ones that did the best businesscatered to the algarvians and to the valmierans male and female who had adhered to their cause redheaded soldiers on leave strolled the boulevard of horsemen staring at the clothes and jewelry and furniture on display and staring in a different way at the valmieran women whod come to the boulevard to shop once upon a time krasta had come to the boulevard of horsemen to display herself as well as to see what was new and expensive and chic now she wished the men in kilts would take no notice of her whenever one of them tried to do more than look she said colonel lurcanio is my protector not all of them spoke valmieran but they did understand the rank andmostlykept their hands to themselves afterwards but one of them spoke to her in classical kaunian if he is an occupation soldier he is not a real man do you want a real man her own classical kaunian was sketchy but she got the gist of that and she managed to say he is a real colonel in the old language the algarvian looked disgusted but he went away after that she discovered she had little trouble telling redheads on occupation duty in priekule from those whod come to the city for surcease from the grinding war in the west the latter were younger rougherlooking and wore tunics and kilts whose light brown was sometimes faded almost to white the soldiers actually garrisoned in the city wore smarter uniforms and were better fed but they put her in mind of dogs set next to wolves and then from behind her someone called hello sweetheart in a voice purely valmieran she turned sure enough there was viscount valnu hurrying toward her he squeezed her and kissed her on the cheek you look good enough to eat he said promises promises she answered which made him laugh but she had trouble caring about badinage today more wearily and more angrily than shed thought she would be she added half the algarvian army seems to think the same thing well i do understand why i do indeed valnus eyes sparkled if you wear your kilt any shorter some of the redheads will think the same thing about you krasta said acid in her voice oh some of them do valnu replied blithely and some of them think i make a proper ally and some of them want to beat me senseless for presuming to wear their clothes life is never dull no krasta for once in her life rather wished it were she took him by the arm buy me a brandy will you im puttyor somethingin your hands valnu pointed in the direction from which theyd both come the tavern back there isnt too bad its only a block or so krasta nodded she remembered walking past it as valnu steered her toward the place he asked is it really true have you got a loaf in the oven with a yawn krasta said aye she hated being sleepy all the time he gave her an arch grin is papa anyone i know you may know him very well she answered really he said and krasta nodded again one of his pale eyebrows rose well well isnt that interesting shall we elope or shall i be angry at you because i may not know papa as well as all that as if you had any business being angry about what i did or didnt do krasta said as valnu held the door to the tavern open for her he laughed she didnt think it was so funny lurcanio was convinced such things were his business if the baby turned out to look like valnu he was liable to make himself very difficult no worsehe wasnt just liable to hed already said he would the brandy didnt taste right any more than tea had lately krasta drank it anyway and drank it fast she needed not to think about lurcanio for a little while that was what she needed but she didnt get it valnu said i hear your friend has gone down to the seashore for a while what if he has krasta said the brandy was hitting her hard maybe because she hadnt drunk any for a while maybe just because she was pregnant when valnu leaned toward her across the little table they shared the smile stayed on his face for the benefit of the fellow behind the bar but his voice came low and urgent you silly little twat are the kuusamans and the lagoans going to land down there does lurcanio think they are he thinks so aye but he isnt sure hes going to talk with some of the algarvians there krasta answered only afterwards did she realize she should have been insulted valnu grunted thats a little more than i knew before but not so much as i would have liked his shrug was almost as ornate as a redheads he gulped his ale then got to his feet i must dash always delighted to see you and the other news you gave me was fascinating too it truly was he left some coins on the tabletop and hurried out another brandy milady the tapman asked no krasta got up and left too out on the boulevard of horsemen a band played a stirring march valmieranstyle music not algarvian and up the boulevard came the first blond soldiers in valmieran uniform krasta had seen since the surrender she stared as a lot of other people were staring but then she realized it wasnt quite valmieran uniform each soldier wore a red green and white patch sewn onto the left sleeve of his tunic to show he served not king gainibu but king mezentio of algarve only a couple of companies of the soldiers marched down the boulevard of horsemen but they were enough krasta hurried back into the tavern and poured down another brandy and then another after that the spirits didnt come close to taking away the taste of what shed seen a roundup bembo sent delminio a reproachful look do we have to his new partner nodded aye we have to youll have done them before wont you back in whatever noaccount town you served in before you got sent here gromheort bembo didnt know why he bothered supplying the name delminio wouldnt care ive done em but i never liked em any way i can get out of it my old sergeant would sometimes excuse one of the fellows in my squad evodio just wasnt any use for that businessdidnt have the stomach for it even when pesaro made him do it hed drink himself blind afterwards your sergeant must have been a softy delminio said which made bembo snort in disbelief but the other constable went on here you get a choice you can do what youre told or you can put on a footsoldiers uniform and head for unkerlant you just talked me into it bembo said i thought i would delminio tapped his fingernail on the refectory tabletop we have had a few fellows who went off to fight king swemmel s whoresons strange birdsstupid birds if you ask me we havent had many and none at all i can think of the past year or so i believe that bembo shivered though it was warm inside the refectory things in unkerlant hadnt been going algarves way the past year or so fine choice he thought can stifle my conscience and do as im told or go off and get myself killed but hed already made his choice and told delminio as much he hardly knew why he was fussing about a conscience distinctly vestigial its nothing i havent done before before going into the kaunian quarter he and delminio and the other constables drew armyissue sticks bembo waved to oraste his old partner from gromheort waved back going hunting he said rounding up kaunians bothered him not at all some of the guards outside the quarter were forthwegians we should send them in for the roundup bembo said they hate the blonds more than we do but delminio shook his head it looks like its a good idea but it just doesnt work some of the kaunians would use their stupid little spell and get away bembo grunted i suppose so its a good thing they havent got a spell to let em look like algarvians his partners hand writhed in a very old sign for turning away evil omens bite your tongue powers above wouldnt that be all we needed a pompous constabulary captain strode out in front of the men hed led to the district he made exactly the sort of speech bembo had known he would make full of the greater glory of algarve and a lot of other things every man there had surely heard too many times before then he said we have to meet our quota nothing and nobody will keep us from meeting our quota now lets go do it the constables tramped into the kaunian quarter as bembo strode past the officer he saw him looking about ready to burst a blood vessel whats his trouble he asked delminio did he think we were going to burst into cheers probably delminio answered have you ever known a captain who wasnt a cursed fool bembo stared at him in astonished delight he didnt make such a bad partner after all cries of alarm and the sound of running feet ahead warned that the kaunians knew the roundup was under way bembo scowled now were going to have to dig the buggers out of their hiding places he grumbled there are times when this job looks a lot too much like work it did however look a great deal better than going off to fight in unkerlant not all the kaunians were hiding not yet something came hurtling down from the sill of an upperstory window in a block of flats it landed on the head of a constables three ranks in front of bembo the noise was that of a brickbat smacking a calabash the constable went down as if blazedperhaps more surely than if hed been blazed he thrashed briefly then lay still blood poured out of him pooling among the cobblestones his bowels let go bembo wrinkled his nose at the sudden stink flies began gathering almost at once the constables shouted and pointed bembo didnt know why they bothered none of them had any better idea than he did from which window the missileby the shards he judged it a flowerpot full of dirthad come every blond in that building the captain screamed i want every blond in that building out here and i want all those whoresons out here in nothing flat capture squads forward his whistle shrilled as if he were ordering footsoldiers into battle against the unkerlanters bembo and delminio werent in a capture squad they were in a holding squad to make sure none of the kaunians escaped once captured they waited in the street for their comrades to start bringing out blonds they waited in the very middle of the street and kept looking nervously up toward the buildings on either side of it kaunian bastards have their nerve delminio said angrily shrieks and screams rang out inside the block of flats before long kaunians started stumbling out of the building the men were all bruised and bloody the women were bruised and bloody too and some of them came down the steps without trousers revenge bembo said delminio nodded makes me wish i was in a capture squad he said bembo answered that with a shrug rape had never been his favorite sport a kaunian spat on the dead algarvian constables corpse all that got him was another beating from the constables in the holding squad bembo swung his bludgeon with as much zeal as anyone else we cant kill the bastard thatd waste his life energy he said but we can sure as blazes make him wish he was dead all right on with the rest of the business the captain said when the last constables came out of the building theyll pay oh how theyll pay only one trouble with that bembo said delminio raised an eyebrow bembo explained if the blonds know were going to do for them why shouldnt they try and boot us in the balls before they go west his partner made a sour face thats a nasty thought youre full of them today arent you heres hoping the kaunians dont have it too kaunians come forth the captain shouted in front of the next block of flats bembo wondered why he bothered predictably no blonds came forth he just gave them another few seconds to conceal themselves before the capture squads swarmed in the extra time didnt seem to matter much though soon more battered kaunians came out the algarvians would take their vengeance through the whole quarter as the holding squads took charge of the blonds the capture squads prised out of their flats the captain kept a tally on a leaf of paper stuck in a clipboard bembo knew what that was all about quota he said not much point to this business if we dont make quota is there privately he wondered if there was any point to it regardless of whether they made quota or not for every kaunian algarve got rid of to fuel its magecraft what would the unkerlanters do kill one of their own or two of their own or three or four maybe king mezentio hadnt realized how very much in earnest about the war king swemmel was if he didnt realize it by now he was a fool and if he did realize it by now maybe he was a fool anyhow for biting off more war than he could chew no i cant say anything like that i shouldnt even think anything like that but bembo couldnt help it he wasnt blind he wasnt deaf no matter what sergeants thought he wasnt stupid if something hovered there in front of his nose and yelled at him at the top of its lungs he couldnt very well not notice it a lot of people he knew didnt seem to think that way though delminio said i still wish wed been on a capture squad some of these kaunian wenches look pretty tasty or they would have before our boys started roughing them up wouldnt mind tearing off a piece not even a little i wouldnt if you want a broad that bad pick one who suits you and throw her down on the cobblestones bembo said nobodys going to do anything but cheer you on and line up behind you not today he looked back toward the crumpled body of the algarvian constable poor whoreson hadnt known what hit him anyhow one second walking along the next dead there were worse ways to go into the next block of flats charged the men from the capture squads as before they beat all the kaunian men and most of the women before sending them out as before they had their sport with some of the women too delminio said they keep on like that theyll be too cursed tired to finish the job theyd better not be the constabulary captain said they can do whatever they wantas long as they make quota if they dont make quota they answer to me there are still plenty of kaunians in here for us to harvest what we need quota harvest those were nice bloodless words they had very little to do with the bruised and bleeding and raped blonds huddled under the sticks of the holding squads they let the captain do his job without thinking much about what he was doing theyd let you do the same if you didnt keep poking and prodding at things bembo told himself its only kaunians after all but the noises they madenot the words he could hardly understand having forgotten the classical kaunian hed had beaten into him at school but the wordless sounds of pain and sorrow and despairwere the same as those so many algarvians might have made bembo violently shook his head what was he doing thinking of algarvians in such straits what was the war about if not making sure algarvians never found themselves in such straits one block of flats after another the capture squads seized kaunians and sent them down to the street at last the captain blew his whistle quota he shouted now lets get em to the caravan depot for transport transport another bloodless word lets send them off to be killed that was what the word meant that was what the captain meant but he didnt have to say it so he didnt have to think it bembo shook his head youre thinking too much yourself again some of the kaunians were too badly battered to have an easy time walking the constables solution to that was to beat them some more they set other blonds to carrying the ones that didnt spur into motion see a constable said as they left the kaunian quarter youre out arent you glad arent you happy forthwegians on the streets jeered the kaunians on their way to the leyline caravan depot by the way some of the kaunians flinched that hurt more than the beatings theyd taken from the algarvians bembo didnt understand that but saw it was so as some desperate kaunian had hurled the flowerpot down on the constables so somebodya womanhurled one word in algarvian at them from an upper story shame delminio laughed so did the captain leading the constables bembo only shrugged the flowerpot had done some damage what could a word do as always shoving too many kaunians into not enough caravan cars was hard work as always the constables did what needed doing and barred the doors from the outside when they finished the windows were already shuttered to bembos surprise the caravan glided off toward the east the direction of algarve and the kaunian kingdoms beyond havent seen that in a while he said whats going on i hear the fellows with the thick spectacles are worried about valmiera delminio answered if lagoas and kuusamo try invading well throw em right back into the strait by the powers above aye bembo said and then wed bloody well better skarnu liked the farm the valmieran underground leaders had found for merkela and little gedominuand now for himself it wasnt so big as the one outside pavilosta where shed lived but the land was richer he chuckled when that thought crossed his mind before the war he wouldnt have been able to tell good farmland from bad he thought merkela would laugh too when he told her that but she didnt she said thats something you should have known she had gedominu on her hip she always did when she needed to do chores and the farm always had chores to do the baby didnt slow her down a bit she got more work done with him than skarnu did without him youre probably right skarnu said no youre certainly right but i didnt i didnt know a lot of things back then he reached out and stroked her cheek i didnt know what mattered to me thats most important she flushed she never seemed to know how to take endearments maybe she hadnt got many while married to old gedominu that hadnt stopped her from loving him or from naming their baby after him before she could say anything in return her eyes swung away from skarnu and toward the road that ran by the little farmhouse someones coming not many people came down that road the farmhouse was a long way from the nearest village let alone ramygala the nearest real town skarnu looked too anyone who did come this way was liable to mean trouble but then he grinned and exclaimed thats raunu youre right merkela waved to the veteran sergeant im always glad to see him come up my road as raunu waved back skarnu raised an eyebrow should i be jealous he asked as soon as the words were out of his mouth he wished he had them back the answer might be aye true raunu was old enough to have fought in the six years war but her first husband had fought in the six years war too so would she mind to skarnus relief she laughed at him instead of getting angry i ought to say you should just to see you fuss skarnu made a face at her and she laughed again then he hurried forward to clasp raunus hand good to see you he said whats up or did you come for a social call raunus snort showed how likely that was captain i like you fine and your lady toohe nodded to merkela whose answering smile was almost warm enough to make skarnu fussbut this is business somethings brewing in the south and youre one of the fellows whos been busy down there alertness surged through skarnu youd better tell me about it he pointed back toward the little farmhouse will you come in and drink some ale while you talk thank you kindly id be glad to as raunu passed merkela he paused to eye little gedominu hes grown a lot since the last time i saw him theyve got a way of doing that babies do forgive the ale merkela said as she poured its bought i didnt brew it myself raunu sipped and shrugged ive had plenty worse dont fret yourself after drinking from his own mug skarnu said the south aye the south raunu agreed the redheads are as nervous down there as a cat trying to watch four mouseholes at once theyve been sending all kinds of bigwigs to the seashore to try and figure out whats going on he coughed colonel lurcanio s down there right now for instance is he skarnu gulped the mug dry his sisters lover had come too close to capturing him back near pavilosta merkela handed him the bottle he poured the mug full again are they down there for the obvious reason are the lagoans and valmierans finally going to cross the strait of valmiera hed never asked that question before hed always been professionally incurious about it what he didnt know nobody could rip from him if things went wrong but raunu wouldnt have come here talking about the south if such a thing were impossible by all the signs mezentios men think they are raunu answered theyre hauling in kaunians from forthweg again and you know what that means murder skarnu said his old sergeant nodded nasty magecraft he added and raunu nodded again powers below eat the algarvians he finished this time both raunu and merkela nodded thats about the size of it raunu said weve wrecked some of the leyline caravans but some of them have got through he scowled even if wed wrecked em all theres nothing really stopping the redheads from grabbing as many valmierans as they need and doing them in only reason they dont do that more i think is to keep from spooking us but if theyve got a chance to throw an invasion back into the sea i figure theyd worry about that first and everything else later youre right merkelas voice held no doubt its just like them the she cursed as foully and fluently as a veteran underofficer are the lagoans and kuusamans going to invade skarnu demanded do we know one way or the other raunu shook his head they wont say aye and they wont say no cursed foreigners dont trust us there are times when they have reason not to merkela said we have traitors in the underground what we know the algarvians have a chance of learning count amatu skarnu said raunu had looked unhappy at merkelas comment but he couldnt argue with that and as if being reminded of amatu reminded him of something else he said the redheads have started recruiting valmierans to fight for em too theyve got maybe a regiments worth some of them paraded through priekule a few days ago wearing algarvian flags on the sleeves of valmieran uniforms merkelas curses this time made the ones shed used before sound like endearments skarnu said they must be scraping the bottom of their own barrel again he did his best to stay professional that way the idea that his own countrymen would go to war for their conquerors was just a piece of information to be analyzed not something to disgust and sicken him try as he would detachment didnt come easy he asked the next question what has all this got to do with me you know whats going on down in the south raunu repeated some people want you to look around and tell them what you think if they think that will help i can do it skarnu said do they want me to travel by myself or with palasta again merkela made a noise down deep in her throat should be jealous she asked raunu looked blank skarnu laughed and shook his head shes a girl he said i like women thanks that satisfied merkela it did more than satisfy her in fact by her smile it pleased her pleased with himself for satisfying her and telling the truth at the same time skarnu turned to raunu when and where do i meet her shell be in the second car of the leyline caravan coming through ramygala at noon tomorrow raunu answered the caravan will take you down to the strait of valmiera heres money for your fare and food and such and for the return trip he pulled a small leather sack from his pocket and gave it to skarnu it clinked after another mug of ale raunu went on his way with the air of a man who had further important business to attend to he probably did merkela nursed little gedominu till he fell asleep then she turned to skarnu in a marked manner if youre going off again she said will you give me something to remember you by what have you got in mind he asked and did as much as he could then and in the night to attend to that when he left early in the morning to walk to ramygala he was yawning even had he been drawn to palasta he wouldnt have been able to do much about it for a while the leyline caravan was late when it finally got to town the young mage was in the car where raunu had said she would be she smiled as he sat down beside her how are you sis he asked just fine thanks she said couldnt be better itll be good to get down to the seaside and say hello to mother skarnu nodded even though mother was fictitious i wish you were my sister went through his mind as it had on the trip to the southeast hed made with palasta id rather have you than krasta but whatever he wished he had no more luck choosing his relatives than did anyone from king gainibu on down because the caravan car filled up fast they spent the trip south talking about the family they didnt have and the plans they hadnt made skarnu kept looking at the men and women around them no telling who might be in king mezentio s pay if valmierans could fight with algarves banner sewn to their sleeves skarnus countrymen were capable of any enormity alsvanga the conductor called when the leyline caravan came to a stop at the depot by the sea all out for alsvanga along with palasta skarnu got out in peacetime he could have taken a ferry across the strait of valmiera to lagoas for the ley line continued even if the land petered out these days there were no ferries lean sharklike little algarvian patrol boats filled the harbor how can the lagoans even think of getting an army across the strait in the face of all this skarnu asked in a low voice i dont know palasta answered also quietly maybe it has something to do with what i felt the last time we went traveling she was young but she was sensible too sensible to speak much about where theyd gone and what theyd done and she was wise to be so sensible too for alsvanga was full of algarviansnot just sailors but also soldiers some of the soldiers were older men in neat uniforms typical occupation troops but skarnu saw a few who were plainly combat veterans their eyes were hard and watchful as his were they didnt care so much about how they dressed a good many of them wore wound badges sometimes with the ribbons that said theyd been hurt more than once theyre ready skarnu murmured theyre as ready as they can be by then he and palasta had left the town of alsvanga and were walking along a country road she led the way she had more senses to guide her toward what needed discovering than skarnu did but she didnt know everything there was to know where are the algarvians coming up with their men she asked only one place they can be pulling em from and thats unkerlant skarnu replied with a certain somber satisfaction and that wont do them any goodno no good at allwhen the fighting picks up there and it will im sure it will powers below eat the redheads palasta whispered fiercely she paused gathered in thought and pointed there the camp where theyre holding the kaumans from forthweg is beyond that stand of beeches but skarnu for once hadnt needed her sorcery to tell him that the wind had swung he could smell the nasty stink of unwashed humanity and human misery theyll have mages around here too somewhere wont they he asked palasta nodded so did skarnu grimly aye theyre ready all right he said if lagoas and kuusamo are going to cross the strait here i dont see how they can hope to land he kicked at the dirt curse it ten now that so many practical mages came to the wilds of the naantali district to train more copies of kuusaman news sheets also arrived when pekka walked into the refectory of a morning she found fernao working his way through one youre reading it without a lexicon she said and softly clapped her hands together to applaud him ive always been good at languages he replied where is this place called kihlanki somewhere in your east isnt it as far east as you can go and stay in kuusamo pekka said as she sat down beside him she wasnt so nervous about being with him as she had been after they ended up in bed though she did sometimes wonder whether that lack of nerves was a good sign or not why he waved the news sheet because unless im reading this wrong it says that your navy has gone and launched a big fleet into the bothnian ocean from there bound for the islands gyongyos still holds let me see pekka said fernao handed her the sheet their fingers brushed for a moment fernao noticed it his breath caught pekka noticed it too and did her best to pretend she hadnt she quickly read through the article fernao had been talking about you read it rightly thats what it says if any lagoan news sheet published a story like that king vitor s men would close it down the next daymaybe the same day fernao said it tells the enemy what youre going to do pekka shrugged we dont like to close down news sheets unless we have a truly important reason ive seen things like that before we would rather be open and tell ourselves the truth than have someone say we may not even if it hurts your kingdom fernao asked even if it hurts some in the short run pekka said in the long run we think its better fernao scratched his head you kuusamans are peculiar people he smiled a lopsidedand oddly attractivesmile maybe thats why im so fond of you he set his hand on hers something close to panic swept over her as if hed made much more overt much cruder advances what caused part of the panic was that alarm wasnt the only reason her heart beat faster even so she took her hand away thats over she said it has to be over why he asked in much the same tones her son uto might have used with an endless series of whys when he was four years old she felt like answering because which had the virtue of stopping that whole leyline caravan of questions in fact she did say because but went on i have a family and i want to go on having a family onceshe shruggedanything can happen once if something like that happened again and again though what would i have to go home to me fernao answered he meant it she could see as much that made it worse not better its impossible she said it has to be she grimaced that left her open to another why instead of using it fernao just shook his head it doesnt have to be that way he said youve decided you want it to be that way which isnt the same thing at all if you think im going to quit trying to get you to change your mind youre wrong he told her that in fluent idiomatic kuusaman a few months before he would have had to use classical kaunian to get his meaning across pekka wished he still did that would have accented the differences between them she said if you go on this way now youll make me angry that wont do you any good fernao studied her face plainly trying to decide if she meant it she did her best to look stern partly to convince him partly to convince herself most of her recognized the need for that part of her though kept saying things like of course you can enjoy yourself here and then break it off when the wars over or when leino comes home or when you and fernao get assigned to two different places a serving woman came up and asked her what she wanted she ordered smoked salmon and eggs glad for the distraction how am i going to make fernao believe i dont want to go to bed with him again when i have trouble making myself believe it she wondered she called after the serving woman oh and a pot of tea too the woman nodded pekka hoped the tea would help her think straight she hoped something would by fernaos expression he knew she was fighting a war with herself he wasnt of two minds he knew exactly what he wanted in a way that was flattering in another way it just made life more difficult before fernao could find anything to say a serving girl came up to the table they were sharing mistress pekka she asked aye lost in her own thoughts pekka needed a moment to realize it wasnt the woman whod taken her breakfast order what is it linna she asked she needed another moment to realize that whatever it was it wasnt good linna was pale and biting her lip whats wrong fernao was a jump ahead of her is it something to do with ilmarinen looking paler than ever linna nodded is he pekka broke off the question without finishing it ilmarinen wasnt a young man and linna was a young pretty woman if hed tried to do something too strenuous he might have died happy but that could only be horror for the person in whose company he was at the time but linna said i dont know where he is i went to his chamber this morning and i found two envelopes this one was addressed to me she pulled out an envelope and took a note from it it says if i come back well celebrate if i dont theres a little something in my will to remember me by have fun with it i had fun with you she folded the leaf of paper and then produced another envelope this one has your name on it mistress pekka so it does pekka took the envelope with a certain reluctance she glanced over at fernao do i want to find out whats in it i think youd better he was all business now not mooning over her at all pekka sighed i think id better too but do i want to she opened the envelope and pulled out the leaf of paper inside fernao and linna both bent toward her to see what ilmarinen had written i still think im right the note said and i think i can prove it im going to try anyhow the rest of the page was covered with closely written calculations right about what linna asked whats he talking about of course the calculations made no sense to her pekka said im not quite sure myself ill have to look at this thank you for bringing it to me its something i need to see and something you dont she added by implication linna took the hint all right she said please let me know what you find out though im worried about him she went off looking back over her shoulder when the other serving woman brought breakfast a moment later pekka hardly noticed she and fernao had their heads together both of them bent over the note linna had brought their index fingers traced ilmarinens calculations line by line pekkas finger moved a little faster than fernaos when she got to the bottom of the paper she exclaimed he cant do that fernao grunted he didnt say anything till hed got to the bottom too then he replied no but he thinks he can he may even be right but i dont think so he switched to classical kaunian for precisions sake see this indeterminacy twothirds of the way down he pointed he treats it as if its value were defined but it is not if he acts on that basis i believe the spell will fail pekka studied she nodded thank you she said i missed that when i hurried through i think youre right im not sure but i think so but if the spell does fail how will it fail some spells that didnt work just didnt work the world went on as if nothing had happened others fernao summed up the others in one classical kaunian word energetically she feared he was right they both got to their feet your breakfast mistress pekka the serving woman said pekka ignored her but hurried out of the refectory out of the hostel with fernao he limped and leaned on his stick but still moved fast enough to suit her when they went to the stable for a carriage they discovered one was already gone are you heading out to the blockhouse with master ilmarinen their driver asked he left a while ago did he pekka said tonelessly well then maybe youd better hurry hadnt you the fellow barely had time to nod before she scrambled into the passenger compartment with fernao she looked at the lagoan mage if it does fail energetically it occurs to me that we might get there just in time to be caught in the energy release aye that occurred to me too fernao agreed we have to try though dont we he waited for her to nod then went on theres a worse possibility too you know he might succeed in going back through time in changing things pekka shook her head i dont believe that powers above i dont want to believe it and if he does it no matter what i believe she shuddered fernao took her hand she let him she was glad of the contact if he can meddle others will be able to do it too he said and we wont have a past to call our own anymore pekka leaned out the carriage faster she told the driver obligingly he got the horses up to a trot are you sure you want to do that fernao said if were late we have to try pekka said though every instinct in her shouted for turning around and going the other way if ilmarinen failed energetically leino would lose his wife and uto would grow up not remembering much of his mother pekka clutched at fernaos hand suddenly absurdly she wanted him very much no chance of that not now i know i might die at any moment thats what it is the carriage stopped pekka and fernao piled out she ran for the blockhouse he followed at the best pace he could manage in spite of the stick his long legs made him not much slower than she when pekka threw open the door her worst fear was finding the place empty that would mean ilmarinen had done what hed set out to do and that would mean disaster but there stood the elderly mage still incanting stop pekka shouted he hadnt come to the indeterminacy but he couldnt be far away he smiled and shook his head and kept on with what he was doing fernao wasted no time talking he simply tackled ilmarinen and knocked him down ilmarinen shouted in fury but fernao bad leg and all was much bigger and younger and stronger than he pekka quickly chanted a counterspell to neutralize the sorcerous potential ilmarinens magecraft had built up you idiots ilmarinen cried and then several choicer epithets no fernao and pekka said together she went on your calculations have an error in them fernao found it and im sure hes right ilmarinen kept right on cursing pekka didnt care she still had a futureand the world despite ilmarinens best efforts still had a past king donalitu of jelgava paced along habakkuks icy deck once more leino made a wish wishes had very little to do with magecraft the kuusaman sorcerer knew as much he made this one anyhow and whether by the powers above or just dumb luck it came true as donalitu was pompously declaiming and so we approach once more the land from which i was unjustly driven almost four long years ago his feet went out from under him and he landed hard on the royal backside leino had all he could do not to clap his hands in glee as uto would have done like everyone else aboard habakkuk donalitu wore shoes with cleats or spikes to keep such mishaps from occurring maybe he hadnt paid attention when people had explained how to walk in them he didnt seem much in the habit of paying attention to anything beside leino xavega did clap her hands but even she tried to pretend she hadnt done it afterwards she grinned at leino he smiled back if it hadnt been for donalitu they never would have ended up in bed together if it hadnt been for donalitu she still would have looked down her nose at himnot hard when she was taller than he was he wasnt about to arrange a dissolution from pekka to spend the rest of his days with xavega she remained badtempered arrogant difficult prejudiced he could see all that clearly enough but when she stripped off her clothes and lay down beside him there was never a dull moment he hadnt been sleeping well aboard habakkuk he did now assisted by captain brunho donalitu got to his feet and managed to stay upright he started to go on with his remarks but didnt get the chance one after another screeching with fury dragons flapped their way into the air and flew off toward the west not even a king so manifestly foolish as donalitu was foolish enough to try to outshout a dragon leino looked around and then back over his shoulder every ley line leading west toward the jelgavan mainland was full of ships some of them flew lagoas crimson and gold banners quite a few more though showed the sky blue and sea green of kuusamo xavega might not think much of either his homeland or his countrymen but kuusamo was stronger than her kingdom since she thought well enough of him to open her legs her other opinions distressed him less than they had he knew that was wrong but had trouble doing anything about it he didnt want to think about her other opinions just now anyway he said i hope the ruse worked when the fleet sailed from kihlanki we made it very plain we were sailing against gyongyosso plain the algarvians couldnt help but find out about it all the ships flew kuusaman flags then till we were out of sight of land everything seems fine so far xavega said we are close enough to the jelgavan coast to send out our dragons and the algarvians have not troubled us with dragons of their own or with ships of their own or with leviathans it looks as if our surprise is complete it will not stay complete for long leino said having dragons drop eggs on you and flame your soldiers will probably draw your notice aye i suppose so xavega said leino hid a sigh hed tried to be playful with his classical kaunianthe only language they had in common since hed never needed to learn lagoan and xavega showed less than no interest in everything kuusaman except him had she even noticed he shook his head she hadnt so what are you doing with her he wondered but the answer to that was as obvious as it was trite im screwing her till we annoy the people in the cubicles on either side of ours hed been surprised at how much a man in his midthirties could dopleasantly surprised very pleasantly we have to smash them xavega said if we do not smash them the landing on the jelgavan coast will fail and it must not fail it had better not anyhow leino agreed and so the war comes back to eastern derlavai i wonder if the jelgavans will thank us for it of course not xavega saidshe was no more fond of jelgavans as a people than of kuusamans as a people but then she asked a perfectly reasonable question does king donalitu seem grateful no as far as king donalitu is concerned he is doing us a favor by allowing us to convey him back to jelgava on habakkuk that made xavega laugh though leino hadnt been joking he looked toward the west more dragons were flying in that direction not only from habakkuk but also from other iceships in her class and from the smaller more conventional which to his way of thinking also meant oldfashioned dragonhaulers kuusamo had devised to fight the war against gyongyos in the wide reaches of the bothnian ocean again some of the dragons were painted red and gold but more were kuusamos sky blue and sea green along with the ships that carried dragons were a great many more that bore soldiers and others with behemoths and horses and unicorns and eggtossers and all the other supplies an army needed to fight on land these days xavega said this is a far mightier armada than the one the algarvians used to take sibiu so it is leino said but the algarvians were sneaky in a different way for their ships did not use the ley lines at all they were just sailing ships like those of ancient days they got into the sibian ports before the defenders even realized they were there xavega cared nothing for such details this fleet is mightier she said again which was indeed true lagoas is mightier than algarve taken by itself that struck leino as much less obviously true coughing a couple of times he said kuusamo has also had a certain amount to do with this fleetthat certain amount being about two parts in three well aye a certain amount xavega allowed reluctantly by her tone that certain amount might have been about one part in ten a shout rose from habakkuk tall watchtower land ho down on the deck leino couldnt see the derlavaian mainland not yet before long though he would habakkuk and the other dragonhaulers would want to stay as close to the mainland as they could to let the beasts aboard them fly as far into jelgava as they could before too long the kuusaman and lagoan dragons would fly from farms on jelgavan soil but kuusaman and lagoan footsoldiers would first have to take that soil away from the algarvians xavega said still no trouble from king mezentio s men they are all looking across the strait of valmiera thinking we would try to strike against them there but we fooled them by sailing out of that eastern port she didnt remember the name leino nodded we seem to have fooled them the better our job of that the smaller the price we shall have to pay he pointed looksome of the ships are sending their landing boats toward the shore sure enough men were scrambling down nets and rope ladders from the leyline transports to the smaller craft that would take them up onto the beaches of southeastern jelgava because a good many ley lines ran toward those beaches the smaller craft also had sorcerers aboard to take advantage of the worlds energy grid in earlier invasions by sea some kuusamans had had to try to reach gyongyosianheld islands from their transports in rowboats and little sailboats logistics here had improved they are not going to be able to make behemoths or even unicorns climb down ladders xavega said how do they propose to get them into the battle i do not know leino answered with a shrug i have not tried to find out either i must admit keeping habakkuk going has been plenty to occupy me for now if i thought they did not have a way i would worry but i expect they do if i transfer to the land campaign i suppose i will have to worry about that kind of thing he looked west again now he could see the mainland of jelgava hed been here on holiday with pekka but that was at the resorts of the far north whatever this was a holiday it was not i hope its not a holiday for the algarvians either it had better not be or were all in trouble he didnt just see the mainland he saw smoke rising from whatever algarvian fortresses or barracks or other installations the dragons could find and he also saw fountains of water rising from the sea not far in front of the foremost ships of the invasion fleet he cursed softly in kuusaman cursing in classical kaunian never satisfied him the dragons havent wrecked all their eggtossers too bad an egg landed on one of the small craft taking soldiers toward the shore after leino blinked away the flash of light from the burst of sorcerous energy he stared at the spot hoping to spy survivors clinging to bits of wreckage but he saw only empty sea there empty sea and other landing boats hurrying toward the shore xavega had chanced to be looking in the same direction brave men she said quietly aye but leino wondered then he shrugged whether theyd been brave or terrified what difference did it make the egg hadnt cared and what they were now irretrievably was sunk a moment later another egg struck a boat that vessel too vanished as if it had never been and a moment later alarm bells aboard habakkuk clanged a dowser shouted enemy dragons and pointed toward the west for a long moment leino didnt spot them he was looking high in the sky where the lagoan and kuusaman beasts had flown when his gaze fell closer to the sea he spied the dragonstwo of them a leader and his wingmandriving straight toward the fleet just above the wavetops each of them flamed a light craft full of soldiers then they pressed on toward the bigger ships of the fleet itself every heavy stick aboard those bigger ships started blazing at the algarvian dragonfliers none struck home though the dragons flamed a few men on the deck of a leyline cruiser not far from habakkuk that done they dodged their way back toward the jelgavan mainland i hope they get home safe xavega said i do not care if they are the foe they have great courage algarvic peopleslagoans as well as algarvianswere prone to such chivalrous notions leino didnt argue with xavega but he didnt agree with her either as far as he was concerned a particularly brave enemy was an enemy who particularly needed killing the algarvian dragons did escape the massed blazing power of the whole allied fleet but they were the only two enemy dragons leino saw that whole day long and even as they escaped the first small craft let their soldiers out on the beaches of jelgava now the algarvians had a new fight on their hands talsu was discovering that life in a tent was less different from life in his home than hed expected he was warm enough he had a roof over his head true it was a cloth roof but with spring edging toward summer that mattered very little in skrunda if he was still under canvas when rain came with fall and winter that would be a different story hed worry about it then thoughhe couldnt change it now after the eggs from kuusaman and lagoan dragons burned him and his family out of their house he was glad they were all alive and in one piece worst about sharing the tent on the edge of townone of manywith his father and mother and sister was that he and gailisa had so little privacy his parents were considerate enough to go out walking every now and then and he and his wife did the same for them both pairs taking ausra along as needed but still he also went out walking and into town for other reasons than privacy these days for most of four years ever since the jelgavan army collapsed and king donalitu fled to lagoas hed taken algarvian occupation for granted it wasnt that he liked the redheadshe despised them but he hadnt seen anything that would get them out of his kingdom in certain minimal ways accepting coins with king mainardo s beaky profile on them in making clothes for algarvian officers in not using his every waking moment thinking up ways to dismay or kill themhed acquiesced in their presence in skrunda everything was different now after days of uneasy silence skrundas news sheets had to catch up with rumor and admit what could no longer be denied the islanders had landed on the derlavaian mainland theyd landed in fact not far from balvithe capital of jelgava lay close to the beaches where theyd come ashore after fetching a news sheet back to the tent talsu waved it in his fathers face just listen to this well i will if you ever read it to me traku answered all right talsu stopped waving the sheet and started reading from it king mainardo the rightful ruler of the kingdom of jelgava expresses his complete confidence that his forces and those of his valiant algarvian allies will succeed in repelling the vicious invasion by the air pirates whose raids have already caused the jelgavan people so much hardship hed be pissing in his pants if he wore pants instead of algarvian kilts traku had heard enough newssheet stories to have little trouble extracting accurate meaning from deliberately inaccurate words he screwed up his face and made as if to spit im sure mainardo loses hours and hours of sleep worrying about the jelgavan people arent you he spoke in a low voice canvas walls were thinner than those of brick and wood aye worrying about how to do more and worse to us than he has up till now talsu said also quietly but waittheres more jelgavan forces and their bold algarvian comrades have inflicted heavy losses on the enemy and are making gains in several areas fierce fighting continues all along the line the invaders hopes for a speedy triumph are doomed to disappointment you know what thats really saying dont you of course i do his father looked irate think im stupid or something it means the redheads tried to boot em back into the ocean and they cursed well couldnt do it or dyou think im wrong not me talsu shook his head thats what i think it means too and heres the best part of all an impostor claiming to be the abdicated fugitive king donalitu has been reported to be in the grasp of the invaders this effort to incite the contented populace of jelgava will surely meet the failure it deserves so the real kings back eh traku said cant very well mean anything else can it talsu returned no trakus tough rather battered features wore a thoughtful expression those fellows who were scrawling street signs about the king coming back knew what they were talking about didnt they seems that way doesnt it talsu said i wish i knew who in blazes they were id join em in a minute and youd best believe thats true there his voice dropped to a whisper and of course whether the antialgarvian underground would want anything to do with him was a different question he knew it hed gone into a dungeon and then hed come out again the assumption had to be that anybody who came out of a dungeon cooperated with the redheads and so talsu had at least by giving them names that the names were of people at least as likely to collaborate with them as to struggle against them might not matter he knew as much though it pained him his hand went to the scar on his flank the scar from an algarvian soldiers knife that had pained him too and a great deal more outside some called in fair but algarvianaccented jelgavan is this being where i am finding traku the tailor aye traku and talsu said together talsu didnt know what was going through his fathers mind as for him he quickly had to send his thoughts down different ley lines the redheads might be in trouble in jelgava but they hadnt been heaved out of skrundaand skrunda unlike balvi lay a long way from the invasion here the algarvians still ruled the roost as the redheada captain by his rank badgesducked into the tent talsu cautiously asked what can we do for you today sir you are still getting cloth i am needing a new kilt the officer answered his eye fell on the news sheet which talsu had set on a blanket he pointed to it you are reading this talsu stood mute so did his father admitting it might land them in trouble denying it might be too obvious a lie the algarvians laugh was bitter what are you saying when my back is turning talsu saw even less way to answer that than the other question and so he didnt traku must have been thinking along with him for all he said was aye i can get cloththe bank didnt burn so ive still got some money what sort of kilt will you need sir lightweight or something heavier are you staying here or have they sent you to unkerlant lightweight the redhead said i am to be staying and fighting in jelgava i am to be staying until they are capturing me or until they are killing me the officers over me are so ordering and i am obeying and the powers below are eating everything here lightweight talsu echoed hed borrowed a tape measure from another tailor who remained in his own shop if youll let me take your measurements the algarvian laughed it was not a happy laugh talsu had laughed that same kind of laugh sitting around a fire with other soldiers while he was in the army it said here we are and we may as well laugh because nothing else is going to help either having laughed the captain said i am seeing your troubles you are not knowing if i am trying to trap you again talsu stood mute so did his father the algarvian was right but admitting as much was dangerous talsu stepped forward with the tape measure i am telling you this the algarvian said you are not having to say anything algarve in jelgava is he used a word in his own language talsu didnt know what it meant but the officers gestures were expressive enough for him to get the idea ruined was the politest term he could think of idly he wondered if algarvians would be able to talk at all with their hands tied how are we fighting here the redhead asked all our good men all our good behemoths and dragonswhere are they being here no unkerlant he used that word again with vast scorn if thats what you think why fight talsu asked why not just give up no no no no the algarvian wagged a forefinger under talsus nose no doing that i am being a soldier fighting is what i am doing and who is knowing he shrugged an elaborate algarvian shrug maybe kuusamo and lagoas will be making mistakes we can be doing thatso can they be doing it if they are making mistakes we may be winning yet and so another shrugi am fighting still he sounded like a soldier sure enough talsu hadnt gone into the fight against algarve with any great hope or expectation of victory but hed kept at it till his superiors surrendered on a personal level he didnt suppose he could blame the redhead for doing the same on a level slightly different from the personal talsu shook his head if he started thinking that way hed stab the officer instead of measuring him for a kilt were the fighting right outside of skrunda he would have thought about that as things were nobody was going to kick the algarvians out of this part of jelgava any time soon and so with a small sigh he advanced with the tape measure not with a knife traku drummed a fingernail on the threelegged stool that was the sole bit of real furniture in the tent after talsu finished measuring the algarvian his father said what with things being the way they are right nowhis wave encompassed the canvas walls and the blankets on bare groundi think maybe youd better pay up front he named his price the algarvian raised an eyebrow talsu expected him to raise a fussmezentios men to a jelgavan were some of the fussiest people ever born but instead of turning red and throwing a tantrum or even haggling the captain dug into his belt pouch and set silver on the stool here he said and started to walk out as he reached for the tent flap he looked back over his shoulder two days time three talsu said three the redhead agreed i am seeing you in three days time then he ducked out of the tent and strode away once he was gone talsu and his father stared at each other did you hear that talsu breathed did you hear that by the powers above theres a redhead who doesnt think algarve can hang on in jelgava king donalitu s back traku said were going to be free again aye talsu said but then quite suddenly no were going to have our own king back again its not exactly the same thing his father made a questioning noise talsu explained when the redheads arrested me and threw me in the dungeon the fellow who interrogated me wasnt an algarvian he was a jelgavan doing the same job for king mainardo as hed done for king donalitu and if king donalitu s giving orders in balvi again what do you want to bet that same son of a whore will go right on doing his job in the dungeon except with different prisoners traku grunted gaolers are all bastards no matter who they work for oh aye talsu nodded but you have to be a particular kind of bastard to do your job without caring who you work for he hesitated then added and you have to be a particular kind of bastard to want your dungeons full of peopleif you happen to be a king i mean traku looked around as if fearing people were leaning up outside the tent with hands cupped to their ears even in the days before the war such words incautiously spoken could cause a man to disappear for months for years sometimes forever if its a choice between our bastard and the algarvians bastard ill take ours he said at last oh aye talsu said again and then sighed thats the choice weve got sure enough i wish we had another one but i dont know what it would be most kings are whoresons nothing else but they got supper that evening from kettles full of slop not much better than hed eaten in his army days after they brought their bowls back to the tent gailisa said somebody who came into the grocery shop today said that mainardo was going to run away from balvi and back to algarve that would be wonderful even the redheads dont think they can go on holding our kingdom down traku said and recounted the algarvian captains words earlier in the day talsu bent down to spit a bit of gristle onto the ground then he said the redheads may not think they can hold jelgava but theyve got to keep trying why his wife asked why dont they just go away and leave us alone i wish they would his sister added so do i ausra talsu said but if they go away the lagoans and kuusamansand i suppose our own army if we have an army againwill follow them right on into algarve and so theyve got to fight here to hang on to their own kingdom well just have to help throw them out then ausra said not quite so quietly as talsu would have liked he didnt answer that hed tried to help throw out the redheads and what had it got him time in the dungeon and an undeserved name as a collaborator of course his timing had been bad if i saw the chance would i fight the algarvians again he wondered he gnawed on another piece of gristly meat that helped hide the fierce smile on his face of course i would if only i could kill them all ilmarinen looked at fernao as if he hated him he probably did you miserable pup ilmarinen said i was after experimental proof fernao shrugged you wouldnt have got it even youve admitted you ignored that indeterminacy all you would have done was take out a big piece of the landscape and you have to admit that too i dont have to do any such thing and im not about to either ilmarinen retorted it might have worked fine well never know now thanks to you they could find out ilmarinen could go off and repeat his experiment fernao kept his mouth shut if he suggested any such thing the kuusaman mage was altogether too likely to take him up on it he could think of nothing he wanted less to keep ilmarinen from coming up with the same notion he changed the subject our armies are pushing farther into jelgava so far the algarvians havent started killing people to try to stop them so far ilmarinen echoed he leaned across the refectory table but i have friends in interesting places one of them said the redheadsthe other redheads i mean not your lotmoved a lot of kaunians from forthweg down to the edge of the strait of valmiera because they thought the blow would fall there how long will it take to drag those poor whoresons to jelgava or else to start hauling jelgavans off the street not long fernao said ilmarinen grunted thereyou see youre not as foolish as you look and i was trying to go back and change all thatchange everything thats happened since this war startedand you and pekka had the nerve to try to stop me you ought to be ashamed of yourselves his eyebrow rose you ought to be ashamed of yourselves for all kinds of reasons but thats the one ive got in mind right now i dont know what youre talking about fernao replied and ilmarinen laughed raucously ignoring him the lagoan mage switched to classical kaunian and supposejust suppose mindthat you were right about what you tried to do suppose the sorcery does have a true timelike component i do not think it does but suppose as much for the sake of argument i have supposed as much ilmarinen said in the same language that is why i tried to do what i did and if i had succeeded the world would be a different place and a better place right now because of pekka that wouldnt make you so happy i know but its still true he spoke the language of scholarship as fluently and idiomatically as he used kuusaman different aye better fernao shrugged perhaps you would have changed things to your hearts desire but what would the next person who meddled in the past have done what about the fellow after hint how long before we had no true past at all only an endless war of changes if the kaunian empire had beaten the algarvians at the battle of gambolo would it have fallen if sibiu had beaten lagoas in our sea wars two hundred and fifty years ago the sibs would have got more from siaulia and the islands in the great northern sea than they did and we less and so on with every kingdom trying to set its lost cause to rights do you see he spoke classical kaunian like most scholars and mages well enough but without real liveliness but that didnt matter so much here all he wanted to do was get his point across and he did ilmarinen didnt answer right away youve given this a good deal of thought havent you he said at last aye fernao answered pekka and i had little else to do while going out to the blockhouse but think and worry the other thing we worried about was how much energy your spell would release if it went wrong nothing you could have done about thatexcept jumping on me and stopping me the way you did i mean ilmarinen said he added i saw the carriage you came in you should have spent your time screwingthe driver wouldnt have known if you were going to die at least you would have died happy fernao got to his feet you are impossible he said fortunately the spell you tried is also impossible he wanted to warn ilmarinen not to try it again but refrained once more he wished he could have strutted away with his nose in the air his permanent limp and the stick he used prevented that he did the best he could given his physical limitations it was good enough to make ilmarinen laugh at his retreating back and he got his nose high enough in the air to keep him from paying much attention to where he was going he almost ran over pekka before he realized she was there what did i do to you she asked you he replied nothing sweetheart her expression warned him not to say such things it always had ever since hed fled his own bedchamber after theyd made love but this time he was able to go on ilmarinen on the other hand pekkas face cleared she was always ready to be annoyed at the elderly theoretical sorcerer even if he was her own countryman what now she asked oh nothing new fernao said but he still thinks hes right in spite of the evidence and he broke off again and what pekka asked when fernao didnt answer right away she drew her ownaccurateconclusion hes teasing you about what we did is he fernao nodded pekka wagged a finger at him you see going to bed didnt stop the gossip it didnt slow it down it didnt solve anything but it was wonderful fernao said that didnt solve anything either it just brought the annoyed look back to pekkas face it made things more complicated she said we dont need things to be more complicated right now the most important thing we can do is work on this magecraft anything that gets in the wayanything at allwe have to push aside she didnt deny that theyd had a good time in bed shed never denied it but she did keep on behaving as if it hadnt happened that might not have been calculated to drive fernao out of his mind but it certainly had that effect what are we going to do he said when i get the chance im going back to my husband and my son pekka answered as for you i hope you find a wonderful lagoan womanor even a wonderful kuusaman woman if you find your tastes running that way i already have fernao told her one without encumbrances pekka told him when she saw he didnt understand the word in kuusaman she translated it into classical kaunian he could have done without such thoughtfulness she added and im not feeling any too wonderful right now either fernao looked around by some accident nobody was staring at them as they stood just outside the refectory that wouldnt last long though it couldnt by the very nature of things while he had the chance fernao kicked at the boards of the floorafter carefully positioning his stick so he didnt fall on his face whats the use he muttered whats the cursed use you see pekka set a hand on his arm it was a sympathetic gesture not an affectionate oneor not an affectionate one of the sort he craved it complicated your life too even without encumbrances now she used the kuusaman word without explanation it wouldnt have if he said if id decided to keep doing what we did once pekka said and he nodded she shook her head the complications would just have taken longer to get here and been worse when they finally did im sorry fernao by the powers above im very sorry but i cant imagine anything that would make me change my mind now all right he said but it wasnt all right nor anywhere close he limped off toward his room pekka didnt come after him or try to call him back he hadnt really expected her to hed hopedbut expectation had the encumbrance of truth while hope lived its own life wild and free once he got back to his chamber he wondered why hed come all he had here was the chance to be alone with his misery he sat down on the bed then wished he hadnt sitting there made him think of those frantic few minutes when hed got everything he wanted only to discover that once hed got it he couldnt keep it that felt worse than not getting it for now he could look back on what hed had know it was real and knowor at least be certain enough for all practical purposesit wouldnt happen again muttering something pungent under his breath he got up and left his room he did at least know where he was going to the crystallomancers chamber where the mages and their crystals kept the hostel in the naantali district connected to the outside world throughout the year as spring gave way to summer getting here was easy enough but that didnt hold in fall or early spring or through the seemingly endless winter blizzards i want a crystal for private communication with my grandmaster he told the kuusaman mage in charge of the chamber of course she said it hadnt always been of course hed had to make a nuisance of himself to gain the privilege only by pointedly asking whether lagoas was truly an equal ally to kuusamo had he prevailed the chief crystallomancer took him to a crystal in the corner the couple of kuusamans closest to that crystal moved away so they couldnt listen to him here you are the chief said do remember that the algarvians are always trying to spy on our emanations i will fernao said looking discontented the kuusaman mage went back to her desk fernao murmured the charm that would link this crystal to the one in grandmaster pinhieros office back in setubal as the crystal activated light flared inside it a moment later pinhieros image filled the glass globe whos that the grandmaster said peering into his own crystal then he recognized fernao ah its you what do you want what sort of trouble are you in so far as fernao knew pinhiero hadnt heard about his entanglement with pekka fernao hadnt told him anyway which might not have been the same thing pinhiero could learn things from all sorts of unlikely places fernao said when will the first contingent of lagoan mages come here for training we really need our own wizards familiar with the new magecraft now that were fighting on the derlavaian mainland speaking his own tongue with pinhiero felt odd after using classical kaunian and kuusaman for so long theyll be leaving setubal day after tomorrow pinhiero said scratching at one end of his graying sandy mustache the demon of getting them ready of course was making sure none of them would start whispering in mezentios ear would you believe it we found one mage the algarvians planted on us twentyfive years ago hed had a past made up that was perfect rill you looked really hard and he speaks lagoan better than i do im glad you found him fernao said nowcan you find someone to take over for me here i think ive done about as much in kuusamo as i can do pinhiero shook his head in a word no in two words definitely no i dont care if your affair with that kuusaman mage didnt work out the way you hoped this is more important than you my boy this is for the guild and the kingdom you stay right where you are fernao scowled he might have known pinhiero had a peephole of some sort into the gossip here aye grandmaster he said and broke the etheric connection with no more of a goodbye than that king swemmel glared out of the crystal at marshal rathar rathar stolidly stared back he much preferred dealing with the king of unkerlant at a distance to trying to deal with him facetoface we are not amused and we are not pleased swemmel said in his harsh highpitched voice im sorry to hear that your majesty rathar replied that on the whole was true when swemmel felt aggrieved he was even more hairraisingly erratic than in his calmer moods they mocked us the king snarled they mocked us most unforgivablycount gusmao and in especial lord moisio were they not ministers of kingdoms also at war against algarvehe couldnt bring himself to say friendly kingdomstheir heads should answer for it we do not tolerate insolence rathar wondered when anyone had last dared be insolent to swemmel not for a good many years the marshal was sure of that but the ministers from lagoas and kuusamo had the advantage of not being unkerlanter subjects swemmel risked real wrath if he abused them of course even that might not stop him if he reckoned himself provoked enough they have the gall to say i told you so to us to usl swemmel snapped still fuming gusmao and moisio had told swemmel what was going to happen and theyd told him the truth he hadnt seemed much interested in hearing it at the timehed actively resisted believing it at the timebut it had turned out to be true and your majesty now that the lagoans and the kuusamans finally are on the derlavaian mainland that can only help us rathar said the redheads cant concentrate all their strength against unkerlant alone that is so swemmel sounded unhappy about admitting even that much but rathar had distracted him aye that is so and we shall make the algarvians pay he stabbed a finger out at rathar even though it was only an image in the crystal the marshal had all he could do not to flinch do you suppose that if they capture the algarvian pretender in jelgava they shall use him as we used the algarvian pretender in grelz i dont know your majesty rathar tried to imagine the kuusamans boiling king mainardo alive the picture refused to form in his mind but he couldnt very well tell his sovereign that well never mind swemmel waved a hand you carry on with what you have been ordered and mind you marshalwe expect to see results his image vanished the crystal flared then went back to being an inert glass globe as often happened after a conversation with the king rathar needed to shake himself to return to the real world the commandants headquarters in pewsum werent so very much not as the real world went rathar got up stretched and walked out onto the street no one followed him no one dared disturb his privacy who would disturb the most powerful man in unkerlant save swemmel alone after a little while general gurmun dared gurmun from everything rathar had seen had as much daring as any officer needed and a little more besides what news from the king he asked marshal rathar eyed him gurmun also had as much ambition as any officer needed and a little more besides one of the posts to which an ambitious unkerlanter general might aspire was the one rathar held even so the question was reasonable picking his words with care rathar replied his majesty is irked at the kuusaman and lagoan ministers for not being as polite as they might have when talking about their invasion of jelgava hes got a right to be irked too if anybody wants to know what think gurmun answered weve been carrying the load against algarve all by ourselves the past three years and now the islanders are crowing like roosters because theyve taken on a little powers below eat em i say that held some truth it certainly matched swemmels view of things rathar said they havent been idle not altogether gurmun snorted the marshal went on and as i told his majesty the more the redheads have to put into fighting lagoas and kuusamo the less theyll have left to use against us well thats true enough gurmun nodded vigorously it should have happened last year or maybe even the year before but it is true now well make mezentios men pay too i expect we will rathar agreed our edge has always been in manpower and behemoths and dragons now it will be a bigger edge and i intend to take advantage of it he pointed to general gurmun youre going to help me do it too gurmun showed his teeth in a wolfs smile thats just what ive got in mind lord marshal im really looking forward to it were all looking forward to it general rathar replied weve been looking forward to it for a long time if all goes well we get to show the algarvians what good scholars weve been these past three years did the king say anything about the timing of what weve got laid on gurmun asked not a word more than a little relieved at that rathar shook his head were still two weeks away more or less thats always provided the redheads dont do something we didnt expect theyre not bloody likely to attack us first not with everything theyve got on their plate gurmun exclaimed i should hope not but then rathar shook his head again noi should hope so if they want to waste their substance theyre welcome to do it as far as im concerned but that isnt what i meant what did you mean then sir general gurmun sounded suspicious he didnt care for rathars seeing things he couldnt here rathar wasnt sure what he was seeing or whether he was seeing anything at all he answered its just that you never can tell with the redheads they might pull some new sorcery out from under their kilts they might not try to stand their ground they might have ready lines farther east no sign of it from the dragons gurmun said no sign of it from the mages no real sign they even know whats building against them here in the north as far as we can tell theyre still worried most about the duchy of grelz aye as far as we can tell rathar agreed i just hope we can tell far enough his chuckle held no mirth back in the days of the twinkings war hed always had a good notion of what kyots forces were likely to do like him they were unkerlanters hed understood how they thought anybody whos sure he understands what the algarvians are up to deserves to get his head handed to him and he probably will they arent as smart as they think they are and we arent as stupid as they think we are gurmun said weve used that against them a few times rathar nodded pretending to do something foolish in the hope the algarvians would pounce on it and thus fall into a later trap they hadnt foreseen had worked well fairly often in fact mezentios men were proud of their own cleverness if they saw the ignorant unkerlanters acting stupid they felt duty bound to punish themand ended up punishing themselves in the process and in their arrogance they had trouble realizing what theyd done wrong are your behemoths in place the marshal asked gurmuns bluntfeatured head bobbed up and down im right on schedule lord marshal if we werent moving only at night if we werent keeping quiet with our crystals wed be farther along still not being able to send a message ahead to let people prepare for the beasts slows us down i know rathar said but all the emanations weve been able to intercept from the redheads show they dont know whats coming thats just how i want things to stay the surprise will make up for everything i hope youre right sir gurmuns eyes flashed if youre wrong king swemmel will hear about it ill make sure he hears about it rathar almost let his smile show on his face one thing hed seen was that swemmel didnt think he aimed at usurpation he was content to be marshal the idea of being king horrified him did gurmun feel the same way rathar had his doubts and if he had doubts swemmel surely had deep dark suspicions i may not be so easy to topple as you think general a wagon in no way out of the ordinary pulled up the driver asked ready to go on up to the front rathar nodded and climbed in gurmun right behind him lots of wagons went up to the front both rathar and gurmun wore uniform tunics ordinary but for their rank badges not even a dragonflier at treetop height would judge them anything but common soldiers of course even common soldiers get attacked rathar thought he shrugged life didnt come without risks if gurmun worried he didnt show it rathar had never had any reason to doubt his courage the wagon rattled east out of pewsum the treesthe ones still standing after the fighting in winter and springwere in full leaf men and behemoths sheltered under the cover of those leaves so long as day stayed in the sky they didnt move men and behemoths sheltered under trees and in barns and huts and under mats that looked like grass for many miles back of the line of battle when night came they moved forward from one place of concealment to the next this is all very good rathar said to the colonel commanding a brigade at the front line the redheads still dont seem to realize just how much weve built things up here they will anticipation was naked and hungry in general gurmun s voice before very long by the powers above well show them worry in his voice the colonel said the brigade opposite me has a good commander spinello his name is hes always active you never can tell what hell do next are you worried about a spoiling attack rathar asked gurmuns laugh was hungry too itd be a sorrylooking attack after it tried biting down on everything weve got in the neighborhood oh wed beat the bastards backim not worried about that the colonel said im more afraid hell try raiding along my front and learn from the captives he takes that were a lot stronger than he thinks right now marshal rathar nodded that was a sensible worry to have a lot of unkerlanter officers wouldnt have fretted about such things this fellow was someone to watch rathar said the best way to keep anything like that from happening is to make sure only the regiments the redheads already know about are in the forwardmost positions that way they wont take captives from any units theyd expect to find somewhere else aye marshal ill see to it the colonel said earnestly good rathar glanced over to gurmun and wasnt unduly surprised to find gurmun eyeing him he spoke one more word soon the commander of behemoths nodded muttering under his breath hajjaj buttoned his algarvianstyle tunic just putting on the garment made sweat pour from him at this season of the year in bishah the sun stood as close to straight overhead as made no difference he would have been hot nude but for sandals and a hat muffled in tunic and kilt he felt as if he were stifling the things i do for zuwayza he said qutuzwho being but a secretary could remain comfortably unclothedcame in and announced the algarvian minister is here to see you your excellency send him in hajjaj answered shall i bring tea and wine and cakes qutuz asked hajjaj had used his kingdoms rules of hospitality to delay discussion with marquis balastro a good many times today though he shook his head no by the powers above he said the sooner i am out of this cloth bake oven the happier i shall be as you say qutuz sounded as if he disapproved technically speaking the secretary was right to disapprove hajjaj didnt care about technicalities as foreign minister he could ignore them if he so choseand every so often he did so choose not quite shaking his head qutuz went out to bring the algarvian minister into hajjajs office by the way marquis balastro strode in it might have been three years before algarve might have been invincible unstoppable leaping from one triumph to another in the east of derlavai and about to embark on the campaign that would surely bring unkerlant to heel balastros stride hadnt changed in those three years the world the world had after polite bows and handclasps and professions of mutual esteem balastro plopped himself down on the carpet and made himself at home with a mound of cushions he adapted to zuwayzi customs more readily than most foreigners this once hajjaj wouldnt have minded his coming to call without his clothes even if that meant having to stare at his pale skin and his circumcision balastro was no fool he noted the absence of the ritual food and drink and drew the proper conclusion from it you must be suffocating in your clothes i am hajjaj admitted well lets get down to business then your excellency balastro said whats on your mind his majesty king shazli asked me to invite you here to get algarves view of the present situation in light of recent developments hajjaj replied the language was fine and diplomatic nevertheless it couldnt completely hide the real meaning underneath the fine words the king wants to know just how much trouble you think youre in balastro understood that too his grin also flashed as jauntily as if algarve remained on top of the world we are not beaten he said stoutly i repeat it we are not we are fighting hard in jelgava the enemy has not gone far from the beaches where he landed and he will have a demon of a time doing it and in unkerlant here it is summer and still swemmels soldiers stay silent we have taught them what assailing algarve costs fair enough hajjaj said it was a more optimistic assessment than he would have made but balastros job was to be optimistic and he did it well hajjajs job was to expose optimism with no visible means of support he raised an eyebrow suppose youre wrong your excellency all right suppose im wrong when balastro smiled his teeth seemed much too sharp to belong in his handsome fleshy face in that case you get to treat with swemmel of unkerlant and i wish you joy of it hajjaj winced the algarvian minister had chosen a good moment to be undiplomatic negotiating with swemmel was the last thing hajjaj or any other sensible zuwayzi wanted to do you will do as i tell you was the only style of negotiation the king of unkerlant understood with a sigh hajjaj said i shall hope you are right then hoping and believing were two different things however much hajjaj wished them one and inseparable this time balastros smile looked less frightening he said believe me we are in this fight for as long as it takes i am glad to hear it hajjaj replied i hope its true i do also want to bring to your attention once more the evidence our soldiers and sorcerers have gathered of an unkerlanter buildup of some size here in the north details i am sure will have been passed from general ikhshid s office to your soldiers but i would be remiss if i did not mention it myself fair enough balastro sounded almost amiable nowindulgent might have been a better word youve mentioned it im sure our attache here knows about it as you say and he will have passed on to trapani whatever he thinks important and if he decides it isnt important no one in your capital will hear about it hajjaj thought that was what being the junior partner in an alliance meant algarve could make zuwayza dance to her tune the reverse did not hold true like a child tugging at an adults arm zuwayza had to work hard to get algarve to pay attention when she spoke hajjaj did his best to tug ikhshid and his staff reckon this a matter of some urgency one you should take seriously ill pass that on to our attache too balastro saidaye he might have been humoring a child i could point out how many times algarve has already been wrong about unkerlant but hajjaj kept his mouth shut balastro had already made it plain he wouldnt listen to much more and zuwayza had been wrong about unkerlant too if wed been right we would have stayed neutral when the war between the two behemoths started and then suddenly balastros glassgreen eyes sparkled and how are your own foreign relations these days your excellency my for a moment hajjaj didnt know what the algarvian minister meant then he did and rather wished he hadnt minister iskakis wife prefers to remain in seclusion at my home for the time being he said stiffly i hope shes not too secluded to keep you from enjoying yourself balastro leered a very algarvian leer never a dull moment there not between the sheets but watch out when she loses her temperand she will i wouldnt know not yet hajjaj said balastro rolled his eyes as if to say hajjaj was obviously mad if harmlessly so hajjaj wasnt so sure balastro was harmlessly mad he went on you know youre learning such things about tassi may have done more to hurt your kingdoms ties with yanina than several misfortunes on the battlefield could have nonsense balastro said king tsavellas isnt going to run off and embrace king swemmel just because his minister here would sooner sheathe his lance in a handsome guardsman than in his own wife not for that no hajjaj agreed but you your excellency were altogether too public about where your lance found a sheath yaninans have long memories for that sort of slight and they will avenge themselves now and again even when they would be wiser not to balastro shook his head nonsense he repeated i tell you your excellency it is not hajjaj said earnestly i understand them in this regard they are very much like zuwayzin there ha balastro said im not going to lose any sleep over this and you can believe me that king mezentio isnt going to lose any sleep over it either i would advise you to lose a little sleep though your excellencyenough to find out how tasty the treat is what have you got to lose even if youre right iskakis will blame me not you hajjaj scratched his head how strange to have his senior wife and the algarvian minister telling him the same thing and it wasnt that he wasnt tempted either or that tassi had shown herself obviously unwilling what is it thene wondered back in the days of the kaunian empire some philosophers had advocated fighting temptation just because it was temptation that had never made much sense to hajjaj and he couldnt see that it had done the ancient kaunians much good either well he asked himself and gave the best answer he could i think it would be more trouble than its worth im sorry for you balastro got to his feet and bowed and i also think weve covered everything on account of which you summoned me good day your excellency always a pleasure he swept out of hajjajs office with much less ceremony than the occasion called for in mild weather hajjaj might have been offended as things were he felt so glad to get out of his tunic and kilt that any other emotions ran a distant second as soon as he was comfortably nude once more he hurried to king shazli s audience chamber shazli was talking about taxes with the treasury minister hajjaj waited till that troubledlooking official departed well shazli asked after hajjaj had bowed before him what does the algarvian say what you would expect your majestyno more no less hajjaj replied he makes light of the enemy landings in jelgava says algarve will triumph in spite of them and predicts victory against unkerlant too that would be nice for a relatively young man king shazli could be dry when he chose the hope of victory against unkerlant was what brought us into the war i know the foreign minister replied in tones that could only mean dont remind me did he say why he thinks his kingdom will beat the unkerlanters the king asked or was it the usual promises with nothing behind them he offered the quiet front as proof king swemmel has come to the end of unkerlants strength hajjaj said did you tell him what we have learned shazli asked of course your majesty the question came close to offending hajjaj but balastros attitude had annoyed him too he thanked me most politely after all though were only naked savages so what could we possibly know the algarvians are very clever their chief failing is how well they know it shazli remarked hajjaj dipped his head in delight he would have been pleased to claim the epigram for his own the king continued i have also had another letter from minister iskakis with him threatening to swell up like a skink if this tassi woman isnt delivered to him forthwith she does not wish it hajjaj said something badsomething very badwould happen to her if she were delivered to iskakis and you know of balastros role in this aye king shazli sighed the worst thing i can say about my foe is that he makes my friends look good that was another fair epigramand a searing verdict against the whole world eleven when colonel spinello went east to waldsolms to report his brigades condition to brigadier tampaste who commanded his division he was not a happy man sir he said ive got my men dug in east of pewsum like so many moles and if i had three times as many of them and five times as many behemoths and ten times as many dragons to back them up i might be able to hang on when the unkerlanters come down on me i might sir i wouldnt guarantee it tampaste couldnt have been much more than spinellos age himself do you know what colonel he said over the past few days our scouts and mages have concluded the unkerlanters may be planning an attack here in the north after all spinello rolled his eyes about fornicating time sir weve been worrying about it for weeks all we are is the folk on the spot tampaste answered if that doesnt prove we cant possibly know what were talking about i dont know what would how big an attack do they think is coming spinello asked they dont know tampaste said and spinello rolled his eyes again the brigadier went on swemmels boys have been doing their best to mask whatever it is theyre up to so were having a hard time telling if it werent something bigger than wed like they wouldnt be trying to hide it spinello hoped tampaste would tell him he was wrong he was worrying too much instead the brigadier solemnly nodded spinello said i dont suppose theres any hope of reinforcements at that tampaste threw back his head and laughed as if at the best joke in the world tell me another one colonel he said the odds would have been bad before the cursed islanders invaded jelgava now well my dear fellow what can i say he spread his hands that said all that needed saying or almost all anyhow spinello asked how are things back in the east theyve been on the ground in jelgava for more than two weeks now we havent thrown them into the sea tampaste replied ive heard theyre moving on balvi the capital thats not officialall the reports from trapani say the fighting is still by the beaches but ive got a brother in jelgava oh spinello whistled tunelessly things cant be going any too well if they think theyve got to lie to us you have a nasty suspicious mind tampaste said i would have more to say about it if the same thought hadnt occurred to me he nodded to spinello go back and set your men digging again the more holes they have the better their chances are good luck colonel powers above go with you spinello didnt know what sort of dismissal hed expected whatever it was it was nothing so abrupt as that he rose saluted and went out onto the dusty streets of waldsolms here in the town the streets were paved once the buildings stopped though the cobblestones did too and the wind blew hard across the endless plains he climbed into his carriage back to gleina he told the driver the village between waldsolms and pewsum didnt pretend to be anything it wasnt none of its streets had ever been paved spinello doubted any of them ever would be a sergeant tramping along one of those dirt tracks called whats the word colonel theyre going to hit us spinello answered dont know how hard dont know how soon but theyre going to hit us if i had to guess id say they wont wait long and they wont give us a little tap take it for what you think its worth he could have said a lot of other things but they would have amounted to more pungent versions of what he had said so he didnt see the point he hopped down from the carriage his wounded leg protested he tried to ignore it though he limped a little going to the hut that did duty for brigade headquarters inside the hut sat a jar of raw unkerlanter spirits that did duty for the fine brandy spinello would have preferred as he lifted it he asked himself do you think the unkerlanters will hit us before you can sober up when the answer to that turned out to be no he poured a mugs worth out of the jar and started the serious business of getting drunk he hadnt got too far when somebody knocked on the door muttering a curse he set down the mug and threw the door open well he growled jadwigai flinched iim sorry colonel the kaunian girl stammered turning red ill come another time she turned to gomore likely to flee all at once spinello was ashamed of himself no come back please come in he said im sorry there are plenty of people i dont want to see but youre not any of them still wary jadwigai asked are you sure when spinello vigorously just how vigorously proved he had some spirits in himnodded she said all right and walked past him into the hut i just wanted to ask how your meeting with brigadier tampaste went it went so well im getting drunk to celebrate spinello took another swig from the mug want some without waiting for an answer to match his own im glad youre here sweetheart i can tell you more of the truth than i can my own men isnt that funny i dont know the brigades mascot took a small sip she made a face but then sipped again what is the truth the truth spinello said grandlyaye hed poured down some spirits all rightis that were in trouble theyre going to try to smash us flat and they have a pretty bloody good chance of doing it he emptied the mug and then filled it again oh jadwigai took a longer pull from her own mug of spirits she looked west sighed and drank again when she spoke once more it was to herself and in the classical kaunian that was her birthspeech well i bought myself a little extra time spinello eyed her profile the way her pale lashes fluttered the pulse in the hollow of her throat she thinks the luck is gone went through him so do i and if it is he used classical kaunian too will you do something for me what she asked but her eyes said she already knew before he asked the next question he did ask it but for some reason in algarvian will you sleep with me i wont touch you if you say noby the powers above i wontbut i want you and i dont think weve got much time jadwigai set the mug down on a stool aye she whispered you could force me we both know all about that since you dont since you havent why not it wasnt much of a recommendation but spinello decided he would take itand jadwigai altogether sober he might not have he might have thought that no matter what he said she couldnt very well tell him no not unless she wanted to go from pampered mascot to cursed kaunian in the blink of an eye with spirits coursing through him with jadwigai unbuttoning her algarvianissue tunic such thoughts never once entered his mind when she was naked she lay down on the algarvianissue cot he used in lieu of the benches lining the walls of the hut he shed his own uniform in a hurry ill do my best to make you enjoy it too he promised rather to his surprise his best turned out to be good enough hed never managed to kindle vanai of course shed despised him which was half the fun of bedding her the only time shed shown any warmth was the last time when he told her hed been sent to unkerlantand that without a doubt was because it was the last time jadwigai might have feared him but she didnt hate him maybe that made the difference you see he said grinning at her after she let out a gasp that sounded distinctly startled she nodded aye i do see sure enough she seemed astonished my turn now spinello mounted her hed wondered if he would find her a maiden as he had vanai but no what had happened there in western forthweg before she became the brigades pet maybeno certainlysuch questions were better left unasked considering how much pleasure she gave him spinello didnt want to ask any questions just then afterwards she said you were gentle you were kind you have been all along all the soldiers here have been kind to me and yet what spinello asked lazily he felt too pleased with the world too pleased with himself to worry about any question jadwigai might put or so he thought till she said how can you be like this with me and the other way with so many kaunians spinello shrugged its war its revenge its just one of those things he could afford to answer like that his people built the special camps they didnt have to dwell in them jadwigai might have had something sharp to say about that shed never been shy and letting him have her might have made her think she could be frankand shed been drinking too but before she could reply thunder rolled in from the west only it wasnt thunder it was countless eggs all bursting at once oh by the powers above spinello exclaimed and sprang from the cot he dressed with frantic haste jadwigai clothed herself almost as fast as he did even so he hadnt finished buttoning his tunic before eggs started bursting in and all around gleina too its the attack the one weve been waiting for jadwigai said it certainly is spinello didnt think hed ever heard so many eggs burst all at the same timeit might have been a continuous wall of noise and it went on and on hed never imagined he would hear worse than what hed known in sulingen but this fit the bill someone pounded on the door to the hut shouting colonel spinello colonel spinello sir im here spinello opened the door the crystallomancer outside looked as if hed just taken a punch in the jaw he was wobbling glassyeyed are you all right whats going on sir there are at least three breakthroughs on our brigades front and im getting shouts for help from the north and south the mage answered tell em no spinello said weve got nothing to give i know that sir the crystallomancer said one of the mages one of em got killed while i was talking with him sir the energy its hard for a man to take that no doubt explained his punchdrunk state more eggs burst all over gleina spinello smelled smoke and heard flames crackling a metal fragment of eggshell buried itself in the doorframe a few inches from his head he hardly even flinched weve got to fight back as hard as we can he said if the unkerlanters break through our lines the powers below will eat our whole army in the north the crystallomancer nodded but just then a man on a unicorn splashed with green and brown paint galloped through the village shouting behemoths unkerlanter behemoths theres millions ofem and theyre all heading this way spinello peered west the cloud of dust there wouldnt hold millions of behemoths but it would hold dozens or hundreds and it wasnt the only such cloud he saw we arent going to hold gleina he said and then i wonder if we can hold waldsolms one more thought flashed through his mind i wonder if we can hold anywhere he looked back over his shoulder at jadwigai you ready to move fast sweetheart she nodded her eyes enormous but less afraid than they had been before spinello first lowered his mouth to her pinktipped breasts good he told her now we have to see if we can stay ahead of swemmels little chums till were able to throw them back if we ever are come on more dragons painted in unkerlanter rockgray flew low over gleina as they fled the burning village newssheet vendors cried their wares as ealstan came home from pybbas pottery works heavy fighting in northern unkerlant they shouted algarvians inflict heavy losses on swemmels savages in fierce defensive battles ealstan fumbled in his belt pouch and came up with a couple of coppers for a sheet the redheads had occupied forthweg for close to five years now hed learned to read between the lines of their lies to get some notion of the truth hiding behind them when they talked about fierce defensive battles that meant the unkerlanters were hitting them hard he was always willingno eagerto read about anybody hitting the algarvians hard with his nose in the news sheet he almost walked past his block of flats he almost broke his neck going upstairs because he kept trying to read and climb steps at the same time he almost walked too far down the hall and gave the coded knock on the door to the wrong flat and he still had the news sheet in front of his face when vanai opened the right door she looked indignant when he finally lowered the sheet kissing her didnt mollify her much but when he said i think the redheads are really in trouble this time she was suddenly all smiles tell me she urged tell me right now theyre talking about defensive battles ealstan said whenever they talk about defensive battles that means theyre taking a pounding and theyre talking about fighting in sommerda and sommerda was a long way behind their line not so long ago they think people are too stupid to look at a map to find out where these places are but theyre wrong we can look at a map vanai went and pulled an atlas from a bookshelf you got this for me when i had to hide here all the time she made a face and corrected herself the last time i had to hide here all the time i mean she didnt leave the flat these days her sorcerous disguise still worked but for shorter and shorterand ever less predictablestretches of time ealstan flipped the atlas open to a map of derlavai he started to laugh i didnt realize it was this old i did vanai told him it dates from back before the six years war no kingdom of forthweg showed on the map algarve ruled the eastern half of the land with unkerlant holding the west she went on this map doesnt show where sommerda is go to the one of unkerlant all right ealstan turned pages till he found it when he did he whistled in surprise even i hadnt realized it was that far east of the cottbus river powers above the algarvians are in trouble if the unkerlanters have come that far this fast good vanai wrapped her arms around her enormous belly surely the baby couldnt wait more than another few days i hope they take back all their own kingdom then i hope they come into forthweg and take it away from the algarvians too i hope they do it fast its the only way i can think of to have even a few kaunians left alive here ealstan nodded he couldnt deny that he had his own worries about the unkerlanters if they overran forthweg would king penda ever return or would king swemmel try to rule the kingdom as his father had in the distant days when the atlas was printed that mattered a great deal to him but he had to admit that vanais concern was more urgent kaunianlover in forthweg even before the algarvians overran it that had been a name with which to tar a man ealstan didnt care he reached out and touched vanais hand she looked up startled shed been studying the map hard but shed been thinking along with him too as she often did she said i wonder if the kaunians who are left will have to go on disguising themselves ourselvesas forthwegians that would be the end of kaunianity in forthweg i know ealstan said quietly he didnt know what to do about it he didnt think anyone could do anything about it he also didnt think he could say that to vanai what he did say was turn to the map of jelgava i want to see where the fightings moved there all right vanai turned pages with what looked like relief the news sheet says theres fighting in salacgriva and says thats an oceanfront town ealstan said he and vanai bent over the map their heads close together why those lying whoresons he exclaimed salacgriva is more than halfway from the sea to balvi they are in trouble vanai said softly ive dreamt for so long that they would be and now they finally are but will anything still be standing by the time theyre finally beaten that was another question with no good answer instead of trying to answer it ealstan kissed her she smiled at him which made him think hed done about as well as he could do when he went off to work the next morning the newssheet vendors were yelling about the terrible price the unkerlanters had paid for overrunning sommerda ealstan smiled and walked on without buying a sheet he could figure out what that meant sommerda had fallen the news sheets were putting the best face they could on it but they couldnt deny the brute fact pybba waited for ealstan when he walked into the pottery do you sleep in your kilns ealstan asked him as far as he could tell pybba was always there he talked about having a home but that seemed talk and nothing else only when im in my cups get itmy cups pybba laughed uproariously now that youre finally here you lazy goodfornothing come on into my office weve got things to talk about you and i he pointed with a stubby finger much scarred from old burns toward the door to his sanctum with that door slammed shut behind them ealstan spoke first mezentios bastards really are taking it on the chin now aye they are pybba agreed thats one of the things i want to talk to you about wont be long if things keep going the way they are before well be able to rise up against the redheads throw em out of eoforwic maybe throw em out of the whole of forthweg too excitement blazed through ealstan that would be wonderful he breathed and about time too voice dry the pottery magnate answered it does help to have the algarvians distracted you know but weve got to rise up before the unkerlanters do all the work for us or else well never get our own kingdom back again ealstan nodded how not when the same thought had gone through his mind the night before what can i do to help he breathed well youve already done this and that pybba allowed that little spell you came up with to let you look like an algarvian and get your wife out of the kaunian quarterweve used that a couple of times and its worked good ealstan said the redheads are looking for kaunians who look like forthwegians pybba said they arent looking for forthwegians who look like them one of their special constables a whoreson who had to be part bloodhound by the way he sniffed out everything we did isnt among those present any more thanks to that little spell and we dont miss him one bloody bit either good ealstan said again this time with savage gusto aye not so bad pybba raised a shaggy eyebrow i almost forgive you for taking up with a kaunian girl thats nice ealstan raised an eyebrow too and i almost forgive you for just almost forgiving me hed hoped to anger pybba instead he made him laugh if you were as pure as you think you are the pottery magnate began but then he checked himself maybe you are by the powers above when you come down to it thats a scary thought go on get back to work his voice rose to a familiar bellow you think i pay you for sitting around doing nothing ealstan always had plenty of work to do even when dealing with pybbas legitimate business when he added on the rest he wondered how he ever slept at night but he didnt stay late as he had so often in the dark days when vanai was a captive in the kaunian quarter with her so close to her time and with no one but him she could trust he wanted to be there as much as he could if pybba didnt like it he would have thrown his job in the pottery magnates face but pybba hadnt said a word on the way home ealstan walked through the park where hed gone with vanai just after she worked out the spell that let her look like a forthwegian hed named her thelberge there when hed run into ethelhelm the drummer and singer whose books hed once kept poor ethelhelm he thought poor cursed ethelhelm a man of halfkaunian blood the musician had been putty in the algarvians hands hed liked his riches too well and had got much too involved with the redheads though hed finally used the sorcery to escape their clutches i wonder why i thought of him maybe it was just going through the park maybe it was the musicians playing on the grassalthough ethelhelm wouldnt have had much to do with the trumpeters or the viol player the drummer now the drummer wasnt bad the drummer in fact was good enough to make ealstan pause and listen for a little while and toss some silver into the bowl the band had set in front of them a nondescript stocky fellow the drummer could have made much more money playing in clubs or even in theaters he sounded he sounded like someone doing an excellent impression of ethelhelm after a bit the drummers eyes met ealstans that wasnt surprising only eight or ten people were standing around listening what was surprising was that the drummers eyebrows rose slightly as if he recognized ealstan if he did he had the advantage for ealstan was sure hed never set eyes on the fellow before hed almost got back to the block of flats when he stopped so suddenly the woman behind him bumped into him and let out a torrent of shrill complaint he apologized but too absentmindedly to suit her up in the flat though he said im sure that was ethelhelm sorcerously disguised to look all forthwegian he can hide the way he looks but he cant hide the way he plays the drums and he knew who i wasim sure of that too for his sake i hope youre wrong vanai said you told him as much yourself if he wants to stay safe he has to stay away from music if you recognized who he was someone else will too and then the algarvians will have him i know that would be too bad ealstan had had his quarrels with ethelhelmhed had quarrels with most of his employersbut he wouldnt have wished falling into algarvian captivity on anyone especially on anyone of even partly kaunian blood looking back on it vanai had trouble defining exactly when she went into labor her womb had been squeezing now and again throughout the last couple of months of her pregnancy she thought that was normal but had no one she could ask over the couple of days after ealstan saw or thought he saw ethelhelm the squeezes grew stronger and came more often are these labor pains she wondered as she walked around the flat they didnt keep her from walking or from doing anything she needed to do and they didnt hurt how could they be pains if they didnt hurt she lay down beside ealstan wriggled till she found the least uncomfortable positionfinding a comfortable one with her belly so enormous was impossible these daysand fell asleep when she woke right around dawn it was to the sound of a snap she also discovered she needed to use the pot but she couldnt stop herself before she got there and dribbled on the floor what is it ealstan asked sleepily i think my bag of waters just broke vanai answered she hoped that was what it was if it wasnt that it was something worse does that mean this is iti mean that youll have the baby pretty soon the mattress creaked as ealstan sat up in bed i dont know vanai said irritably the truth was she didnt know much more about it than he did but it was happening to her not to him it hardly seemed fair hed been there at the beginning why shouldnt he be there at the end too she went on i thinkoof whats the matter ealstan could hear that something was now i know why theyre called labor pains vanai got the words out in small bunches this time when her womb clenched she really felt it maybe the water in there had shielded her from the worst of the squeezes nothing was shielding her any more shed been looking forward to having the baby now all at once she wasnt so sure pybba wont get his accounts cast today ealstan said i expect hell figure out why im not there i expect so vanai agreedonce the pang eased she could speak freely she also seemed to have stopped dribbling she got up off the pot and waddled back to bed she hadnt been there long before her womb clamped down again she grunted this one was stronger than the last can i get you anything ealstan asked anxiously vanai shook her head im going to do this till im done she said i can tell its real now she wanted to laugh at herselfshe made it sound as if she were going into battle but the laughter wouldnt come this was a battle and some women didnt come back from it she wished she hadnt thought of that to keep from thinking she got out of bed and started walking it wasnt so easy now not with the pangs coming every few minutes when the third or fourth one caught her in the middle of a step she almost fell that would not be a good thing to do not now she told herself she stood there waiting for the labor pain to end and her belly to ease back from rock hardness that seemed to take a very long time she was gasping by the time it finally happened moving slowly and with great care she walked back to the bed and lay down are you all right ealstan looked faintly green but he stayed by the bed and clutched her hand and she didnt suppose he could do much more than that im as well as i can be vanai answered i dont think ill do any more walking though thank you all the same before very long her womb squeezed in on itself again the baby didnt like that and kicked and wiggled as if in indignation because there was very little room in there and the walls of the womb were tight that hurt too where it usually hadnt before vanai hissed which made ealstan jump when the tension eased she said this is all supposed to happen i think both of them had read as much as they could about what happened when a baby was born but the forthwegian books on the subject told less than vanai would have liked back in oyngestun her grandfather had had classical kaunian gynecological texts in his library but they might as well have been a mile beyond the moon for all the good they did her now and the kaunians of imperial times had known a lot less about medicine than modern folk dideven the forthwegians whom the descendants of those kaunians reckoned barbarians a lot of what was in brivibas texts was probably wrong ealstan suddenly said you look like yourself again not like a forthwegian vanai started to laugh again only to break off in the middle when another pang hit she started to say something in spite of the labor pain only to discover she couldnt what her body was doing took charge now and her mind had to wait till her body gave it leave to work once more in the time between pains she said thats the least of my worries sweat ran down her face her hair newly redyed black felt wet and matted she might have been running for hours people called giving birth labor for a reason too and it went on and on the pangs came closer together and each one seemed a little stronger a little more painful than the one just before after what felt like forever vanai asked what time is it midmorning ealstan answered she almost shouted that he had to be lying to her that it had to be midafternoon at the very least but when she looked at the light through the windows she realized he was right in a small voice she asked would you get me a little wine he frowned should you have it i dont know she answered i dont think ill puke it up if i drink it and my mouth is dry as the zuwayzi desert right now all right ealstan brought it to her he also brought in a widemouthed basin in case she proved mistaken but the sweet red wine went down smoothly and stayed down and she felt better for it her mouth no longer seemed caked with dust another eternity that might have been an hour or two dragged by ealstan stayed by the side of the bed squeezing her hand running a cool damp cloth over her forehead and neck every so often occasionally holding up the winecup so she could take another sip she was glad to have him there gladder than she would have been to have a midwife even if a midwife knew more and then all at once she wasnt youyouyou man you she said furiously in between two pangs that hardly left her room to breathe let alone talk if it werent for you and your lousy prick i wouldnt be in this mess now ealstan looked stricken after a moment though his face cleared one of the books said that when you started calling me names it was a sign the baby would come soon he told her vanai called him more names then all the names she could think of in both forthwegian and classical kaunian she hated to stop when the next labor pang took her but had very little choice just breathing through it was quite hard enough but she resumed when it finally ebbed after a few more pangs she felt the urge to use the pot again as if her bowels badly needed to move when she said soher sudden storm of anger against ealstan had passed away as fast as it blew uphe answered that means youre ready to push the baby out that wasnt what it felt like it felt as if she were straining to pass a stool the size of a football shed heard that a couple of times from women talking back in oyngestun before the war she hadnt imagined it could be truehow could having a baby be so crude now she found out for herself but no matter how hard she bore down the baby didnt seem to want to move im trying to shit a boulder she panted as ealstan ran that cloth across her face im trying to but its stuck keep trying he said its what youre supposed to do she had very little choice her body kept straining to force out the baby it would have kept on doing that whether she wanted it to or not the most she could do was concentrate take a deep breath and try to help it along she pushed with all her mightand this time felt movement that made her push harder than ever she let out a noise half squeal half groan and all effort oh by the powers above ealstan said softly here comes the head he let out a startled squawk nohere comes the baby once vanai had pushed out the head everything else was easy that was the hard part both figuratively and literally shoulders torso and legs followed in short order so did the afterbirth ealstan made gulping noises youll have to throw away these sheets vanai said before asking the question she should have asked first is it a boy or a girl a girl ealstan answered hereim tying the cord with one hank of dark brown yarn and one of yellow now im cutting it now he held up the baby she started to cry and quickly went from purple to pink give her to me vanai said give me saxburh that was the girls namethe forthwegian girls nametheyd picked vanai also thought of her as silelaiher own mothers name if things in forthweg ever improved for kaunians perhaps the baby could use that name too ealstan handed her to her mother as if he had in his hands an egg that might burst at any moment saxburh had a little hair incredibly fine what there was of it was dark her eyes were dark blue but that meant nothing all babies eyes were that color at first whether her skin would prove fair or swarthy whether shed be lean like a kaunian or blocky like a forthwegian who could say too soon for such guesses here vanai said and set the baby on her breast saxburh knew what to do she began sucking right away that made vanais womb contract painfully she let out a hiss and began to realize how worn she was she felt as if shed been run over by a wagon full of logs and then ealstan had the nerve to say move a little but when after a groan she did he swept off the fouled bedclothes and gave her a pair of drawers and a cloth pad of the sort she wore when her courses came she set saxburh down for a moment so she could put them on the babys high thin wail made vanai pick her up again in a hurry as saxburh went back to nursing vanai asked ealstan could you get me something to eat please i feel like i havent had anything in years of course he hurried away and came back with bread and sausage and olives and cheese and two big mugs full of wine as vanai fell to like a famished wolf he raised his mug high to our baby to our baby vanai echoed with her mouth full after she swallowed she took a long pull at her own mug she wanted to bathe she wanted to sleep for a year for the time being she was content to lie there with saxburh and try to rest major scoufas looked up from his mug of ale at colonel sabrino well your excellency now i know you are truly in bad odor at king mezentios court the yaninan dragonflier said sabrinos mug held spirits not ale he hadnt got very far down it though not yet i told you that the day my wing got here he replied why do you say you know it now because if your superiors cared for you at all they would have sent you north to try to stem the unkerlanter tide there scoufas replied but no they have left you here to keep us yaninans company and i happen to know they are sending everything they can possibly spare to the north that called for a long pull at the mug of spirits sabrino wished he could have contradicted scoufas unfortunately the yaninan was right sabrino said all he could say i am a soldier i can only go where my orders take me i can only do what my superiors tell me i understand that and the answer does you honor major scoufas said but is it not true that something very like a catastrophe is taking shape for algarve in the north he spoke with a certain avid interest if algarve went down to defeat against unkerlant sabrino didnt see how yanina could avoid also going down to defeat that didnt stop some yaninans from enjoying algarves misfortune having tasted defeat so often themselves they enjoyed seeing the onceinvincible algarvians learn what the dish tasted like disaster sabrino shrugged i dont think its so bad as that major sooner or laterprobably soonerswemmels men will run out of soldiers and well mend the front the way weve done here in the duchy of grelz he realized too late he should have called it the kingdom of grelz scoufas raised a dark elegantly arched eyebrow to show he realized the same thing using the unkerlanter name for the region showed how much ground the algarvians had lost in the past year and he realized he was liable to be talking through his hat when he claimed things would soon get better in the north the algarvian army defending that long and vital stretch of front seemed simply to have disappeared algarvian reports from the north grew more tightlipped day by day swemmels men by contrast declared victory after victory and claimed the recapture of town after town if those claims were lies the algarvians might have done a better job of denying them scoufas said if you were truly a lucky man colonel or a wellfavored one you might have been sent off to jelgava and escaped from unkerlant altogether that held some truth too but rather less not many algarvian formations were leaving unkerlant to fight in the east mezentio didnt have enough men in unkerlant to hold back swemmels soldiers as things were the east would just have to take care of itself and if it doesnt sabrino wondered if it cant he finished the spirits at a gulp then were in even more trouble than we were before he eyed major scoufas you may not like algarvians all that well but i suggest you remember one thing before the unkerlanters get into algarve if were so unlucky as to have that happenthey have to go through yanina like most yaninans scoufas had an expressive face the emotion he expressed wasnt delight nor anything close to it sabrino smiled maybe scoufas thought he was allowed to snipe at algarvians but they couldnt say anything about his kingdom that wasnt how things worked no matter what he thought before either wing commander made the occasion more unpleasant a yaninan crystallomancer burst into the peasant hut where they were drinking and spoke rapidly in his own language yaninan always put sabrino in mind of wine pouring out of a jug glug glug glug but he didnt speak it and had to ask whats he saying the unkerlanters seem to be stirring down here after all scoufas replied theyre trying to cross the trusetal river and set up a bridgehead on the east side cant have that sabrino sprang to his feet if they get a company over today itll be a brigade tomorrow complete with behemoths scoufas dipped his head in the yaninan equivalent of a nod aye that is so he said we may not love each other but there is nothing like a common foe to point out where our interests lie true enough sabrino said shall we go pay a call on the common foe and try to make him extinct rather than common extinct scoufas frowned he needed a moment to understand the wordplay which robbed sabrino of half his pleasure in it but then the yaninan smiled oh i see aye indeed it would be well if the unkerlanters were extinct they both hurried out of the hut shouting for their men the yaninan dragon handler with the big black mustache had taken it upon himself to minister to sabrinos dragon he was as good as any algarvian could have been his name was tsaldaris he had no breeding to speak of had he come from a notable family he would have been flying dragons not handling them he spoke algarvian after a fashion enough to talk about dragons at least as sabrino mounted the screeching badtempered beast tsaldaris said careful cinnabarpfuif he made a disgusted noise and held thumb and forefinger close together to show hed had little to give the dragon any hope of getting more any time soon sabrino asked fastening his harness so the dragon couldnt pitch him off no matter how much it wanted to tsaldaris tossed his head as yaninans did when they meant no supply got unicorns prick up arse he said which sabrino feared summed things up altogether too well sabrino waved to major scoufas scoufas waved back sabrino looked to his own men they were ready hed known they would be and so were the yaninans they made perfectly good dragonfliers their trouble was they had not enough dragons and not enough men trained to fly them especially when facing a foe who came in such great numbers as the unkerlanters did at sabrinos nod tsaldaris loosed the chain that held his dragon to its stake screaming fury at the world the dragon leaped into the air with a great thunder of wings algarvian dragons painted in varying patterns of green and white and red rose with it so did their yaninan counterparts those beasts painted simply red and white some carried eggs slung beneath them others would protect those dragons and do what damage they could with their flames sabrino cursed the dearth of cinnabar the land of the ice people he muttered the mamming hills plenty of cinnabar both places the algarvians would never get to use any of it not any more flying west though always made him feel better when he was flying west he was going on the attack hed had too much of the unkerlanters coming to him he was hed always been a man who wanted to make things happen not one who sat back and waited for them to happen to him he didnt need long to spot the unkerlanter bridgehead eggs were bursting all around the edges of it most of them looked to be unkerlanter eggsking swemmels soldiers had far more tossers than did the yaninans facing them too and sabrino started cursing again this time in good earnest the unkerlanters had thrown a plank bridge across the trusetal rivertheir artisans were clever at such thingsand were sending behemoths across to the eastern bank sabrino had two crystals with himone to link him to his own squadron leaders the other with somewhat different emanations to major scoufas he spoke into both of them at the same time those behemoths are our target if we can slay them and wreck that bridge the footsoldiers on the ground ought to be able to close out the rest of the unkerlanters this side of the river had they been algarvian soldiers he would have been sure of it with yaninans one could only hope however good their dragonfliers were their footsoldiers had singularly failed to cover themselves with glory no plurally for the yaninans had failed again and again but sabrino couldnt say that no matter how true it was for fear of offending major scoufas who was as touchy as any yaninan the dragons carrying eggs dove on the bridge the unkerlanters had heavy sticks mounted nearby to protect it of course one dragonan algarvian beastwent straight into the trusetal sabrino cursed yet again one more comrade he would never see again but eggs burst in large numbers in the river and on both banks then one struck the bridge square in the center the burst of sorcerous energy pitched two behemoths into the water and set the bridge afire sabrino whooped whooping still he gave new orders now we attack the behemoths on the east bank of the trusetal cover us if you would be so kind major scoufas said my men and i will show you what your allies can do although sabrino had been about to order his own dragonfliers to swoop down on the unkerlanter behemoths he was willing to salve scoufas pride and so he answered let it be as you say my thanks the yaninan told him and gave his own orders in his own language sabrino understood not a word of them but what they were was hardly in doubt and almost as if diving on targets in a practice field the yaninans carried out the attack the behemoths below scattered as targets would not and could not but that mattered little for what was a behemoths speed when measured against a dragons if scoufas and his men had to get a little closer to flame the behemoths than they would have needed to do with more cinnabar in them what difference did that make but just as sabrino began to gloat in good earnest captain orosios face appeared in the crystal that kept the wing commander in touch with his fellow algarvians enemy dragons the squadron leader shouted a whole great swarm of them coming out of the west they were painted rockgray of course and sabrino hadnt seen them against the clouds im getting old he thought if he wanted to get much older he would have to fight hard now melee he ordered if we break up their formation we have the edge the unkerlanters did fine as long as they acted in accordance with someone elses plan if they had to think for themselves to decide quickly they had trouble a wild melee it was too once the algarvians got in amongst the unkerlanters dragons spun crazily through the sky sabrino tried to flame one of swemmels sparrowhawksthat was the name the algarvians gave the unkerlanters best dragonfliersbut couldnt come close enough to do it when an unkerlanter dragon got on his tail he had to fly like a man possessed to keep from getting flamed himself but he managed to blaze the enemy dragonflier with his sticka lucky blaze but he was glad to take it and the rockgray beast went wild attacking every dragon around it since the unkerlanters had far more dragons in the air than he did that helped his side more than theirs it didnt do enough to help the yaninan dragonfliers down below though the unkerlanters had enough dragons to assail the algarvians and yaninans at the same time major scoufas image appeared in sabrinos crystal we have to pull out he shouted we havent got rid of the bridgehead sabrino said blazing at another unkerlanter dragonflier and missing if we stay we still will not be rid of the bridgeheadand the unkerlanters will be rid of us scoufas replied sabrino cursed as he pondered had he not judged scoufas right about the first part of that he would have ignored the second men and dragons fought to be used up at need as things were aye he said bitterly and began the tricky business of getting his wing free theyd hurt the unkerlanters but swemmel still had menand worse behemothson this bank of the trusetal all things considered garivald was pleased with the crop he and obilot had managed to plant theyd started late with the mule theyd hired from dagulf but looking over the soft green of growing barley and rye he thought they should end up with plenty to get them through the winter not so bad he told her after a long day of weeding no not so bad she agreed the farther we are from anybody else the better too she dipped a horn spoon into the porridge of barley and leeks they were eating for supper garivald grunted thats true enough by the powers above i didnt think id end up a hermit but you never know do you no obilots eyes went far away back to whatever shed had before the algarvians swarmed into the duchy of grelz maybe garivald had never had the nerve to ask such questions and shed never said what drove her into the irregulars all she said now was you never know sooner or later they would have to go back into linnich the farm had no salt lick they could trade herbs and vegetables from the garden plot for salt and for tools and maybe for some chickens or ducks too when spring came again they would need a draught animal for the plowing garivald was in no hurry not even the thought of seeing dagulf cheered him his friend reminded him of all hed lost when zossen vanished off the face of the earth and he wasnt sure he could trust dagulf not any more they hadnt seen each other for a couple of years a lot had happened in that time a lot could have happened too the only way to find out would be the hard way filled with such gloomy thoughts garivald was glad to lie down on the benches against the wall of the hut he and obilot had taken for their own and go to sleep as usual a day in the fields made him sleep as if he were stuffed into a rest crate till the next morning when he woke he ate more barley porridge and went out to the fields to begin all over again he might not do exactly the same thing day after day but he always had plenty to do no one who lived on a farm ever complained of too little to do not between planting time and harvest hed just thrown a rock at a rabbitand to his disgust missed for it would have gone into the pot had he hit itwhen three men came up the path leading to linnich they were the first men hed seen on the path since he and obilot found this farm now that spring had come it was hardly a path at all being much overgrown whoever had used this place before he came hadnt had much use for company either those three men saw him too one of them waved without thinking garivald waved back he cursed himself for a fool afterwards but it probably wouldnt have mattered one way or the other two of the men carried sticks slung on their back the third had his in his hand if they were bandits garivald was in trouble if they served king swemmel he was liable to be in more trouble still hail called the one whod waved are you fariulf aye thats me garivald answered with something approaching relief if they were using his false name they didnt want him for the crime of fighting the algarvians without doing it under king swemmels auspices he hadnt done much as fariulf to get into trouble what do you want he added as the men came forward obilot was watching from the garden he wondered if she would get a stick from inside the farmhouse and start blazing but he stood between her and the three oncoming men whod got very close by then are you hale asked the fellow who was doing the talking he answered his own question aye i can see you are come along with us come along with you where garivald asked someplace you should have been long before this king swemmels army replied thethe impresser garivald realized he had to be you think you can sit out the war here in the middle of nowhere thats not how things work pal come along quietlike and nothing badll happen to you till the cursed algarvians have their chance at your worthless hide by then all three aimed their sticks at him considering what they could have done to him considering what they surely would have done to him had they known his real name going into the unkerlanter army didnt strike garivald as such a bad bargain all he said was let me tell my woman goodbye he pointed back toward obilot he expected them to refuse impressers had an evil name maybe they were relieved he didnt put up more of a fuss for the man who talked for them replied go ahead but make it snappy i will garivald beckoned obilot forward she came with obvious reluctance but she came her face was hard and closed showing nothing to the impressers but nothing to him either he made the best of things he could bringane theyre taking me into the army how will i get the crop in without you she cried but her voice like his held a note of relief this wasnt good but it could have been worse in the army at least hed have a chance to fight back with a certain rough sympathy the impresser said things are hard all over the kingdom lady why are you making them harder for fariulf and me obilot demanded because we need men if were going to whip the algarvians the impresser replied now lets get going we havent got all day garivald squeezed obilot he kissed her he said ill come back she nodded he hoped she believed him he tried to believe himself the impressers snickered he wondered how often theyd heard the same promises then he wondered how often those promises came true having done that he wished he hadnt the impressers led him away he shook his head at obilot as he went warning her not to try to blaze them one against threeeven two against threewasnt good odds her shoulders went up and down in a sigh but she finally nodded by the time he got into linnich garivald wondered if he shouldnt have let obilot try to stop the impressers he was hungry and tired and wanted nothing so much as to go back to the farm forget about the world and have the world forget about him too most of the people on the streets in linnich were women and old men he wondered whod told the impressers he was out there on that farm away from the village if he ever found out if he ever got his hands on that person he hoped it wasnt dagulf that would be a terrible thing to think of a man who had been his friend but he knew he would wonder for a long time to come more impressers stood in the market square along with the men theyd rounded up he didnt see dagulf there which raised his suspicions some of the men who would be going into king swemmels army were hardly men at all but youths others had gray hair and gray stubble on their cheeks only a couple were like garivald somewhere in the prime of life lets get moving an impresser said he was in the prime of life garivald resentfully wondered why he wasnt out there trying to blaze algarvians instead of rounding up his own countrymen the impresser went on weve got a long way to go to the closest leyline caravan depot where was the closest leyline caravan depot garivald didnt know ley lines werent so dense in this stretch of the duchy of grelz he didnt think there was one within half a days walk of linnich though that gave him a certain amount of hope with a little luck he might slip away during the night hed had plenty of practice slipping away in his days as an irregular but if he knew tricks the impressers knew tricks too sure enough they had to halt by the side of the road for the night they proved to have light leg irons in their packs and fastened their recruits together before doling out black bread and sausage to them garivald sighed that was the sort of efficiency king swemmel surely approved of garivald never found out the name of the town with the caravan depot he was formally taken into the armyas fariulf son of syrivaldinside the depot before boarding the caravan a boredlooking clerk asked do you take oath to defend the kingdom of unkerlant and king swemmel from all foes as directed by those set over you aye garivald answered as everyone else surely did what would swemmels men do to someone who refused to swear that oath garivald knew he didnt want to find out riding the leyline caravan was something new and exciting hed sabotaged them but hed never ridden in one before by the way some of the other new recruits exclaimed he wasnt the only one aboard a caravan car for the first time how the countryside whizzed past as the caravan glided northwest that was the first thought that struck his mind the second was how devastated the countryside looked it had all been fought over at least twice parts of it more often than that as he went through one wrecked village after another he began to realize just how vast the war against algarve really was more recruitsagain mostly boys and older menboarded at each stop till they filled his caravan car and presumably the others food was more black bread drink was water hed never tried to sleep sitting up on a hard bench he didnt think he could when he got tired enough though he did he stayed on the caravan for two and a half days rising from that seat only to ease himself in a privy that stank and soon began to overflow by the time the caravan stopped somewhere far outside the duchy of grelz ever so much farther from home than garivald had ever gone before he could barely hobble from the car no one waiting for him seemed to care he got a rockgray tunic and socks and a knapsack and a pair of stout boots he got a stick when the sergeant who issued it to him asked if he knew how to use it he just said aye the sergeant made a mark on a leaf of paper and sent him to the right those who said no went to the left a mage came before the group of tired confused men on the right and began chanting spells over them someone asked what they were for theyll ward you against algarvian wizardrysome of it anyway a watching soldier answered garivald thought of sadoc the irregular and hoped this mage knew his business better than sadoc had once the magic was done the new soldiers got back onto a caravan car this one had a bad privy too after another day and a half the leyline caravan stopped again as garivald got out he asked is this where we train train somebody already on the ground laughed we havent got time to waste on training you we gave you a stick right if you live long enough youll get trained by the powers above and with no more fanfare than that garivald trudged off to battle against the algarvians sidroc couldnt remember the last time hed been on a quiet stretch of front there were unkerlanters west of him he knew that but plegmunds brigade for once wasnt in the midst of desperate righting at every hour of the day and night patrols went out with some reasonable expectation that they wouldnt come back chopped to pieces or fail to come back at all enjoy it while it lasts sergeant werferth said to anyone and everyone who would listen before long the algarvians are going to ship us north thats where theyre in trouble so thats where well go not fair sidroc said theyve been loafing in the north for the past two years let them worry about swemmels whoresons and leave us alone life isnt fair sonny werferth looked around to make sure no redheads were in earshot then went on besides they may really need us from what i hear the powers below have got their teeth into that whole algarvian army up there thats not good sidroc said slowly did i say it was werferth answered of course theres another reason they might send us up there too if they run into much more trouble the fightll be heading back toward forthweg they might figure wed fight harder trying to keep swemmels bastards out of our own kingdom they might be right sidroc had seen enough of the war in unkerlant to know what both sides did to villages they overran he winced at the idea of that happening inside forthweg it mostly hadnt when the redheads conquered his kingdom the forthwegians had been overwhelmed too fast my arse ceorl said the ruffian had been scraping mud from his boots with a knife looking up he went on far as im concerned the powers below are welcome to forthweg and so are the unkerlanters i joined plegmunds brigade to get the demon out of there i dont give a flying futter if i never see the stinking place again as long as i live plenty of people up in forthweg would probably be glad never to see ceorl again either sidroc didnt say that it held true for him as well it held true for a lot of the men in plegmunds brigade sergeant werferth sidroc judged was one of the few for whom it might not hold true werferth hadnt joined the brigade because everyone hated him hed joined because he liked being a soldier and this gave him the chance to keep doing what he liked and what he was good at before sidroc could say anything along those lines a runner came trotting up and spoke in algarvian which meant brigade business brigadier polinesso orders everybody whos not on patrol to report to the village of ossiach at midafternoon hes got something special to say must be special sidroc said hes never done anything like this before do you know what it is ceorl asked the runner who shook his head ceorl cursed the fellow as he went off to spread the word elsewhere something special werferth repeated in musing tones i wonder what it could be you dont suppose the wars over do you sidroc and ceorl both laughed fat chance sidroc said werferth looked rueful after a moment he laughed too sidroc didnt think the war would ever end ossiach wasnt far away the roughlooking bearded men of the brigade filled the market square to the bursting point if any unkerlanters remained in the village they prudently stayed out of sight brigadier polinesso climbed up onto a crate so the soldiers he commanded could see him we have a special new regiment alongside of us on the left men he said you need to know this so you will not take them for the enemy they will wear the flag of algarve on their left tunic sleeves we expect them to fight like tigerslike tigers do you hear aye brigadier the assembled men of the brigade chorused good very good you are dismissed polinesso said sidroc scratched his head all the way back to his squads encampment what in blazes was he talking about whos coming in next to us we know about the algarvians we know about the yaninans id like to kill the yaninans the way they run ceorl said they had some regiments of sibians werferth said but i think the sibs went into sulingen and never came out besides mezentios lost sibiu so he wont get any more regiments there black zuwayzin sidroc suggested ceorl howled laughter id like to see those naked whoresons down here especially in the wintertime theyd freeze their balls off and thats no joke besides werferth added they dont wear tunics how can they put flags on the sleeves of tunics they arent wearing all right not zuwayzin sidroc said but who then theyd better not be yaninans werferth said ceorls right about that i dont want them on our flank not with the itchy feet theyve got if they bug out they leave us naked as a zuwayzi for the unkerlanters polinesso wouldnt say the yaninans fight like tigers sidroc scratched his head again powers above he wouldnt the redheads havent got any use for yaninans either werferth and ceorl both grunted but neither one argued from which sidroc concluded they thought he was right werferth said maybe theyre grelzers since when are grelzers special in grelz sidroc asked and again got no good answer he found the truth two days later coming in from another blessedly uneventful patrol he paused to fill his water bottle in a stream not far from where his squad was camped when he looked up another soldier was filling a bottle on the other side of the stream in careful algarvian the other fellow said you are from plegmunds brigade is it not so we were told we would have plegmunds brigade on our right hand aye im from plegmunds brigade sidroc gave his own name and added who in blazes arejyow the other mans uniform was dark green almost the color of those the grelzers who fought on algarves side wore but this fellow was no grelzer he was tall and slim and blond and wore trousers and short tunic with sure enough the algarvian flag sewn to the left sleeve hes a kaunian sidroc thought dazedly hes got to be a kaunian but thats not what the redheads use kaunians for i am brusku the stranger said which both did and did not sound like a kaunian namethe ending was different from the s forthwegian kaunians used then he went on i am a soldier in the phalanx of valmiera ahh sidroc slowly nodded now things grew clearer the algarvians didnt massacre blonds from valmiera and jelgava maybe for fear of touching off revolts in the east but they were getting some use from them anyway sidroc nodded again in a more friendly way than hed thought he would show to any kaunian welcome to unkerlant you cant go home again either can you bruskus pale stare suddenly sharpened no he said after a moment so it is the same for you is it i did what i wanted to do it is enough sidroc had done what he wanted to do too was it enough whether it was or not he was stuck with it he said come back to my camp with me he pointed north you can meet my pals all right brusku splashed across the stream which was no more than ankle deep as sidroc led the way he thought about how strange it was to be fighting alongside a kaunian a few years before though he would have thought it strange to be fighting alongside algarvians too greetings ceorl called when he walked up to the fire the ruffian pointed behind him who in blazes is that his names brusku sidroc answeredin algarvian so brusku could follow hes from the phalanx of valmierathats the outfit brigadier polinesso said was going in on our left he wondered if ceorl would make a crack about kaunians escaping from algarvian camps that wouldnt do anybody any good maybe the valmieran kaunians didnt know what happened to their blond brethren from forthweg maybe they knew and tried not to think about it by the way the ruffians lips pursed he thought about it but then visibly he thought better of it he said lets kill some unkerlanters and let it go at that aye brusku said that is what we came for sergeant werferth passed the valmieran his flask here try this brusku drank he coughed a couple of times unicorn piss and fire he said is that what you forthwegians drink we drink wine and plum brandy when were home werferth answered down here we drink anything we can get our hands on i think the unkerlanters brewed this stuff out of turnips brusku looked at the flask as if he wanted to throw it away instead he took another pull and handed it back to werferth then he said i had better go or my sergeant will come down on me he nodded to sidroc and headed off in the direction from which hed come once he was gone ceorl spat into the fire fighting side by side with kaunians ive thought of a lot of strange things but never any like that ill tell you something though sidroc said id rather have them on my left hand than a pack of jumpy yaninans he watched ceorl weigh that the ruffian didnt take long to nod werferth said a good thing you boys didnt talk about what happens to forthwegian kaunians im going to tell everybody to keep quiet about that what happens when the phalanx of valmierawhat in blazes is a phalanx anywayfinds out about it sidroc asked sooner or later they will theyre bound to good question werferth said well probably see before too long like you say and when we do you know what its like when an egg bursts almost close enough for the sorcerous energy to kill you he waited sidroc nodded everybody whod been in battle for a while knew what that was like werferth went on when they find out itll be like that only more so sidroc thought it over how would he feel if the algarvians started slaying forthwegians to make their magic stronger he could think of some forthwegians he wouldnt miss starting with ealstan and hestan still aye youre likely right twelve istvan proved less unhappy as a captive on obuda than hed expected to he lived in a barracks no worse than the one where hed lived while a gyongyosian soldier on that same island he was a good deal more comfortable than hed been in the forests of western unkerlant or in the trenches on the island of becsehely the food his kuusaman captors fed him and his comrades wasnt especially good but it wasnt especially bad either and there was plenty of it he had no work harder than chopping firewood under the watchful eyes of the kuusaman guards it could have been far worse when he said as much in line for breakfast one morning kun nodded and replied aye i thought theyd send us off to the mines or some such thisits as if theyve made obuda into a crate and theyll keep stowing captives here till it fills up nothing to do but sit around and get fat istvan agreed ive been a soldier for a long time i dont much mind being an old soldier for a while if you know what i mean im with you szonyi said from behind him nobodys trying to blaze me or drop an egg on my head anyone who thinks im sorry about that is plumb daft well the two of you get no arguments from me kun said watery island sunshine glinted off the gold frames of his spectacles ive never been what youd call eager to have people trying to kill me i leave all that up to you fierce country lads if he hadnt fought bravely every time he had to he would have condemned himself out of his own mouth there even as things were istvan spoke a little stiffly we are a warrior race corporal kun said nothing to that but aye sergeant istvan couldnt possibly call him to account for two unexceptionable words but then kun looked around the sun sparkling off his spectacles once more his glance took in the captives camp the palisade around it the brisk alert kuusaman guards on the palisade and the bedraggled gyongyosians moving forward one at a time to be fed ears burning istvan said well we are aye sergeant kun repeated which finished the job of demoralizing istvan the onetime mages apprentice made as if he didnt even know what hed done he fights istvan thought he just doesnt fight fair he didnt say that out loud it would have made kun unbearably smug an obudana mediumsized darkhaired man with light reddishbrown skinslapped oatmeal mush into istvans mess tin here you is he said in bad gyongyosian gyongyos had held obuda been driven off by the kuusamans retaken the island and then been driven off again the locals had had their chances to learn the languages of both occupiers thanks istvan turned away and started spooning up the mush his own people flavored oatmeal with butter and salt the kuusamans put in sugar and spices and raisins instead it wasnt what he was used to but it wasnt too bad when hed finished he took his tin over to a basin of water to wash it he was sloshing it around in the basin when another captive came up beside him he blinked hello major borsos he said i didnt know the starsaccursed slanteyes had got you too hed fetched and carried for borsos back in the days when gyongyos still held obuda hed seen the mage again in the vast forests of unkerlant borsos had had trouble remembering him then and plainly had trouble remembering him now after a moment he said ah hello sergeant aye im among the unlucky too gyongyos hasnt had much luck lately couldnt you use your magecraft to do something istvans voice trailed away here on an island now far away from any that gyongyos held what could even a true mage do and borsos hissed shut up by the stars the kuusamans dont know what i am and i dont want them finding out either or theyll send me somewhere worse than this oh till then istvan hadnt noticed borsos wasnt wearing his sorcerers badges along with his emblems of rank as in most armies gyongyosian mages held officers rank not so much by virtue of their blood as to give them the privilege of telling common soldiers what to do real aristocratic officersmost of themwould look down their noses at borsos but they probably wouldnt tell the kuusamans what he was in fact it might be nice having a real wizard in here on our side im hardly even that borsos said im just a dowser you ought to remember if you hauled my gear around for me better than nothing istvan said better than kun he thought kun had been an apprentice before going into ekrekek arpads army borsos at least was fully trained in one specialty of magic from behind istvan someone asked is this man bothering you sir istvan turned there stood captain frigyes as stiff and erect and formal as if still in command of soldiers in the field he might have been even more stiff and erect and formal here in the captives camp to try to hold his men together borsos said no captain weve known each other for a while frigyes still looked dubious leaning toward him istvan spoke in a low voice hes a mage sir is he frigyes answered also quietly he eyed borsos collar tabs unlike istvan he didnt need an explanation from borsos you dont want the enemy to know your skill eh he didnt bother calling borsos sir any more officersreal officers didnt take seriously mages claims to rank borsos didnt get angry a good many mages didnt take those claims seriously either the dowser replied thats about the size of it captain all right frigyes nodded briskly i can understand that and it might be useful for us to have a sorcerer here who knows maybe we can find a way to hit back at the kuusamans yet maybe but borsos didnt sound as if he believed it they have strong wards up around the camp though theyre the enemy captain but theyre not fools if they were fools they wouldnt be moving forward they wouldnt be beating us was what he surely meant but no gyongyosian soldiernot even a mage in military uniformwould come right out and say that the traditions of a warrior race died hard wards can do only so much captain frigyes said and led major borsos aside he spoke to the mage too softly for istvan to make out what they were saying istvan didnt even bother resenting it that was how officers were as best he could tell the stars had made them that way the cry of horror borsos let out a moment later wasnt too soft to hear it made istvan jump and he wasnt the only one no borsos said a moment later and wagged a finger under captain frigyes nose as if he were a real major and not just an officer by courtesy that was enough to put frigyes back up he stalked off like an offended cat what on earth istvan said he wasnt really asking borsos what frigyes had proposed it was more an exclamation of astonishment by the sweet pure and holy light of the stars sergeant you dont want to know borsos face was pale as milk a backcountry mana herder say from the valley from which istvan sprangmight have looked that way after seeing a ghost borsos didnt strike istvan as a man likely to see a ghost or to panic if he did but the dowser went off in the direction opposite the one frigyes had taken he staggered once plainly a man shaken to the core what on earth istvan said again again he got an answer this time from kun cant you figure it out for yourself sergeant istvan whirled the sorcerers apprentice and corporal was right behind him dirty mess tin in hand if i could figure it out would i be going what on earth istvan asked in some irritation and i know bloody well that you didnt hear as much of it as i did so what makes you so fornicating smart your friend there is a mage of sorts aye kun said he waited for istvan to nod then went on what was captain frigyes doing with us when all the kuusamans in the world jumped on our company huh the jump there was too wide for istvan to follow him across it what are you talking about patiently kun guided him across our company commander was good and ready to sacrifice us all to let the mages make the magic that would have thrown the slanteyes off becsehely remember but they captured us before he got us to wherever the wizards were and so he waited he needed to wait a while istvan had trouble with the jump even with a guide at last though istvans mouth fell open you think he was talking with borsos about making that same kind of sorcery here once the words were out of his mouth they made a horrid kind of sense he wished they hadnt and kun nodded thats just what i think captain frigyes wants to go on fighting the war how else can he do it could borsos make that kind of magic here istvan asked hes a dowser mostly does he even know enough to cast that kind of spell ask him kun answered i cant tell you with a shudder istvan shook his head i dont think i want to know kun clicked his tongue between his teeth in sharp disapproval you should always want to know knowledge is bad but ignorance is worse is that a fact istvan said and kun nodded as if it most assuredly were istvan put his hands on his hips if knowing is such a great thing how come we both wish the mages had never figured out how to use the magic they get from killing people answer me that o sage of the age its not the same kun said stiffly the only reason our mages turned toward that spell was that the unkerlanters used it against us we have to be able to fight back istvan shook his head again youre not really answering me youre just pushing it back one step dont you wish the unkerlanters hadnt worked out how to use that spell then you cant be real happy about it or you wouldnt have been so very thrilled to volunteer to help power the sorcery now kun winced volunteer to have my throat cut you mean no may the stars turn their light from me if i was happy about that and i suppose youve made your point huzzah for ignorance he held his hands in front of his face as if playing a fanfare on a trumpet i got him to admit i was right istvan thought proudly the pride was in proportion to how seldom that happened but then he wondered what captain frigyes would do and what he could make major borsos do he didnt know and wished he did as soon as the wish crossed his mind he realized kun wasnt entirely wrong he thought about admitting as much but in the end did no such thing he gained such triumphs too seldom not to want to savor them to the fullest leudast had got used to life in the bridgehead on the eastern bank of the fluss the algarvians kept pounding away trying to drive the unkerlanters back over the river and seal off the bridgehead they kept throwing in attacks every so often too going at the unkerlanter regiments on the east side of the fluss as if the whole war depended on wiping them out after swemmels men had beaten back one such assault a trooper in leudasts company said isnt this the worst fighting youve ever seen in all your days lieutenant the fellow couldnt have been above seventeen unkerlanter soldiers in the field didnt get to shave very often but his cheeks remained smooth and beardless even when he was nowhere near a razor leudast wanted to laugh in his face instead he just shook his head sonny i was wounded down in sulingen they fixed me up in time to let me fight in the durrwangen bulge after those scraps anything the redheads have done to us here is like a walk in the meadow with a pretty girl he thought of alize back in the village of leiferde sergeant kiun shook his head oh its not so easy as that sir he said more like a walk through the meadow with an ugly girl if you want to know what i think who wants to know what you think leudast returned they grinned at each other why not between the two of them theyd captured the algarvian noble whod called himself king of grelz just as leudast wasnt quite an ordinary lieutenant so kiun wasnt an ordinary sergeant the young soldier was unimpressed youre making fun of me he said and his voice broke in the middle of the sentence going from the baritone he would have as a grown man to the squeaky treble he was just escaping well what if we are gilan leudast asked you said something silly if you dont expect people to make fun of you after you say something silly youre making a big mistake but i didnt know it was silly gilan protested that makes it more silly not less leudast said had he been that naive when king swemmels impressers pulled him into the army if he had how in blazes had his sergeants and officers put up with him he thought of sergeant magnulf whod died in the first year of the war with algarve theyd shared a hole in some village they were trying to defend had he looked out of the hole when the egg burst in front of it he would be dead now and magnulf might still be alive it had happened the other way round he knew neither rhyme nor reason for it as if the mere thought of eggs were enough to conjure them up they started bursting not far from the trench in which he and kiun and gilan stood they werent quite close enough to make the soldiers throw themselves flat but they werent much farther off than that powers below eat the redheads kiun said i thought they were supposed to be moving everything north to fight our push there lots of odds and sods in the men theyre throwing at us leudast said those forthwegian whoresons are almost as bad as grelzersyou cant tell theyre the enemy till too late and now these blond kaunian buggers they fight hard kiun said aye leudast nodded there were a few kaunians not so far from my village i grew up pretty close to the border with forthweg you know theyre just people who dont look like us what i dont get is how come theyll fight for the algarvians when the redheads kill em to make their magic these arent kaunians from forthweg kiun said theyre from way the demon off in the east somewhere i hardly even know the names of the kingdoms on the other side of the world theyre valmierans leudast said before kiun could put in a jab he held up his hand only reason i know is because captain recared told me he knows all that stuff but still theyre blonds and so are the kaunians from forthweg so why would they help mezentios bastards have to take some prisoners squeeze it out ofem kiun said i suppose so leudast allowed unkerlanter eggtossers started answering the algarvians they still didnt respond as fast as the redheads but they were there in numbers in the bridgehead nothing the algarvians or the foreigners fighting for them had done had stopped unkerlant from bringing eggtossers and behemoths forward which was not the least of the reasons they still held the foothold on this side of the fluss dragons flew by dragons painted rockgray theyll drop their loads on the algarvians heads too leudast said serves the redheads rightthis is what they used to do to us all the time before long the algarvian eggtossers fell silent thats more like it kiun said maybe theyll learn not to try that anymore heres hoping leudast said thats one lesson i wish theyd learned already as a matter of fact kiun chuckled and nodded for all the world as if leudast were joking theyd both been in the front lines a long time if you didnt joke youd go mad sooner or laterunless the redheads killed you which was rather more likely here though the algarvians really did seem to learn a lesson things stayed very quiet for the next couple of days they were so quiet in fact that leudast almost lost the feeling of being stuck in a bridgehead he remarked on that the next time he saw captain recared adding if we hit them hard enough to make them stay this quiet maybe we can break out of this cramped little place and start pushing them back again recared shook his head not yet lieutenant id like to just as much as you would but not yet well have to see how things go up in the north before we find out what we can do here all the spares we have and all the reserves are going into that push if it goes well then we can try pushing here too or thats my guess anyhowask marshal rathar if you want a better notion oh of course sir leudast laughed unlike most junior lieutenants hed met the marshal and rathar might if reminded remember who he was none of that meant he could go asking questions of rathar none of it meant rathar was anywhere within a thousand miles of the river fluss at the moment either recared laughed too and said youve got attitude leudast do i leudast shrugged i dont know anything about that all i know is im still here and that makes me luckier than a lot of people poor magnulf crossed his mind again he asked how are things going up in the north sir better than we expected as well as we hoped recared answered leudast blinked he hadnt really looked for a reply quite so optimistic the regimental commander went on that whole algarvian army up there is getting smashed to pieces with any luck at all we will be able to start moving here pretty soonbut not just yet im in no hurry sir not as long as the redheads and the whoresons who fight for them leave us alone the way they have lately leudast snapped his fingers that reminds mekiun and i were talking about the kaunians who fight on algarves side has anybody figured out why theyre daft enough to do it weve caught a few recared said we havent found any answers that tell us a whole lot best guess so far is theyre about like the buggers in plegmunds brigade neerdowells and men down on their luck and a few just looking for a fight and taking one anywhere they can find it leudast grunted bunch of cursed fools if anybody wants to know what i think youd have to be wouldnt you to fight for somebody who was doing that to your own people well i think so captain recared said then he changed the subject and then sooner than leudast had expected he left leudast scratched his head for a while wondering if hed somehow offended the regimental commander he ran the conversation over in his mind he couldnt see how and then as he was drifting toward sleep that night he did after all king swemmel was killing powers above only knew how many unkerlanters to fuel the sorcery that thwarted the algarvians murderous magic and helped beat the redheads and their allies out of unkerlant even though he was doing that leudast didnt hesitate to fight for him neither did countless other unkerlanters maybe the valmieran kaunians felt the same way if they do theyre wrong leudast thought and dozed off after black bread and sausage the next morning he led kiuns squad out on a patrol through the woods he could have stayed back in camp and let the sergeant take charge of the patrol himself a lot of officers would have but hed been on plenty of patrols himself if he went on this one he thoughthe hopedhe gave everyone a little better chance of coming back in one piece a jay screamed a woodpecker drummed on the trunk of a birch a flock of waxwings flew from one wild plum tree to another no one whod ever heard them could mistake their soft metallic zreel zreel for the call of any other bird all seems pretty quiet kiun said no sign the redheads are trying to sneak in and make trouble you sound disappointed leudast said not me kiun shook his head surprised maybe but not disappointed i havent seen the algarvians back on their heels like this for a long time he shook his head again i dont think ive ever seen the algarvians back on their heels like this doesnt seem natural you know what i mean i think so leudast nodded theyre not doing anything themselves theyre waiting for us to do something they never used to do that we used to wait for them especially in the summertime its not the same fight it was a couple of years ago a good thing too he thought if the algarvians were still kicking us around like that wed have long since lost the war kiun started to answer then silently toppled his stick falling from hands that would no longer hold it he didnt even twitch he was dead before he hit the ground a patch of leaves near his feet started smoldering sniper leudast called and dove for cover sniper up a tree he addedthe trajectory of the beam that had slain kiun proved as much if the whoreson stayed quiet how were they supposed to find him hed got kiun through the head kiun had been about there and the patch of plants on the ground that had caught fire was about there so the enemy had to be over in that direction there leudast pointed northeast one of those trees there work carefully boyshell be looking for us the unkerlanters slid from tree to bush to rock trying to show themselves as little as possible and the sniper evidently knew what he was about for he sat tight in whatever tree hed chosen for himself if the unkerlanters didnt spot him he was free to get away free to wait for the next unlucky soldier to come within range of his stick but then a trooper shouted there he is and pointed to a big leafy oaka tree so big and leafy the mere sight of it had made leudast suspicious once seen the sniper didnt last long he wounded one more mannot badlybefore tumbling dead out of the tree he was a trouserwearing kaunian with an algarvian banner sewn to the sleeve of his tunic leudast kicked the body one more down he said and the patrol moved on colonel spinello stumbled south and east trying to pick his way through a marsh east of sommerda he was weary and filthy and unshaven he hoped he wouldnt meet any unkerlanter soldiers for he wasnt at all sure whether his stick held enough sorcerous energy to blaze at that he reckoned himself better off than most of the soldiers in the regiment hed commanded he remained alive and able to go on retreating most of them were either dead or captive he missed a step and went into muck up to his knees before he could sink any deeper jadwigai who remained on firm ground grabbed him and helped him get back to decent footing himself thank you sweetheart he said and gave her a kiss she was every bit as worn and dirty as he but still contrived to look good to him it wasnt just that she didnt grow whiskers to add to a raffish appearance shed been so pretty starting out grime and exhaustion only gave her beauty more sharply sculpted edges youre welcome she pointed toward a clump of manhigh bushes a couple of hundred yards ahead if we can get there well have a pretty good hiding place for the night aye i think youre right spinellos bones creaked when he started moving but move he did unkerlanters were bound to be prowling in this swamp if they caught up with him hed never make it out the other side to reconnect himself to the algarvian army he wondered if any algarvian army remained in northern unkerlant to be reconnected to he couldnt prove it not at the moment not by the way mezentios forces had collapsed under the hammer blow the unkerlanters dealt them he went into muddy water again before reaching the bushes this time he pulled himself out without help from jadwigai the water was also stagnant and smelly the last time hed risked a fire hed used a lighted twig to get a leech off his leg mosquitoes hovered in buzzing thrumming clouds as he and jadwigai had hoped the bushes marked slightly higher ground he stretched out almost ready to fall asleep right there where he lay jadwigai sat down beside him maybe she was still full of luckhe was still breathing after all or maybe hed broken the regiments luck and the whole northern armys as well when he first brought her to his bed or maybe thats nonsense he muttered what jadwigai asked nothing he told her or i think its nothing anyway he rolled onto his side and leaned on one elbow studying her ask you something go ahead she said why are you still here with me you might do better to let the unkerlanters catch up with you especially spinellos voice trailed away especially since were killing kaunians and theyre not didnt strike him as the most politic thing to say no matter how true it was he sometimes wondered why she hadnt cut his throat while he lay sleeping asking her that didnt seem politic either last thing i need is to put ideas in her head if she hasnt got em already jadwigai shook her head id just be a body to them i think they dont care about kaunians we always made jokes about them in my villageit wasnt that far from the border with unkerlant she might well have been right both sides here in the west fought the war without restraint algarvian soldiers did as they pleased with unkerlanter women in villages theyd overrun the unkerlanters sometimes killed algarvians they captured in lingering painful ways and left their bodies where their comrades could find them besides jadwigai went on i know youll keep me safe when we find the rest of the army ill do my best spinello wondered how good that best would be a colonel normally would have no trouble getting whatever he wanted for his mistress but times werent normal and most mistresses werent kaunians more urgent worries reared their head at the moment what have we got left to eat bread hard and stale but bread jadwigai answered and spirits if we mix the spirits with swamp water we can drink the swamp water too she was right again spinello shuddered all the same the swamp water tasted as nasty as it smelled and that remained true regardless of whether it would give him a flux of the bowels the bread wasnt just hard it could have done duty for a brick spinello and jadwigai shared if i had bad teeth id starve he said before jadwigai could answer eggs burst off in the distance whats happening to the army she asked have you got any idea in detail no spinello said in general aye they threw more at us than we could stand up against and they broke us i was afraid they were going to do that but theyve done more than i thought they could they used columns of behemoths to smash through our lines then turned in so theyd either surround us or make us fall back and they did it over and over and over i didnt know they had that many behemothsor dragons either i dont think anybody in algarve knew what all swemmel had before this fight started you might have done better if you had known jadwigai remarked aye thats so spinello admitted what he could hardly deny but its too late to dwell on it now now we have to hope we can stay alivewhen he said we he meant not only himself and jadwigai but every algarvian in the north of unkerlantand somehow stop the enemy more eggs burst do you think we can jadwigai asked sooner or later we have to spinello replied theyll run out of men and beasts and supplies if we have anything at all left by then well stop them but when where he shrugged an elaborate algarvian shrug the answer was important but he couldnt do much to influence it not as a harried fugitive he couldnt he took off his hat and laid it under his head for a pillow jadwigai lay down beside him in the bushes theyd made love a few times during the grinding retreat but they were both too weary now spinello reached out to pat her hand then he dove headlong into oblivion he woke a little before dawn jadwigai still slept with care and worry gone from her face she looked improbably young spinello shook his head she was as tough as she was pretty shed done as well as she could for herself in a situation as near impossible as made no difference shed done far better than most of the rest of the kaunians from forthweg and if she stayed with him now that was bound to be hard selfinterest he shook her awake ready to clap a hand to her mouth if she made more noise than she should shed done that once or twice not now though reason came into her eyes almost at once lets get going spinello said quietly aye jadwigai nodded maybe you can blaze some of these marsh birds maybe but spinello remembered a coot hed killed it hadnt been worth eating once dead of course when you got hungry enough the sun was still low in the southeast when they came on a couple of squads worth of soldiers for a moment spinello thought himself a dead man then he realized they were algarvians stragglers like himself no not stragglers just defeated men in full retreat they even had a crystallomancer with them were supposed to have a strongpoint in volkach the fellow said if we can get there maybe well get back to the real war under his breath he added something like if theres any real war left up here but he didnt say it loud enough to make spinello ask him to repeat it as they fought their way through the swamp one of the troopers asked whered you pick up the twist colonel he sounded curious and a little jealous as he might have had spinello carried a knapsack full of smoked pheasant and fine wine unlike a knapsack jadwigai could speak for herself im not a twist you what she called him proved shed learned soldierly algarvian i wasi amthe luck of the alberese regiment oh to spinellos surprise the soldier bowed to her as if to an algarvian duchess ive heard about you a lot of folks up here have heard about you aye thats right another soldier nodded he turned to spinello anybody gives you a hard time about her colonel you just yell theres plenty of people wont let anything happen to her thats good to hear spinello said he sounded less happy when they came out of the swamp and up onto solid ground the vast plains of northern unkerlant were ideal ground for behemoths back in the early days of the war that had all been to algarves advantage now when the unkerlanters could put three four five beasts in the field for every algarvian animal moving across the plains made sweat trickle from his armpits and down the small of his back swemmels men had been through here on their way farther east bloated stinking corpses many of them still wearing kilts lay here and there but no unkerlanters were in sight now get your bearings on this volkach place spinello told the crystallomancer is it still holding after squatting over his crystal the mage nodded about ten miles they tell me he said we can do it we have to do it spinello said and the other worn beaten dirty algarvians nodded actually there was one alternative if they didnt get to volkach they would die for that matter if the unkerlanters had a tight perimeter around the town they were in trouble but they stumbled into volkach late that afternoon though nervous pickets almost blazed them for enemy soldiers theyd had to hide a couple of times while unkerlanter columns went by swemmels men though were after bigger game than a few handfuls of holdouts and kept right on hurrying east back when the war was new algarvian soldiers had stormed west the same way the officer in charge in the unkerlanter town was a major he commanded most of a regiment of soldiers a few eggtossers and half a dozen behemothsnot enough to do anything with but too much for the unkerlanters to gobble down at a gulp it was the biggest algarvian force spinello had found in one place in a couple of weeks the major seemed relieved to see him there and cared not at all that a kaunian girl sat beside him what will we do sir the fellow asked as if spinello had any answers what can we do we cant hold on here much longervolkach isnt anything but a shield that lets our men farther east retreat and everything in the north is ruined everything i tell you i know after all spinello had been through since the unkerlanter blow fell he thought he knew better than the major did but what point to saying so sooner or later were bound to stop them he hoped he wasnt whistling in the dark he wanted a bath and food and clean clothes before he could ask for any of them the major said if only the islanders hadnt invaded jelgava wed get the reinforcements we need then maybe spinello said and then in spite of everything he fell asleep where he sat leino saluted captain brunho and spoke in classical kaunian sir i request your leave to transfer from habakkuk to the forces now on the ground in jelgava brunho studied him a tall somber lagoan staring down at a stubby little kuusaman may i ask why he said also in the old languagethe only tongue the two of them had in common of course sir leino had to stay polite if he affronted the captain he wouldnt get what he wanted i want to have the chance to give the algarvians what they deserve we have largely won the war at sea and my duties on habakkuk these days have more to do with maintenance than anything else this ship is not new anymore it is proved it no longer needs me the land war does you want to do something you have not done before brunho said though leino couldnt tell whether the captain approved of his lust for novelty he nodded aye sir and it was true but it wasnt the whole reason the other side of the coin was that he wanted to get away from xavega volunteering to go forward into battle would let him break clean without hurting her and without making her angry however much he enjoyed his time in bed with her he couldnt spend all his time with her in bed and he still found her annoying when they werent in bed she also intimidated him enough that he didnt want to come right out and tell her so brunho stroked his chin you are not the first mage aboard habakkuk to make this request you see sir leino said we have the chance to strike directly at algarve now i am not surprised i am not the only one who wants to take it if we lose too many mages from habakkuk our ship here will abruptly cease to be a ship captain brunho said an iceberg in the warm waters off the coast of jelgava would not last long you have plenty to keep habakkuk safe and the margin for security is large leino knew that was true hed made the staffing arrangements for sorcerers himself and i repeat maintaining the ship is now routine for most of the tasks involved you do not need mages of the highest rank the fight on the mainland though these are almost the same arguments the other mage used against me brunho said with a wintry smile since i had a difficult time disagreeing then i am not surprised at having a difficult time disagreeing now your request for transfer is approved he reached into his desk i have some forms for you to fill out i thought you might leino said dryly the forms were printed in both kuusaman and lagoan like any cooperative project habakkuk produced twice as much paperwork as it would have had one kingdom undertaken it with a sigh the kuusaman mage inked a pen and set to work escaping from xavega appeared nowhere on any leaf of paper no matter how large it loomed in his mind when leino finally finished the forms he pushed them across the desk at captain brunho the lagoan officer just accepted them for all the sense he could make of them they might have been written in demotic gyongyosian i thank you for your services he said in the one tongue he and leino did share gather your effects and report to the starboard bow i already have a boat scheduled to take the other mage ashore you may share it thank you sir leino said after salutingby captain brunhos upraised eyebrow he might have done it betterhe hurried away his effects as brunho called them fit into a duffel bag it was a heavy bag because a lot of those effects were sorcerous tomes walking with the bag over his right shoulder and with a list to the left he made his way to the starboard bow to his surprise he found xavega there the sea breeze blowing her coppery hair out behind her and also blowing at her kilt so she had to use one hand to hold it down he hadnt intended to say goodbye just to go better that way hed judged now he had no choice or so he thought till xavega said farewell leino i am leaving habakkuk leino gaped then he started to laugh so youre the other mage he exclaimed xavega looked blank and he realized hed been startled into kuusaman he translated his words into classical kaunian the other mage xavega still looked puzzled i am leaving habakkuk too leino set down his duffel on habakkuks iceandsawdust deck we have just been sailing here it is all routine i wanted the chance to fight the algarvians on the mainland xavega threw her arms around him and kissed him a nearby lagoan sailor whistled enviously squeezed against xavegas firm soft warmth leino couldnt imagine why hed wanted to leave her he knew he would remember as soon as he no longer felt her breasts pressing against him but that would be later now now he wanted to go back to his cabin with her no time for that they got into the boat and sailors lowered it down to the sea another mage a lagoan stood at the stern to seize the sorcerous energy in the ley line and propel the boat toward the distant shore xavega said when i volunteered to go to the mainland i did not think i would see you again why not leino asked he hadnt expected to see her either but he didnt care to come right out and say so well xavega hesitated but then spoke with her usual frankness you are a kuusaman after all her usual frankness and her usual ignorance leino thought as she went on i did not know if you would be eager to see the fighting up close my dear we do not revel in war the way algarvic folk do leino replied with a sigh that does not mean we cannot fight well we are fighting gyongyos by ourselves as near as makes no difference and two out of every three soldiers from the island in jelgava are kuusamans xavega made a sour face she had to know leino was telling the truth no one not even the most ardent lagoan patriot could deny that liking it was another matter at last she said it is not my fault that your kingdom is bigger than mine i never said it was your fault but you must not think that we kuusamans cannot fight or that we are afraid to fight leino raised an eyebrow of his own perhaps imitating captain brunho your king vitor did not think we were afraid to fight when he went to war against algarve he was afraid we would go to war against lagoas he remembered some of the hotheads at a party at his brotherinlaws wanting to do just that mezentios men wouldnt have attacked yliharma thennot in this war anyhow but an algarve bestriding derlavai would surely have looked across the strait of valmiera before long regardless of whether the kingdom dominant there was a nominal ally the boat skimmed up to the edge of the beach the mage said something in lagoan then condescended to translate it into classical kaunian for leino all out out leino went into calfdeep water he was glad he didnt get his duffel wet xavega splashed down beside him the boat slid away toward habakkuk as so many soldiers had before the two mages squelched up onto the jelgavan sands few signs of the fight were left close by the sea though a handful of sticks some with kuusaman hats tied to them others with lagoan headgear had been thrust into the sand to mark soldiers final resting places a kuusaman soldier came up to leino and xavega and said you are the mages we were told to expect no just a couple of tourists a little early in the season leino answered the trooper grinned xavega squawked that was when leino realized hed spoken his own language he translated for her she rolled her eyes out of bed she didnt believe in foolishness just over that rise is a leyline caravan depot where you can go forward up toward the front the soldier said again leino turned his words into classical kaunian after hed done that he asked the fellow how close to balvi will the caravan take us about fifteen miles thats where the front is the soldier answered king donalitu is practically pissing himself on account of he cant get back into his precious palace he set a hand on his chest breaks my heart it does ill bet leino said which made the other kuusaman laugh out loud when he translated for xavega she laughed too leino did a little laughing himself he wasnt angry or wasnt too angry at donalitu without the badtempered jelgavan monarch he wouldnt have found himself in xavegas arms and you wouldnt have left habakkuk to get away from her he told himself see how well that worked he and xavega trudged along with the kuusaman soldier till they got to the depot which was canvas over bare timbers a sergeant there checked their names off on a list leino threw down his duffel bag with a groan of relief after climbing into a car xavegas didnt seem to bother her she sat down beside him showing a lot of leg and not bothering to fuss with her kilt to show less a few soldiers boarded the leyline caravan and a couple of men one kuusaman the other lagoan with the green sashes of healers then the caravan still not very full began to glide west away from the sea and toward the fighting the country rose rapidly much of the interior of jelgava was a high plateau none too well watered and very hotespecially by kuusaman standards few mountains towered above the plateau it was as if having got that high the land refused to do much more before long leino saw fresh signs of war craters from bursting eggs scarring fields a grove of apricots ravaged by more eggs and half burned the carcass of a dragon with buzzards all over it a group of men working to get the armor off a dead behemoth the behemoth was kuusaman the armor the ceramicandsteel composite leinos own sorcery had helped create it was stronger against beams than regular chainmail but hadnt saved this particular beast he hoped the crewmen had managed to escape the caravan car glided past trenches and past hastily dug gravesredbrown lines on green still leino turned to xavega and spoke in classical kaunian the algarvians have not put up the hardest of fights no the lagoans have rolled over them she coughed a couple of times then grudgingly added and the kuusamans as well it was more like the kuusamans and the lagoans as well but leino didnt bother correcting her they also glided past dragon farms and fields full of grazing behemoths and unicorns and horses and rows of eggtossers and piles of eggs ready to fling and endless files of tents some lagoan brown othersmore kuusaman green all the appurtenances of modern war and when they arrived at the sorcerers encampment they found another kuusaman sergeant this one used classical kaunian so well leino wondered what hed done before becoming a soldier ah the pair from habakkuk i have you assigned to the same tent xavega smiled and nodded the smile was full of promise so much promise that leino nodded too so much for your good intentions he thought well youll enjoy yourself till the quarrels start again he sighed odds are it wont be long marshal rathars headquarters had moved east out of pewsum had he stayed there the front in northern unkerlant would have left him behind as the sea leaves bathers behind when the tide goes out now he directed the attack against algarve from a village just west of sommerda a village whose name he hadnt bothered to learn as things stood he didnt think he would ever know it he turned to general gurmun and said you know were going to have to move again soon looks that way gurmun agreed the troopers are getting ahead of us sure enough by the time were through this algarvian army will be gone from the board powers below eat all the redheads i wont miss em a fornicating bit neither will i as it had a way of doing rathars gaze fell on the map pinned to a table undoubtedly stolen from a fancier hut than this one he shook his head in slow wonder its going just the way we drew it up back in cottbus if anything were ahead of the timeline we drew up back in cottbus who would have imagined that would happen against the algarvians dispassionate as if he had clockwork in his belly gurmun answered we broke the buggers last year in the durrwangen bulge now its just a matter of kicking down the door and charging through rationally speaking rathar supposed he was right still he said this is the fourth summer of the war against them its the first time they havent tried an attack of their own do you wonder that im happy at how things are going no lord marshal gurmun said you can be happy just dont be surprised he sounded like what he was an officer tough competent and altogether confident unkerlant hadnt had many officers like that when the war against algarve started she still didnt have enough but one gurmun made up for a lot how are the behemoths holding up rathar asked losses are within the range we expected gurmun answered the farms in the west are sending enough fresh beasts forward the redheads dragons never could fly that far not even when things looked worst for us and the gongs never have put a whole lot of dragons in the air against us i wouldnt want to try flying over the elsung mountains either something to that rathar agreed a weekmaybe even lessand well be swarming over the forthwegian border gurmun said what was the forthwegian border i mean marshal rathar started to call him a mad optimist then he took another look at the map and at what the algarvians could put between his behemoths and the old forthwegian frontier you may be right he said you bet im right gurmun declared getting more footsoldiers on horseback helps too rathar said even though they fight on foot moving em mounted helps em keep up with the behemoths the redheads used that trick too whenever they could scrape up the mounts powers below eat the redheads gurmun said again the powers below are eating the redheads and were serving them up the first couple of years of this fight they taught us lessons now were better than our schoolmasters rathar doubted that the algarvians still had more flexible arrangements than the soldiers of his own kingdom they coordinated better among footsoldiers and behemoths and dragons each of their regiments or squadrons had more crystals than its unkerlanter counterpart which made them more responsive to trouble an algarvian regiment was probably worth close to two unkerlanter units but if king swemmels soldiers threw three or four or five regiments at each algarvian formation here in the north the unkerlanters had thrown a lot more than that at each algarvian regiment at the spearpoint of the attack and the redheads however fiercely theyd fought couldnt stand up against such an overwhelming weight of numbers this time theyd really and truly broken our way of putting out a fire is throwing bodies on it till it smothers rathar said sorry gurmun but i dont think thats the most efficient way to do things it works gurmun said its worked so it does rathar agreed again if it hadnt worked unkerlant would have lost the war but the price the kingdom was paying every ruined empty village he rode through as his countrymen fought their way east tore at him how would unkerlant rebuild once the fighting finally ended where would the peasants to fill those villages come from he had no idea before he could say as muchnot that general gurmun would have worried about such a thing his mind focused solely on using his beloved behemoths against the algarviansthe sound of many marching feet came to his ear his head swung toward it toward the eastern side of the village the side closest to the fighting gurmuns head swung the same way a grin spread over his bluntfeatured face as he said how much do you want to bet those are captives id sooner keep my silver thanks rathar answered gurmuns grin got wider lets go have a look at the whoresons without waiting for a reply he hurried out of the peasant hut rathar followed a little more slowly hed seen captive algarvians before still being reminded what these attacks were doing to the enemy wouldnt hurt and the column of captives coming through the village represented more than a regiments worth of men the guards in their rockgray tunics wore grins a lot like gurmuns some of the algarvians were grinning too the nervous grins of men glad to be alive and unsure how much longer they would stay that way more of them looked glum they might be alive but they didnt want to be in unkerlanter hands their light brown tunics and kilts were shabbier than algarvian uniforms had been when the war was new it wasnt just that they were filthy and worn the cloth itself was thinner and cheaper and flimsier than what theyd used then despite everything a few redheads strode along as if they owned the world they towered over their captors as algarvians usually did tower over unkerlanters and gave the impression that the guards were actually escorts taking them someplace where more unkerlanters would serve them rathar admired algarvian arrogance and despised it at the same time regardless of their true situation mezentios men still reckoned themselves the masters of derlavai some of them almost made even their foes believe it rathar held up a hand when the marshal of unkerlant gave even an informal order his mean leaped to obey column halt the guards screamed some in their own language others in fragments of algarvian who here speaks unkerlanter rathar asked he had a little algarvian himself but only a little and knew no classical kaunian the language that tied together educated men of all kingdoms in the east of derlavai and on the island kuusamo and lagoas shared a redhead stepped toward him one of the ones whod kept his spirit in spite of captivity i being in your kingdom three years he said trilling his words in a way no unkerlanter would i learning your speech some what you wanting your head on a plate gurmun growled but rathar waved him to silence what do you think of things now that we have beaten algarve in the summer as well as the winter the redheads shrug was a masterpiece of its kind i being in your kingdom three years he repeated no unkerlanters in algarve no unkerlanters ever in algarve sooner or later we winning war gurmun wasnt the only one who growled then so did all the guards who heard the algarvian rathar waved for quiet again he got it but he suspected the captive would have a hard time once out of his sight how can you say that he demanded when weve driven your countrymen out of most of what they held here in the north in just a few weeks with another shrug the algarvian replied we having secret sorceries we using them soon turning unkerlant upsydown insyout you seeing he sounded like a man who knew exactly what he was talking about and unkerlant had already known too much horror from algarvian sorceries some of the guards muttered among themselves a couple made signs the peasants used to turn aside evil omens and now instead of growling gurmun barked what kind of sorceries not knowing the captive shrugged yet again if likes of me knowing he had a corporals pips on his shoulder boardsnot being secret eh i think youre lying gurmun said in a deadly voice thinking how you liking the algarvians voice made it plain he didnt care what an unkerlanter even an unkerlanter general thought king mezentio saying these things so i believing he marshal rathar gestured once more waving the captives on the guards screamed at them they got moving before long the arrogant redhead was lost in the throng not soon enough though rathar thought do you believe the son of a whore gurmun asked sounding unwontedly nervous i believe he believes himself rathar answered whether mezentio is telling lies thats a different question its not the first weve heard of these secret sorceries aye gurmun was unhappy a lot of the captives weve taken lately go on about them where theres smoke theres liable to be fire where there are algarvians theres liable to be trouble rathar said and his general of behemoths nodded vigorously he went on reports have gone back to cottbus though and king swemmel doesnt seem to worried about this good gurmun said although marshal rathar nodded he wondered whether it was good true swemmel saw plots behind ever chair and under every rug if he didnt think these worrisome reports true it was a good sign he judged them an algarvian bluff that was fineif he proved right every once in a while though his instinct let him down badly as when hed judged that the algarvians wouldnt expect an unkerlanter attack three years before maybe the redheads hadnt expected such an attack but if not it was only because theyd been so far along with plans for their own which had gone in first no mistake now could cost as much as that one hador so rathar devoutly hoped but he didnt want to have to deal with the kings mistakes under any circumstances a crystallomancer burst out of the hut next to the one in which rathar made his headquarters lord marshal the young man shouted weve got men inside forthweg sir told you so general gurmun went from anxious to smug in a heartbeat this is even faster than you thought it would happen rathar said and gurmun nodded the marshal went on we have to move east we truly do were getting too far behind the line again gurmun nodded once more rathar laughed plenty of worse problems to have by the powers above gurmun chuckled too to the men in charge of an advancing army life looked good talsu set silver on the grocery counter since gailisas father was in the shop she put the money in the cash box before sliding the jar of green olives in a brine flavored with garlic and fennel across the counter he spoke in a low voice so her father wouldnt hear with luck we wont have to look at mainardos pointynosed algarvian face too much longer that would be good she agreed also quietly then she raised her voice to tell her father im going home with talsu now papa all right he answered ill shut the place up myself you dont need to worry about that hed stopped trying to persuade her and talsu to spend their nights there instead of in the tent on the outskirts of skrunda gailisa took talsus hand as she emerged from behind the counter they walked out of the grocers shop and into the warm twilight of a jelgavan summer evening a couple of newssheet vendors were still waving leaves of paper and shouting their news invaders thrown back before balvi king mainardos heroic algarvian allies triumph in savage righting when one of the vendors waved his sheet at talsu he shook his head and kept walking to gailisa he said the redheads keep right on telling lies i know she nodded youll never believe what i heard from one of the women who came into the shop today though will i want to believe it though talsu asked when gailisa nodded again he said then tell me well what she said was gailisa paused either for dramatic effect or just to take a breath what she said was either mainardos already run away from balvi or hes just about to he doesnt want to end up like whatshisname his cousin did over there in unkerlant boiled alive you mean talsu said the news sheets had screamed of unkerlanter barbarism when that happened his wife nodded once more he scratched his head that was a rumor he wanted to believe but no matter what he wanted he saw certain basic difficulties how did this woman here in skrunda know what was going on with the algarvians way over in balvi i dont know gailisa answered im telling you what she told me thats all i hope its true dont you of course i do talsu said with a nod of his own the only thing better would be having the lagoans or the kuusamans catch him and give him to king donalitu hed envy his cousin by the time donalitu was through with him he would wouldnt he gailisa smiled but then shook her head the things im imagining the things im hoping foreven thinking about them would have made me sick a few years ago its the war talsu had seen things and done things and had things happen to him that he never would have imagined before the war either one of the things that had happened to him was only too obvious right now pointing to the ruins past which he and gailisa were walking he said aye its the cursed war we used to live here gailisa squeezed his hand your father will find a way to rebuild he would have already if it were an ordinary fire and not eggs from the sky we cant go on living in a tent too much longer she sounded more hopeful than sure of that but talsu didnt argue with her he thought the same thing he started to say so but then exclaimed in surprise instead someone had been hurrying up the sidewalk toward them now despite the deepening dark talsu recognized him father he said what are you doing here its close to curfew time and you know how jumpy the redheads are powers above be praised traku said panting a little i found you before you got in i just hope they havent followed me what are you talking about talsu asked though he had a horrid fear he knew traku said someonenever mind whocame by today and warned me the algarvians were going to come after everybody theyd ever caught before i dont know why maybe lock em up again maybe do something worse but for all i know theyve got somebodyprobably a jelgavan too curse the buggerwatching the tent waiting for you to get there so they can drop on you something worse talsu repeated people whispered about what the algarvians did to people of kaunian blood off in the west if they were in trouble in jelgava what would keep them from doing the same thing here nothing he could think of he said no i cant go home not with that waiting i have to disappear i think youre right his father said gailisa nodded will you be all right if i dont come home tonight talsu asked traku well find out traku answered with a shrug if its not quite all right ill make my getaway too traku knew it was liable not to be that easy he didnt say anything for fear of alarming gailisa he clasped trakus hand then clutched his wife to him he kissed her for a long time when at last he had to let her go he said ill come back if i made it back from the dungeon i can make it back from this he knew that was liable not to be so easy too again he kept quiet gailisa said dont tell us where youre going if we dont know the redheads cant tear it out of us good luck son traku said gruffly he held out a small cloth sack it was heavy in talsus hand and clinked softly traku went on get going now maybe thatll buy you a little luck hope so anyhow with a wordless nod talsu started up a side street when he looked back he couldnt see his father and gailisa anymore he stuffed the sack of coins into a pocket he didnt know how long it would last but having it was ever so much better than going into exile with no more than a couple of coppers he wished gailisa hadnt been carrying the olives they would have given him a snack if nothing else in the old days skrunda like most towns had had a wall around it no more hardly any of the wall remained once jelgava became a united kingdom builders started making the most of all that readycut stone why not when the town was unlikely to have to stand siege these days skrunda had long since outgrown the old walledin area anyhow as talsu got to the outskirts then he wasnt in town one minute and out in the countryside the next he kept passing houses but less and less often with more and more open space between them presently he started going past little almond orchards and groves of fragrant lemons and oranges at first all he wanted to do was put distance between himself and skrunda the longer the algarvians had to chase him and the farther into the country they had to go the better if they want to catch me theyd better work for it he muttered an eagle owl let out a couple of deep hoots as if agreeing with him but once he was well away he started wondering where he should go and what he could do head for dobele the next town farther west what would he do when he got there the redheads knew he was a tailor so looking for work with a needle would be asking to get caught could he work as a day laborer he supposed so but the idea roused no enthusiasm in him what i really want to do is fight the algarvians not run from them he thought if i had a stick in my hands i wouldnt be running now all hed ever wanted to do was fight mezentios men trying had landed him in the dungeon trying again might land him in something worse he didnt care that was what he wanted more than anything else in the world and so instead of staying on the road and making for dobele he turned down a little path that led up toward low rolling hills south of the two towns he didnt know whether bandits lurked in them what he did know was that were he a bandit he would have lurked up there he didnt get to them that night but fell asleep in bushes by the side of the track that was uncomfortable but not too bad on a summers night in jelgava he wouldnt have cared to try it in some southern kingdom when he came to a farm the next morning he asked the farmer if i give you a days work will you give me a couple of days food the farmer just stood in the yard tossing feed to his hens his eyes measured talsu after the silence stretched for a while talsu said or if you want you can turn me in to the redheads theyd thank you he hadnt wanted to roll the dice so soon but seemed to have little choice and it worked the farmer said well ill find something for you to do he went into the house and came out with barley bread and hard white crumbly cheese and some olives much like the ones talsu had bought at the grocery and a flask of wine sharpened with citrus juices talsu ate and drank then he chopped wood till his palms blistered and pulled weeds in the vegetable garden after that the farmer and his wife gave him bread and ham and olive oil and more wine for lunch and a stew of mutton and grain and almonds and apricots for supper he slept on straw in the barn the following morning the farmer brought him a couple of loaves of bread a small flask full of a paste of garlic and olives and oil and a large flask full of wine he even gave him a knapsack that had seen better days in which to carry the food talsu came to attention and saluted as he might have to an officer he wasnt altogether astonished when the farmer returned the salute the fellow said if you go six or eight miles south youll come to a track that heads southwest into some of the steeper country its the one with a milepost from the old kaunian days just in front of it follow it if you care to why talsu asked the farmer just shrugged after a moment talsu shrugged too he slung the knapsack over one shoulder and started south his hands hurt his joints ached and his muscles were stiff and sore he wasnt used to the work the farmer had set him after a while though walking along under the warm sun eased the kinks there was the milestone its graystreaked marble much weathered but the inscription still legible and he could make sense of that classical kaunian inscription thanks to kugu the silversmith hed had other less pleasant things for which to thank kugu and hed had his revenge he turned right and walked down the track the farmer had mentioned sure enough the country did get rougher anyone with a stick on one of those bluffs could have potted him before he knew where danger lurked but the fellow with a stickalgarvian military issue talsu recognized it at oncestepped out from behind a tree you may have made a mistake coming along this track he said a fatal mistake he meant not if youre fighting mezentios buggers a farmertalsu described the man and his farm as well as he couldsent me on this way i was in the army till we quit i know what to do do you the banditor was diehard a better namerubbed his poorly shaved chin he lowered the stick but not by very much come along with me well see what we find out talsu gladly came thirteen krasta stood naked by the side of the bed staring down at herself i still dont look like im pregnant she said sounding as if she was trying to convince herself colonel lurcanio lying naked in the bed lazy and cheerful after making love nodded not not very much he answered agreeably what do you mean not very much krasta demanded her indignation quick to kindle even toward her dangerous algarvian lover my belly doesnt bulge at all well so it doesnt lurcanio reached out and set the palm of his hand on that stillflat belly krasta expected it to slide lower down between her legs instead lurcanio went on but your breasts are larger than they were not that i mind you understand rather than reaching down from her belly he reached up to caress her she hissed be careful theyre more tender than they used to be too she couldnt help admitting that it was both blessing and curse when his hands werent gentle or sometimes simply when she moved too fast they would hurt but they also gave her more pleasure when he did a proper job of caressing them than they ever had before she quickened sorry my dear lurcanio continued in almost clinical tones and your nipples are larger and darker than they were are they krasta looked down at herself again i hadnt noticed that im not surprised or not very lurcanio said men are liable to pay more attention to that sort of thing than women do i should hope so krasta sat down beside himcarefully so her tender breasts wouldnt bounce as far as im concerned theyre just there a sudden thought took her by surprise but i suppose theyll matter to me if i decide to nurse the baby myself aye im sure they would lurcanio raised an eyebrow and would you do such a thing or would you hire a wet nurse i dont know krasta said with an impatient toss of the head she promptly regretted it for it jerked the upper part of her body too she hissed again and brought a protective hand up to her breasts theyre just there she repeated like algarvians in valmiera lurcanio said she nodded aye like algarvians in valmiera only after shed repeated that too did she pause to wonder about it what an odd way to put things not so odd we have been here four years have been here four years lurcanio said considering some of the places i might have gone instead i have no complaints you may rest assured that that is the truth but i do not know how much longer i can stay here what do you mean krasta had always hated change these days lurcanio in her bed and algarvians on the streets of priekule were what she was used to he stroked her again that was all he was likely to do he wasnt a young man any more and wouldnt want her more than once of a night voice detached and ironic as usual he answered unlike some people i could name i am usually in the habit of meaning what i say and neither more nor less than that but krasta frowned trying hard to think despite finding the exercise unfamiliar where would you go what would you do unkerlant or jelgava most likely he replied i would fight for my king and my kingdom that is one of the things a soldier may be called upon to do from time to time you know but what would i do krasta exclaimed when she did think she usually thought about herself first colonel lurcanio laughed i presume that were i to depart this mansion tomorrow the very next day you would start trying as hard to convince viscount valnu that your baby is his as youve spent the last few weeks trying to convince me it is mine it is yours krasta insisted with much more certainty than she felt all along though shed done her best to make herself believe the baby was lurcanios and if the algarvian officer should disappear would she have to start believing the child was valnus she glared at lurcanio youre a horrid man too you know thank you lurcanio said which only annoyed her more he laughed but the amusement wouldnt stay on his face when it faded he looked a long way indeed from young i have not got my orders yet you understand but i fear they may not be far away krasta didnt feel so happy either seeing her lover look not so young reminded her she wasnt quite so young either so did the weariness that came with carrying a child fighting back a yawn she said if you algarvians need all your officers and soldiers in those other kingdoms far away how will you hold on to valmiera she thought about the soldiers shed seen marching up the boulevard of horsemen the blond soldiers in valmieran uniform with algarvian flags on their sleeves did the redheads think they could use men like that to hold down the kingdom if they were right what did that say about valmiera what did lying naked here beside an algarvian say about her it was all very confusing lurcanio patted her he liked to touch her even when he didnt feel like doingor couldnt doanything more that is a good question my sweet he said when king mezentio figures out a good answer for it i hope he will let me know until then he got out of bed and started getting into his clothes when he was dressed he bowed to her i shall see you in the morning he seldom spent nights in her bedchamber krasta turned out the lamp without bothering to put on pyjamas a month into summer the night was fine and warmnothing like the long frigid miserable hours of darkness the winter before and shed had it easier than most because of the algarvians in the mansion with her she didnt dwell on that for long she just slid under the linen sheets and fell asleep a couple of hours later distant rumblings woke herthose and flashes of light on the horizon thunder she wondered muzzily but the day was bright and clear then her wits began to work and she remembered the sorry world in which she lived oh she said out loud around a yawn the islanders are dropping eggs on us again she took it for granted why not it had happened before a good many times it would doubtless happen again too she sighed and went back to sleep when she came down to breakfast the next morning she found colonel lurcanio in a foul temper how are we supposed to go about fighting a proper war if they keep dropping eggs on our heads he demanded they have dragons krasta said spreading butter and jelgavan marmalade on toast dont you have dragons too of course we have dragons too lurcanio answered irritably he was going to be difficult krasta could feel it and she was right more irritably still lurcanio went on we have dragons fighting to keep the lagoans and kuusamans on sibiu from dropping eggs on algarve herself we have dragons some dragons fighting the islanders down in jelgava and we have dragons in the west in unkerlant and forthweg fighting swemmels men unkerlant and forthweg krasta asked i hadnt heard that before and you have not heard it now either forget i said it lurcanio told her he passed a hand across his face it was still early morning but he looked weary after a moment he looked up at krasta again where was i ah aye with all those dragons flying over the rest of derlavai how many do you think algarve has left to put in the air above priekule not enoughthats plain krasta said and so eggs land on valmierans you people should have thought this out better before you got into such a big war if you want to know what i think lurcanio stared at her out of redrimmed eyes he started to laugh krasta started to get angry then her algarvian lover said out of the mouths of babes he got up walked around the table and kissed her you are right my sweet we probably should have thought this out better but it is rather too late to worry about that now would you not agree lurcanio she said as he went back to his seat he looked her way in some surprise she hardly ever called him by name what is it he asked his voice more serious than usual the mocking note so often in it now entirely gone youre going to lose the war arent you the words came forth in a rush blurted out before krasta had the chance to think about whether she really wanted to ask that question eat your breakfast colonel lurcanio told her as if she were a child asking something whose answer had to be too hard for it to understand but then he shook his head a gesture aimed more at himself than at krasta things are not easy these days he said slowly i do not know when they will be easy again i do not know if they will ever be easy again but i tell you this if algarve goes down we shall go down fighting do you doubt it even for a moment no krasta shivered though the day already promised considerable heat we shall go down fighting lurcanio repeated as if she hadnt spoken we shall put sticks in the hands of the veterans left alive from the six years war and in the hands of fourteenyearold boys still sore from their circumcisions for if we lose this war as we lost the last one what shall be left for algarve for once in all the time theyd spent together krasta wanted to go around the table and comfort him but she didnt she just sat where she was she wished the baby inside her would let her drink brandy even so early in the day but the mere thought made her belly clench lurcanio shrugged and smiled as if deliberately pushing worry to one side well he said the evil time has not yet come for us and while it may come it also may not i intend to do what i can to enjoy myself in the meanwhile no the evil time hasnt come for the algarvians yet krasta thought what about for the kaunians of forthweg what about for kaunians all over derlavai she couldnt ask lurcanio that question that she couldnt ask it of him was probably the most important reason she hadnt got up and gone around the breakfast table to him she was in an odd way and with certain gaps truly fond of him but he was an algarvian and she had yellow hair walls would always stand between them whether he fully realized it or not he rose and bowed to her and now i needs must go do what needs doing to hold the evil time at bay as best i can if you will excuse meone of his eyebrows twitchedor even if you will not he bowed again and left he sits at a desk but he fights for algarve just as much as if he had a stick in his hand krasta had known that for four years but knowing it and having it hit home were two different things hes worth even more than an ordinary soldier because he can do things no ordinary soldier can do and you may have his baby inside you no matter what lurcanio would do to her if she bore a blond krasta hoped with all her heart the child was valnus after the impressers hauled garivald into king swemmels army he hadnt got much in the way of training he hadnt got any training as a matter of fact theyd given him a uniform and a stick and told him to obey the officers and underofficers set over him if he knew what was good for him then theyd taken him to the front in northern unkerlant stuck him in a squad there and thrown him at the algarvians he still had trouble recalling that his name was supposed to be fariulf and now less than a month after hed followed a behemoth over and through the algarvian trenches when the assault began he found himself a corporal and a corporal in a foreign kingdom at that for his regiment had pushed into forthweg a couple of days earlier forthwegian peasant villages didnt look much different from their unkerlanter equivalents except that the locals painted their houses in brighter colors and that the men wore beards no another difference there were a lot of men in the villages that took some getting used to when the redheads came through these forthwegians knuckled under one of garivalds squadmates said they didnt fight back not like we did and so more of them are left alive garivald thought he kept that notion buried down deep getting a name for the subversive kind of grousing might have proved fatally inefficient what he did say was the redheads put up a tougher fight down in the south than theyre doing up here thats cause half the grelzers are traitors another trooper said which wasnt quite true but came too close to truth for comfort the fellow went on besides what do you know about it corporal even if you did get promoted youre a new fish garivald started to answer that hed seen plenty of fighting down in grelz even if not formally as one of king swemmels soldiers his irregularsmunderics till he took over the bandhad harassed the algarvians and their grelzer puppets and even a few forthwegians the ruffians in the outfit called plegmunds brigade but in the end garivald kept his mouth shut and let the question go with just a shrug he didnt want people knowing corporal fariulf was really garivald the fellow whod led irregulars and written songs and done other things to draw the unfriendly notice of people in cottbus king swemmel and those who followed him trust no one whod fought the redheads on his own after all such people might turn and fight him one day too dragons streaked by overhead flying east they were all painted the rockgray of garivalds tunic havent seen many algarvian dragons lately he remarked that seemed a safe enough way to change the subject dont miss those bastards either not even slightly two soldiers said it at the same time in almost identical words garivald hadnt had to worry about algarvian dragons down in grelz mezentios men hadnt had so many that they bothered using them against irregulars almost every beast they put in the air flew against king swemmels main army but now garivald was part of that main army if the algarvians put dragons in the air here in the north they would be flying them at his comrades and him but if the algarvians put dragons in the air here in the north swarms of unkerlanter dragons would try to knock them down garivald had never seen so many dragons in his whole life hed never imagined that so many dragons could be gathered together and fed and flown over one stretch of the front halt who comes a sentry called as someone approached their campfire the answer came back in forthwegian some unkerlanters especially those from the northeast could make sense of the related language but it was just tantalizing noise to a grelzer like garivald the sentry was a northern man when he said come ahead then in his dialect of unkerlanter the forthwegian must have been able to follow him for he approached the fire except as he got close he proved not to be a forthwegian oh he had dark hair and a dark beard as forthwegian men did but he was tall and slim and had blue eyes and a short straight nose nothing like the beaks belonging to forthwegians and their unkerlanter cousins and instead of a sensible kneelength tunic he wore a short tunic and trousers garments garivald had heard of but till now had never seen corporal he asked garivald that was a word nearly identical in forthwegian and unkerlanter when garivald nodded the local bowed low before him as if he were at least a colonel rather than a junior underofficer he said something that might have been thank you or might as easily not have been then he jabbed a thumb at his own chest and said ikaunian kaunian garivald said i thought kaunians were blond he didnt think a whole lot of kaunians were left alive in forthweg either but saying that didnt strike him as the best way to make this fellow his friend as things turned out it wouldnt have mattered for the local plainly didnt understand his dialect in some exasperation garivald called out to the sentry come back here and translate for me rivalin aye corporal rivalin said ill do my best thats all you can do garivald agreed ask him why his hair isnt yellow if hes one of these kaunian buggers rivalin spoke in his own dialect exaggerating some of the sounds and slurring others till garivald could scarcely make out what he was saying the kaunians seemed to get it though and answered quickly too quickly he and rivalin had to go back and forth a couple of times before the sentry turned to garivald again corporal he says he is a blond only he dyed his hair for some kind of a magical disguise he had that made him look like a forthwegian so the redheads wouldnt grab him oh garivald started to nod then checked himself wait a minute if he had this magical disguise why did he need to dye his hair wouldnt the magic take care of that for him more backandforth between rivalin and the kaunian at last rivalin returned to a brand of unkerlanter garivald could readily understand corporal i think hes saying he did it on account of his hair would turn yellow again if it got cut while he had the spell on but im not quite sure oh garivald repeated all right now ask him why he decided to quit his disguise and start wearing those silly clothes when rivalin translated that the kaunian spoke with considerable heatso much heat that the unkerlanter sentry had to ask him to slow down several times when the torrent of words finally ebbed rivalin answered i dont think hes got a whole lot of use for forthwegians powers above one of the troopers behind garivald said i havent got a whole lot of use for forthwegians either garivald shrugged except for the men of plegmunds brigade these were the first forthwegians hed ever seen the kaunian spoke again he says he wears those clothes on account of those clothes are what kaunians wear rivalin reported garivald shrugged again forthweg was a lot warmer than the duchy of grelz why anybody would want to wear trousers up here even the algarvians werent so foolish and then through rivalin the kaunian said he wants to know how to join up with us corporal he wants to start killing algarvians says its his turn now i cant do anything about that you know i cant garivald said and rivalin nodded garivald went on take him to lieutenant andelot maybe hell figure out what to do with himand hell be out of our hair right rivalin grinned at him you havent been a corporal very long fariulf but you know eggs is eggs he led the kaunian away i should hope i know eggs is eggs garivald said i know we need a new sentry too he named another man and sent him out to take rivalins place when rivalin came back he looked astonished i think theyre going to recruit that whoreson he said why not garivald said he wants to blaze some redheads if he gets a couple before they get him thats a bargain for us and even if he doesnt they blaze him instead of an unkerlanter thats a bargain too rivalin eyed him you sure the impressers just scooped you off your farm too right i am garivald answered i wish i were back there now getting my crop in he paused part of me wishes that anyway the rest well its not like i dont owe the algarvians anything heads solemnly went up and down a lot of the newer soldiers in swemmels army came from lands regained from the redheads theyd seen how the algarvians ruled the countryside they held a lot of them had kinsfolk missing or dead the way garivald did and a lot of them fought as if the war were a personal struggle against algarve in some fights not a great many captives got taken more behemoths came up during the night before dawn the next morning they rumbled forward tearing a hole in the algarvian line through which footsoldiers swarmed garivald had done that again and again he almost got the feeling heor rather the unkerlanter armycould do it any time almost hed already seen that mezentios men even when outnumbered and outflanked fought hard for every foot of ground and they didnt fight with sticks and behemoths alone hed heard about the magic that shook the ground and tore fissures and sent lambent purple flames shooting up from it now his squad met that magecraft at first hand men screamed when the earth opened and then closed on them men whom the flames caught had no chance to scream and simply ceased to be one burst of flame not only charred a behemoth but also touched off the eggs it carried spreading ruin through the footsoldiers closest to it but then the magic ebbed almost as swiftly as it had sprung up lieutenant andelot happened to be crouched by garivald as it faded the officer said thats our mages sacrificing our people to beat down their wizardry is there any other way to beat it garivald asked if there is we havent found it yet andelot answered life energy gives mages a lot of force to work with life energy a bloodless way to say killing people garivald found exactly what it meant that afternoon when he and the survivors from his squad pushed past the sacrifice the algarvian mages had made to try to stop them row upon row of blond men and women all blazed through the head no wonder that kaunian wanted to join up garivald said if the algarvians had done this to us id want to kill every algarvian ever born no wonder at all rivalin said like garivalds his eyes kept coming back to the dead blonds in sick fascination but then garivald reflected that mezentios men hadnt lined up unkerlanters row on row and sacrificed them their own mages had done that he wished he hadnt thought of it in such terms they only do it because the algarvians are killing these blonds that was true but eased his mind only so much they were doing it and why counted little sooner or later a day of reckoning would have to come wouldnt it whenever bembo went out on the streets of eoforwic these days he found himself looking west that was the direction rain came from not that rain was likely in the forthwegian capital in the middle of summer but despite heat and bright blue skies and dazzling sun a storm was brewing in the west and he knew it the algarvian constable noticed he wasnt the only one glancing that way with a distinct effort of will he turned his gaze away from the west and onto his partner its on your nerves too eh delminio he said aye delminio answered not needing to ask what it was who wouldve thought things could just fall apart like that not me bembo said and tell me what difference will it make to the cursed unkerlanters powers below eat em if im toting a long stick like a soldier and not the regular short one this miserable thing is heavy he could always find something to complain about even though hed carried an armyissue stick going into the kaunian quarter despite the long stick slung on his own back delminio had no trouble shrugging an elaborate algarvian shrug no it probably wouldnt make much difference to swemmels bastards if they ever get here he allowed powers above grant that they dont bembo said powers above grant that the army stops em somewhere anywhere hed never imagined sounding plaintive and worried about the algarvian army but that was how he felt delminio went on as if he hadnt spoken repeating it wont matter much to the unkerlanters no but suppose these forthwegian whoresons here in town start feeling frisky wouldnt you rather be toting something thatll knock em over from more than a hundred feet away urk bembo said and meant it most sincerely dyou think itll come to that who knows delminio shrugged again but ill tell you this theres an awful lot of forthwegians walking around with their peckers up because they know were hurting or do you think im wrong he sounded as if he hoped bembo would tell him he was just imagining things bembo wished he could do that but he couldnt before the forthwegians on the streets had scrambled out of the way when they saw constables coming they might not have loved them who ever loves a constable bembo wondered not wasting a chance for selfpity but they feared them which would do now if they werent laughing behind the constables backs bembo would have been astonished some of them had the nerve to laugh in the constables faces bembo wouldnt have minded teaching them a lesson but he didnt orders were not to do anything that might touch off a riot the algarvians had enough to worry about in forthweg these days without adding the forthwegians to the mix delminios grunt might have meant he thought bembos silence proved his point since bembo thought the same thing he didnt push his partner the stinking unkerlanters were getting close to the twegen river the stream that flowed north to the sea right past the western edge of eoforwic do they think theyll have a happy time if swemmels whoresons take this place away from us bembo asked no one in particular not likely no not likely at all delminio agreed other question is do they care and thats not likely either most ofem dont think about unkerlanters one way or the other except that swemmels men are giving us a hard time they think king penda will come back if they throw us out and theyll all be happy again dont hold your breath bembo said wasnt swemmel about ready to boil somebody alive because whoever it was wouldnt hand penda over to him tsavellas of yanina had him delminio said bembo snapped his fingers thats right thanks id forgotten who it was when i was back in tricarico reading about all this stuff in the west in the news sheets it didnt seem to matter so much only goes to show you cant tell ahead of time delminio said and bembo nodded he hadnt thought much about forthweg at all not in the days before the war started hed never imagined he would have the bad luck to get stuck in this miserable kingdom for years a forthwegian with a graystreaked black beard reaching halfway down his chest came out of his shop and shouted at the constables in bad algarvian when you catch villains who theft from me how i make living they theft my trunks well however you make a living it wont be as an elephant bembo answered delminio snickered the shopkeeper who sold luggage didnt speak algarvian well enough to get the joke elephant what you talk about elephant he said powers below eat elephant go catch thefts what you good for all you algarvians you nothing but crazy peoples bembo swept off his plumed hat and bowed as if at a compliment thank you he said delminio snickered again the shopkeeper said something in sonorous guttural forthwegian whatever it was bembo didnt think it was praise the fellow turned around and stumped back into his shop if the bugger who stole from him starts selling those trunks maybe well nab him delminio said if he doesnt how can we get our hands on him and why should we care bembo added you think i want to work hard for somebody who calls me names if hed dropped a little silver now thatd be a different story sure enough delminio agreed far as im concerned the powers below are welcome to all these forthwegians i wouldnt shed a tear if we started shipping them west along with the blonds trouble with that is itd really spark off an uprising bembo said after pondering for a couple of paces delminio nodded aye youre probably right he took another step of course the uprisings liable to come anyway if it does these buggers ought to be fair game you ask me you talk like oraste bembo said who delminio waggled a finger oh your old partner he seems like a pretty good man to have at your back he is bembo let it rest there along with being a good man to have at ones back oraste believed the way to settle problems was to settle the people who made themby choice permanently the shift was long and slow and dull another argument with a forthwegian right at the end made it even longer delminio was furious and didnt even try to hide it he was all for arresting the local who was unhappy because somebodyd flung a rock through a window hed just replaced bembo didnt want to arrest him he wanted him to shut up and go away then his partner and he could go back to the barracks and relax if we drop on him we have to drag him over to the gaol and fill out all the cursed forms he said that always takes hours and were already late getting back and im hungry he patted his belly to him that argument like the belly in question carried considerable weight in the end it carried weight for delminio too he contented himself with taking hold of his stick and starting to swing it toward the forthwegian that stopped the argument in the middle of the ley line the forthwegian turned pale and fled we ought to ship him west delminio said nobodyd miss him a bit powers below eat him bembo said lets go home and see if theres anything left in the refectory those other greedy buggers better not eat everything in sight he was almost hungry enough to hurry back to the barracks to make up for lost timealmost but not quite he and delminio were still three or four blocks away and squabbling goodnaturedly over what the evenings entree would be when a great roar ahead staggered them both the ground shook under bembos feet windows shattered without rocks pitched through them bembo listened for the bells that warned of unkerlanter dragons but didnt hear them he had trouble hearing much of anything they somehow snuck one through the bastards he shouted and even had trouble hearing his own voice delminios words came to bembo as if from very far away was that the barracks bembos eyes opened wide he hadnt thought of that he and delminio started to run when they rounded the last corner bembo skidded to a stop broken glass and pebbles skritched under his boots the whole front of the barracks was gone not far from him a big chunk of stone had come down on someonea forthwegian by his tunic the result wasnt pretty this must have been an enormous egg delminio had to shout it two or three times before bembos battered ears caught it he nodded too big for a dragon to carry youd think he had to do some shouting of his own to get his partner to understand and i still dont hear any warning bells someone came staggering out of the barracks an algarvian badly burned and bleeding how anyone could have lived through that blast of sorcerous energy was beyond bembo but he ran toward the other constable to give him what help he could before he reached his countryman the fellow clapped both hands to his chest and toppled he might almost have been blazed then a beam burned the ground by bembos feet and he realized the other algarvian had been blazed he wasnt a soldier hed never been a soldier he had no interest in becoming a soldier he had a great deal of interest in never becoming a soldier all of which when someone started blazing at him meant exactly nothing he dove for cover as if hed been fighting in the west against the unkerlanters for years get down he shouted to delminio who still stood there staring as if he hadnt the slightest idea what was going on maybe delminio didnt a moment later bembos partner clutched at his shoulder and went down so hed got his lesson bembo hoped it wouldnt prove too expensive other shouts started piercing the ringing in bembos ears they werent in his language but in raucous forthwegian he couldnt understand a word of them no that wasnt true after all one word he understood very well penda stupid buggers have gone and risen up sure as blazes he thought peering out from behind the smoking rubble in back of which he sprawled theyll pay for that oh how theyll pay someone in a halfshattered building across the street from the barracks moved bembo didnt know exactly what the motion was or just whod made it whoever it was though was bound to be a forthwegian which meant which suddenly meantan enemy bembo raised his stick to his shoulder and blazed he heard a shriek he heard it very clearly and shouted in fierce triumph all at once he was delighted he had that long heavy armyissue stick you want us youll have to pay for us he yelled a beam seared the air inches above his head he smelled thunder and lightning exultation trickled out of him as he realized the forthwegian rebels were liable to be willing to do just that saxburh wailed in her cradle vanai hurried to pick up the baby and put her on her breast that was what saxburh wanted her cries ceased she sucked and gulped contentedly vanai stroked her fine soft hair it was dark as ealstans was but the babys skin was too fair too pale for a fullblooded forthwegians sure enough saxburh showed both sides of her family eggs burst not far away the windows rattled they hadnt shattered yet powers above only knew why vanai felt like shrieking too but who would comfort her if she did no one she could think of not even ealstan could do that vanai cursed softly desperately was ealstan here staying close by her side while she took care of their daughter she shook her head he had to go fight she told saxburh he had to try to kick the redheads out of eoforwic he thought that was more important her daughter stared up at her out of eyes darkening from blue toward brown the baby had just learned how to smile she tried to smile and nurse at the same time milk dribbled down her chin hes a fool vanai went on in classical kaunian dabbing at saxburhs face with a rag hes nothing but a fool he thinks the algarvians will go away just like that she snapped her fingers the sound startled the baby who jerked her headand tried to take vanais breast with it vanai yelped that made saxburh look back toward her again without letting go her moving that way hurt less after a little while saxburh grunted and made a mess in her drawers vanai changed them cleaned the baby off and rubbed olive oil on her bottom and then nursed her some more saxburhs eyes sagged shut vanai slid the nipple out of her mouth hoisted the baby to her shoulder and got a sleepy belch out of her a couple of minutes later she set saxburh back in the cradle and closed the toggles on her tunic she went to the kitchen and poured herself a cup of wine nursing always left her thirsty as she drank she looked out the window she wasnt afraid anyone on the street would recognize her as a kaunian for one thing the forthwegians held this part of eoforwic and for another her masking spell worked as well as it always had now that she wasnt pregnant any more she looked like a forthwegian and she would for hours yet dark brown bloodstains marred the gray slates of the sidewalk vanai couldnt tell which ones came from algarvians and which from forthwegians no algarvians were left alive hereabouts not now smokes sharp scent filled the air so did the nastier deadmeat stench from unburied bodies looking west vanai saw fresh smoke rising from a dozen fires inside eoforwic and even more smoke huge black columns of it on the far side of the twegen river the unkerlanters were closing in on eoforwic moving so fast that not even the news sheets which had to give forth with algarvian lies could cover up the magnitude of the disaster that had befallen mezentios men here in the north vanais mouth twisted if the unkerlanters hadnt come so far so fast the forthwegian underground wouldnt have risen up vanai didnt much care whether forthwegians or unkerlanters gave orders in these partsanyone but algarvians suited her fine but ealstan cared though he differed from most of his countrymen in his views about kaunians ealstan was a forthwegian patriot he wanted king penda back he wanted the forthwegians to free their own kingdom or as much of it as they could and he was willingno he was horribly eager to risk his life to help bring that about hes an idiot vanai whisperedshe didnt want to disturb saxburh but she meant it all the way down to the depths of her soul the baby was real the baby was there set against saxburhs reality what did the kingdom of forthweg matter nothing not so far as vanai could see but ealstan thought differently men are stupid went through vanais mind not for the first time shed done everything she could to keep ealstan here in the flat nothing had worked not argument not pleading not tears pybba told him there was going to be a fight and after that he might as well have been deaf and blind vanai had no trouble at all hating the pottery magnate more eggs burst all in one sector of the city north of the flat vanai cursed again in classical kaunian and in forthwegian the algarvians had far more eggtossers than pybbas ragtag and bobtail true mezentios men needed everything they could scrape together against the unkerlanters but they also couldnt afford to lose eoforwic they were fighting back hard footsteps in the hallway vanais heart beat faster she didnt have to fear algarvian constables not for a while that thudding heart meant hope and at the coded knock she jumped in the air and squeaked for joy carrying a stick with the algarvian greenredandwhite shield enameled on near the touchhole ealstan strode into the flat his tunic was filthy so was he he wore an armband also grimy now that said free forthwegas close as the irregulars came to having real uniforms home for a little while he said around a yawn then i have to go back despite the dismay stabbing through her at that and despite his not having bathed for days vanai threw her arms around him and kissed him then she said theres hot water on the stove i can pour some in a basin if you want to clean up while i get you something to eat aye ealstan said and yawned again he pulled off his tunic his shoes and socks and his drawers and stood there in the kitchen careless of his nakedness vanai just smiled and hurried to get the hot water a few years before she would have been shocked what her grandfather would have said i dont care what my grandfather would have said she thought firmly this is my husband she gave him bread and oil and cheese and olives and onions all sorts of food that would keep she wished they had a rest crate for meat and other perishables they could have afforded one but theyd never got around to buying it now they had to do without ealstan sat down still naked he wolfed down everything in sight and looked around for more when did you eat last vanai demanded yesterday he said vaguely aye yesterday i think its been busy out there he shook his head a few drops of water sprayed out from his hair and his beard were doing what we have to doso far anyway hows the baby shes fine vanai said which drew a grin from ealstan she got up and filled his mug with wine once more a moment later it was empty again vanai went on she really is starting to smile thats good thats very good ealstan said heres hoping were able to give her something to smile about as if to underscore his words more eggs burst he grimaced powers below eat the algarvians they dont care if they knock eoforwic flat as long as they get rid of us will the unkerlanters help us vanai asked who knows what the unkerlanters will do ealstan said who cares what theyll do this is our kingdom curse it it doesnt belong to swemmel any more than it belongs to mezentio which is all very well vanai said but will swemmel pay any attention if you tell him that i doubt it ealstan spoke with a bitter cynicism vanai had heard from other forthwegians talking about their kingdoms unhappy history when have our neighbors ever paid any attention to us vanai got up walked around the table stood beside ealstan and set her hands on his bare shoulders ill pay attention to you if you wouldnt sooner fall asleep he laughed as he looked up at her but hesitated even so will you be all right if we do i think so she answered it should be long enoughand ive missed you too you know she kissed him that might have been a cue in a farce saxburh started to cry instead of getting angry ealstan laughed again vanai hurried off to tend the baby saxburh turned out to be both wet and hungry she also turned out to be wide awake and full of smiles maybe i will just fall asleep ealstan said after a while whatever you like vanai knew she would be up a couple of times in the night saxburh hadnt quite got the idea of sleeping through it yet in a way having the baby in the flat was an advantage it left her so tired the din of fighting outside seldom disturbed her rest after a couple of hours saxburh went back to sleep again vanai set her in the cradle ealstan to her surprise was still awake i must be important to you she said as she got undressed you think youre joking he said no vanai shook her head i dont i know what being tired means too ealstan soon proved he wasnt too tired vanai straddled him carefully lowering herself onto him it hurt she wasnt surprised that it did not after a baby had gone through there it hurt almost as much as her first time had she did her best not to let ealstan see that she took no pleasure from it no that wasnt true she took no sensual pleasure but she did enjoy pleasing ealstan he moved slowly and carefully doing his best not to hurt her even when he groaned and clutched her backside and spent himself she leaned down and kissed him go to sleep now sweetheart nothings going to happen till the morning saxburh would inevitably wake up between now and then but ealstan couldnt do anything about that when the baby did wake up ealstan didnt even hear her cries he kept on breathing deeply not quite snoring in the bed beside vanai his breathing didnt change when she slid out of bed she shook her head in bemusement back in the days when hed gone to work and shed had to stay in the flat for fear of being seized as a kaunian hed often risen without waking her now the shoe was on the other foot occasional flashes of light came through the shutters as vanai changed saxburhs wet linen and put the baby to her breast bursts of sorcerous energy along with the fires those bursts could start those flashes meant men shrieking and buildings crashing to ruin but they looked and sounded like nothing so much as a thunderstorm without the drumming rain saxburh nursed she burped she went back to sleep without much fuss vanai laid her in the cradle then lay down beside ealstan all sorts of questions filled her mind would this uprising do forthweg any good if it did would ealstan come through safe the second mattered more to her than the first if anything happened to ealstan she didnt care what happened to forthweg and then she fell asleep herself no matter how worried about ealstan she was she couldnt hold her eyes open another moment when she woke it was beginning to get light outside she found herself alone in bed she hurried out to the kitchen ealstan had left a note behind hope i see you again soon hed written in classical kaunian whatever happens i shall love you as long as i live she stared at that tears filled her eyes saxburh chose that moment to wake up with a yowl vanai scooped her out of the cradle and sat down to give her her breakfast as the baby began to nurse they were both crying ealstan wondered whether hed been wise to go home during the lull in the fighting he loved vanai and wanted to see her as much as he could his new little daughter entranced him but seeing them while it reminded him of why he was fighting also reminded him of how much he had to lose he didnt need that reminder not if he was going to lay his life on the line against the redheads leofsig did it he thought that brought his fury up to the proper pitch if it hadnt been for the algarvians his cousin sidroc never would have quarreled either with him or with his brother ealstan hoped sidroc was dead these days if he wasnt he was still fighting in plegmunds brigade on the algarvian side recruiting broadsheets for plegmunds brigade remained on some walls though the forthwegian rebels who held most of eoforwic had whitewashed the greater number of them ealstan picked his way through rubble up to the barricade of brickwork and boulders and benches behind which the rebels sheltered a fellow named beortwulf whod been a sergeant in the forthwegian army and served as a captain here nodded to him pretty quiet right now the redheads have been busy further west he pointed across the twegen before continuing to them were an afterthought theyre really sweating about swemmels men afterthought eh ealstan bared his teeth in a fierce grin lets seem em try moving men through eoforwic and call us an afterthought something to that beortwulf agreed far as im concerned the powers below can eat algarve and unkerlant both aye ealstan nodded itd make things a lot easier for forthweg thats certain before beortwulf could answer a runner called ealstans name when he admitted to being in the neighborhood the fellow said come on with me the big boss wants to have a chat with you oh he does does he ealstan said suppose i dont feel like talking to him but he followed the man deeper into eoforwic to find out what pybba had in mind whatever it was the algarvians wouldnt like it pybba still worked out of the pottery and ran the rebellion from there as hed run the underground before seizing the chance to strike at mezentios men the algarvians still hadnt figured out who their chief tormentor was had they done so eggs would surely have smashed pybbas establishment to potsherds what now ealstan asked when he came into pybbas sanctum do you want me to cast accounts for you id ask you to if i didnt have something better for you to do the pottery magnate replied with a laugh he turned to the two forthwegians already in the room with him and said heres the clever lad who figured out how to make us look like algarvians when we need to both the other forthwegians were in their midto late thirties old men ealstan thought uncharitably then he took a second look at them and realized either one could tear him to pieces without breaking a sweat he prudently kept his unkind thought to himself pybbas pals were looking him over too one of them said i suppose hell have to come along then he looks like he might be able to cut it hes already got himself an algarvian stick the other noted approval in his voice ealstan refused to let himself be baited he also refused to show undue curiosity no matter what he felt he just nodded to pybba and said tell me what you need me to do pybba nodded too so did the other two unnamed forthwegians the one whod spoken first said kid sounds like hes got his head on straight he may do hes got gall pybba said high praise from him he turned back to ealstan the redheads are still hanging on to the royal palace and the leyline caravan depot and one leyline route through eoforwic that lets em ship some men west and it lets em give us a hard time if their military governor all of a sudden came down with a slight case of loss of life ah ealstan nodded again doing his best to stay dispassionate youll have the right kind of algarvian uniforms to let us get away with a masquerade kids no dummy sure enough one of theassassinssaid to his comrade the fellow suddenly switched to unaccented algarvian you understand me kid can you talk like this too i understand ealstan answered in the same language if i talk much i give us away i do not talk well could be worse the other forthwegian said all right youll be junior to us well do the talking at least youll know whats going on how long does your fancy spell hold six or eight hours ealstan said that seemed to please both of the men in the office with pybba and him and the pottery magnate as well plenty of time pybba said you can get into your new clothes just before sunup and sneak into algarvian territory do what you want to do and then lie up somewhere till you can get back to our lines why lie up ealstan asked why not hustle back to our lines ha you dont think of everything after all one of the rough men said we hustle back looking like redheads our fornicating palsll fornicating blaze us before we can tell em who we are dont worry about that ealstan said i can turn us back as easy as i can make us look like algarvians everyone else beamed maybe he hadnt mentioned that part of the sorcery to pybba before before sunrise the next morning ealstan put on an algarvian sergeants uniform while his comradeshe still didnt know their namesdonned the clothes of a captain and a major ealstan had to fiddle with his cantrip a little to shift it from first person to third so it would work on the other two men he cast it twice in quick succession and the other two men took on the appearance of the enemy then he used the original version on himself a grunt from one of the others told him it had worked he couldnt sense it on himself any more than vanai could tell that she looked like a forthwegian after casting her own disguising spell good thing we saw you do that a forthwegian fighter said or wed kill you on the spot one of his pals nodded ealstan was content to follow the older mens lead as they sneaked out of the forthwegian positions and toward the corridor through eoforwic the algarvians still held as soon as they were on a street where redheads might see them the two forthwegians in officers clothing became algarvians themselves with what seemed a deeper magic than the one with which ealstan had disguised them it wasnt just that they spoke the language they imitated the strut and swagger that distinguished mezentios men imitated those things so well that it did not seem an imitation but rather something real ealstan had to work hard to imitate them his own swagger seemed painfully artificial to him but none of the real algarvians pointed his way and shouted impostor after a bit he noticed that a lot of underofficers and troopersnot all of them but a good manywere less flamboyant than their officers once hed seen that he stopped worrying so much about having to overact what amazed him as he pressed on toward the royal palace was how ordinary the algarvians acted among themselves hed seen them up to now only as occupiers harassing his fellow forthwegians and doing worse than harassing the kaunians of forthweg now though even more than when hed sneaked into the kaunian quarter looking for vanai he might have been an algarvian among algarvians which gave him a whole different perspective among themselves they were just people going on about their business and laughing and joking as he might have done with his friends no one is ever the villain in his own story ealstan reminded himself it was a far cry from what he usually thought of the algarvians and far from the most comfortable notion hed ever had if he hurried after the other two he didnt have to think redheaded guards in short tunics and kilts ringed the palace from which king penda had once ruled forthweg the palace had suffered worse indignities than algarvian guards too the forthwegians had made a stand there when unkerlant stabbed ealstans kingdom in the back and the unkerlanters in their turn had tried and failed to keep the algarvians from capturing it many of the towers famous throughout the kingdom had fallen in one fight or another but the algarvian banner still flew from a tall flagstaff in front of the palace and an algarvian military governor still ruled forthweg for king mezentio from inside it one after another the guards stiffened to attention as ealstans comrades and he went past them no one barked a challenge if they looked like algarvians they were assumed to be algarvians ealstan had to fight down the urge to snicker that might have given the game away we have a situation report for the governor from the west said the forthwegian who looked like an algarvian major he kept saying that again and again it was plenty to get him and his companion who was dressed like a captain and ealstan with them whisked through the palace and toward the governor their target the speed with which it got them whisked through the palace again told ealstan what the redheads truly reckoned important the forthwegian uprising in eoforwic was a nuisance to algarve the endless grinding war against unkerlant really mattered ealstan had expected to see some of the magnificent trappings of the forthwegian monarchy on display in the palace he didnt before long he realized hed been naive what the unkerlanters hadnt stolen the algarvians surely had he was halfway through the throne room in fact before he recognized it for what it was the throne remained but only as a chair all the gold leaf had been stripped off he hadnt even time to feel outrage before it could start to grow he was pressing on toward the governors office which had been the kings although the governora fat man with a dukes silver dragon perched on the left breast of his uniform tunicwas talking with some other lesser official he sent the man away at once declaring the front comes first ealstan understood him very clearly when the other redhead went out ealstan shut the door behind him the governor went on what is the latest gentlemen will we be able to keep swemmels men from crossing the twegen and aiding these stinking forthwegians the two men dressed as officers led him toward a map he paid no attention whatever to ealstan why should a governor notice a sergeant ealstan unslung his stick he had all the time in the world to blaze the algarvian duke in the back of the head the man crumpled without a sound good work the forthwegian dressed as a major said lets get out of here out they went locking the door behind them his grace is preparing a response for us the counterfeit major told the fellow whod been conferring with the governor hell need a little while the genuine redhead nodded ealstan and his comrades were out of the palace and in the back room of an abandoned house two blocks away when the hue and cry began by then hed already turned the other two men who looked like algarvians back into forthwegians and theyd pulled ordinary forthwegian tunics from their packs and put them on he gave himself his proper appearance too leaving their sticks behind was a nuisance but couldnt be helped they went out onto the street once more without the slightest trace of fear ealstan felt like cutting capers mezentios men were looking for three of their own kind they paid no attention to lowly unarmed forthwegians just as the governor had paid no attention to a lowly sergeant ealstan grinned and clapped his hands together once liking the comparison very much for once even marquis balastros bravado failed him when hajjaj called on him at the algarvian ministry in bishah the zuwayzi foreign minister took that as a bad sign doing his best to conceal his worry he said you are gracious for agreeing to see me on such short notice your excellency you are gracious for wanting to see me at all your excellency balastro returned i am glad you do not find algarve a sinking ship to be abandoned as soon as possible as a matter of fact hajjaj did reckon algarve a sinking ship abandoning it was another matter abandoning algarve meant casting zuwayza on king swemmels mercy and swemmel hardly knew the meaning of the word i am sorry to find our officers were right about the building unkerlanter offensive in the north hajjaj said and even sorrier you have not had better fortune repelling it so am i balastro said bleakly do you think you will be able to hold on the line of the twegen hajjaj asked for a while the algarvian minister replied perhaps for a long while hajjaj wondered if that was bravado returning but balastro went on after all swemmel lets us do him a favor if he stops there a favor hajjaj scratched his head having to wear clothes on a blisteringly hot day like this he felt like scratching everywhere at once but refrained im sorry your excellency but i dont follow that we did the forthwegians a favor we got rid of their kaunians for them and precious few of them miss the blonds even a little bit balastro said now were getting rid of a whole great whacking lot of forthwegians who enjoy rising up and causing trouble if we kill them they cant very well rise up and cause trouble for the unkerlanters now can they oh hajjaj said i see what you mean do you really think king swemmel is that devious when it comes to getting rid of people who might cause him trouble one fine day nobodys better than swemmel marquis balastro spoke with great conviction and he was probably right too turning the subject away from forthweg and toward something more immediately important to him hajjaj said you will understand that king shazli has a certain amount of concern because the front has shifted so far to the east that was a diplomatic way to say king shazli is scared green because there arent any algarvian soldiers anywhere close enough to help us hold back the unkerlanters and we cant do it by ourselves we already tried and we lost to hajjajs relief the algarvian minister understood it as such balastro said we will send you more dragons your excellency we will send you as many behemoths as we can spare we will send as many soldiers and mages as we can spare too thank you for your generosity hajjaj said you might have done better to send us all these things earlier you know maybe balastro sounded bland but king mezentio has not forgotten you and that is something you must always remember hajjaj nodded now he understood the more worried algarve was that zuwayza might drop out of the war the more the redheads would do to keep her in it the more enemies unkerlant had to fight the better off algarve was in a way that was reassuring in another way as the zuwayzi foreign minister had said it was liable to be too little too late hajjaj rose and bowed i shall take your reassurances back to the palace his majesty will be glad to have them when he got back to the palace though he went to general ikhshid before calling on the king ikhshids fleshy face was unhappy so theyll send us more dragons and behemoths will they he said one white eyebrow rising theyd better do it fast if theyre going to do it he didnt sound convinced he didnt sound cheerful either fast hajjaj raised an eyebrow too do you know something i dont maybe ikhshid answered but its nothing thatd surprise you very much id bet the unkerlanters are starting to bring more and more soldiers up against our lines in the south that didnt surprise hajjaj it did alarm him can we beat them back he asked anxiously well do the best we can with what weve got and whatever the algarvians give us general ikhshid said you hit anything hard enough though and itll break if the unkerlanters put enough men in the fight were in trouble we saw that four and a half years ago do you think they can hajjaj asked depends on how theyre doing against algarve and gyongyos ikhshids jowls wobbled as he frowned odds are better now that they can than they were six weeks ago theyve gone a long way east and the redheads dont seem able to stop them anywhere hajjaj explained balastros theory of why the unkerlanters had paused on the twegen it made ikhshid no more cheerful he said i wish that made less sense than it does my thought exactly hajjaj said have you told the king what you just told me general ikhshid shook his head not yet i have to see him now hajjaj said ill give him the broad outline if thats all right with you and you can fill in the details later fine fine now ikhshid nodded hell likely take it better from you than he would from me hajjaj thought the general overestimated his powers of persuasion but headed off to see shazli nonetheless the king served him tea and wine and cakes and didnt take the royal privilege of cutting short the small talk that accompanied the refreshments having played many such games himself hajjaj judged that shazli knew the news would be bad and didnt much want to hear it at last though with a sigh king shazli said im comfortably certain this is no mere social call your excellency although i am always glad of your company no one ever pays a king a mere social call save perhaps another king hajjaj said and quickly summarized what hed learned from balastro and ikhshid king shazli sighed when he finished we knew this day was coming when the unkerlanters began driving the algarvians back this summer before hajjaj could speak shazli held up a palepalmed hand we knew this day might come when the algarvians failed before cottbus and we knew it probably would come when they failed in sulingen now we have to deal with it as best we can hajjaj gave the king a seated bow just so your majesty as long as you keep that view of the world zuwayza is in good hands provided the unkerlanters dont end up parading through bishah shazli said well if worse comes to worst your excellency i rely on you to keep that dark day from dawning ill do my best hajjaj promised though he thought the king relied on him for altogether too much after his busy and gloomy morning after a nap in the heat of noontime hajjaj left bishah and went up into the hills to pass the rest of the day at home i didnt expect you back so soon young fellow tewflk said when hajjaj alighted from his carriage life is full of surprises hajjaj said doing his best to forget how many of them were unpleasant would you be so kind as to have a servanthe would never have offended the majordomo by saying another servantbring some date wine to the library for me of course your excellency tewfik replied hajjaj would have been astonished had he said anything else once inside the library hajjaj pulled out a book of poetry by a kaunian named mikulicius whod lived in what the historians called late imperial times mikulicius had watched things fall apart all around him and written about what hed seen with his kingdoms algarvian allies in headlong retreat with the unkerlanters massing against zuwayza the bitter verses seemed perfectly timely even if they were more than a thousand years old the door opened the servant with the wine hajjaj thought without glancing up from the book he said just set the tray down if you please aye your excellency that answer did make him look up in surprise it came in throatily accented algarvian not the zuwayzi hed expected there with the tray and the wine jug and the cup stood tassi she wore no more than she had when shed first knocked on the door to hajjajs home he looked her up and down he could hardly help doing that he switched to algarviansharp algarvianhimself to ask who sent you here minister iskakis very estranged wife hadnt learned much zuwayzi yet why master tewfik did she answered her eyes perhaps too convincingly innocent he said you needed some wine did he hajjaj said tassi dipped her head as yaninans often did instead of nodding and did he say i needed anything else no now she tossed her head a gesture that gave birth to enchanting motions of other parts of her body curse it she does look naked to me not nude hajjaj had to think in algarvian to have that make any sense to him his own tongue lacked the distinction between the words tassi went on he did say you seemed unhappy did he say why hajjaj asked tassi tossed her head again why does not matter she replied which went dead against a lifetime of experience for hajjaj she took a deep breath hajjaj admired that too she said i have been unhappy too i know what it is like i know it is bad i understand do you he wondered does being unhappy because your husband likes boys more than he likes you let you understand a man who is unhappy because he sees his kingdom in mortal danger analytical as always hajjaj found the idea unlikely but couldnt quite dismiss it out of hand tassi had not an analytical bone in her body she got down on the carpet beside hajjaj what are you doing he demanded though he knew and knew he could do what she obviously had in mind making you happy for a little while she answered your senior wife said i should just do this and not pay any attention to your grumblings kolthoum said that did she hajjaj asked tassi dipped her head again her hairshed perfumed itbrushed over his chest and belly and tewfik sent you he said she didnt bother responding to that shed already answered it once hajjaj took off his reading glasses and wagged a finger at her i sense a plot tassi didnt respond to that eithernot with words at least but she didnt need words to be very distracting hajjaj supposed he could have picked her up bodily and thrown her out of the library but that would have been undignified and a man would suffer almost anything before losing his dignity not he thought as his arms went round her that im suffering too much fourteen every news sheet every rumor that came to the farm in southern valmiera brought merkela ferocious joy theyre losing she gloated theyre running theyd running like whipped bleeding dogs with their tails between their legs then suddenly her grim delight faded gedominu she exclaimed what did you just put in your mouth the baby had started crawling not long before that meant she and skarnu had to keep a closer eye on him than ever she reached down grabbed him and stuck a finger in his mouth she got something out of there then wiped her hand on her trousers what was it this time skarnu asked with clinical curiosity just a dust bunny powers above be praised merkela answered she glared at gedominu with mock fury at least you didnt swallow that dead cockroach a couple of days ago gedominu laughed he thought it was funnythough hed squealed in outrage when his mother took the bug away from him merkela set him down once more he started to crawl backwards but then decided to go ahead instead adventures with gedominu notwithstanding skarnu hadnt forgotten what merkela was saying every news sheet every rumor that came to the farm brought him nothing but frustration aye theyre losing he said aye theyre running theyre running in the west theyre running in jelgava but what are they doing here not bloody much powers below eat them thats not true merkela said and in fact it wasnt true or it wasnt strictly true the algarvians occupying valmiera had sent a lot of men west to fight the unkerlanters and a few north to fight the lagoans and kuusamans in jelgava their grip on the countryside had loosened skarnu worried much less than he had before about an algarvian patrol swooping down on the farm here but the redheads still held the southern coast strongly against invasion from across the strait of valmiera they still held the kingdoms towns with no small aid from the valmieran constabulary and from the many traitors theyd recruited to do their dirty work for them true the underground could strike more readily than it had still its strikes remained pinpricks and everywhere else or so it seemed mezentios men were taking hammer blows i want to smash the algarvians skarnu said i want to smash them till they cant get up again our army fell to pieces i was there i watched it happen we never knew what hit us we need revenge for that now if were ever going to be able to hold our heads up once this war finally ends ends merkela stared at him as if shed never heard the word before she pursed her lips do you know i never thought about the war ending never once either the algarvians would have us down or wed have them down having them down is what i look forward to gedominu she grabbed their son this time she got whatever was in his hand before he could stick it in his mouth i look forward to having them down too skarnu said but i also look forward to knocking them down it wont be the same if a pack of foreigners does it all for us i dont care how it happens merkela said i just want it to happen i want to have something to do with it skarnu said stubbornly i want to march into priekule at the head of an army and go back to my mansion and clean out my sister and every sign the algarvians were ever there i want to do that myself with my countrymen i dont want a bunch of foreigners telling me all right little boy its safe to go home now priekule mansion merkela spoke the words as if they were foreign to her and so they were even if they were in valmieran skarnu had discovered that the capital and what went on there didnt seem real to a lot of valmierans from the countryside as for the other merkela murmured most of the time i forget what blood you bear before the war being a marquis had mattered more to him than almost anything else now he said our son bears my blood and he bears yours too and when the war is over i intend to wed you and set you up in that mansion unless you decide youd sooner dwell somewhere else in that case wherever it is ill live there with you she shook her head its like something out of a fairy tale nobles dont come to farms and want to marry peasant girls not in real life they dont no they dont get that lucky skarnu said which brought a smile to her face he went on having the algarvians swallow up the whole kingdom isnt something out of a fairy tale either its out of a nightmare merkela nodded before she could say anything someone knocked on the door at a good many times over the past couple of years that would have brought panic to skarnu no more merkela walked to the door and opened it raunu she exclaimed real pleasure in her voice come in let me pour you a mug of ale dont mind if i do skarnus veteran sergeant said dont mind if you do either he looked down at gedominu who had drool on his chinhe was cutting a tooth hes just about big enough to march seems that way skarnu agreed merkela came back with not one but three mugs of ale on a wooden tray and a pitcher from which to refill them too skarnu eyed raunu but you didnt come here to tell me what a big boy ive got not unless i miss my guess no raunu took a pull at his ale then nodded to merkela now this is your own brewingi can taste it aye she looked pleased but not for long skarnus right you wouldnt be here if you didnt need him to do something a while ago you would have needed us both to do something thats not so simple anymore her glance toward gedominu was fond but also wistful she missed the days when she could easily go forth against the redheads too well im always glad to come here raunu said but youre rightits got to do with business he nodded to skarnu weve had some practice wrecking the redheads leyline caravans you and meand you to milady he added as if merkela were already a marchioness but youve got other things on your mind for a spell she nodded her eye kept going back to gedominu where skarnu asked what needs doing up in the north raunu answered theyll be moving a good many caravans before long using the ley lines through that rugged country to get soldiers to jelgava by the shortest way itd be nice if some of em didnt get there it would be nice if a lot of them didnt get there skarnu said and both raunu and merkela muttered agreement he added fitting if we give them a hard time up in the north too that puzzled his lover and the sergeant he didnt try to explain but still thought he was right four years earlier mezentios men had moved footsoldiers and more important still masses of behemoths through country valmiera had thought too rough for such maneuvers the valmierans full occupied with another algarvian attack down in the south hadnt noticed the stroke till it had already slipped between their ribs and into their heart revenge even a small measure of revenge would be sweet youll come then raunu asked he meant it seriously the underground wasnt like the army even if most of its members had been soldiers of course i will skarnu answered as hed gone down to the southern seacoast so he rode the leyline caravan from the little town of ramygala up to the wooded hills and gullies of northern valmiera he felt like a stranger there half a foreigner wary of opening his mouth the local dialect was a long way from the brand of valmieran he spoke dont worry about it raunu told him when he worried out loud the cursed algarvians cant tell the difference between how they talk here and the right way no the algarvians cant skarnu agreed but there are bound to be traitors here there are traitors everywhere if hed seen one thing in occupied valmiera that was it some of them have had accidents was all raunu said to that the rest of the whoresons theyre thoughtful you might say skarnu hoped he was right right or wrong they both had work to do the locals had got them papers showing they were foresters and other paperswhich they were not to displaythat gave them enough jargon to pass as the real article unless questioned by someone who really knew what he was talking about with luck that wouldnt happen the papers gave them the excuse they needed for going out into the woods as skarnu tramped those hills and valleys as he eyed the narrow winding roadsin the stretches of the landscape where there were any roads at allhe grew to admire more and more what the algarvians had accomplished by making a thrust through such terrain no matter how much you hate them you cant ignore them he told raunu no theyre too dangerous for thatlike any other snakes raunu said skarnu laughed and nodded though the veteran underofficer hadnt been joking in all that contorted country the only straight lines were the ley lines the worlds energy grid ran where it would once mages learned to exploit the ley lines men had to hack down trees if caravans were to glide where they needed to go and so many long narrow stretches of cleared ground marked the ley lines paths through the woods algarvian patrols marched along the ley lines too the redheads were no fools they knew the underground would try to disrupt their movements but knowing and being able to do anything about it were liable to prove two different things here as elsewhere in valmiera as elsewhere throughout the east of derlavai mezentios men were stretched too thin to do everything that wanted doing they couldnt patrol all the ley lines all the time or even most of them most of the time i think this seems a likely spot skarnu said at last the leyline caravan will be just coming over that risehe pointedand wont have the time to stop even if the conductor should notice anything wrong about the line what say you raunu considered briefly aye it suits me good enough then see how simple it is skarnu suspectedindeed he was sureraunu could have found the spot as readily as he had but he was here he took a crystal from his trouser pocket activated it and spoke briefly using code phrases to give the bearings of the stretch of ley line theyd chosen while not calling it that then he and raunu left in a hurry he didnt know the redheads had overheard him but had to act as if they were tracking every emanation around pity we cant be here when they do the job raunu remarked aye skarnu nodded somewhere not far away a team of his countrymen had assuredly heard what hed said he didnt know where what he didnt know mezentios men couldnt pry from him but knowing we helped knowing we told them where to bury the eggthat counts for something too reminds us were still in the war like raunu said thats it skarnu agreed thats just it in fact when you knocked on my door i was complaining to merkela that the algarvians were going to the powers below everywhere but in valmiera its still true more or less but weve helped make it not quite so true sooner or later the redheadsll get whats coming to era raunu said i dont just want them to get it skarnu said i want to be the one who gives it to them and now i amat least a little back when the unkerlanter attack on algarve in the north was new major scoufas had called it a catastrophe and colonel sabrino had told the yaninan dragonflier he didnt think it was quite so bad as that since then king swemmel s men had pushed the algarvians out of the north of unkerlant theyd pushed them out of western forthweg and had fought their way to the line of the twegen river the river that ran by eoforwic if that wasnt a catastrophe sabrino didnt know what would be but catastrophe or no the wing of dragonfliers he commanded remained here in the south he had even gone so far as to send a written petition to king mezentio begging his sovereign to send him into the urgent fighting mezentio hadnt told him no mezentio hadnt deigned to reply at all more than anything else that told him in how bad an odor with the king he really was major scoufas had stopped twitting him about it yaninans were politer or at least more formal people than his own countrymen the officers in his wing hadnt stopped grumbling about their fate at last sabrino took aside captain orosio whod been with him longer than anyone he said if you want to transfer i wont stand in your way i dont blame you for wanting to go where the action is i want to go up north myself but nobody will listen to me nobody will listen to you either as long as you serve under me but if you dont i have the feeling youll get what you want to his surprise orosio shook his head no thank you sir he said i dont know anyone who wants to leave the wing sir thatd just be another slap at you we want the wing to get what it deserves and we want to give the unkerlanters what they deserve touched sabrino set his hand on orosios shoulder one thing algarvians are by the powers above is loyal to their friends the squadron commander nodded well of course sir he said though in the world at large it was anything but of course and the king bloody well ought to be loyal to you too you gave him the best advice you knew how and not only that you were right too and much good it did me sabrino said i told that to scoufas you can get in every bit as much trouble with a king for being right as you can for being wrong maybe even more trouble scoufas orosio looked around before continuing the two of them stood off to one side of the dragon farm from the beginning this hadnt been the sort of conversation for which they wanted eavesdroppers satisfied no yaninans were in earshot orosio went on i wish we were by ourselves and not tied to tsavellas people its like being married to a dead woman i know sabrino answered but i dont know what to do about it if we were here by ourselves wed be here by ourselves if you know what i mean no algarvian footsoldiers for miles around out here in the west were stretched too thin weve got to use whatever allies we can scrape up yaninans captain orosio rolled his eyes forthwegians powers above do i hear right is there really a kaunian regiment somewhere down here ive heard that too sabrino answered kaunians from valmiera i think those people are crazy orosio declared since sabrino thought he was right he didnt argue in fact he waved orosio to silence a yaninan was trotting toward them in accented algarvian the fellow called colonel sabrino to tent of crystallomancers im coming sabrino hurried after the fellow he wondered what had gone wrong now he also had to do his best not to laugh at the way the pompoms on the yaninans shoes bounced up and down algarvians always had a hard time taking their yaninan neighbors seriously all but a couple of the crystallomancers inside the tent were yaninans for some reason or other sabrino had trouble getting algarvian replacements he had to admit the little swarthy men did know their business their specialistswhich also included dragonflierswere pretty good their army as a whole he sat down at the crystal to which a yaninan waved him sabrino here an algarvian face looked back at him hello colonel i am major ardalico i want to let you know that i am establishing a special camp a couple of miles to the rear of your position a special camp sabrino repeated tonelessly thats right ardalicos voice was bland even the algarvians who slaughtered kaunians from forthweg for the sake of their life energy werent comfortable about saying that straight out special camp was their favorite euphemism why are you setting up a special camp back there sabrino asked major ardalico s image in the crystal gave him a large hearty false smile because ive been ordered to sir thank you so much sabrino said and the majors smile got larger and falser now be so good as to tell me why you were ordered to put that camp there sir i wouldnt care to speculate about that ardalico was smooth he was so smooth he was downright greasy colonel sabrino hated him on sight powers below eat you you miserable little turd sabrino ground out youre going to tell me the truth or ill get my dragons in the air and knock that camp down around your ears and if you dont think ill do it you can bloody well think again hed succeeded in knocking the smug selfsatisfied smirk off ardalicos handsome face you wouldnt dare blurted the officer in charge of the special camp sonny boy you just go ahead and try me sabrino said im already under a cloud in trapani what can king mezentio do to me send me to the west to fight the unkerlanters ive been here since you were in diapers now are you going to talk to me or do i pay you a visit on dragonback he wasnt bluffing some few of his own men might balk but the yaninans would surely follow him for one thing it would infuriate algarve for another the idea of sacrificing kaunians appalled them they werent really hard enough to fight in a war like this but what choice did they have when they found themselves sandwiched between mezentio and swemmel major ardalico licked his lips he wasnt stupid except in the particular way that had let him become an officer heading up a special camp in the first place he had to realize sabrino meant what he said but he tried one last delaying tactic what was it you wanted to know why are you running up that bloody murder manufactory of yours sabrino demanded ardalico winced thinking of it as a special camp probably helped him sleep at night sabrino didnt care he had his own worries most of themthe ones that werent centered in trapanilay due west of him he went on are you putting it up because it looks like the unkerlanters are going to mount an attack in these parts and we need some way to stop them i shouldnt be speaking of this by crystal ardalico said unhappily sabrino drummed his fingers on the tabletop the motion drew ardalicos eyes sabrino could see as much from his image more unhappily still the young major said aye there is some fear of that although sabrino heard the words he didnt want to believe them how he whispered with everything theyre doing up in the north where can they find the men and the beasts to strike another blow against us down here too its a big kingdom unkerlant is ardalico answered which meant he didnt know how swemmels men were doing what they were doing either the algarvians hadnt believed unkerlant would be able to fight back so strongly when they first launched their attack against swemmels kingdom here more than three years later sabrinos countrymen still had trouble believing it which doubtless went a long way towards explaining why the tide of war flowed against them if they do attack can we stop them sabrino asked the one question besides which none of the others mattered major ardalico said having a special camp in the neighborhood will give us a better chance sabrinos laugh held knives of bitterness oh aye all the kaunians weve killed so far have done just what we wanted thats why we marched into cottbus week before last isnt it he had the satisfaction of watching ardalicos image wince instead of shouting he went on in a small quiet deadly voice you stupid clot dont you see the unkerlanters will kill as many of their own as they need to to block whatever you do if the camp werent here colonel the unkerlanters would still kill their own ardalico replied and then where would you be that held enough truth to make sabrino wince in turn even so he said if we hadnt started it major they wouldnt have every interrogation record hed seen confirmed that the unkerlanters hadnt imagined using largescale murder for the sake of life energy as a weapon of war not till the algarvians showed them the way but they hadnt stepped back from learning either which may be true and which may not sir but which has nothing to do with what will happennot with what may happen mind you but with what will happenif king swemmels buggers do hit this section of our line ardalico said i suppose thats true sabrino admitted as you know were rather short of footsoldiers hereabouts shall i try to see if i can bring in a few companies from the phalanx of valmiera to protect your special camp for a moment he thought ardalico would nod but the younger officer only gave him the look any junior officer gives his senior when the latter has just told a joke that is anything but funny good day sir ardalico said and broke the etheric connection light flared in the crystal before which sabrino sat when it faded the crystal was for all practical purposes inert once more with a grunt sabrino got to his feet and left the crystallomancers tent he strode over to the nearby tent in which major scoufas made his headquarters the yaninan looked up from the papers on his folding table good day sir he said i hope you will forgive me for saying so but you do not look like a happy man im not like any algarvian sabrino had spent a fair amount of time sneering at yaninans but he wouldnt have traded major scoufas for a company of ardalicos will this help scoufas produced a jar of the local spirits and a couple of mugs not much for flavor but it numbs the brain i could use some numbing thanks but sabrino went on before hed had anything to drink theyre putting in a special camp in this sector you know about special camps i know of them aye the yaninan dragonfliers dark eyes were particularly unfathomable a filthy business he waited to see how sabrino would respond when sabrino nodded scoufas continued and not a good sign if one is coming into being here sabrino nodded again the two officers proceeded to get very drunk ilmarinen came up to fernao in the hallway and poked him in the chest with a bony forefinger when the elderly theoretical sorcerer didnt say anything and did keep poking fernao poked back for a moment they might have been fencing with fingers since fernao was much younger and had a longer reach he got the better of the duel ilmarinen said you deserve it you cursed lagoan what have i done now fernao was only too sure ilmarinen would come up with something scandalous and the kuusaman mage did you turned out to be right you miserable unprincipled son of a whore oh that wasnt an admission fernao heard from ilmarinen every day right about what about expanding that one series ilmarinen answered you really cant do it the way i tried im not saying my notion is impossible mind you but my spell wouldnt have worked if you want my thanks for stopping me you can have em fernao shrugged im glad the energy release didnt happen that spell would have released a lot of energy he hadnt tried to calculate how much now in an offhand way he did you know if we wanted to we could try to turn it into a weapon too aye i suppose we could ilmarinen shrugged id sooner try to turn it into a spell that does what i want it to do he was incorrigible he reveled in being incorrigible now he waited for fernao to pitch a fit the best way to frustrate him was not to do what he wanted with a shrug of his own fernao said with everything else going on you probably wont have time to work on it if you arent busy here something is badly wrong ilmarinen grunted you only think youre joking fernao shook his head he didnt think he was joking at all catching him with his defenses down ilmarinen poked him again as he yelped the kuusaman mage added one of these days i may even forgive you for being right fernao asked for being right ilmarinen agreed with a last pokehe had a sharp fingernail toohe went past fernao and down the hall if you want to thank somebody thank linna fernao called after him she was the one who let pekka and me know where youd gone ive already thanked her ilmarinen said over his shoulder believe me it was much more fun than thanking you ever could be he turned a corner and disappeared fernao stared after him then shook his head and started to laugh trying to get the last word against ilmarinen was a losing battle laughing still fernao went back to his own chamber and looked without much warmth on the report he was drafting for grandmaster pinhiero the first lagoan mages had finally come to the research station in the barren naantali district they werent doing so well as either fernao or pinhiero had hoped language problems were part of the reason they were less fluent in kuusaman than they needed to be and even more than kuusaman mages they had trouble accepting that one law lay under the two with which theyd long been familiar fernao cast about for a way to say that without making his countrymen sound like imbeciles morons perhaps but not imbeciles he thought hed just inked his pen when someone knocked on the door he suspected it would be ilmarinen coming back for the word after the last word he put the pen down even so listening to ilmarinens impudence was bound to prove more entertaining than explaining to the head of the lagoan guild of mages why some of the sorcerers hed sent werent measuring up but when he opened the door ilmarinen wasnt standing in the hallway pekka was oh fernao said in surprise and then recalling himself come in he stepped aside thank you pekkas voice wasnt quite steady the small quaver in it alarmed fernao more than a scream from another woman might have she sat down on the stool hed been using to draft his reportsank down onto it really whats wrong he asked as he sat down on the bed something obviously was one possibility sprang to mind right away you told me you werent with child were you wrong what pekkas eyes widened to his vast relief she shook her head no its not that powers above be praised im just upset thats all why he said and then before he could stop himself why come to me pekka chose to answer the second question first because whatever else we are were friends he nodded though his lips tightened because that was true theyre not being lovers any more hurt all the worse pekka went on i just got a letter from leino hes left habakkuk so he can join in the fighting in jelgava has he fernao said now pekka nodded miserably fernao made himself say what needed saying i hope he stays safe did he mean it part of him did anyhow the larger part the part not centered on his crotch you know the spells the algarvians use pekka said theyve never used them against ships they use them on land whenever they can scrape together enough kaunians to kill im frightened for him i wish he hadnt done it he should be all right fernao want to take her in his arms to comfort her did part of her want that too was that why shed come here he wished it were but he didnt believe it he also wished he were better at fooling himself with a sigh he went on if the news sheets are right mezentios men arent putting up much of a fight in jelgava so you shouldnt have anything to worry about i dont trust the algarvians pekka said which made good hard sense they cant just go on retreating through jelgava if they do too much more retreating they lose the war that also made sense the same thought had crossed fernaos mind if it had crossed the minds of the people who wrote news sheets they did their best not to let it show their best was quite good the news sheets had a tone of giddy euphoria that sometimes made fernao want to gag leaning on his stick he heaved himself to his feet once more and limped over to set a hand on her shoulder she didnt flinch but she didnt turn toward him either he sighed again he didnt see a wish coming true hell be fine he repeated pekka rose too thank you fernao she said you are a good friend i shouldnt have troubled you with this youre rightyou shouldnt have went through his mind but again that wasnt altogether true aloud he said its all right we are friends whatever else we are as you said becoming lovers was destructive of friendships he knew that he was glad it hadntquitehappened here do you ever want to go and fight the algarvians yourself pekka asked comparing him to her husband then she went on sometimes i have all i can do just staying here and working on this sorcery it doesnt seem enough fernao lifted his cane into the air for a moment he stood on two legs one good one bad the cane was the point of the exercise pekka realized as much as her eyes followed its motion she turned red fernao said they already have as much of me as i care to give them thank you very much oh pekka said softly i was foolish im sorry he shrugged which made his bad arm and shoulder twinge but only for a moment dont worry about it he said and then almost as romantic as an algarvian if mezentios men hadnt ruined me for anything strenuous grandmaster pinhiero probably wouldnt have sent me here and then i wouldnt have been lucky enough to meet you pekka blushed once more not looking at him she said youre being difficult again fernao am i he thought about shrugging again and promptly thought better of it well maybe i am id better go she said quickly and as quickly did fernao listened to her fading footsteps in the hall if she hadnt gone quickly what would she have done thrown herself into his arms after all or found the nearest blunt instrument and hit him with it because hed chosen to be difficult again how much would you give to know the answer to that he wondered but he didnt have to keep wondering very long everything i have everything i could conjure up or borrow or steal he limped over to the desk and to the report hed been drafting for pinhiero with a grimace he pushed it away how was he supposed to pay attention to it when he had really important things on his mind if pinhiero had to wait a day or two longer for his answers the world wouldnt end especially since he wouldnt like them when he got them another knock on the door fernao jumped inside him his heart jumped too was that pekka coming back at a sort of shambling trot he hurried across the chamber and opened the door oh he said dully it wasnt pekka it was in fact one of the lagoan mages whod come to the naantali district to learn the new sorcery after so long using kuusaman and classical kaunian he had to make a conscious decision to speak his own language come in viana thank you she answered she was perhaps a year or two older than he nicely shaped but on the plain side earnest hardworking i hope im not disturbing you not at all he answered limping back to the desk to flip the papers so she couldnt read them what can i do for you sit down make yourself at home thank you viana said again i wanted to ask you some questions about what we were doing here and how we would use the sorcery in the field go ahead fernao said viana did one question after another some of them were things she already should have known but none was downright foolish mechanically he answered them all after what seemed like forever and was in fact something above an hour she said ive taken up enough of our time things are much clearer now i appreciate your patience she got to her feet so did fernao using good leg good arm and cane to return to vertical its all right he said after that session he looked forward to getting back to work on the report for grandmaster pinhiero it would have to be more interesting with a last polite nod viana left and fernao did start writing again halfway down the second leaf of paper after he did his pen abruptly stopped scritching he looked out the window and scratched his head i wonder if viana came here trying to find out something that didnt have anything to do with those spells she must have knownmustnt shethe answers to a good many of the questions shed asked was she trying to find out if i were interested in her well if she was she had her answer fernao had gone on and on about magecraft without the slightest concern for anything else he supposed he could repair that the next time they met he supposed he could but he didnt really intend to because the truth was he wasnt interested he muttered a lowvoiced curse then started to laugh life would have been so much simpler if he were summer on obuda meant long misty daysit never got very hotand mild misty nights istvan remembered that from his days on the island as a gyongyosian warrior he was he supposed still a gyongyosian warrior in some technical sense but he thought of himself as a captive of the kuusamans much more often not everyone in the large captives camp on obuda shared that view as far as captain frigyes was concerned for instance the war remained a going concern frigyes was ready to sacrifice himself and all the other captives to loose potent magecraft against the kuusamans just as hed been ready to sacrifice the men under his command back on becsehely hes daft you know kun said one morning as he and istvan squatted over stinking latrine trenches even if our sorcerous energy knocks this island out of the bothnian ocean and up onto the peaks of the ilszung mountains it wont change how the war turns out by even a coppers worth you know that istvan grunted i know that he grunted again kuusaman guards strode the palisade not far away having to take care of his needs without privacy had left him badly constipated for a while he didnt even notice any more the captain doesnt know it or else he doesnt care he tore off a handful of grass aye well no doubt youre right kun grabbed some grass too fortunately it grew very fast but i care i dont much fancy having my throat cut for nothing since istvan didnt either he just threw the grass down into the trench got to his feet and set his clothes to rights what are we going to do then he asked we cant very well go and tell the kuusaman guards that would get our throats cut too and not for nothingwhen our friends found out my dear boy kun said as if he were istvans father rather than his comrade my dear boy if we ever had to do such a thing we would also have to make sure our friends never ever found out that was so obvious istvan felt like a fool for not having seen it himself in the nastier ways of the world if not in years kun was a good deal older than he they queued up for breakfast they queued up for everything in the captives camp the kuusamans regimented them even more thoroughly than the gyongyosian army had done which was saying a good deal a few of the cooks were kuusamans more were obudansthe occupiers put the natives to work for them one of the obudans a mediumsized mediumbrown manlarger and darker than a kuusamanwore a dragons tooth on a leather thong around his neck as istvan mess tin in hand came up to him the gyongyosian pointed to the fang and said you might have bought that from me once upon a time a lot of obudan men were eager to get their hands on dragons teeth thinking they reflected well on their virility the cook fingered the heavy tooth maybe i did he replied no reason he shouldnt understand gyongyosian istvans kingdom had had a couple of spells of ruling obuda before the kuusamans finally seized the island plunging his ladle into the kettle of fishandbarley stewheavy on the barley light on the fishhe gave istvan a bigger helping than usual you lucky son of a goat said kun who hadnt got any more than the usual istvan only smiled and shrugged he knew some things about getting along with people that his sourtempered friend had never figured out once they finished eating they washed their mess tins in big tubs of water set out for the purpose istvans spoon clanked in his tray he had another spoon hidden under the mattress of his cot the handle scraped down to make a knife blade of sorts hed never mentioned that to kun or to anyone else but you never could tell when a weapon might come in handy as he carried the mess kit back to his bunk for the daily inspection he stole a glance at kun maybe kun had a grounddown spoon knife stashed away somewhere too that hadnt occurred to istvan till now a kuusaman lieutenant strode through the barracks as the gyongyosian captives stood at attention by their cots a sergeant would have done a better more thorough job so thought istvan at any rate and never once stopped to wonder if his own underofficers rank had anything to do with his opinion once the kuusaman was satisfied frigyes pointed to istvan and the men whod served in his squad woodchopping detail he said as if istvan didnt know what he was supposed to be doing this is something that needs to be done properly without enough wood we dont eat hot food aye captain istvan said resignedly still he understood what frigyes meant some of the work the kuusamans gave their captives was designed to keep them busy nothing more fortunately they didnt seem to mind the captives going through the motions on that sort of job but firewood as frigyes had said was serious it was in fact serious in several ways the kuusaman corporal who issued the captives their axes kept careful count of just how many he was issuingno chance of stealing an axe and stowing it under a mattress if the number turned in at the end of the day didnt match the number given out at the start there would be trouble kun grumbled at chopping wood kun grumbled at a good many things but he was particularly vain about his hands which for a soldiers were soft and fine how am i supposed to cast a proper spell with them all rough and bruised and battered he complained you couldnt cast much of a spell any which way szonyi said you were only a mages apprentice not a mage yourself kun gave him a look full of loathing and swung his axe as if he would have liked to bring it down on szonyis neck to istvan chopping wood was just a job hed been doing it since he was a boy back in his home valley chopping wood meant staying warm through the harsh winter as well as having hot food in your belly he was raising his axe to split another chunk of beech when the gates to the captives camp not too far away swung open more poor buggers coming in szonyi predicted aye no doubt istvan lowered the axe without chopping he was willing to pause for a little while to see some new faces and new faces he sawnewer than hed expected who are those fellows szonyis deep voice cracked in surprise they sure arent gyongyosians the kuusaman guards led in four men who towered over them as gyongyosians would have but who as szonyi said plainly did not come from istvans kingdom the newcomers were slimmer of build than most gyongyosians and their hair was coppery not tawny they wore kuusaman military clothing which did not fit them well at all i know who they have to be kun said theyre algarvians stars above i think youre right istvan stared at the redheads the only real allies his kingdom had but what are they doing out here in the middle of the bothnian ocean algarve is way over on the other side of the world somewhere what he knew of geography would have filled the heads of perhaps two pinseven though thanks to his army service hed seen much more of the world than hed ever expected or wanted while growing up in the little village of kunhegyes lets ask them when we get off our shift szonyi said kun smiled a sour smile and what language will you ask them in he inquired szonyi had only one answer for that which was no answer at all a typical gyongyosian peasant he spoke only his own language sheepishly he said i dont suppose they know gyongyosian about as much as you know of algarvian probably aye kun enjoyed making szonyi look like a fool the new captives naturally noticed everybody staring at them they waved to the gyongyosians and bowed from the waist as if they were visiting nobles showoffs szonyi muttered then one of the algarvians waving again called out hello friends how are you in almost unaccented gyongyosian so they dont speak our language eh istvan said just as kun enjoyed making szonyi look like a fool istvan enjoyed turning the tables on clever kun he got fewer chances than he would have liked but made the most of the ones he did find kun as usual looked furious at getting caught in a mistake doing his best to discover how such a disaster might have happened he asked the algarvian where did you learn to speak gyongyosian my father was on the staff of the minister to gyongyos years ago the redheaded man answered and i was born in gyorvar so you could say i learned your language in your capital that was more than istvan could say himself his own upcountry accent sometimes made him feel selfconscious when he spoke to officers or others who had a more elegant turn of phrasesometimes even to kun who sprang from gyorvar but istvan knew what he wanted to find out why are you here so far from algarve asking the question that way let him disguise his own geographical shortcomings too with a wave to his comrades the algarvian said we crewed two leviathans that were bringing oh one thing and another from algarve to gyongyos we would have brought other things back from gyongyos to algarve the kinds of things you have more of than we do and that we could use in the war istvan started to ask what sorts of things those were but decided not to some of the kuusaman guards were bound to speak his language and he didnt want to give them the chance to learn anything interesting instead he said and something went wrong did it you might say so the redheaded man replied aye you just might say so some kuusaman dragons were flying east to drop eggs on some island or other that belongs to you and they saw our leviathans and dropped their eggsor enough of their eggson them instead they hurt the animals too badly to let them go on after that it was either surrender or try to swim home by ourselves he shrugged we surrendered istvan tried to imagine guiding a leviathanno a couple of leviathans from algarve all the way to gyongyos from one side of the world to the other he couldnt very well tell the foreigners that they should have fought to the death not when hed wound up in a captives camp too eyeing the barracks and the yard with something less than delight the algarvian asked what do you people do for fun around here what do we do for fun istvan returned why we chop wood we dig latrines when were very lucky and we havent got anything else to do we sit around and watch the trees out beyond the stockade grow the algarvian had a marvelously expressive face hearing istvans reply he looked as if hed just heard his father and mother had died and what do you do for excitement he inquired if you want excitement you can try to escape istvan answered maybe you can get out of the camp then maybe you can steal a ship then maybe you wouldnt have to swim home i am always glad to meet a funny man the redhead said istvan started to puff out his chest till the algarvian added too bad i am not so glad to meet you his smile took away most of the sting it might have taken away all of it had kun not sniggered istvan gave him a dirty look which only made him snigger again louder this time even when hed commanded a company as a sergeant leudast hadnt been allowed to attend officers conferences he was still commanding a company but thanks to luck and marshal rathar he was a lieutenant these days that entitled him to know what would happen before it happened to him here he and captain recared and a couple of dozen officers commanding units much larger than their ranks properly entitled them to lead sat in a barn that still stank of cow and listened to a colonel who was probably doing a lieutenant generals job explaining the details of what the unkerlanter army would try next in the south and so the colonel was saying if we succeed if all goes as planned we shall finally drive the cursed algarvians from the soil of the duchy of grelz exactly as our glorious comrades in arms have driven them out of northern unkerlant high time i sayhigh time indeed a lowvoiced rumble rose from the officers aye leudast joined it but had other things on his mind so theyve driven the redheads out of the north altogether have they that means my home village belongs to unkerlant again the thought would have cheered him more had he not paused to wonder if any of it was still standing it would have been fought over at least twice and for all he knew more often than that have you any questions the colonel asked a couple of majors did and even a brash captain leudast kept his mouth shut he was without a doubt the most junior officer in the barn and didnt want to remind anyone else that he was there at all the colonel efficiently disposed of the queries unlike a good many commanders leudast had known he actually had some notion of what he was talking about he finished weve wanted to pay those whoresons back for years now we put them in a sack and then pound the sack to pieces somebody said well find all sorts of strange things in the sack too so we will the colonel agreed algarvians yaninans forthwegians even blonds from out of the far east he shrugged so what it only shows the redheads are scraping up everything they can to try to hold us back but it wont work glory to king swemmel glory to unkerlant glory to swemmel glory to unkerlant the officers chorused the meeting broke up leudast and captain recared walked back to their position together leudast pointed look at all the eggtossers weve got waiting for the redheads eggtossers and behemoths and dragons and men recared said the river is running our way now theyll try to dam it upthey always fight hardbut we should have our way with them aye leudast nodded they threw everything they had at the durrwangen bulge last year they havent done any throwing since theyve been catching instead recared nodded too thats right and theyll catch it good and proper come tomorrow morning and leudast and recared passed a stockade guards stood stolidly around the perimeter the stink of longunwashed bodies wafted over the wall is that what theyre doing with the soldiers they courtmartial these days leudast asked i thought they just put them in punishment battalions and threw them at the redheads first they do recared answered those arent soldiers in there come on he walked faster plainly wanting to get away from the stockade as soon as he could they arent soldiers leudast said then who oh he walked faster too i wish we didnt have to do that how had the wretches behind the stockade ended up where they were by being desperate criminals maybe by being in the wrong place at the wrong time that struck leudast as much more likely he said no more those who complained about such things might end up behind a stockade themselves when he got back to his own encampment he feigned cheeriness whether he really felt it or not weve got a good plan and plenty of what we need to make it work he told his company every word of that was true too if it wasnt the whole truth the soldiers didnt need to know it tomorrow morning were going to make the algarvians sorry they ever set foot in unkerlant his men cheered sergeant hagen whod replaced kiun said well do better than that well make the cursed algarvians sorry they were ever bornisnt that right lieutenant hagen was very young and had a youngsters terrifying enthusiasm thats just right leudast said you ought to get whatever sleep you can tonight because all the eggs were going to fling will wake you up early the eggs they were going to fling would wake some of his men up early others had found a knack for sleeping through anything leudast envied them wishing he had the same knack himself as company commander he didnt get much sleep he stayed up late making sure everything in the company was as ready as it could be and he had a soldier shake him awake half an hour before the eggs were due to fly so he could be ready to lead the men eastward hissing and whistling noises in the air announced eggs flying toward the enemy a few moments later the eastern horizon lit up as with sunrise a couple of hours early leudast thrust his whistle into his mouth and blew a long piercing blast it was funas much fun as hed had with toys while a boyand he suddenly understood why officers enjoyed the privilege of carrying them forward he shouted for king swemmel and for unkerlant other company commanders whistles were shrilling too and so was captain recareds urra the men yelled urra swemmel urra they swarmed toward the algarvian lines part of that was eagerness to close with the hated foe part of it was knowing that hardeyed impressers with sticks would follow the advance and mercilessly blaze anyone who wasnt moving forward fast enough to suit them those impressers sometimes met mysterious fatal accidents of their own but they did help inspire most of the soldiers eggs burst among the advancing unkerlanters too king mezentio s men hadnt been caught altogether by surprise and the pasting they were taking hadnt put all their eggtossers out of action shrieks mingled with the cries of urra but what the algarvians gave was only a pittance a nuisance compared to what they were taking some of leudasts men newly swept into the army shrieked from terror rather than from pain but he knew better hed been on the receiving end of far far worse than this pulses of light began flickering in the night aheadalgarvian sticks their beams probing for his countrymen no the redheads hadnt been completely fooled and they hadnt been completely silenced either leudast cursed under his breath why dont they start killing the poor sods theyve rounded up he thought we could use the help he was ashamed of himself a moment later algarvian footsoldiers must have felt the same way when their mages first started slaughtering kaunians back in the dark fearful days when cottbus looked as if it would surely fall if they were wrong to wish for such a thing how was he right especially when his kingdoms sorcerers slaughtered his own countrymen for their effects how am i right its my neck thats how some of the enemys beams zipped past him fearfully close before the ground ahead shook and violet flames burst up from it some of his men whooped with glee as the sorcery struck the foe maybe they were naive enough not to know how their mages did what they did maybemore likelythey wanted to live themselves and didnt care forward leudast yelled hit em hard while theyre groggy the algarvians wouldnt stay groggy long three years and more of fighting them had made him all too sure of that they didnt have enough men or beasts to hold back the unkerlanters or drive them as they once had but the troopers they had left were as deadly dangerous as ever and the redheads still had kaunians left to kill leudast had hoped the unkerlanter bombardment would have slain a lot of the blonds without giving the algarvians the chance to seize their life energy and turn it into sorcerous energy no such luck the dreadfully disruptive and destructive sorcery the unkerlanter wizards raised now quieted much sooner than it should have as mezentios mages used and used up the kaunians to counteract it could be worse leudast thought in the old days wedve been fighting like mad bastards to counter their conjuring not the other way round a column of unkerlanter behemoths thundered forward the eggtossers and heavy sticks the armored beasts bore on their backs battered down surviving algarvian strongpoints and once it got moving east that column kept moving the only thing that could reliably stop a behemoth was another behemoth the algarvians had been short of behemoths ever since losing so many in the enormous battles of the durrwangen bulge and most of the animals they did have were in the north trying to hold the unkerlanters there come on men leudast shouted almost stumbling over a kilted corpse they cant hold us were breaking them their crust is tough but once were past it what have they got left nothing he blew the whistle again exulting in the squeal he exulted in what he saw too as the sky grew light and true dawn approached watching algarvians run was something unkerlanter soldiers didnt get to do often enough the redheads almost always fought till they couldnt fight any more not here hit with overwhelming force mezentios men fled for their lives it didnt help much the fleeing footsoldiers fell one after another leudast was in the middle of yelling forward yet again when an algarvian who didnt runsome stubborn whoresons always stood their ground blazed him in the leg the word went from a command to an anguished howl he fell heavily clutching at his right thigh lieutenants down sergeant hagen shouted leudast heard the words as if from very far away hed heard such cries countless times before but hed gone through three years of war and been wounded only oncetill now how bad was it he made himself yank up his tunic and look the beam had gone right through his leg outside the thighbone such wounds often cauterized themselves this one hadnt he was bleeding but not too badly he had a wound bandage unkerlant didnt issue such things hed taken it off a dead algarvian covering both sides of the wound was awkward but he managed hed just got the bandage into place when a couple of troopers hauled him upright he screamed again the way they manhandled him hurt as much as getting blazed had in the first place sorry sir one of them said well get you back to the healers all right leudast tasted blood he must have bitten his tongue or lower lip the men were glad to help him why not it took them away from danger too and he realized in dull painfilled astonishment he was getting his own second holiday from the war but the price of the ticket was very high he bit down on another scream and then on another still before long he wasnt biting down on them anymore pekka hadnt needed long to realize she disliked viana the more she knew her the more she disliked her too it wasnt that the lagoan sorceress was particularly annoying or that she lacked the wit to understand the spells shed come to the naantali district to learn for a little while pekka had trouble figuring out what it was for a little while but not for long viana was tall and straight and highbreasted with a narrow waist and long elegant legs the short kilts she wore showed to best advantage standing beside her pekka felt twelve years old and halfsprouted all over again having stood beside viana once pekka made it a point of never doing it again shes a lagoan lagoan women are bigger and rounder than kuusamans after pekka told herself that a couple of times she suddenly quit it wasnt the answer to the problem it was the problem it wouldnt have been if viana hadnt cast sheeps eyes at fernao every chance she gotand she made sure she got plenty of them just watching her just listening to her made pekka want to retch youre jealous pekka thought hes not your manyou made a point of telling him hes not your manand youre jealous you told him to find a lagoan girl heres one practically throwing herself at his feet and you want to kill her you don tjust want to kill her you want to kill her slowly an inch at a time and take days and days to get it over with she stared at herself in the mirror above the sink in her room jealousy was the greeneyed monster but her eyes remained brown no vianas eyes are green pekka hissed she stepped away from the mirror no she whirled away from the mirror so she wouldnt have to look at herself or think about the color of vianas eyes am l going out of my mind in a way it would have been easier had fernao fallen head over heels for his countrywoman then pekka would have known how things were and she could have gone on with her own life but as far as she could see fernao was much less interested in viana than viana was in him which meant which means trouble pekka said aloud which meant fernao was still interested in her if that wasnt trouble she didnt know what was going to him to let him know how upset she was at leinos jointing the war on the derlavaian mainland had been a mistake she saw that now if she revealed her most intimate feelings about her husband to another man with whom was she being more intimate the answer to that was depressingly obvious the reason for it was pretty obvious too leino was far away while fernao was here i was only really intimate with him once pekka said as long as she could keep on saying that as long as i can keep on saying that what she wondered as long as i can keep saying that im going to be sickjealous ofviana whenever i see her or even think of her and what if i were really intimate with fernao more than once she didnt see leinos face in her mind when she asked herself that she saw utos thinking about her son made pekka raise a hand to her cheek as if someone had slapped her in the face after that pekka couldnt make herself stay in her chamber another instant for that matter she couldnt make herself stay in the hostel any more instead of going into the refectory to gab with her colleagues she fled the place as if it were full of demons and so it was but the demons were her own outside things felt easier somehow the day was mild not warm the naantali district got warmer in summer than her southern seacoast home town of kajaani but not a lot warmer white clouds drifted slowly from west to east across a watery blue sky grass and shrubs remained green but they would start turning yellow in only a couple of months before long winter would reclaim this land and hold it for a long long time a lapwing flew by peeping before long it would fly north it could flee she was stuck here the lapwings motion made her notice other motion in the sky far far higher something up there circled lazily right at the edge of visibility a hawk she wondered and shook her head it was bigger than a hawk and higher than a hawk too a dragon but what was a dragon doing up there how long had dragons circled over naantali she didnt remember seeing one before had the seven princes taken to warding the hostel and the blockhouse and the land in between it wasnt the worst idea in the world if they had though why hadnt they told her about it this was her project she was supposed to know about such things she watched the dragon it continued to wheel far too high up for her to tell anything about it except what it was then something fell away from it pekka let out a gasp of horror fearing the dragonflier had somehow fallen off but the dragon didnt change course as it would have if suddenly deprived of intelligent control it kept right on circling as the the speck tumbled down to earth pekka had a while to watch that speck fall to watch it grow larger to wonder what it was she didnt wonder long if it wasnt a dragonflier it almost had to be an egg but if it was an egg either something had gone dreadfully wrong up there or or the algarvians have managed to sneak a dragon south from valmiera the way we pound their kingdom the thought formed blizzardcold in her mind one egg though the dragon had flown a long long way it couldnt possibly have carried more than one what were the odds the fellow flying it could hit anything worth hitting with a single egg good enough to risk a dragon and a highly trained man pekka couldnt see how unless she had to keep her eye on the plummeting egg now had she glanced away she would have lost it it looked as if it would fall some little distance behind the hostelbut then at the last instant the direction in which it fell suddenly shifted bringing it back toward the building magecraft flashed through her mind just before the egg burst she knew of no spell that could catch a quickly falling object like an egg and swing it back toward its target but she didnt know everything there was to know either the algarvians had talented mages of their own if theyd concentrated on this kind of magic they might be as far ahead with it as her group was with its special spells even as she realized that the egg released its sorcerous energy with a great roar and a flash of light just behind the hostel although shed wandered a couple of hundred yards away before she saw the dragon the noise was terrific a hammerblow against the ears part of the hostel sagged down toward the back like a tired old man sagging into a sofa smoke began to rise no pekka screamed and dashed back to the battered building as she ran she looked up into the sky she couldnt spot the dragon at first then she did it wasnt circling any more it was flying off toward the north as if the man aboard it knew hed done what he was supposed to do and so no doubt he did pekka cursed him with all her heart she doubted the curse would bite her own countrymen were warded against such and the algarvians were bound to be too she cursed anyhow people started spilling out of the hostel some bleeding some limping some helping others who had trouble moving on their own there was ilmarinen with blood running down his face from a cut cheekand with the plate of smoked salmon from which hed been eating still in his hand he waved to her calling they managed to sneak one in on us the stinking whoresons was he angry or did he admire the algarvians professional skill pekka couldnt tell she waved back and said aye she was glad to see ilmarinen not badly hurt but he wasnt the one whod made her come tearing back the way she had wheres fernao she cried in the midst of death and destruction ilmarinen laughed at her but the laughter cut off hes in there somewhere he answered one way or another he took the last bite of salmon off the plate and ate it more smoke poured from the hostel and more of it slid toward ruin more people came staggering out too mages and servants and cooks all mixed together pekkas heart leaped when she saw a tall redheaded man with a ponytailbut it wasnt fernao only one of the lagoan mages whod come here to learn the sorceries hed helped shape fernao had rescued her when the algarvians assailed the blockhouse could she do anything less for him she started into the hostel a couple of men caught her and held her back dont go inside mistress pekka one of them said the whole thing is liable to fall down i dont care she kicked out at them let me go no mistress the man replied we need you safe plenty of other people to go in there and get out the hurt and the dead youre staying right here between them he and his friend were much stronger than she she struggled anyhow and had to bite her tongue to keep from cursing them as savagely as she had the algarvian dragonflier and then all at once she went limp in their restraining arms there was fernao staggering out through the door ilmarinen had used hed lost his stick and made heavy going without it but didnt seem badly hurt pekka wheres pekka he shouted in his accented but now fluent kuusaman here i am pekka called when she said let me go this time the men who had hold of her did she hurried over to fernao are you all right she demanded not too bad he answered how in blazes did the algarvians manage to do this to us his face went thoroughly grim if one of the lagoan mages i brought in turns out to be a spy you can do whatever you please with me id deserve it no she said it had nothing to do with you or any of the other lagoans she explained how she knew guiding falling eggs by sorcery fernao said when she was through i wouldnt want to try that but i wont argue with youyou saw it and i didnt im just glad youre all right im glad youre all right pekka said they clung to each other now that she knew he was hale pekkas wits started working again ive seen ilmarinen now we have to find out if the rest of the theoretical sorcerers are safe theres palis fernao pointed and whos he dragging out oh powers above its viana the lagoan sorceress neck bent at an unnatural angle she was plainly dead piilis let her rest on the grass and hurried in after someone else before pekka could tell him to stop she stared at vianas corpse which looked skyward with blank eyes in an odd way her jealousy of the lagoan might have saved her life shame filled her she began to cry fifteen at some point in his life sidroc had surely heard the phrase misery loves company if he had the exact meaning of that phrase had escaped him till he found himself not far from the town of mandelsloh in the extreme east of unkerlant surrounded by king swemmel s soldiers he didnt know how many men who fought for king mezentio were surrounded with him but he did know the number wasnt small and he knew that the miserable men in the mandelsloh pocket came from just about every kingdom that had followed algarve into war against unkerlant had he not known the men sitting and lying around the fire with him would have done a good enough job of teaching the lesson even in the chaotic desperate fighting that marked the algarvian response to the unkerlanters latest blow here in the south he hadnt lost touch with sergeant werferth or ceorl though he wouldnt have particularly missed the ruffian had something happened to him a young exhausted algarvian lieutenant sprawled on the ground close by them hed been attached to plegmunds brigade but not to sidrocs company of forthwegians in algarvian service a couple of grelzers in dark green tunics by now had beards that would have let them pass for forthwegiansexcept that sidroc understood very little of what they said one of them was roasting some meat probably a chunk of dead unicorn but possibly dead behemoth not far from them a blond from the phalanx of valmieran lay snoring a yaninan in leggings and the funny shoes the soldiers of his kingdom wore changed the bandage on a minor wound unkerlanter dragons flew by overhead they ruled the skies these days they didnt bother dropping an egg on the campfire they were after bigger targets before long eggs burst half a mile or so away sidroc didnt even stir if a burst wasnt close enough to put him in danger of his life he didnt intend to worry about it even if it was that close he wouldnt worry about it much next to what would happen if swemmels soldiers got their hands on him alive dying didnt look so bad where do we go from here he saidin algarvian the one language all the weary frightened battered soldiers nearby might understand sure enough the yaninan answered in the same tongue east plenty of unkerlanters east of us too werferth said fatalistically that lieutenant sat up but our comrades are there to the east he was worn and filthy not at all the proper dapper algarvian officer we have to break through if we dont break through were all dead and if we do break through we are still all dead that was one of the grelzers the one who wasnt roasting meat it will take a little longer that is all his algarvian was so heavily accented sidroc had a hard time understanding him but once sidroc did make sense of the words he had a demon of a time disagreeing with them the yaninan finished fiddling with his bandage he pointed to the grelzers you not have to go east he said also haltingly you take off tunics you just peasants they both shook their heads i will not live under king swemmel said the one whod spoken before he kills his whole kingdom when the other grelzer took his meat off the fire ceorl pointed to it and said you want to share that as usual he had his eye on the main chance the grelzer plainly wanted nothing of the sort he glared at ceorl as a dog with a bone might glare at another dog whod looked at it but unlike a dog he thought before he fought and reluctantly nodded he started cutting up the gobbet so everyone could get a couple of bites from it sidroc wolfed down his portion he had some bread in his pack but he didnt take it out what he showed he would have to share if he went hungry now he might be able to eat more a little later meanwhile the yaninan shook the kaunian from valmiera awake so he could get his little portion thank you the blond said around a yawn hed been asleep when the other trapped soldiers talked about what to do next but he had the same idea we had better get moving the accent he gave to algarvian was even stranger than that of the grelzers but he still thought straight for he went on the longer the unkerlanters have to tighten the noose around us the more trouble we will be in ceorl said im sick to death of marching if you stay here youll get your death whether youre sick or not sidroc said ceorl glared at him they still didnt like each other had they not had worse worries they might have fought with a groan the algarvian lieutenant heaved himself to his feet hes right he said weve got no good chances but moving fast is our best one sidroc groaned too as he made himself stand he wanted to sleep with luck for about a week but he wasnt ready to sleep forever not yet and so he trudged off with the rest everything inside the mandelsloh pocket painted a picture of the disintegration of the army trapped there unkerlanter dragons had caught a column of supply wagons out in the open and smashed it to bits the wagons lay burnt and scattered like savaged toys the animals that had drawn them were bloated and starting to stink a battery of algarvian eggtossers had suffered a similar fate the engines made to fling death at the unkerlanters wound up on the receiving end of what they were supposed to dish out their tumbled and broken disarray argued that this fight would not be won not by the algarvians and a leyline caravan had taken an egg and now blocked the line it was intended to travel soldiers struggled to move it aside so other caravans might pass how much good will that do sidroc wondered they still cant get through the ring swemmels buggers have around us the lieutenant leading the motley little group of which sidroc was a part must have had the same thought he didnt let them get close enough to the wrecked caravan to be ordered to help shift it they just went on their way one band among many without much hope but without much choice either with only one choice in fact break out or die more dragons appeared overhead sidroc promptly dove into the crater a bursting egg had left behind his comrades took cover too he waited for more eggs to fall for the earth to shake at their bursts for the screams of wounded men to start nothing of the sort happened after a moment the blond from the phalanx of valmiera said those are algarvian dragons algarvian dragons had flown over the mandelsloh pocket before but not very often when they did they sometimes dropped food or medicines for the soldiers sidroc looked up to the sky with sudden hope the thought of getting his hands on a food package made his belly growl and his mouth water but no food parcels plummeted down in a way they were only cruel hoaxes since the dragons couldnt possibly bring in enough even to come close to supplying all the men trapped around mandelsloh every little bit helped someone though instead of food packets leaves of paper fluttered in the air slowly dancing toward the ground sidroc grunted what sort of lies are they telling us he asked nobody in particular the unkerlanters sometimes dropped leaflets urging their foes to surrender and promising them good treatments if they did the leaflets would have been much more persuasive had those foes not known what had happened to raniero of grelz sidroc didnt even have to climb out of his hole to get his hands on a leaflet two of them swirled down into the crater one hit him in the shoulder he grabbed it and turned it right side up soldiers of algarve help is on the way it read a strong counterattack from the east has been launched to regain contact with you and reestablish the front in this area we expect your rescuers to fight their way through the forces of the barbarous foe and join you within two days time you are urged to break out toward the east to aid this movement and to insure that it is crowned with success no matter what the result of the attack fom the rescuing units he read it through twice he spoke algarvian better than he read it but there still didnt seem any room for doubt theyre going to try he said as he came out of the crater theyre going to try but they dont think they can do it thats what it sounds like to me too sergeant werferth said the algarvian lieutenant nodded he read algarvian perfectly well and he also had no trouble reading between the lines the kaunian from valmieran was holding a leaflet too this attack of theirs will make the unkerlanters turn away from us he said in his odd accent this will give us a better chance he was probably right he was in fact almost certainly right but his being right didnt turn the better chance into a good one nevertheless sidroc started tramping east wed better get moving he said we want to break out while theyre still trying to break in no one argued with him the other soldiers emerged from their holes and slogged east too they werent any sort of formal unit just a double handful of men thrown together by chaos they clung to one another now though as if theyd fought shoulder to shoulder for years until that is they tramped past the wreckage of what the algarvians called a special camp eggs had hurled the neat rows of sacrificed corpses this way and that several days in the sun had turned them black and bloated and stinking but they were all unquestionably blond sidroc stared at the kaunian from the phalanx of valmiera what was he thinking what could he be thinking had sidroc been the algarvian lieutenant he wouldnt have waited around to find out he would have run for his life the blond looked at the stick he carried sidroc thought about running for his life even though he wasnt the algarvian lieutenant slowly the valmieran said algarve gave me this stick to fight unkerlant fighting unkerlant is the most important thing everybody relaxed sidroc realized he hadnt been the only anxious trooper he glanced over at the valmieran his private opinion was that the fellow was a little bit crazy but then if he werent a little bit crazy himself why the demon had he signed up for plegmunds brigade crazy or not hed read that leaflet right however hard the algarvians farther east were trying to break into the mandelsloh pocket the unkerlanters were holding them away that meant his comrades and he had to break out to make their own way toward the men fighting to link up with them it meant the army in the pocket had to leave most of their weapons behind it meant in the end that sidroc had to throw away his stick and his uniform and swim fifty yards across a freezing river but there were algarvians on the other side of it they hauled him out of the water and gave him spirits and dry clothesa short tunic and kilt but that couldnt be helped and they did the same for the blond from the phalanx of valmiera exhausted shivering half drunkthe spirits went straight to his headsidroc stuck out a hand the kaunian clasped it ealstan didnt need long to discover that raising a revolt against the algarvians in eoforwic was not so simple as sorcerously disguising himself as a redhead and going off to assassinate somebody maybe his comrades and he had hurt the algarvians with that murder he hoped so but mezentios men had found somebody else to put in the dead mans slot and they went right on about the business of grinding the rebellion into the dust reporting to pybba one morning ealstan pointed west across the twegen and angrily demanded what in blazes are the unkerlanters waiting for were tying up powers above only know how many brigades of algarvians for them why dont they cross the river and help us since the uprising started pybba looked to have aged ten years his voice was grim as he answered theres no good reason i can think of a couple of bad reasons if you want em go ahead ealstan said all right first thing that springs to mind is that theyre letting the algarvians solve their forthwegian problem for em a forthwegian whod fight the redheadsd fight swemmels buggers too so they may reckon a lot of us are better off dead ealstan grunted that made entirely too much sense he said the same way we let the algarvians solve our kaunian problem for us eh aye just like that pybba answered before realizing exactly what ealstan had said when he did he glared funny fellow ha ha i wasnt joking ealstan said how is it different shut up the pottery magnate said in a flat hard voice just shut up i dont have time to argue with you if you want to be a kaunianlover once we dont have the stinking algarvians on our hands fine go right ahead for now though youd cursed well better keep in mind which is more important in that moment ealstan hated him hated him with a hatred all the more bitter because pybba was his own countryman and they would never ever see eyetoeye on this ealstan had to take a deep breath to keep from telling the pottery magnate exactly what he thought of him by the look on pybbas face he thought the same thing of ealstan tell me what you need from me ealstan said at last ill go do it and then we wont have to have anything to do with each other for a while a bargain pybba said at once youre a stubborn whoreson youre almost as stubborn as i am i thinkthe only difference is youre a fool ealstan of course reckoned pybba the fool never mind he said you got in a last insult huzzah for you now give me my orders so i can go do them right pybba pointed toward the center of the city weve got a force building in a park getting ready to cut the algarvians corridor to the palace and to the leyline terminal go make sure theyre ready to move tell em the attack is still on the fellow in charge there already knows what time fine shall i join it if you want to pybba spoke with relentless indifference a moment later though he checked himself and shook his head no you know too cursed much cant have the redheads nabbing you and tearing it out of you right ealstan said tightly he turned on his heel and strodealmost stompedout of pybbas office and out of the pottery works that was now the headquarters for the rebellion as he left he laughed a little one thing the uprising had done it had cost the algarvians their source of style seventeen sugar bowls they would have to use something else instead of hold their little eggs eoforwic looked like what it was a city torn by war smoke thickened the air ealstan hardly noticed hed got very used to it eggs burst not far away hed got used to that too and hed got used to glassless windows to buildings with chunks bitten out of them and to charred beams sticking up like leafless branches from the wreckage the forthwegian capital hadnt suffered too badly when the unkerlanters seized it or when the algarvians took it away from king swemmel s men it was making up for lost time he found the park without much trouble finding the man in charge of the attack took more work but he finally did the fellow nodded brusquely aye i know what were supposed to do he said well bloody well do it too you can go back and tell pybba he doesnt need to hold my hand im not a baby keep your tunic on ealstan hid a smile he had that same reaction to the pottery magnate usually a couple of times an hour he knew he was here more to get him out of pybbas hair than for any other reason he didnt care right this minute he couldnt think of anything he wanted more than to be out of pybbas hair when he didnt say anything more the local commander nodded again as if hed passed a test all right kid well feed the powers below plenty of dead algarvians dont you worry about a thing that kid made ealstan bristle but he didnt show it when you showed things like that people just laughed right he said again and walked away almost as fast as hed walked away from pybba the park didnt look like a place where an attack was building the forthwegian fighters didnt gather out in the open that would have shown them to redheads on dragons overhead or with spyglasses up in tall buildings and would have invited massacre instead they crouched under trees and in the buildings around the park waiting for the order to go forward they all wore armbands that said free forthweg so the algarvians couldnt claim they were fighting out of uniform and blaze them on the spot if they caught them as ealstan was going by one of the forthwegian fighters under the oaks called his name he stopped in surprise he didnt recognize the other man but then after a moment he did it was the fellow whod been playing drums in another parkthe fellow who played so much like the famous ethelhelm now that ealstan heard him speak he sounded like ethelhelm too hello ealstan said the face is familiarwhich wasnt quite true but i cant place your name he didnt know which name ethelhelm was using if ethelhelm had even a dram of brains it wouldnt be his own and sure enough the musician said you can call me guthfrith good to see you again ealstan told him getting your revenge on the algarvians are you guthfrith its about time wouldnt you say ethelhelm answered probably long past time ealstan said and the kaunian halfbreed nodded ealstan went on what have you been doing with yourself lately odd jobs mostly said ethelhelmno i should think of him as guthfrith went through ealstans mind did you recognize me there in that other park i saw you and i thought you might have i thought i did ealstan replied but i wasnt sure you didnt look just the way i thought i recalled youyou were sorcerously disguisedbut your hands hadnt changed at all ethelhelmno guthfrithlooked down at the hands in question as if theyd betrayed him and so in a way they had even now they looked more as if they should be poised over drums than holding a stick with a chuckle he said not everyone has ears as good as yours im not sorry either id be in trouble if more people did you would have been in trouble ealstan said not any more now youre getting your own back no guthfrith shook his head the thieving redheads have taken away everything i had i cant get it back the most i can get is a piece of revenge i wasnt very brave before now he shrugged i try to do better thats all anyone can do ealstan said took me a long time to figure it out guthfrith said hows your lady what was her name thelberge thats right ealstan nodded shes fine thanks weve got a little girl do you guthfrith said and ealstan nodded again then guthfrith reminded ealstan he was also ethelhelm for he went on you used to go with a blond woman before that didnt you do you know what happened to her uhno ealstans ears heated in dull embarrassment but he was not about to tell the musician that vanai was thelberge he wished he hadnt had to tell pybba about his family arrangements the more people he told the more vanai found herself in danger for there was no guarantee that the forthwegians would succeed in ousting the algarvians from eoforwic and if mezentios men won this fight they would surely take the most savage vengeance they could no eh guthfriths voice was toneless as he added too bad ealstan wanted to explain everything to him he wanted to but he didnt aye the fellow who had been ethelhelm was a half breed but hed got much too cozy with the algarvians and stayed that way much too long if they ever captured him now he was liable to feed them a genuine fullblooded kaunian to save his own neck he looked at ealstan with something like loathing though theyd been friendly while ealstan was casting his accounts for him ealstan looked at him in much the same way neither of them plainly would ever trust the other again when ealstan said ive got to go he knew he sounded relieved and guthfrith looked the same way take care of yourself take care of your little girl too by the way guthfrith sounded ealstan was welcome to walk in front of a leyline caravan you take care too ealstan sounded as if he wished the same for guthfrith he hurried off toward pybbas headquarters and didnt look back once whatever warmth hed known for the man whod been one of the most popular musicians in forthweg was dead now he needed a while to get back to the pottery magnates place algarvian dragons appeared overhead and dropped load after load of eggs on eoforwic forcing ealstan into a cellar no unkerlanter dragons flew east from over the twegen to challenge the beasts painted in green red and white the enemy could simply do as he pleased and he pleased to knock down big chunks of the forthwegian capital he doubtless assumed anyone still inside the city opposed him had he been wrong in that assumption the destruction he wrought helped make him right took you long enough pybba growled when ealstan finally did get back i didnt send you out to buy a months worth of groceries you know you may have noticed the algarvians were dropping eggs again ealstan said i didnt want to get killed on my way back so i ducked into some shelter till they quit pybba waved that aside as if of no account maybe to him it wasnt will the attack go through on time he demanded ealstan nodded aye the fellow in charge of it told me to tell you he didnt need any reminders thats my job reminding pybba said his job as far as ealstan could see was doing everything nobody else was doing and half the jobs other people were supposed to be doing without him the uprising probably never would have happened with him it was going better than ealstan had thought it would was it going well enough ealstan had his doubts and did his best to pretend he didnt leino had been in balvi or rather through balvi once before on holiday with pekka then the capital of jelgava had impressed him as a place where the blond locals did their best to separate outsiders from any cash they might have as quickly and enjoyably as possible now now with the algarvian garrison that had occupied balvi for four years fled to the more rugged interior of jelgava the city was one enormous carnival jelgavans had never had a reputation for revelryif anyone did it was their algarvian occupiersbut they were doing their best to make one thumping kaunianstyle bands blared on every corner people danced in the streets most of them seemed drunk and anyone in kuusaman or lagoan uniform could hardly take a step without getting kissed or having a mug full of something cold and wet and potent thrust into his hand even though leino walked through balvi hand in hand with xavega jelgavan women kept coming up and throwing their arms around him jelgavan men kept doing the same thing with xavega who seemed to enjoy it much less when one of the blond men let his hands wander more freely on her person than he might have she slapped him and shouted curses in classical kaunian by his silly grin he didnt understand her and wouldnt have cared if he had looking around at the way most of the kuusaman and lagoan soldiers were responding to this welcome leino spoke in classical kaunian too they seem to be having a good time of course they dothey are men xavega answered tartly in the same tongue and nine months from now a good many halfjelgavan babies will be born i do not care to have any of them be mine all right leino said reflecting that any jelgavan man who tried to drag xavega into a dark cornernot that every couple was bothering to look for a dark corner not in the midst of this joyous madnesswould surely get his head broken for his trouble or else have something worse happen to him and then he and xavega rounded a corner and he discovered that not all the madness was joyous there hanging upside down from lampposts were the bodies of several algarvians and the jelgavans who had helped them run the kingdom under puppet king mainardo the crowd kept finding new horrid indignities to heap on the corpses everyone cheered at each fresh mutilation leino was glad he didnt speak jelgavan he couldnt understand the suggestions that came from the onlookers he glanced toward xavega what they were seeing didnt seem to bother her she caught his eye and said they had it coming maybe he answered wondering if anyone could ever have that coming to him or to her he pointed that one i think used to be a woman i daresay she deserved it too xavega snapped leino shrugged he didnt know one way or the other he wondered if the people whod hung the woman up there with those men had known or cared and then a fierce howl rose from the jelgavans for a wagon bearing a blond man with his hands tied in front of him came slowly up the street through the crowd leino needed no jelgavan to understand the roars of hatred from the people the captive in the wagon shouted something that sounded defiant more roars answered him the crowd surged toward the wagon the fellow with his hands tied had guards but they didnt do muchdidnt in fact do anythingto protect him the mob snatched him out of the wagon and beat him and kicked him as they dragged him to the nearest wall some of them had sticks they blazed him he fell with another harsh baying cryhalf wolfish half orgasmicthey swarmed over his body when they find some more rope he will go up on a lamppost too leino said classical kaunian seemed too cold too dispassionate for such a discussion but it remained the only tongue he had in common with xavega good riddance to him she said these people knew him they knew what he should have got and they gave it to him i suppose so leino said and then after a moment i wonder how many in that mob have things of their own to hide and how many names that jelgavan did not get to name because they killed him so fast xavega gave him a startled look i had not thought of that she said but then she shrugged if they do not get the names from him they will surely get them from someone else a lot of these jelgavans collaborated with the algarvians that was also likelyindeed almost certainto be true some of the same ones will probably end up collaborating with us leino said the thought saddened him he wondered why hed never labored under the delusion that war was an especially clean business a couple of blocks farther on a fat jelgavan rushed out of his tavern to press mugs of wine in leino and xavegas hands quite impartially he kissed them both on the cheek and shouted out something in which leino heard a word that sounded a lot like the classical kaunian term for freedom then he bowed and went back into his place only to emerge again a moment later to give wine to a couple of kuusaman soldiers by the way they staggered theyd already had a good deal xavega let out a scornful sniff if the algarvians knew what things were like here they could run us out of balvi with about a regiment and a half of men maybe leino raised an eyebrow would you have said the same thing if you had seen a couple of drunken lagoan soldiers our men have too much discipline for but xavegas voice trailed away not even she could bring out that claim with a straight face too much evidence to the contrary was not just visible but blatantly obvious leino laughed she contented herself with giving him a sour look that only made him laugh more more shouts of savage glee came from up a side street theyve caught another collaborator leino thought with something between joy and alarm watching a man even an enemy die as that one jelgavan had done was nothing to face with equanimity but these collaboratorsthere were about a dozen of themwere not going to their end only to their humiliation they were women who must have had algarvian lovers theyd been stripped to the waist and had red paint smeared in their hair people shouted curses at them and pelted them with eggs and overripe summer fruit but no one aimed a stick their way little whores xavega said most of them are taller than i am leino said xavega snorted again you know what i meant she said and this time he had to nod they passed an empty square half overgrown with rank grass not something leino would have expected to see in the middle of a large crowded city like balvi at the edge of the square sprouted a small brickwork of memorial tablets all of them obviously new leino tried his classical kaunian on a few of the locals excuse me but whom do these tablets remember on his third try he found a man who could answer him in the old language not whom man from another kingdom but what the fellow said his accent odd in leinos ears but understandable once an assembly hall from the days of the kaunian empire stood here but the algarvian barbarians may the powers below eat them destroyed it we could not mourn it as we should have while false king mainardo ruled here now that he is gone we show we remember thank you leino said hed heard about algarvian wrecking in the kaunian kingdoms but this was the first hed seen of it himself i thank you man from another kingdom the jelgavan replied in classical kaunian the usual word for foreigner also meant barbarianthat was the word the man had applied to the algarvians he found a politer substitute for leino after bowing he added i thank you for setting us free and for giving us back our own true and rightful king eryou are welcome leino said and got away in a hurry from everything hed seen of king donalitu aboard habakkuk the jelgavans were welcome to him here and there in balvi signs in the algarvians slithering script remained no doubt they told garrison troops and soldiers on leave from the horrors of the west how to get about in the city even as that thought crossed leinos mind he noticed a couple of jelgavans busily tearing down one of those signs a lagoan soldier wearing the silver gorget that marked a military constable held up his hand he spoke in his own language xavega angrily answered he shrugged and said something else she answered even more angrily what does he want leino asked he had next to no lagoan of his own just as xavega had never bothered learning kuusaman in classical kaunian she replied he says all mages are to report to a center they have set up near the palace he says we cannot enjoy ourselves here even for a day but that we have to report at once so we can return to duty once more it makes sense leino said xavega kept right on grumbling whether it made sense or not she didnt like it perhaps noting as much the military constable came up and spoke in lagoan then to leinos surprise he added a few words in kuusaman come with me i take you there you dont have to do that leino said this time the lagoan surprised him by laughing i think maybe i do have to do that you come with me leino shrugged and nodded xavega looked ready to bite nails in half once the military constable put that into lagoan but she nodded too at the center a boredlooking kuusaman clerk checked their names off a duty roster in his own language he said the two of you havent had the special training isnt that right aye thats so leino answered he translated for xavega who looked miffed at not hearing lagoan or at least classical kaunian she grudgingly nodded again all right the clerk went right on speaking kuusaman and made a couple of more check marks ill assign you to the training center north of here shall i billet the two of you together whats he saying xavega asked leino translated again she nodded once more and told the clerk aye put us together in classical kaunian he evidently followed that language even if he chose not to speak it for he made more checks still leino had left habakkuk to find a painless way to break things off with xavega he still didnt know exactly why shed leftto get at the algarvians he supposed and shed seen having him around as one more comfort shed grown used to and youyou really hate the idea of going to bed with her leino thought he didnt care for most of xavegas opinions or for large chunks of her rather badtempered character but when they lay down together if i had any gumption i would say no put us apart he said not a word he let the clerk finish the paperwork the fellow pointed to a bench wait there before long a carriage or a wagon will take you to the leyline caravan depot for your trip to the center things are a little crazy now leino went over and sat down xavega perched beside him with an inward sigh he slipped his arm around her waist and drew her close for once most obliging she snuggled up against him are you almost ready colonel lurcanio called up to krasta from the foot of the stairs this is a reception at the royal palace remember king gainibu will probably behead you if you are late krasta looked at herself in the bedchamber mirror she tugged at the waistband of her trousers her pregnancy still didnt show not quite but she knew she was heavier than usual her trousers should have been snug but not this snug but they would have to do im coming she said she and lurcanio hadnt been invited to the palace for some months she didnt want to offend king gainibu by being late even if she didnt worry about the headsmans axe as she grabbed a handbag she wondered if she was fretting over nothing probably odds were gainibu would be too drunk to care or even to notice who arrived when hed stayed drunk most of the time since the algarvians occupied priekule by the way lurcanios eyes lit up she knew the trousers werent too snug the wrong way and she also knew that she had rather more on top than shed had before lurcanio or curse it was it valnu put a baby in her with men that never went to waste lurcanio handed her up into his carriage his driveranother redhead of coursepicked his way through evening twilight and then through darkness toward the palace no lights showed lagoan and kuusaman dragons flew over the capital of valmiera all too often these days if patrolling algarvians or the valmieran constables who served them saw lights they would sometimes start blazing without warning after getting lost a couple of times and grumbling in his incomprehensible language the driver finally found the palace lights gleamed inside with dark curtains making sure no stray beams leaked out colonel the count lurcanio a flunky bawled out his companion the marchioness krasta on lurcanios arm krasta strode into the reception hall shed gone into that reception hall on lurcanios arm a good many times at first everything seemed the same as usual algarvian officers with their goodlooking valmieran companions along with the valmieran nobles who inclined toward algarve and their ladies king gainibu stood in a receiving line with grand duke ivone the redhead who really ran valmiera these days but something in the hall was different tonight krasta sensed it at once though she needed a little while to realize just what it was far fewer valmieran nobles had come than would have been true a couple of years before only those whod most closely tied their fate to the occupiers krasta hadnt paid a great deal of attention to the news sheetsshe never didbut she knew the war news for algarve wasnt good the fairweather friends are flying she thought she almost said it aloud but caught herself in time lurcanio would not have taken it kindly his temper had a way of slipping when some algarvian position in unkerlant or jelgava did some slipping of its own krasta got her second surprise when she and lurcanio greeted the king of valmiera in the receiving line as usual gainibu had a glass in his hand but it held only wine not the stronger spirits hed preferred since yielding to the redheads good evening colonel gainibu said when lurcanio made his polite bow krasta dropped a curtsy and a good evening to you marchioness the king added his voice and his eyes seemed clearer than they had for years as lurcanio started to go on gainibu remarked there are a few things i should like to discuss with you tonight colonel of course your majesty lurcanio said catcourteous as usual but he couldnt quite keep the faintest hint of astonishmentor was it alarm from his voice and he couldnt keep from glancing over to grand duke ivone ivones smile looked as if it were held in place with carpet tacks this may be an interesting reception after all krasta said as they made their way toward the tables piled high with food and drink so it may lurcanio sounded anything but happy at the prospect what in blazes is wrong with gainibu he seemed better than he has in a long time krasta said that is what i meant lurcanio snarled he took a glass of something potent and knocked it back at a gulp krasta chose a mug of ale for herself she had less of an urge to drink herself blind at these affairs than shed had before she found herself expecting a baby she couldnt decide whether that was good or not on a raised platform in one corner of the reception hall sat several musicians softly playing they were valmierans themselves but played soft delicate tinkling algarvianstyle music rather than the more emphatic rhythms and more raucous instrumentsbagpipes and thumping drumsof their own kingdom krasta had got used to hearing the occupiers music in the royal palace now for some reason she noticed it again colonel lurcanio didnt need long to notice it either they must have got drunk up there he growled pointing to the men and one woman on the low platform either that or they are making a hash of things on purpose just to annoy us why would they do that krasta asked it is called kicking a man when you think he is down her algarvian lover answered his eyes glittered his smile seemed more carnivorous than usual you had better be right or you will be very sorry but krasta hardly heard those last few words kicking a man when you think he is down much suddenly became clear things she was seeing here and things she had seen elsewhere the valmierans thought their occupiers were in trouble and so they could afford to show insolence some of them thought that way anyhow but a big swagbellied man with a provincial accent came up to colonel lurcanio and boomed ho congratulations on your armies bold brave defensive stand along the twegen river by his tone the algarvians were still cocks o the walk lurcanio bowed for which i thank you your excellency krasta had never heard of the twegen river shed never heard of a lot of the western places that found themselves written into the chronicles of the war with letters of blood she stared down into her mug of ale wishing she felt like drinking more while lurcanio and the valmieran noble from the back of beyond talked endlessly about the fighting and how it was going after a while she yawned and found a chair and sat down carrying a baby gave her an excuse for showing she was tired and bored the valmieran baron or whatever he was talked loud enough to let the whole reception hall know his opinionsas if anyone cares krasta thought acidly still booming like a courting grouse he went on surely the unkerlanter hosts will break themselves on the rock of your might may it be so lurcanio answered with another bow and now if you will excuse me he hurried off to get himself another drink by the time he got back the valmieran had gone off to boom in someone elses ear lurcanio poured down the drink even so what was he going on about krasta asked something about which he knows much less than he thinks he does a certain amused malice in his voice lurcanio went on there are i suspect a great many things about which he knows much less than he thinks he does even though krasta still hadnt emptied her first mug of ale that made her giggle she might have said the same sort of thing herself then she quickly got to her feet and curtsied once more king gainibu was coming toward her and lurcanio the kings walk had more purpose and less wobble in it than shed seen for years lurcanio noted the same thing as hed noted gainibus unusual steadiness in the receiving line his bow was politeness personified but hard suspicion ruled his voice as he murmured your majesty good evening colonel and milady of course gainibu said but after that he might have forgotten krasta was there it irked her less than it would have from a lesser personage the king was the king and did as he pleased swinging his attention back to lurcanio he continued i told you earlier in the evening that we should have somewhat to discuss so you did your majesty the algarvian replied by all means say on i shall you need not worry about that king gainibu s wave somehow encompassed not only the reception hall but the whole kingdom of valmiera at some point or other probably sooner rather than later you will have to evacuate this land to fight elsewhere it could be lurcanio said it is on the other hand anything but certain dont bandy words with me gainibus voice was sharp peremptory the voice of a king you are already moving men out of valmiera moving them through priekule to fight in the west and the north before long parts of the kingdom will be all but bare of algarvians we shall hold what we need your majesty lurcanio for his part spoke with studied selfassurance if you think we shall let ourselves be dispossessed of the main cities and the roads and ley lines between them i must say i believe you to be mistaken this may come to a test gainibu said theyre bargaining krasta realized in sudden surprise the algarvians hadnt had to bargain in valmiera for some time she looked around for viscount valnu but didnt see him she shrugged even if she had he probably would have been in the company of one algarvian officer or another and she really didnt want to see him like that her free hand went to her belly for a moment all at once she hoped valnu had sired her child hed had the first chance after all and a valmieran father might prove much more convenient than shed thought only a few weeks before shed missed a little of what the king and lurcanio were saying would regret it came from lurcanios mouth both sides would regret it gainibu answered do you doubt that and so my proposal if there are no outragesand you know the sort i meanyou will find your withdrawal easier than it would prove otherwise if not he shrugged it will not be withdrawal but a running fight words rhetoric but lurcanio sounded uneasy how can you hope to make your promises good i have ways the king said remember what algarve managed after the six years war despite being beaten and occupied we can do the same especially as you will be busy elsewhere i told ivone as much he said you were the man for the details good evening colonel he nodded and walked off what sort of details krasta asked what exactly was he talking about the sort of details my sweet that are all too likely to put me in charge of combat troops once more however tedious that may prove lurcanio answered careless of who might be watching he closed his hand on her breast i shall have to make the most of things while i can hajjaj woke to the sound of distant thunder that was his first thought his second thought was that the first was idioticthunder in bishah might have been more likely than snow there at that season or at any season but it wasnt a great deal more likely beside him on the low bed tassi stirred and muttered after a particularly loud roar she stiffened and sat up and said something or other in yaninan hajjaj spoke in algarvian the only language they had in common the unkerlanters have sent dragons against bishah again their eggs should not burst close to here not when were up in the hills oh she said now fully awake i thought it was a storm she snuggled against him he enjoyed the touch of her soft bare skin he would have enjoyed it more had sweat not sprung out wherever their bodies touched zuwayzi summer nights were not really made for lovers who craved clasping each other close in winter it might have been a storm hajjaj replied at this season i hope our dragonfliers and the algarvians do a proper job of punishing the raiders may it be so tassi said and then as long as we are awake would you like to hajjaj chuckled ask me again in a couple of days and ill gladly say aye you pay me the compliment of treating me as if i were younger than i am it is flattering far be it from me to deny that but i know what this old carcass can do and what is beyond its powers these days do you tassi said mischief in her voice she slithered down toward the foot of the bed maybe i can surprise you maybe she could have too shed pleasantly surprised hajjaj once or twice before kolthoum had been right as usual tassi made a splendid amusement but she hadnt even begun when someone tapped on the bedchamber door she let out a startled squeak hajjaj was a little startled too he always slept lightly and his retainers knew better than to bother him in the night without urgent need what is it he called out in zuwayzi your excellency you are wanted at the crystallomancers tewfik s voice came from the other side of the door it is general ikhshid despite the summer heat ice ran up hajjajs back ill come of course he said and got out of bed whats wrong tassi asked in algarvian not following the quick conversation between the two zuwayzin i dont know hajjaj answered in the same tongue though he feared he did but i had better go and find out im sorry to disturb you lad tewfik said as hajjaj stepped out into the dimly lit hallway the wrinkled old majordomos laugh had a leer in it i hope i didnt interrupt anything no hajjaj said and let it go at that you can go back to bed now yourself tewfik ill take care of whatever needs doing but tewfik shook his head im up ill stay up you may need more from me before the morning comes how much did he know how much did he guess hajjaj had no time to find out whatever his majordomo knew tewfik would keep it to himself hajjaj did know that he hurried down the hall toward the chamber where the crystallomancers kept this isolated clanfathers house in touch with the wider world sure enough general ikhshid s image stared out at him as he sat down in front of one of the crystals there as soon as ikhshid saw him the zuwayzi officer began to speak well your excellency the whoresons have dropped the other boot the unkerlanters even now hajjaj could hope he was wrong but ikhshid nodded grimly im afraid so this isnt just another raid on bishah theyre pounding us all along the frontpounding us hard i mean they arent playing games any more your excellency theyve got a demon of a lot of men and behemoths and dragons and eggtossers are we holding the zuwayzi foreign minister asked the question he had to ask and asked it with more than a little dread for nowmostly ikhshid said thats by the reports i have right this minute mind you i dont have reports from the whole line yet and that worries me some of our brigades may not be reporting because they arent there to report any more and if they arent his bushy white eyebrows came down and together in a frown if they arent swemmels soldiers are liable to be pouring through the gaps hajjaj said thats what you mean isnt it most unhappily general ikhshid nodded aye and if they are powers above only know how were going to stop them we gave them a good fight when they attacked us almost five years ago hajjaj said that was true also true was that the unkerlanters had prevailed in the end and ikhshid said what worries me most your excellency is that theyre a lot better than they were back then we havent changed all that much but theyve had three years of lessons from the algarvians you dont get any better schoolmasters than mezentios men that didnt sound good no it doesnt sound good at all hajjaj thought gloomily he asked have you told king shazli yet i dont mind so much waking you up ikhshid said i thought id let his majesty sleep till morningif the unkerlanter eggs will wake him he is the sovereign and he needs to know hajjaj said dont tell him youve told me first tell him youre about to let me know and that he doesnt have to im going to head down into the city right now all right ill do it just as you say ikhshid nodded to someone hajjaj couldnt seepresumably his crystallomancer for the crystal flared with light and then went inert as the etheric connection was broken hajjaj went out into the hall he wasnt surprised to find tewfik waiting im going to need a driver right away im afraid he said the majordomo nodded ive already got him out of bed hes harnessing up the carriage thank you tewfik hajjaj said you are a wonder the ancient retainer nodded accepting the praise as no less than his due by the time hajjaj got down into bishah the unkerlanter dragons had flown off to the south a bit of smoke hung in the air the moon was down or hajjaj judged he would have seen dark columns rising into the sky eggs had fallen close to the royal palace but not on it a few minutes after hajjaj got to the foreign ministry qutuz came in did general ikhshid have a crystallomancer get hold of you too hajjaj asked his secretary qutuz shook his head no your excellency the attack seemed bigger than usual so i thought i should be here in case something was going on i gather it is you might say so hajjaj answered the unkerlanters have struck the lines down by our southern border and theyve struck hard are we holding qutuz asked anxiously we were when i spoke to ikhshid hajjaj said i hope we still are general ikhshid himself strode into hajjajs offices a little past sunrise as he had on the crystal he wasted no time theyve broken through in several places ive ordered our men back to the next line of positions farther north i hope we can hold them there you hope so hajjaj said and ikhshid nodded like a man picking at a sore hajjaj elaborated you may hope so but you dont think so do you no ikhshid said bluntly we may slow em up there but i dont see how we can stop em the next line north of that is on our old frontier thats a lot deeper because we spent years building it up between the six years war and the last time swemmels buggers hit us can we stop the unkerlanters there then hajjaj asked i hope so ikhshid answered in much the same tones hed used the last time he said that hajjaj ground his teeth that wasnt what hed wanted to hear nor anything close to it he hadnt thought he would ever wish ikhshid werent quite so honest what should the kingdom do if the soldiers cant hold along that line he asked make peace as fast as we can and get the best terms king swemmel will give us again general ikhshid spoke without the least hesitation if the unkerlanters break through at the old frontier powers below eat me if i know how we can stop themor even slow them down very muchthis side of bishah its summer hajjaj said looking for hope wherever he might find it wont the desert work for us some ikhshid said somemaybe what you have to understand though and what i dont think you do is that the unkerlanters are a lot better at what theyre doing than they were the last time they struck us a blow were some better ourselves thanks to the algarvians weve got more behemoths and dragons than we did then but curse me if i know whether itll be enough no sooner were the words out of his mouth than a young captain hurried past qutuz and saluted sir the junior officer said to ikhshid im sorry to have to report an enemy breakthrough at sab abar ikhshid cursed wearily odds were he hadnt slept all night he said thats not good sab abar is in the second defensive line not the first if theyve got through there already thats not good at all how could they have reached the second line so fast hajjaj asked how could they have broken through it so fast they probably got there about as fast as we did ikhshid said unhappily its not a neat pretty fight when both sides are moving fast especially if the whoresons on the other side have got their peckers up and the stinking unkerlanters do powers below eat em they think they can lick anybody right now and when you think like that youre halfway to being right qutuz asked the next question before hajjaj could if theyve broken through at this sab abar place can we hold the second line even for a little while i dont know ill have to see general ikhshid sounded harried well do everything we can but who knows how much that will be he bowed to hajjaj if youll excuse me your excellency id better head back in fact unless i miss my guess ill be going down south before too long as i say we have to do what we can with another bow he tramped away the young captain in his wake what are we going to do your excellency qutuz asked the best we can hajjaj answered i have nothing better to tell you any more than ikhshid had anything better to tell me what i have to do now i think is let king shazli know we have difficulties he didnt know what shazli could do he didnt know what anyone could do it was up to zuwayzas soldiers now if they did what he hoped the unkerlanters still had their work cut out for them if they didnt if they didnt zuwayza might not need a foreign minister much longer only an unkerlanter governor ruling from bishah as one had back before the six years war one of the nice things about serving as an algarvian constable even an algarvian constable in occupied forthweg was that bembo hadnt had to go to war it was always other poor sods whod had to travel west and fight the unkerlanters theyd hated him for his immunity too hed known they hated him and hed laughed at them on account of it now that laughter came home to roost the war had come home too or at least come to eoforwic which he had to call home these days for one thing the forthwegians in the city kept on fighting as if they were soldiers and for another swemmels men sat right across the twegen from eoforwic if they ever swarmed across the river bembo clutched his stick a little tighter these days he always carried an armyissue weapon not the shorter one hed used as a constable for all practical purposes he wasnt a constable any more all the algarvians still in eoforwic came under military command nowadays ever so cautiously he peered out from behind a battered building he ducked back again in a hurry seems all right he said no forthwegian fighters in sight anyhow oraste grunted its the buggers who arent in sight youve got to watch out for bembos old partner said he and bembo and half a dozen real soldiers had been thrown together as a squad you never see the one who blazes you or if you do hes the last thing you see a trooper added cheerfully heh bembo said if that was a joke he didnt find it funny if it wasnt a joke he didnt want to think about it running feet behind him made him whirl the business end of his stick swinging toward what might be a target the algarvians heldand held downthis section of eoforwic but their forthwegian foes kept sneaking fighters into it and making trouble bembo had no desire to find himself included in some casualty report no one would ever read but the fellow heading his way was a tall redhead in short tunic and kilt an algarvian constable like himself relaxing a littlerelaxing too much was also liable to land you in one of those reportshe asked whats up nothing good the newcomer answered you know how a bunch of our important officers have come down with a sudden case of loss of life he waited for bembo and the men with him to nod then went on well the brassthe ones whore still left alive i meanthink theyve figured out whats gone wrong tell tell that wasnt just bembo several of his comrades spoke up too disliking the men in command was one thing wanting to see all of them dead was something else againat least bembo supposed it was with the selfimportance of a man who knows he has important news the other constable said well what happened isor the big blazes think what happened isthe fornicating forthwegians have worked out a spell that makes them look like us what could be better for assassins like the cursed kaunians looking like forthwegians by the powers above bembo exclaimed aye it sounds wonderful oraste said now all we need is a spell that makes us look like kaunians so we can go off and cut our own throats and save the forthwegians and the unkerlanters the trouble that isnt much of a joke one of the soldiers said echoing bembos thought who says i was joking orastes face and voice were cold as winter in the south of unkerlant the soldier glared back at him that was enough to intimidate most algarvian constables pressed into combat duty it would have been plenty to intimidate bembo who knew perfectly well that he was softer than the men who went to real war but oraste glared right backanyone who reckoned himself the harder man would have to prove it by beating him and the soldier looked away first bembo was impressed he was also worried how in blazes are we supposed to know the whoresons with us are proper algarvian whoresons and not disguised forthwegian whoresons just waiting to cut our throats he asked the fellow whod brought the bad news theyre still working on that the other constable answered some of the forthwegians dont trim their beards enough before they go into disguise so they end up looking fuzzier than we usually do and some of them have that foul accent of theirs when they try and speak algarvian but some of em we wouldnt have so many dead men if they were all easy to spot if you dont know the fellows around you keep an eye on em he sketched a salute and hurried off to spread the news further well thats jolly bembo said cant trust the forthwegians cant trust the kauniansand didnt we do that to ourselves he thoughtand now we cant trust each other either probably just what the stinking rebels wantus blazing us i mean one of the soldiers said bembo wished he could have argued with that but it seemed pretty selfevidently true he would have said so but the algarvians chose that moment to start tossing eggs at the forthwegians just in front of his companions and him hed found out in a hurry that a certain number of such eggs were liable to fall short of where they were aimed he threw himself into a hole some earlier burst had made and hoped none would land on him i hate this he shouted to anybody who would listen but how likely was it that anybody would and even if somebody would how likely was it that he could hear one mans cry of protest through the endless roar of bursting eggs as soon as that roar let up someone shouted forward bembo scrambled to his feet and went forward with the rest of the soldiers and constables he was no hero hed never been a hero but he couldnt bear to have his comrades reckon him a coward would you rather have them reckon you a dead man he asked himself as he advanced the answer was evidently aye because he kept going sometimes saving face counted for as much as saving his neck the houses and blocks of flats ahead had been battered before they were more battered now with smoke and dust rising from them in great clouds broken glass glittered in the streets and on the slates of the sidewalks it could slice right through a boot bembo noticed it as he ran but it was the least of his worries that thunderstorm of eggs hadnt got rid of all the forthwegian fighters up there someone was blazing at the algarvians from a building ahead bembo threw himself flat behind what had been a chimney before it came crashing down in ruin he was used to going after people who tried to get away from him not after men who stood their ground and blazed back no one cared what he was used to he stuck up his head and waited to see where the forthwegians beam came from when he did spot it he blazed and was rewarded with a howl of pain more eggs started bursting ahead bembo hunkered down again every block of eoforwic the algarvians took from the rebels had to get pounded flat before they could be sure of holding on to it forward that hateful shout again forward bembo went cursing under his breath from a doorway twice its natural size somebody stepped out and flung what looked like a cheap sugar bowl the forthwegian fell an instant later blazed by three beams but then the bowl landed among the oncoming algarvians and the burst of sorcerous energy trapped inside flung pottery fragments in all directions something bit bembos leg he yelped and looked down at himself blood trickled along his calf but the leg still bore his weight he ran on toward a doorway when he dashed into the meager shelter it gave he discovered he shared that shelter with oraste im wounded he cried dramatically his old partner glanced down at the cut on his leg go home to mama when this is done oraste said she can kiss it and make it better well i like that bembo struck a heroic posecarefully so as not to expose any of his precious person to lurking foes here i am injured in service to my kingdom and what do i get mockery scorn about what you deserve oraste said ive seen people get hurt worse if they scratch themselves while theyve got a hangnail powers below eat you bembo cried im going to put in for a wound badge when we come off duty youll probably get one too from what ive seen the only way you can keep from getting a wound badge is if you get killedand then they probably give the bastard to your next of kin orastes cynicism knew no bounds before bembo could let out another indignant squawk somebody up ahead yelled forward again oraste left the shelter of the doorway without the least hesitation bembo had to follow him on he ran puffing marveling that the fear of looking bad in front of his comrades once more proved stronger than the fear of death a forthwegians head appeared in a secondstory window bembo blazed at the forthwegian who toppled bembo ran on he had no idea whether the man hed just blazed was a fighter or an innocent bystander he didnt care either the fellow had shown up in the wrong place at the wrong time he had to pay for that if the penalty was death too bad better his than mine or one of my pals bembo thought more forthwegians were holed up in a furniture shop not far ahead no chance they were innocent bystanders they blazed at the oncoming soldiers and constables bembo wasted no time ducking for cover he wasnt ashamed to do it for he was far from the only one doing it then several eggs crashed down around the furniture shop and one right on it surrender an algarvian yelled to the forthwegians still inside you cant win he switched to forthwegian so rudimentary even bembo could follow it coming out hands high you no to kill we one of the forthwegians called back in equally bad algarvian not if you give up right now the soldier answered make it snappy this is your last chance to bembos surprise half a dozen forthwegians did come out of the wrecked shop their faces glum their hands up over their heads when more eggs burst not far away they all flinched not one of them tried to take shelter though they must have been sure the algarvians would blaze them if they did and they were without a doubt right you constables one of the algarvians soldiers said to bembo and oraste you know what to do with captives take these buggers away right bembo grunted as he got to his feet that was something he knew how to do and while im away from the lines ill see how i go about asking for that wound badge too sixteen leudast had served in the unkerlanter army for a long time hed been fighting in the elsung mountains in what was then king swemmel s desultory border war with gyongyos when the derlavaian war first broke out between algarve and most of her neighbors hed been part of the unkerlanter force that gobbled up western forthweg while the redheads were smashing most of king penda s army and hed spent a demon of a lot of time fighting the algarvians himself two leg wounds werent so very much to show for all that hed started out a common soldier with no hope of rising higher and here he was a lieutenant in all those years in the army hed never been particularly eager to go into a fight in fact hed always been happiest during the brief spells of quiet hed found and here he was now forced to stay quiet as he recovered from this second wound well behind the fighting front he hated it he hated every minute he had to lie on his back he hated every minute the healers used to poke and prod at his blazed leg and hated the wise things they muttered back and forth in a language that hardly seemed to be unkerlanter at all when will you let me go he demanded when will you let me get back to my men when will you let me get back to the fighting am i really saying that but he was now at last after so much terror he could begin to smell victory against the algarvians they still fought bravely they still fought cleverlymore cleverly than his own countrymen most of the time but there werent enough of them to hold back the rising unkerlanter tide no matter how bravely and cleverly they fought and having gone through all the black days when the algarvians seemed sure to overwhelm unkerlant leudast wanted to be there to help beat them how much he wanted that amazed him but the healers shook their heads you will not be ready for some weeks lieutenant one of them said and they went on to their next patient alone in his cot leudast quietly laughed to himself the last time hed been wounded down in sulingen his treatment had been a lot rougher than this as soon as he could hobble around theyd put a fresh stick in his hands and thrown him back into the fight of course hed been only a sergeant then even the unkerlanter army took better care of its officers than of its other ranks and sulingen had been as dreadful a struggle as any the war had seen theyd needed everybody they could find but even so he asked the healers again the next day when he could go back to the fight they gave him another evasive answer count your time here as a leave of sorts lieutenant one of them said i dont want this sort of leave leudast said whereupon all the healers looked at him as if he were daft if i get leave i want it to be with my sweetheart they nodded then but they still didnt take him seriously ive got strings to pull he thought im not quite an ordinary lieutenant even if they think i am time to remind them otherwise please get me pen and paper i want to write to marshal rathar and request an immediate return to duty now the healers looked at him as if he might be dangerous cautiously one of them asked how do you know marshal rathar he commissioned me after i captured false king raniero of grelz leudast replied take that the healers didnt seem to know how to take it they put their heads together and muttered among themselves at last one of them said you really are not fit to return to duty yet you know that leg will not support you well all right said leudast who could not disagree with what was obviously true but it doesnt seem to me like you people are doing much to get me back to duty youre just letting me lay here you do need to rest and recuperate you know lieutenant the healer said if i got any more rested id be bored to death leudast returned youre a bunch of mages isnt there anything you can do to send me back faster they put their heads together again leudast hadnt really expected anything else they seemed unable to do anything without consulting among themselves the one who served as their spokesman said you mean use more sorcerous energy to expedite your recovery he sounded faintly scandalized leudast didnt care how he sounded thats just what i mean he said youre healers arent you what the demon good are you if you wont do any real healing they all looked indignant he wanted to laugh they thought that would impress him after all the time hed spent in the field nothing this side of a stick aimed at his face impressed him the fellow who did their talking said i hope you realize we have only so much sorcerous energy to expend aye ive noticed that leudast sounded as sardonic as he could common soldiers get next to nothing officers get as little as you think you can get away with giving fetch me that paper i do need to write to marshal rathar he knew he was being unfair the healers were desperately overworked men but hed told a goodsized chunk of truth too a man who wasnt important or wellconnectedoften the same thingor whose wound wasnt either as easy as possible to treat or in some way interesting got short shrift once upon a time leudast had been a man without connections he wasnt any more though and he intended to keep hitting the healers over the head with such importance as he had till they did what he wanted they knew it too glaring their spokesman said you wish us to give you preferential treatment he might have been a gyongyosian accusing leudast of wanting him to eat goat thats right leudast said cheerfully you do it all the time i want you to do it for me they put their heads together yet again when they separated the man who did the talking said you realize this may cause you some considerable pain leudast shrugged the healers blinked they didnt know what to think of a man whom pain didnt horrify which only went to prove theyd never been up to the front he said how much pain do you think youll get once i tell the marshal you wouldnt treat me even after i asked you to they winced leudast didnt think hed prove able to do much to them but they didnt have to know that plainly they didnt feel like taking chances in their shoes leudast wouldnt have felt like taking any either let us review your case said the one who spoke for them if we find some sorcerous therapy that might help you we shall apply it tomorrow i hope you do leudast said which seemed to him wiser than youd cursed well better then he had another day of waiting flat on his back he would sooner have been in a trench waiting to start an attack which proved how bored he was either that or it does prove ive lost my mind he thought the next morning the healers appeared with a wheeled chair and a couple of muscular attendants who manhandled leudast into it other wounded soldiers stared curiously at him as they took him off the healers had a tent of their own well away from the wounded they attended it was almost alarmingly quiet in there what are you going to do to me leudast asked wondering if browbeating them had been such a good idea after all before any of them answered their attendants hauled leudast out of the wheeled chair and propped him up on a table then the mages draped his legall of it except the area of the woundwith gauze made from a glistening fabric he had never seen before what are you going to do he asked again treat your legor rather the wounded portion of it and no other thus the insulating cloth a healer told him which left him no wiser then the fellow condescended to explain we are going to age the flesh that has been blazed so that being a month older than the rest of you it will also have already healed thats wonderful leudast exclaimed i didnt know you could do such things you will not enjoy it so much while it is happening the healer replied also once the month has passed you would be very wise to have the sorcery reversed i will give you a letter authorizing the reversal hold on to it and do not forget to have the second sorcery done all right leudast said but why the look the healer gave him was anything but cheery because if you fail to have it done if you should forget that flesh will die a month before the rest of youand i promise you it will make your last month alive much less pleasant than it would have been otherwise leudast thought about that he gulped oh he said in a small voice we begin the healer declared he and his colleagues started to chant burning heat coursed through leudasts wound he gasped and tried to jerk away the attendants grabbed him making sure he couldnt move this is what you asked for the healer told him this is what you get and youll enjoy every moment of giving it to me wont you leudast thought but he refused to give the healer the satisfaction of knowing he understood that in a voice as steady as he could make it he said get on with it then the healer eyed him and nodded in reluctant approval before long leudast was panting and trying not to curse or scream the healers hadnt told him he would feel all the pain of a months worth of healing distilled down into the few minutes the sorcery took he clenched his fists the smaller hurts of nails digging into palms and of biting down hard on the inside of his lower lip helped distracta littlefrom the torment in his leg then suddenly that torment eased leudast let out a long astonished sigh of relief the healer said you were brave we do few such procedures where the patient does not cry out i believe it leudast sounded shaky even to himself but the gnawing pain in his leg had eased that was what hed wanted can i put my weight on it you may the healer replied precise as a schoolmaster i hope you canthat was why we performed the sorcery well lets find out leudast swung down off the table one of the attendants whod hauled him up onto it reached out to steady him he waved the man away the leg wasnt perfect but it would do he could use it he nodded to the healers thanks im ready to go back into the line we shall fill out the necessary papers one of them said another very carefully peeled the shining cloth from leudasts leg the healer who was doing the talking went on make sure you have this sorcery reversed in a months time as i said if you forget your last month will be nothing but torment to you i understand leudast said and he did the mere idea of knowing a month ahead of time that he would be dead he shuddered even war against the algarvians seemed clean next to that and he was suddenly more eager than ever to get back to the field if he died in battle at least it would be over fasthe hoped merkela glared at skarnu and at the underground fighter who called himself tytuvenai after the town where he was based she said i dont think you ought to be talking with the algarvians i think you ought to be blazing them oh well do some of that even yet tytuvenai said lightly he winked at skarnu eh pavilosta aye no doubt skarnu answered he glanced over to merkela like it or not we have to talk with them now give me one good reason she snapped they hold the towns they hold the roads if they want to they can start slaughtering valmierans the same way theyve been slaughtering the kaunians from forthweg skarnu said they can do it any time they please merkela winced reluctantly she nodded there is that aye there is tytuvenai agreed if we want to have a kingdom left when this cursed war finally ends we have to walk a little softer than we might like right now and so he nudged skarnu wed better get moving right skarnu said without any great enthusiasm whether he recognized the need or not he wasnt thrilled at the idea of talking with the algarvians either but he kissed merkela and went out to the horses tytuvenai had waiting outside the farmhouse as he mounted and rode off he grumbled why dont the people up in the north handle this themselves they do tytuvenai answered but we have to do our part too as usual he was cheerfully cynical you cant expect those fellows up there to count on their fingers and get the same answer twice running skarnu laughed though he was sure the northern valmierans said the same thing about him and tytuvenai and the other irregulars here in the south he and his comrade rode for about three hours skarnus backside started to hurt he wasnt used to so much equestrianism by the way tytuvenai started grunting every so often skarnu suspected he was feeling it too after a while tytuvenai grunted again this time in relief were supposed to meet the redheads in that apple orchard ahead ive got a flag of truce in the saddlebag here demon of a thing to have to use with the algarvians isnt it its war skarnu answered with a shrug theres nothing dishonorable about it but he was trying to convince himself as much as tytuvenai they tied their horses to a couple of the apple trees skarnu didnt fancy going into the orchard armed with nothing more than a white flag on a little pole if the algarvians grab us theyll be sorry he thought theyve got to know they ii be sorry dont they a tall man in his later middle years stepped out from between a couple of trees he too carried a flag of truce good day gentlemen he said in fluent if accented valmieran and gave the two irregulars a courteous bow i have the honor to be colonel lurcanio administrator of priekule under grand duke ivone and you are tytuvenai tytuvenai said pavilosta skarnu said he eyed lurcanio till now hed had only one brief look at the redhead who was his sisters lover he hoped lurcanio wouldnt recall the name of the hamlet he used as a sobriquet no such luck lurcanios catgreen eyes kindled he bowed again this time to skarnu alone so pleased to meet you at last we have an acquaintance in common i know skarnu said and said no more you may be interested to learn she is expecting a child lurcanio remarked is she skarnu said tonelessly but that wasnt quite enough and so loathing krasta he asked the question he had to ask yours to his surprise the algarvian didnt smirk and nod indeed the fellows voice was cautious as he answered so i have been given to understand what was that supposed to mean before skarnu could askbefore he could even decide whether he ought to asktytuvenai said lets get down to business shall we an excellent suggestion lurcanio said you would be wise to bear in mind that we are still strong enough to punish acts of madness aimed against us we would reckon some of your punishments acts of madness you know skarnu said no doubt one day perhaps we can discuss the role perspective plays in human affairs lurcanio was a cool customer skarnu wondered what krasta saw in him the algarvian resumed we have other business before us at present however so we do tytuvenai said such as making us believe we shouldnt do more to hold up the leyline caravans youre using to ship your soldiers out of here go ahead lurcanio gave him a smile half charming half coldly vicious the people of valmiera will not be happy with the choice you make but go ahead do as you feel you must and we shall do as we feel we must a lot of the people of valmiera will be happy with anything that gets you people out of our kingdom skarnu said anything at all and you know why night and fog that was what the algarvians or their henchmen scrawled on buildings whose occupants had vanished for goodusually into the camps where the redheads kept kaunians they killed the people most intimately concerned with our vengeance will not be happy lurcanio said on that you may rest assured why you tytuvenai began wait skarnu said the other irregular looked at him in some surprise skarnu seldom spoke like a nobleman giving a servant an order that tone more often appeared in krastas mouth here though he made an exceptionand tytuvenai did fall silent you own some glimmering of sense colonel lurcanio said i wonder if you do skarnu answered tell me do you really think algarve still has any hope of winning the war with king mezentio s leadership with our strong sorceries one never knows lurcanio said skarnu laughed in his face he waited for lurcanio to get offended but the algarvian just waited to see what he would say next what he said was do you think algarve has any realistic chance of winning the war lurcanio shrugged one of the elaborate shrugs in which his countrymen delighted after a few heartbeats skarnu realized that was as far as the redhead would go he didnt suppose he could blame lurcaniofor that anyhow he hadnt wanted to talk or even think about valmieras troubles back in the days before algarvian behemoths and dragons leveled his kingdoms hopes you might want to bear one thing in mind skarnu said if you do lose this war your enemies will remember everything you did while you held their kingdoms down how large a price do you want to pay after your armies cant fight any more for once colonel lurcanio had no quick answer no snappy comeback he eyed skarnu with no liking but with wary respect nonetheless there is enough between your ears for sparks to strike is there not he remarked your sister is prettier than you but her head is empty with a shrug of his ownhe didnt want to show lurcanio he agreed with himskarnu said thats also something to talk about some other time but if you start killing valmierans for the sport of it think what will happen when valmieran soldiers march into algarve lurcanio raised an eyebrow and if our best chance to keep valmieran soldiers from ever marching into algarve lies in killing all the valmieran civilians we can lay our hands on this time tytuvenai spoke before skarnu could if you try something like that algarvian youd better be sure you do win can you do that trying and losing anyhow will be worse than not trying at all but colonel lurcanio shook his head by the powers above nothing would be worse than not trying at all he and the two valmierans eyed one another in perfect mutual incomprehension we will not attack leyline caravans taking your soldiers out of valmiera if you dont take our civilians out with you and if you dont start killing them for your magecraft skarnu said if you do everything is fair game and we reckon any caravan bringing your soldiers into valmiera is fair game too that is not right that is not just lurcanio said manymost evenof the men we bring here do not come to fight they come for leave from the fight they have been making in the west theyre still soldiers skarnu said if you give them sticks what will they do start to dance he surprised a laugh out of the algarvian colonel there may perhaps be something to that lurcanio said i speak for myself when i say so however not for grand duke ivone you were an officer you will understand the need for following orders skarnu started to nod tytuvenai broke in saying some orders are wicked no one should follow those anyone who follows an order to murder people deserves whatever happens to him anyone who lets his kingdom lose a war it might win deserves whatever happens to him lurcanio answered they glared at one another once more at a fresh impasse lurcanio said can we agree to anything he asked leave our civilians alone and well let your caravans leave in peace skarnu said we had that bargain before or so i thought lurcanio said so king gainibu hinted at any rate maybe he thought the kings name would fill the valmierans with overwhelming awe and maybe it would have before the war skarnu said these past four years weve been on our own we havent paid much attention to his majestyand thats the fault of you algarvians why should we start over now he hadnt seen colonel lurcanio taken aback till then why because he is your sovereign of course the redheadactually hed gone quite grayreplied hes welcome to reign tytuvenai said why should he rule what has he done for us lately lurcanio wagged a finger at him a very algarvian gesture if we should ever leave this kingdom you will find that he still intends to rule mark my words may you have joy of it he paused i think we have said everything that wants saying he paused again then nodded to skarnu have you any message for your sister i have no sister skarnu said stonily no point even telling her you saw me you take this business altogether too seriously lurcanio said skarnu did not reply the algarvian shrugged it shall be as you wish of course he turned and strode away skarnu started to call something after him but didnt what point to it what was lurcanio but an enemy he might beskarnu thought he was an honest enemy but an enemy he remained skarnu turned to tytuvenai he nodded once lets go he said after a long deep restful nights sleep colonel spinello yawned stretched and finally opened his eyes the mattress was large and soft the house not far outside of eoforwic had he thought belonged to a kaunian before kaunians in forthweg fell on hard times it was ever so much more comfortable than lying down on bare dirt which hed done far too often while escaping the disaster that had overtaken the algarvian armies in northern unkerlant not so bad eh sweetheart he said when jadwigai didnt answer spinello rolled over toward her she wasnt lying in bed beside him either he shrugged no law said she couldnt get up before him though he wouldnt have minded pinning her to that soft resilient mattress just then why not start the day with pleasure when it was all too likely to end in death or some other disaster spinello pulled on his tunic and kilt and ambled out into the kitchen to see what jadwigai had put together for breakfast or what he could some algarviansthe ones whod never gone west to fight in unkerlantcomplained about how miserable things were in forthweg spinello and the others whod been driven out of swemmels kingdom only laughedthey knew better jadwigai spinello called when he didnt see her she didnt answer he shrugged again and went to get himself some food bread and olive oil and wine wasnt his favorite breakfast but it beat the blazes out of bugs and nasty sour berries and swamp water a leaf of paper lay on top of what was left of the loaf of black bread spinello picked it up he hadnt seen jadwigais script before but this couldnt belong to anyone else his own name was written on one side of the paper he turned it over to the other by the time you read this jadwigai had written in classical kaunian i will be gone i do thank you for saving me in the fight and flight through unkerlant i know you did not do it all for my sake but also for your own even so you did it and i am grateful but i also know what happens to kaunians in algarvian hands i know it could happen to me if you get hurt or get tired of me i have learned that kaunians these days have little trouble looking like forthwegians i would rather do that than live the way i have been living even if unkerlant conquers forthweg i would rather do that i do not wish you ill not in your own person i do not wish ill on any of the men of the albarese regiment who still live they could have killed me or kept me to give their bodies relief until i died and they did not but i do not want algarve to win this war i find i cannot forget after all that i am a kaunian farewell shed scrawled her name under the note spinello plucked at his chin beard hed neatened up after returning to civilized company jadwigai had been naive to leave the leaf of paper if he wanted to he could give it to a mage to use the law of contagion to track her through it should i do that he stroked his chin again she wouldnt be happy or anything close to it of course hed enjoyed bedding vanai precisely because she hadnt been happy about it but things would be different with jadwigai hed be breaking a bond of trust if he hauled her back hed never had one with vanai only a bargain her body in exchange for keeping her grandfather from getting worked to death on a road gang jadwigai could have killed him or betrayed him to the unkerlanters more times than he could count and so he was in his own way an honest man there were live ashes in the hearth he got a little fire going and tossed the note into it the paper charred blackened and burst into flames he ate his bread and oil and washed them down with not one mug of wine but two when he walked outside the sentry in front of the house stiffened to attention spinellos resolution wavered a little perhaps under the influence of wine have you seen jadwigai he asked your wench no sir i wouldve remembered the algarvian soldiers eyes lit up as any mans would when he thought of jadwigai i thought she was in there with you you lucky whoreson he didnt need to say it again spinello could read it in his eyes no spinello let it go at that jadwigai would know when sentries went off duty and when they came on if shed timed her disappearance to just before the last fellow went off he wouldnt wonder that she hadnt returned and his replacement wouldnt know she was gone the only risk would have been waking spinello when she got out of bed and if she had wakened him she would have just had to put up with him one more day before trying again is something wrong sir like any algarvian the sentry had a nose for scandal no not a thing spinello lied without hesitation she went off somewhere without telling me thats all thats liable not to be healthy the way things are around here these days the sentry remarked i dont know what youre talking about spinello said dryly the sentry chuckled spinello went on next to unkerlant this is a fornicating walk in the fornicating park the sentry laughed again he wore the ribbon for a frozenmeat medal the decoration king mezentio had given out by the tens of thousands to the men whod come through the first winters fighting in unkerlant spinello had one too smoke rose from eoforwic where the forthwegians still battled desperately to drive back the algarvian armies the unkerlanters across the twegen still stayed quiet though spinello could see distant smoke in the south where swemmels men had forced a bridgehead over the river they werent trying to break out of it yet but the algarvians hadnt been able to crush it either when spinello let himself think about that he worried but he had plenty of other things to worry about too the sentry spelled out one of them are we going back into eoforwic today sir i wouldnt mind a holiday and thats a fact with a chuckle spinello said i wouldnt either old man neither would algarve come to that when the forthwegians and unkerlanters and islanders decide to give us one thoughthats another question so aye well be going back into town i thought you were going to tell me that the corners of the sentrys mouth turned down like so many algarvians he wore his heart on his sleeve id just as soon sit this one out if its all the same to you im going in spinello said i could use the company he and the sentry grinned at each other they were both going in and they both knew it they both hoped they would both come out again when the day was done spinello found himself in charge of a force he would have laughed at if he were throwing it against the unkerlanters a lot of the soldiers he led had sat out most of the war on occupation duty in valmiera they were both older and fatter than they might have been some of them held their sticks as if not quite sure what to do with them but they went forward when he told them to go and he didnt suppose he could ask for more than that he was none too thrilled about going forward himself hed fought block by block house by house in sulingen till he took a beam through the chest hed been lucky in an odd painful way that was early enough in the fight there to let a dragon take him out of the city had he stayed unhurt till the end he wouldnt have come out of sulingen alive eoforwic hadnt been knocked about quite so badly as sulingen not yet most blocks of flats still stood though window frames gaped bare like the eye sockets of countless skulls spinello wasnt so sure he wouldnt rather have seen rubble anyone could be watching from those upper stories they made perfect snipers nests he couldnt read the forthwegian warning whitewashed on walls here and there but he knew about what it said anyone blazes from a building the building gets wrecked and we wont bother clearing out the people who live there first that kind of warning hadnt stopped the sniping but had slowed it down ordinary forthwegians didnt want to be driven from their homes or killed in them any more than anyone else did he wondered how many people in those flats werent forthwegians at all but sorcerously disguised kaunians he wondered if jadwigai had been foolish enough to go into the city or if shed had the sense to flee out into the countryside where she was less likely to get killed and then he remembered that that constable back in gromheort had told him vanai was supposed to have come to eoforwic he laughed to himself he wouldnt recognize her if he saw herhe was sure of that if she looked like a kaunian his countrymen would long since have seized her and if she didnt he wouldnt know her from any other dumpy forthwegian girl even a dumpy forthwegian girl is better than a cold empty bed he thought but then girls forthwegian or kaunian dumpy or elegantly lean slipped out of his mind ahead lay enough rubble to satisfy even the most ambitiously destructive wrecker of all time fan out men he called therell be rebels in there sure as were all missing foreskins he watched the troopers take cover and slowly shook his head no most of them hadnt spent the past three years honing themselves against the unkerlanters even against the forthwegians more would fall than might be true with better soldiers as he ducked behind a tumbledown wall himself a beam charred wood a couple of feet above his head part of a broadsheet still clung to the brickwork a bearded forthwegian strangling a dragon painted in algarvian colors spinello snorted nothing subtle there nothing very interesting either even the unkerlanters turned out better broadsheets eggs started bursting on the rubble now spinello nodded unlike footsoldiers the men who handled eggtossers had to know what they were doing and the unkerlanters as they had for some weeks just kept sitting quietly on the far side of the twegen river spinello thought that was funny he suspected the forthwegians werent laughing forward he called and blew his shiny new officers whistle hed lost the old one in an unkerlanter swamp forward his men went they werent so young or so dashing as the soldiers hed led in unkerlant but they cleared the surviving forthwegians from the wreckage and lost only a couple of men doing it crouched in amongst the reconquered rubble spinello felt proud of them till a question crossed his mind now that weve got it what the demon good is it he shrugged a fancy algarvian shrug if soldiers spent all their time worrying about things like that how would they fight their wars talsu peered down at the road leading toward skrunda from behind a rock most of the way up a low hill another irregular shared the cover of the boulder with him by the powers above its good to have king donalitu back in jelgava back in balvi again the other fellow said its good to have the algarvians getting kicked out of jelgava talsu didnt quite agree with his comrade but didnt want to cause a quarrel either its the same thing near enough the other man said he was older than talsu and leaner with a scar seaming his left cheek he looked like a murderer from what hed said hed been a dyer before the war the skin of his hands still bore strange mottling not quite talsu couldnt let that go unchallenged whats the difference then well when i was in the dungeon the fellow who squeezed me wasnt an algarvian he was as jelgavan as we are hed worked for the king before he worked for the redheads and ill bet he goes back to working for the king once the redheads run away or get beaten some of our troublesll go with emsome but not all people like that interrogator will still be here you cant help people like that the other jelgavan said why not talsu asked because theyre part of the way things work his comrade said you cant get rid of them any more than you can get rid of the pits in olives you can do that talsu said it just takes work he started to add something to that but the other irregular gave him a shot in the ribs with an elbow and pointed west toward skrunda talsus head swung that way a column of algarvian soldiersa couple of regiments worthwas coming east along the road along with three or four behemoths and a motley collection of wagons theyre still moving men forward to fight the lagoans and kuusamans talsu said theyre trying to his companion answered our job is to make sure they dont have an easy time of it how many men were hidden here and there along these hills talsu didnt know how had the irregulars leaders heard the redheads would move soldiers along this road he didnt know that either though he could make guesses he thought good some jelgavans sold out their fellows to the algarvians why shouldnt others sell out the redheads to their countrymen maybe some of the algarvians there were the ones whod seized him when he went with kugu the silversmith for what hed thought would be his introduction to the underground but turned into his introduction to the dungeon talsu knew that was wildly unlikely but hoped it was true just the same do you really need that kind of help to want vengeance he wondered a moment later he shook his head no i dont need it but it would be nice somewhere on a hilltop not far away the irregulars had an eggtosser or two talsu didnt see the first egg fly through the air but he did watch it burst just in front of the algarvian column the next egg better aimed landed among the redheads the burst of sorcerous energy flung men and pieces of men high into the air lets see how they like that by the powers above the jelgavan next to talsu said with a fierce whoop of glee the algarvians of course liked it not at all talsu had been away from real war for close to four years hed forgotten how quickly trained men could reactand he wondered if soldiers from the jelgavan army could ever have reacted so quickly mezentios men spread out even before the third egg hit then they swarmed up the hills on either side of the road blazing as they came talsu stuck his head out from behind his side of the boulder for a quick blaze at the enemy a beam zipped past his own head close enough for him to feel the heat and smell the lightning in the air he ducked back into cover in a hurry over on the other side of the boulder the dyer was cursing some of the bastards blaze while the rest run he complained how are we supposed to blaze at them you werent in the army during the war were you talsu said with a dry chuckle which startled a nod from the other jelgavan thats just one of the chances you take in this business another quick blaze from talsu the algarvian at whom he aimed went down but he didnt know whether hed hit the man like the redhead he dove for the dirt too whenever somebody started blazing at him he turned to his comrade intending to tell him something on the order of thats how its done whatever hed been about to say he didnt the other irregular sprawled bonelessly in the dust blazed through the head blood pooled beneath his body he was still twitching a little but talsu had seen enough men killed to know another one he snapped off another blaze but the algarvians were coming hard and fast before long theyd be on his flank if he didnt fall back keeping the boulder between himself and most of them he scurried back over the crest of the hill he wasnt the only one in full retreat either he didnt think the irregulars leaders had expected mezentios men to hit back so fiercely he wasnt particularly surprised himself the algarvians had always been aggressive even back in the days of the kaunian empire talsu threw himself down behind a bush and watched the crestline aye i still remember a trick or two he thought with somber pride now if one of those cursed redheads forgets and one of mezentios men did he charged over the top of the hill he couldnt have done a better job of exposing himself if hed tried for a week not a smart thing to do talsu thought and blazed him the redhead wore a look of absurd surprise as he crumpled but not all of mezentios men were fools the algarvians couldnt have done nearly so much harm if they had been fools many more of them came over the rise with proper care talsu fell back again and then again he saw more of his comrades who werent so lucky he got away into the deeper hills where the irregulars had been sheltering for a long time the algarvians didnt pursue so hard as they might have some of the raiders were jubilant about that they know better than to stick their noses in here too far one of them said if they tried it theyd be sorry although talsu didnt argue with those bold spirits he didnt think they were right either the redheads had been on their way east to fight the kuusamans and lagoans once theyd broken up this harassing attack wouldnt they get back to their chief business as fast as they could if they had any sense they would and anyone who looked at things with an ounce of sense would see the same thing maybe the irregulars didnt have a whole lot of sense maybe theyd been so starved for victories for so long anything looked bigger than it really was maybe maybe all sorts of things talsu thought laughing at himself whatever the truth was he couldnt do anything about it later that evening the algarvians did something about it or tried to they sent a few dragons over the hills a few eggs came hissing down out of the sky a couple of them burst near the irregulars camps none of them did any harm that raised the jelgavans spirits too hardly even worth being afraid of the stinking algarvians anymore somebody said somebody else nodded several men clapped their hands maybe theyre right talsu thought hopefully a couple of nights later the algarvians showed they still deserved fear the night was very black one of those latesummer nights when the air was so warm so clear so still the stars in the sky hardly twinkled on sentrygo talsu kept staring up at them somewhere between midnight and dawn not long before a replacement was supposed to come and he was supposed to go back to camp he felt something wrong for the first moment or two he didnt know what it was earthquake he wondered jelgava got them from time to time though skrundas neighborhood hadnt been hit hard in his lifetime when the ground quivered beneath his feet he thought at first he was right but the shaking didnt build as an earthquake did it just went on for a while looking back in the direction of the camp he saw purple flashes as if lightning were striking close by but where would lightning come from out of as clear a sky as hed ever seen fear ran through him in the wake of that thought replacement or no replacement he hurried off toward the camp by the time he got there everything was over if it were an earthquake it had struck the irregulars alone their fires were thrown higgledypiggledy a couple of small shrubs burned close by there were rents in the ground from which smoke still rose at first when talsu smelled burnt meat he thought the odor was left over from cooking earlier in the evening then he realized what it was really coming from and his stomach did a slow lurch that was burnt meat all right but some of the burnt meat still shrieked and begged to die that could have been me he thought numbly if i hadnt been out standing sentry that could have been me powers below eat the algarvians someone not far away shouted powers above curse their sorcery talsus stomach lurched again he knew what kind of sorcery mezentios men used people had been whispering about it for a couple of years maybe longer but how are they getting kaunians from forthweg into jelgava he said as much to himself as to anyone else they have trouble moving their own soldiers around this kingdom bitter laughter answered him who says it has to be kaunians from forthweg if they need bodies bad enough they can start pulling people out of skrunda or any other town and bloody well killing them that hadnt occurred to talsu take people out of his home town line them up and kill them to tap their life energy take say his wife his father his mother his sister no he said again largely to himself why not the other surviving irregular said theyre algarvians they hate all kaunic peoples as much as we hate them if they cant get kaunians from forthweg here you think they wont grab jelgavans however much talsu wished he thought that he didnt not down where it mattered we might not have a kingdom left by the time theyre through with us he exclaimed thats why weve got to keep fighting the bastards the other irregular said whatever they do to us may it come back on their heads ten times over a hundred times over talsu said he couldnt get the picture of algarvians seizing his family out of his mind no matter how hard he tried and he tried as hed never tried before in all his days vanai had known fear a good many times in the course of the derlavaian war anyone in forthweg who hadnt known fear surely had something wrong with him this though this was terror and terror she discovered was a very different beast from mere fear i saw him she told saxburh in classical kaunian she held out her hand in the posture of one taking an oath by the powers above i did see him her daughter thought it was funny and laughed the pure clean laugh of a happy baby to vanai it was no laughing matter she knew spinellos stride when she saw it even if the algarvian officer had acquired a slight limp since going off to fight in unkerlant and if that wasnt he leading soldiers up the street past her block of flats her eyes were useless he wouldnt recognize her not when she looked like a forthwegian these days thelberge she thought shivering i can be thelberge and hell never know me of course he might not care either he might blaze her any which way after all the rebels in eoforwic were for the most part forthwegians he might blaze me but hell never bed me again she thought fiercely never by the powers above logically bedding her might bewas almost bound to bethe last thing spinello had in mind at the moment logic had nothing to do with anything though when she remembered the algarvian coming again and again to her grandfathers house in oyngestun and taking her to bed instead of taking brivibas into a labor gang hed known she despised him he hadnt caredor maybe he had for sometimes she thought her resentment only excited him more i want to kill him she thought i want to kill him with my own hands maybe then ill feel clean again there were a good many stories from before the days when the first kaunian kingdom grew into the kaunian empire about ravished women avenging themselves on the men whod abused them brivibas had taught her those tales with scorn in his voice they were legends maybe even myths and not sober history but teach them to her he had legends or not they were part of the underpinnings of kaunianity what made things harder was that she couldnt talk to ealstan about this he knew nothing of spinello and vanai wanted to keep it that way and so whenever he did manage to come home filthy and exhausted she forced the algarvian to the back of her mind but she couldnt force him out of it any more than she could have pretended a bad tooth didnt really ache once after ealstan kissed her goodbye and patted her on the backside and went out to try to cause the redheads more trouble a really horrible thought ran through her mind what if he and spinello come up against each other spinello has all the might of algarve behind him what if he vanai violently shook her head she wouldn t think of thatso she told herself and so of course the thought kept coming back again and again each time more dreadful than the one before she cursed as foully as she knew how if only i hadnt picked the wrong time to look out the window but she had to go into the kitchen and when she went into the kitchen she couldnt very well help looking out the window seeing algarvian soldiers prowling through this part of eoforwic would have been enough of a jolt even without recognizing spinello the forthwegian rebels had securely held it only days before little by little the redheads were pounding the uprising to bits across the twegen river the unkerlanters sat and waited vanai had never thought much about them one way or the other now she hated them had they come to the forthwegians aid eoforwic wouldnt have an algarvian left in it ealstan was surely rightswemmels men were letting the redheads solve their forthwegian problem for them when vanai went into the kitchen again she found she had problems of her own problems in the larder last time shed ventured out shed got as much food as she could carry back now she would have to do it again she went over to the cradle and looked down at saxburh the baby smiled to see her smiled and laughed vanai smiled too but she had to work at it she didnt like the idea of taking saxburh out with her when she sallied forth to get food but she liked leaving her behind even less saxburh might cry every minute till she got back or worse she might not be able to come back taking the baby out was dangerous but so was leaving her behind there were no safe places no safe choices in eoforwic these days vanai scooped the baby out of the cradle come along you little nuisance she said saxburh thought that was very funny vanai unfortunately didnt if she had to carry saxburh that was so much less food she could bring back before setting out she renewed the masking spell on herself and cast it on her daughter on saxburh she could see it take effect the baby looked plumper and a little darker on her ventures out of the house vanai had seen a handful of kaunians bold enough to look like themselves she admired their courage without wanting to imitate it carrying saxburh downstairs was easy carrying her and a lot of groceries back up to the flat would be a lot more work ill worry about that once i get the food vanai thought shed managed before she expected she would be able to do it again she paused inside the lobby near the door to make sure everything was quiet before venturing out algarvian soldiers wouldnt know her for a kaunian now but they or their forthwegian counterparts were liable to blaze anyone who appeared unexpectedly no redheads were in sight when she stepped out onto the street only a couple of forthwegianspeople who looked like forthwegians anyhow just as she did one a woman smiled toward saxburh the other a fighter as unkempt and grimy as ealstan was these days paid neither vanai nor the baby any attention after a quick glance to make sure she wasnt an algarvian satisfied as to that he tramped on down the middle of the street a stick in his hands and ready to blaze no matter how forthwegian vanai looked she couldnt match that display of selfassurance she stayed close to the walls as she hurried toward the market square where shed gone so often before mezentios men seized her and flung her into the kaunian quarter people still bought and sold things there but it was a smaller more furtive place than it had been getting there wasnt quite so simple as it had been either she had to skirt or climb over piles of rubble that had been houses and shops and blocks of flats that would have been easier without carrying saxburh too coming back with food again would be even more delightful you do what you have to do vanai thought you do it and then you think about how you did it one thing at a time thats all worriedlooking forthwegians scurried around the market square getting what they could and cursing the prices they had to pay the people who sold most of them were as hardfaced as the forthwegian fighter vanai had seen several of them had guards with sticks at their backs to make sure they got paid for their goods vanai winced when she heard the prices they were asking thats twice as much for flour as i paid the last time i was here she complained with a shrug the man from whom she was buying said thats on account of i used to have twice as much to sell if you dont want to pay it sweetheart somebody else will he was doubtless right about that vanai paid she did have plenty of silver she paid for cheese and beans and almonds and peas too nothing exciting there only stuff that would keep and could go into easy stews and porridges she wasnt worrying about fancy meals these days only about holding starvation at bay saxburh started to cry when vanai was about halfway back to her block of flats vanai didnt know whether the baby was hungry or wet or just sick of being toted around likequite literallyone more sack of beans she didnt care either she couldnt do anything with saxburh till she got back to the flat not unless she wanted to put all the food down and that was about the last thing she wanted to do in a city at war getting back out of sight was far and away the smartest course she soon found out just how true that was somethingnoting motion in the sky perhapsmade her look up in spite of the constant struggle to keep her feet she gasped in horror flying straight toward her hardly higher than the housetops were half a dozen dragons all of them painted in gaudy crazy patterns of red green and whitealgarvian beasts they carried eggs slung under their bellies vanai shrank back against a wall not that that would have done the slightest bit of good had they decided to flame her or drop those eggs close by but they swept on past so low that their wings kicked dust up from the ground into her eyes without a free hand to rub at them she blinked frantically a moment later eggs burst in the market square the noise smote her ears saxburhs wails grew louder she heard screams behind her too i cant do anything sweetheart vanai said jiggling the baby up and down in the crook of her elbow im just glad we went out early saxburh wasnt glad and didnt care who knew it vanai couldnt do anything about that without slowing down and she wasnt about to slow down for anything or anybody saxburh included getting home was the most important thing she could do shed already had that thought it was especially true now and she did it wailing baby or no wailing baby getting the door to the block of flats open without putting anything down proved another adventure and getting up the stairs another one still but she did what needed doing and she was able to set some of her bundles on the floor in the hallway in front of her flat so she could use a key to open the door that done she hustled groceries inside and closed and barred the door behind her by then saxburh wasnt just red in the face she was a nasty blotchy purple i know vanai said soothingly i know nobody was paying enough attention to you now i can she cuddled the baby and nursed her saxburh settled down and quickly went to sleep vanai wished somebody could calm her down as easily as that she put the grain and nuts and vegetables and cheese in the kitchen cupboards then she turned the tap only a trickle of water came out she said something in classical kaunian that surely would have shocked brivibas then something even more incendiary in forthwegian up till now shed always been able to rely on the water if she couldnt cursing again she put a pot under the tap to catch as much water as it would give where could she get more the fancier parts of eoforwic had a good many fountains this grimy district no she would have to get some from somewhere you could live a lot longer without food than without water the trickle stopped vanai stared in dismay maybe people would repair the mains and the water would come back on again soon maybe they wouldnt and it wouldnt however things turned out she had to do her best if i can she thought if i can marshal rathar could look east across the twegen river and watch eoforwic burn the sight didnt make him unhappynot in the least on that side of the river algarvian soldiers were fighting and dying and using up uncounted eggs and behemoths and sorely needed sacks of cinnabar for their dragons and none of it cost him so much as a single soldier general gurmun was looking east too through a spyglass lowering it he said ive never been one to have much use for delay but ive got to admit that just sitting here serves us pretty well right now it does doesnt it rathar agreed i was thinking the same thing as a matter of fact king swemmel is shrewd no doubt about it that he is gurmun said enthusiastically the redheads could be fighting us street by street in eoforwic can you imagine how expensive that would be instead theyre fighting the forthwegians it saves lots of wear and tear on us and it gets rid of troublemakers we would have had to worry about later on true enough rathar suspectedno he was certainthe forthwegians didnt think of themselves as troublemakers in their own minds they were surely patriots of course what they were in their own minds mattered only so much to rathar he had to look at them as his sovereign would gurmun asked do you know what the king plans to do here in forthweg hes not going to let that son of a whore of a penda come back and king it is he his majesty has not told me what he plans for forthweg rathar said carefully the only order he has given me in that regard is to make no settlement on my own he holds everything in his own hands as a king should do gurmun was one of swemmels men in a way even rathar wasnt hed been a boy not a man when the king came to power and had no standards of comparison whatever swemmel decided was automatically right for him and marshal rathar dared not show he disagreed even if gurmun didnt betray him in the hope of becoming marshal of unkerlant in his place someone else was liable to unkerlantespecially unkerlant under king swemmel ran on betrayals and denunciations what would you do here if you were king gurmun asked watch my back rathar thought aloud he answered im not king i dont want to be king how about you gurmun what would you do how do you like the boot on the other foot gurmun me i dont know anything about running a kingdom i dont much care either gurmun answered as any unkerlanter who wanted to live to a ripe old age had to do all i want is the chance to let my behemoths loose and smash on through the algarvians again he pointed across the river once more and i can see my odds of doing that will be better later on than they are right now he wasnt smooth as a courtier but he got the job done he didnt criticize swemmel and he didnt show ambition at least not of the dangerous sort youll get your wish i expect rathar said weve got that bridgehead over the twegen north of eoforwic and the other one south of the city the algarvians havent a chance of breaking either one of those not with the forthwegians inside eoforwic keeping them so busy thats right gurmun nodded and we can really use the lull to get our supply lines straightened out we outran everything when we chased the algarvians out of unkerlant this summer and the redheads did a cursed good job of sabotaging the ley lines and burning the fields and planting eggs in the roads as they fell back powers above only know how we managed to keep bringing things forward we did it rathar said thats what matters ill tell you something else too id rather manage moving things forward than moving them back i had too much practice doing that the first two years of the war he almost said so out loud but held back he would have told that to general vatran whom he trusted but not to gurmun gurmun was probably a better soldierrathar wondered if even the algarvians had a finer commander of behemothsbut vatran knew a confidence when he heard one while the younger officer didnt strangely or perhaps not so strangely gurmuns thoughts ran on an almost parallel ley line vatrans moving forward down in the south too hes into yanina here and there isnt he i bet king tsavellas is pissing on his pompom shoes picturing that rathar laughed out loud i wouldnt be a bit surprised and were giving the zuwayzin what they deserve gurmun added they should never have caused us so much trouble the last time we fought them youre probably right rathar said if the king hadnt insisted on attacking them before wed made ail our preparations they might not have either that of course was one more thing he couldnt say no one who blamed king swemmel out loud for any of unkerlants shortcomings could look forward to anything save prison or hard labor or things being as they were in this war becoming a sacrificial victim rathar knew he enjoyed no more immunity from that rule than did the lowliest common soldier in the unkerlanter army gurmun said pity weve never bothered going up into the mountains of central ortah and teaching the ortahoin a proper lesson too they deserve it perching up there and trading with both sides and thinking they can just sit out the whole war no now rathar shook his head concentration gurmun we hit whats troubling us the ortahoin arent going to come down out of their mountains and give us a hard time we took enough of a bite out of their kingdom to get men through the lowland swamps we dont need more trouble with them not with two pushes going against the redheads and another one up in zuwayza and the war against the gongs out in the far west gurmun added fair enough lord marshal i see your point getting gurmun to admit that to anyone was no small feat the war against the gongs is like a onelegged fat man walking rathar said its not going anywhere any time soon weve made sure they cant break out of the woods and theyre not really trying any more either their big fight is against the kuusamans in the islands of the bothnian ocean theyre losing that one too gurmun said with somber satisfaction good if they were winning in the island war they would have more energy to put into the fight against us rathar said and the kuusamans and lagoans are really running the algarvians out of jelgava of course they arethe cursed algarvians are fighting us a lot harder than theyre fighting the islanders gurmun said we owe them more than the kuusamans and lagoans do rathar said they know it too and they dont want to pay off look at it from their eyes and their strategy makes pretty good sense gurmun screwed up his face i dont want to look at anything from algarvian eyes powers below eat all the redheads powers below eat em aye rathar said but sometimes you have to try to see things through their eyes if you dont you wont understand what theyre trying to do and youll have a harder time beating them that made gurmun look thoughtful he did want to beat the algarvians rathar could fault him for a few things but never for lack of desire the next interesting question gurmun began before he could say what he thought the next interesting question would be a crystallomancer came running into the headquarters calling marshal rathar marshal rathar im here rathar said what in blazes has gone wrong now by the young mages tone something had sure enough the fellow said sir weve just lost two of the bridges into the bridgehead south of eoforwic we almost lost the third one too what rathar and gurmun said together in identical tones of angry disbelief rathar went on how the demon did the redheads get so fornicating lucky sir it wasnt luck the crystallomancer said theyve got some new sorcery thats letting them really aim some of the eggs they drop from dragons the people down at the bridgehead dont know just how theyre doing it but theyve watched eggs swerve in midair and land on the bridges or right by them in the river marshal rathar spent the next little while cursing algarvian ingenuity then he turned to general gurmun and said we have to let addanz know about this if the redheads can figure out a way to steer dropping eggs our mages can figure out a way to stop them theyd better be able to anyhow gurmun said if they cant king swemmel will find himself a new archmage in one demon of a hurry and addanz will likely find himself down in the cinnabar mines in the mamming hills the kingll squeeze some use out of him anyhow rathar reckoned the commander of behemoths almost surely right swemmel had a low tolerance for failure swemmel come to that had a low tolerance for almost everything rathar and gurmun followed the crystallomancer down the street to the house where he and his comrades worked with rathar in overall command of all of unkerlants fighting fronts the crystallomancers didnt fit into the house where he worked and slept when addanzs image appeared in a crystal rathar explained what had happened the archmage of unkerlant nodded i have heard somewhat of this from the kuusamans he said apparently even mezentios men have trouble doing what they do only a handful of their mages are capable of such rapid kinetic sorcery it may prove a nuisance but no worse if they knock down our last route into that bridgehead itll be a lot worse than a nuisance rathar growled and if you know what mezentios mages are up to why arent you trying to stop it we have already begun work on countermeasures archmage addanz said but these things do take a certain amount of time and he blinked powers above what was that rathar didnt answer him that had been an egg bursting close by close enough to startle him into biting his tongue he tasted blood he and general gurmun dashed out of the crystallomancers headquarters leaving it to the mages to break the etheric connection rathar needed only an instant to see what had happened an egg had burst squarely on the building where hed been living was that one of their steered eggs gurmun asked how should i know rathar trotted toward his headquarters lets see if anyones left alive in there they dont want you left alive gurmun said thats all right rathar told him i dont want them left alive either and im going to get my wish seventeen summer was fading fast in the naantali district fernao had watched that happen before setubal the capital of lagoas and his home town didnt have the best weather in the world not even the most ardent lagoan patriot could have claimed otherwisenot when in peacetime come to balmy balvl broadsheets sprouted like mushrooms on walls and fences every autumn but even setubal looked subtropical when measured against the wastelands of southeastern kuusamo even before nights turned longer than days the grass started going from green to yellow birds began flying north first by ones and twos and then in enormous flocks more and more clouds boiled up from the south so that even when it was daylight gloom held sway more often than not the worsening weather perfectly fit fernaos mood the rattle and scrape and bang of hammers and saws and chisels and other tools as kuusaman construction crews raced to repair the hostel after the algarvians dropped their steerable egg on it did little to improve his spirits either dont worry about a thing ilmarinen told him at supper one evening if they arent ready before the snow starts falling im sure all of us kuusaman mages know the ancient art of building snow houses wed be happy to teach it to you so you can stay as warm and cheerful as we do thank you so much fernao cast about for a word in kuusaman didnt find it and switched to classical kaunian can you quantify exactly how warm and cheerful you will be oh of course ilmarinen said can you provide me with an appropriation to investigate it with all the latest sorcerous techniques fernao took a tiny copper bit from his belt pouch here you are excellent ilmarinen scooped up the coin you may expect your answer in about ten thousand years he laughed uproariously fernao laughed too glum or not he couldnt help it ilmarinen worked hard at being outrageous and was good at what he did whats funny pekka asked as she sat down at the table with them fernao explained pekka gave ilmarinen a severe look snow houses indeed she said when was the last time you made a snow house or herded reindeer like our ancestors day before yesterday he answered as seriously as if it were true noise from down the hall covered fernaos snort and pekkas cough she said ill tell you what worries me all those carpenters im sure the algarvians will have tried to put spies among them hard for an algarvian to look like a kuusaman fernao said that gave him an excuse to look at her and to admire the way she looked when the steerable egg burst by the hostel all hed worried about was whether she was all right the sorcery they were working on hadnt mattered a bit but pekka and ilmarinen both shook their heads plenty of masking sorceries pekka said a good many of them used against the algarvians here and there ilmarinen added speaking with considerable authority he had knowledge and sources for knowledge at which fernao couldnt begin to guess wouldnt be too surprising if they tried to get some of their own back there are ways to look behind such masks im sure fernao said oh aye ilmarinen spoke with authority again anything one mage can figure out how to make another mage can figure out how to break pekka gave her order to a serving girl even as she nodded thats right it leaves me with two worries on my mind that mezentios mages havent done something particularly clever that we dont notice and that we do our checks on all the workmen and dont let any slip past unexamined fernao called for a mug of ale when it came he sipped slowly the ale gave him an excuse to pick at his supper ilmarinen on the other hand ate as if he were stoking a roaring fire rising from his seat just as the girl brought pekkas food he leered down at fernao dont do anything i wouldnt enjoy he said and went off whistling hes a nuisance fernao said one of pekkas eyebrows quirked upward you just noticed she said and applied herself to her chop well you got what you wanted fernao thought you re alone with her or as alone as you can be inside the refectory with a lot of other people eating too now what are you going to say he didnt say anything he couldnt say anything he felt as callow and nervous as he had when a youth calling on a girl for the first time he just sat there still picking at his food sipping the ale and enjoying her company as much as he could after a bit she started talking shop he had no trouble doing that save for the occasional word that like quantify came out in classical kaunian because he couldnt come up with it in kuusaman he called for more ale and for a mouthpuckeringly tart gooseberry pastry so he wouldnt have to get up and leave as ilmarinen had then he left the pastry half eaten when pekka finished her supper faster than hed expected getting to his feet in a hurry wasnt easy or comfortable but he did it anyway pekka noticed of course are you following me she asked sounding somewhere between amused and alarmed i cant very well leave the refectory without following you he answered which had the twin advantages of being true and not requiring him to say aye it also got a smile from pekka who said all right but fernao suddenly bold went on will you come back to my chamber with me what why now pekka definitely sounded alarmed are you planning on stopping more scandal remember what happened the last time we just started someand made our lives more complicated i know fernao said by then they were out in the hall away from the crowd inside the eating chamber come or not however you like im not going to try to molest you i think you know that much if you dont youd better not come he limped on toward his chamber he still hadnt got used to limping he didnt know whyhe was going to limp for the rest of his lifebut he hadnt he looked down at his feet and at the rubber tip to his cane he didnt want to look over his shoulder to see whether pekka was following part of him didnt want to anyhow but he couldnt keep his eyes from sliding toward where she would be if she was and she was he breathed a silent sigh of relief then wondered if he should have he was he knew liable to make things worse not better after opening the door to the bare little room he stood aside to let pekka in before him sit down he said shutting the door behind them make yourself comfortable pekka didnt she stood there in the middle of the floor like a nervous bird that would fly away the instant it saw the slightest motion the comparison fernao feared was liable to be all too apt what is it pekka asked in tones as brittle as her stance what did you need to bring me here to say should we have anything to say to each other that we cant say where everyone can hear i dont know by the powers above i dont but fernao remembered how theyd clung after the algarvian egg burst by the hostel when each had feared the other dead he took a deep breath and went on in a rush by the powers above though i do know that i love you ive never felt like this about any other woman before and im not interested in feeling like this about any other woman ever again there thats all pekka turned and took a long step toward the door fernao thought she was going to flee on the instant if she did what would he do if she did get drunk and stay drunk for a week was the first thing that came to mind but she stopped and turned back so suddenly it was more like a whirl her face was as pale as hed ever seen it why did you have to go and say a thing like that she demanded and she sounded furious because its the truth curse it fernao answered stubbornly hopelessly because i didnt care whether i lived when that egg came down till i saw you were all right if that isnt reason enough what is he sounded angry too and he wasangry at the world that wouldnt let him have what he wanted most pekka stared at him shed gone even whiter and he hadnt thought she could tears glistened in her eyes as they had after shed made love with him that firstand onlytime in a tiny voice hardly more than a whisper she said if i told you i felt the same way what would you do fernaos cane almost slipped from his fingers having hoped for words like those he had trouble believing hed really heard them he also had trouble coming up with an answer almost too late he realized words werent what he needed he did let the cane fall but only because hed taken pekka in his arms he bent down to her at the same time as she was tilting her face up to him not very much later and without another word between them they lay down close together on his bed they had to lie close together the bed was too narrow for anything else pekka sighed as fernao went into her but her eyes were shut then though with what fernao thought a deliberate act of will she opened them and looked up at him from a distance of only a couple of inches and then for a little while fernao stopped thinking at all afterwards he wondered if she would bolt from his chamber as she had the first time theyd surprised themselves by becoming lovers then this time theyd known what they were doing and pekka understood as much for she asked what are we going to do now it was a serious question not the dismayfilled one shed asked after they joined before whatever you like he answered i know youre the one with the hard choices to make you need to know id be glad to marry you and live with you in kajaani or setubal or wherever you please if thats what you want to do i hope it is i dont know pekka said right now i have no idea what im going to do i have to th fernao knew what he was going to do right then and he did it he kissed her that not only kept her from talking it kept herand himfrom thinking for some time longer he hadnt known he could make love twice in such quick succession not in his midthirties and not after the battering his body had taken but no matter how pleasantly worn he and pekka were after gasping their way to delight for a second time pekka asked her question over again what are we going to do now well just have to see fernao said pekka frowned thoughtfully then nodded colonel sabrino had never been in yanina before when the war against unkerlant began hed been stationed in the north flying out of forthweg he wished with all his heart he werent in yanina now had the algarvians and yaninans and grelzers and the soldiers from plegmunds brigade and the phalanx of valmiera been able to halt king swemmel s latest bludgeon of an assault he wouldnt have been in yanina as things were as things were the tattered remnants of his wing of dragonfliers and the equally ragged remains of major scoufas were flying out of a makeshift dragon farm on the outskirts of the town of kastritsi north and west of patras king tsavellas capital the unkerlanters had paused only a couple of miles outside of kastritsi the people there fled east as fast as they could go on foot or in wagons or on unicorns and horses and donkeys they clogged the roads making it harder for the soldiers trying to hold back swemmels men to get where they needed to go some of the men fleeing kastritsi should have been in tsavellas army some of them almost without a doubt were in tsavellas army but had somehow got their hands on civilian clothes when sabrino remarked on that captain orosio nodded next thingll be theyll start running without bothering to take their uniforms off first he spat it wont be long i bet i wish i thought you were wrong sabrino said so what in blazes are we going to do about it the squadron commander asked before answering sabrino looked toward the center of kastritsi the taller buildingsthose still standing anywaysported strangely painted onion domes that reminded him he was in a foreign kingdom he sighed i dont think we can do anything about it except to go on fighting the unkerlanters as hard as we can for as long as we can have you got any better ideas orosio sighed too and spat again i was hoping you did sir youve been right a lot of times before what if i have sabrino said how much good has it done me how much good has it done algarve orosio had no reply for that since sabrino didnt either he didnt see how he could blame the younger man from over by the tents where the dragonfliers sleptwhen they slepta yaninan waved to him he waved back polite as usual then the yaninan waved again more urgently this time captain orosio said sir i think he wants you i think he does too sabrino said with another sigh of his own i was hoping he didnt major scoufas he want to see you the fellow said when sabrino went over to him does he sabrino said and the yaninan dipped his head in his kingdoms gesture of agreement sabrino headed for scoufas tent he had nothing against the yaninan officer scoufas made a good dragonflier and a good wing commander it wasnt his fault that most of his kingdoms fighting men were unenthusiastic and that the kingdom lacked many of the tools it needed to do a proper job of fighting as often happened with commanders scoufas was busy with paperwork when count sabrino ducked into his tent scoufas shoved the leaves of paper aside with every sign of relief i propose that we fly forth and attack the unkerlanters threatening kastritsi he said you do sabrino said in some surprise in all the time hed been associated with the yaninans over in the duchy of grelz hed never heard such words from any of them scoufas flew more than bravely enough but he hadnt been aggressive in seeking out missions but now the yaninan dipped his head aye we must drive the barbarous invaders from the soil of my kingdom if your countrymen had fought harder in unkerlant those barbarous invaders might not be on the soil of your kingdom now but what point to saying that to scoufas he couldnt change what had already happened any more than sabrino himself could and as far as sabrino was concerned helping scoufas defend a yaninan town now made it less likely that hed have to try to keep the unkerlanters from overrunning an algarvian town sometime in the not too indefinite future the mere thought was enough to make him nervously glance eastward scoufas not only noticed him doing it but understood why the yaninans chuckle held more sorrow than mirth it makes a difference when it is ones own kingdom does it not he said aye sabrino said harshly have we got enough eggs and cinnabar to give the unkerlanters a proper pounding not so much as we would like scoufas answered never so much as we would like is it not so he waited for sabrino to nod then went on but we must do what we can with what we haveis that not so as well aye sabrino repeated even more harshly than before when do you want to fly let the dragon handlers load eggs aboard our dragons let them give the beasts what meat they have laced with brimstone and with what cinnabar they can find the yaninan wing commander said an hours time should be plenty would you not agree sabrino rose and bowed i shall be honored to have your company in an hours time major he bowed again then strode out of scoufas tent and shouted for his own men to ready themselves for a raid they came from their tents with an eagerness that still delighted him after five years of fighting how can anyone beat us he thought proudly but if that question didnt have an answer what was he doing fighting here in yanina and not going after the unkerlanters in their own kingdom or relaxing back in trapani following a victorious war yaninans are a lot happier about fighting now that theyre doing it at home arent they colonel one of the dragonfliers said as long as they are happy sabrino saidagain what point to worrying about how things had been before he climbed aboard his dragon while the bushymustached yaninan handler was still feeding it chunks of meat yellow with brimstone or scarlet with cinnabartoo few of the latter though brimstone was easy to come by quicksilver he thought about algarves failure in the land of the ice people and his kingdoms failure to reach the mamming hills then realized he was worrying about what had gone before whether he wanted to or not with a wave the handler unchained the dragon from its stake luck to you good the fellow said in rudimentary algarvian sabrino waved back then booted the dragon into the air it rose with a scream of fury and a thunder of wings other beasts painted in algarvian and in yaninan colors joined it between them they had about forty dragons the raid was a raid sabrino wondered how many hundred hed flown in the course of the war the dragons dropped their eggs on the unkerlanters busy digging themselves in west of kastritsi then swooped low to flame whatever men and beasts they could catch out in the open swemmels soldiers had a good many heavy sticks a couple of yaninan dragons tumbled out of the sky sabrino didnt see any algarvian dragons go down he hoped he hadnt missed anything ill find out after we fly home he thought his dragons flame was shorter than it should have been and faded faster all the algarvian and yaninan animals had the same predicament major scoufas appeared in one of the crystals sabrino carried we have done what we can do i think scoufas said i think youre probably right sabrino agreed we have hurt them scoufas said no doubt of it sabrino said the raid was a pinprick a fleabite nothing more if it delayed the fall of kastritsi by so much as an hour he would have been astonished scoufas was no fool he had to see that too but these days even delays of less than an hour to the relentless unkerlanter advance were not to be sneezed at sabrino spoke into the crystal attuned to his own squadron leaders they pulled their men out of the attack and flew back with the yaninans toward their latest dragon farm no unkerlanter dragons had paid the farm a call while the algarvians and yaninans flew on the attack the bushymustached dragon handler chained sabrinos mount to its stake once more he waved to sabrino as the algarvian wing commander descended from the beast sabrino managed a nod in return not too far away a yaninan crystallomancer trotted up to major scoufas they put their heads together after a moment scoufas jerked as if stung by a wasp he said something loud and pungent in yaninan then abruptly fell silent sabrino wondered what was going on he shrugged it looked to be a purely yaninan concern and he had plenty of troubles of his own with a weary sighflying dragons was by rights a young mans gamehe trudged off to his tent a few minutes later scoufas stuck his head through the flap and said may i come in of course major sabrino said in some surprise he usually visited scoufas rather than the other way round let me get you something wet and strong i thank you but no scoufas replied when i am done you will not care to drink with me i fear i have been honored to fight alongside you your excellencyalways remember that sabrino didnt know just what scoufas meant but didnt like the sound of it have you been transferred that was the most innocuous explanation he could find in a manner of speaking colonelin a manner of speaking scoufas replied my kingdom you might say has been transferred as of earlier today i am informed yanina finds herself in alliance with king swemmel of unkerlant and at war with king mezentio of algarve i am sorry to be the bearer of such news but it is something you must know it certainly is it was also one of the besttimed betrayals sabrino had ever heard of but that was neither here nor there doing his best to gather himself he asked and are you at war with me major scoufas tossed his head no i wish with all my heart that king tsavellas had not done this you algarvians scorn us i know but you did not mistreat our kingdom what swemmel will do it may be better than what he would have done had he taken yanina by conquest so tsavellas hopes me he shrugged i have my doubts and so you and your men may fly off wherever you would i will say i am sorry but i got the order too late to try to stop you good luck colonel sabrino bowed i thank you you are a gentleman would you care to fly with my men believe me you would be most welcome thank you but no scoufas said whatever else i am i am a yaninan i understand major sabrino bowed again what he didnt understand was what would happen nextor rather how anything good for algarve could possibly happen next its another fornicating new kingdom sidroc said as he tramped through a town somewhere in western yanina if this futtering war ever ends and we get back to fornicating forthweg we can set up as fornicating tour guides ceorl barked laughter i like that id go on a fornicating tour any day best kind of tour to go on you ask me he rocked his hips forward and back where in blazes are we anyway sergeant werferth asked this wasnt exactly plegmunds brigade any more it was a collection of men whod got out of the mandelsloh pocket in one piece forthwegians grelzers blonds from the phalanx of valmiera algarvians yaninans the algarvians assumption seemed to be that since theyd managed it when so many hadnt nothing could hurt them now sidroc hoped the assumption was right all right maybe i wont make a tour guide after all he said the unkerlanters use one kind of writing i cant read and the yaninans use another one wherever it is its the arse end of nowhere and the fornicating yaninans are welcome to it so are the unkerlanters if anybody wants to know what i think he and his comrades had spoken forthwegian of course one of the yaninan soldiers asked what you say in algarvian the only language the men who fought for king mezentio had in commonwhen they had any in common at all you say of my country the name many times i wondered what the name of this town wasthats all yiannis sidroc said yiannis looked as if he suspected it wasnt all but he didnt challenge sidroc on it of this town the name is kastritsi he said miserable place aint it ceorl said but in forthwegian before yiannis could ask him what that meant an algarvian soldier pointed to the outskirts of town looktheres a bunch of dragons taking off are those the same bastards who flew over us to give swemmels buggers a hard time a while ago sidroc asked hope so the redhead answered the more the unkerlanters get hit the slower theyll come after us theyre flying off toward the east not back toward the unkerlanters sidroc said in disappointed tones must come from this kingdom then sergeant werferth saidin forthwegian he didnt mention yaninas name so yiannis and his countrymen none of whom knew a word of forthwegian noticed nothing amiss people on the streets of kastritsi stared at the retreating soldiers with big dark round solemn eyes if you re retreating their faces said the unkerlanters will come next they didnt seem to look forward to meeting king swemmel s men a good many of them were getting out of kastritsi while they could sidroc understood that he wanted to get out of kastritsi too and he did get out of the town though the refugees slowed down the couple of regiments worth of men of which he was a part he kept looking anxiously up to the sky if unkerlanter dragons appeared overhead the result would be gruesome but the difficulty when it came came on the road ahead not from out of the sky a company of yaninan soldiers in very clean uniforms that showed theyd seen little action were letting the refugees from kastritsiand from other towns farther westgo through but they spread across the road and the fields to either side when they saw the armed men heading their way their commander a skinny little captain stepped forward and held up his hand palm out like a constable halting traffic at a busy street corner he sounded like one too when he spoke in algarvian you are to halt who of you is the commander that was a pretty good question sidroc wasnt sure anyone would or could answer it he and his comrades were almost as much refugees as the people fleeing kastritsi he had nothing left but his looks to show he was a forthwegianand for the life of him he couldnt imagine why algarvians were kilts to him they were miserable demonically uncomfortable things but the rangy algarvian major who strode out in front of the motley group of men of which sidroc was a part wore his ragged kilt with panache i guess i am he said whats your skirmish line here all about captain it doesnt look what youd call friendly it is not supposed to be friendly the yaninan officer replied yanina is as of today the ally of unkerlant yanina is as of today the enemy of algarve and of all kingdoms allied with algarve you will all of you put your sticks on the grounds and your hands in the air you are our captives oh we are are we the algarvian officer said looking down his nose at the captain whod called for his surrender the yaninan dipped his head plainly confident the redhead would do as he was told but the algarvian had other ideas he turned back to the soldiers he led and shouted come on boyslets take em you want to let em hand us over to the unkerlanters he toppled in the next instant blazed by three yaninans at the same time but nobody whod fought in the west wanted to fall into unkerlanter hands and while sidroc didnt know about anybody else he was cursed if he wanted to surrender to a bunch of yaninans who looked as if theyd never done any real fighting in all their born days he took a blaze at a yaninan who made a pretty clear target the man went down with a howl and sidroc wasnt the only one the veterans whod faced everything swemmels hordes had thrown at them werent about to let a handful of yaninans push them around shouting mezentio they deployed from column into line and rolled over tsavellas men some of them did fall but not very manythe yaninans whod been sent out to stop them didnt really seem to believe till too late that they would fight back it was all over in a couple of minutes of the yaninans who didnt get blazed some fled and rather more threw their hands high and gave up sidroc laughed as he collected the stick from one of those why did they think wed give up he said its all theyre good for themselves that may well be why a blond from the phalanx of valmiera said but what do we do now that yanina has turned against us it is not just this one company it is the whole cursed kingdom sidroc hadnt thought of that are we going to have to fight our way through this whole cursed kingdom like you said who knows the valmieran shrugged i will say this i would sooner fight yaninans than unkerlanters any day sidroc nodded the fellow from the phalanx might be nothing but a fornicating kaunian but he wasnt a stupid fornicating kaunian with the algarvian major dead the highestranking officer left on his feet was a lieutenant who had to be a couple of years younger than sidroc when he called out crystallomancer his voice broke and squeaked like a youths did they have a crystallomancer with them sidroc wouldnt have bet on it but one of the valmierans stepped forward aye sir he said his blond hair seemed to startle the lieutenant but the officer told him see if you can find out where theres a garrison we can attach ourselves to the man from the phalanx of valmiera saluted and went about his business the algarvian lieutenant raised his voiceand kept it from cracking all you yaninans whove been with us you have a choice you can stay with us and go on fighting swemmel or you can lay down your sticks and your packs and walk away from the war right now a couple of dozen men whod fought in unkerlant did walk away sidroc wondered what he would have done had someone offered him the same choice id stay he thought nobody made me sign up for plegmunds brigade i did it myself and most of the yaninans stayed too wed better keep an eye on them sergeant werferth murmured in forthwegian no telling what theyll do if they have to keep blazing at their own people the crystallomancer said sir we have forces toward the southeast about ten miles from here well head that way then the algarvian lieutenant said a moment later he asked did they say whats going on in patras it lies in that direction too theres fighting there sir the crystallomancer replied theres fighting all over yanina as best i can tell how are we supposed to hold off the unkerlanters if weve got these yaninan whoresons nipping our ankles at the same time sidroc asked ceorl said we kick em in the balls a few times theyll stop biting hope so sidroc said along with his comrades he started trudging toward that other force loyal to mezentio hed been retreating before now he was retreating through hostile country he knew the difference unkerlant had taught it to him movement now could turn into battle without warning if a couple of regiments of yaninans came over that low hill they didnt along the road a few men loyal to tsavellas blazed at sidroc and his comrades from whatever cover they could find methodically the algarvians and forthwegians and valmierans and the yaninans whod stayed with mezentios men hunted them down and killed them when they marched through a village people called out in broken algarvian save us from unkerlanters they didnt know their sovereign had chosen the strategic moment to change sides youd better get the blazes out of here sidroc called back those bastards will come and eat you for breakfast someone translated that into gurgling yaninan the villagers exclaimed in horror some of them started fleeing east with no more than the clothes on their backs curse it keep your fool mouth shut sergeant werferth snapped now those miserable yaninans will clog the roads for everybody else sorry sergeant but sidroc wasnt sorry he had all he could do to keep from laughing out loud as he left the yaninan village he nudged ceorl didnt they look like a flock of spooked chickens sure did ceorl said after another few paces he added youre not such a bad son of a whore after all thanks you too sidroc grinned ceorl grinned back in forthweg hed been a ruffian a robber probably a murderer here he was a comrade sidroc didnt worry about what he did in his spare time and ceorl evidently had at last forgiven him for not being rough enough just after sunset they joined up with the algarvian brigade the crystallomancer had found sidroc wasnt far from the lieutenant who led his group when that worthy asked the colonel in charge of the brigade sir what are we going to do now what can we do now fall back the colonel answered theres higher ground farther east they wont have such an easy time pushing us off it we have to hold there nothing but algarve behind the lieutenant nodded earnestly sidroc nodded too in a different way the lieutenant thought everything would be all right once they got to the high ground wherever it was sidroc had done enough retreating by now to doubt whether everything would ever be all right again pekka had had to beg the seven princes to get a few days leave from the sorcerous project in the naantali district shed put raahe and alkio jointly in charge while she was away they were solid and steady not given to wild adventurism shed also advised them to smack umarinen over the head with a rock when and as needed getting from the naantali district back down to kajaani was an adventure in and of itself the carriage ride from the hostel to the nearest leyline terminal was long and bumpy then thanks to the way the earths energy grid in that part of the world ran she had to go around three sides of a rectangle before finally heading south to her home town and she did every bit of it with a smile on her face which wasnt like her small inconveniences didnt bother her while larger ones seemed small this is what falling in love does she thought i remember i didnt think id ever feel this way again but i do it wasnt that shed stopped loving leino that made what she felt for fernao seem stranger but didnt make it go away leino was far away in time and space while fernao her whole body felt warm when she thought about fernao though the kuusaman landscape outside looked as bleak and chilly as it always did in autumn the leyline caravan glided over the last low hills and down toward the harbor of kajaani coming up on kajaani the tickettaker said as he strode through the carsas if anyone could doubt where this particular caravan was going coming up on kajaani the end of the line he addedas if anyone seeing the gray whitecapflecked ocean ahead could doubt that either grabbing her carpetbag from the rack above her seat pekka was among the first out the door when the caravan halted under the steep roof of the depot there stood her sister elimaki waving and there beside elimaki was uto pekka squealed and her son ran to her and squeezed the breath out of her powers above how big youve got she said i am big he answered im nine he picked up the carpetbag shed dropped to hug him i can carry this he said importantly and he was right nine pekka thought a little dazed but he was also right about that of course hed been four when the derlavaian war started the world had spent more than half his lifetime tearing itself to pieces pekka had thought she would tear herself to pieces too with guilt when she saw her son but that didnt happen either she still loved him as unreservedly as ever aye seeing him reminded her of leino but it wasnt that she didnt love leino it really isnt she though as if someone had insisted that she didnt she felt as if she loved everybodyexcept the algarvians them she still hated with a hatred whose cold viciousness astonished her whenever she paused to look at it she didnt have to look at it for long because here came elimaki behind uto good to see you again pekkas sister said as the two of them embraced and kissed each other on the cheek its been too long its always much too long between your visits im busy pekka mimed exhaustion and falling to pieces to show how busy she was laughing elimaki said you must be doing something important when pekka didnt answer right away her sister nodded to herself i know lots of people who dont talk about what theyre doing these days i cant talk about what im doing pekka said elimaki nodded again thats what they all say come on lets get up to the houses theyd lived side by side for years its getting dark of course it is pekka said kajaani lay even farther south than the naantali district which meant fall and winter here were even darker and gloomier as they hurried out of the depot she asked how is olavin it was she thought a harmless question elimakis husband wore uniform aye but hed been a banker before the war and was a paymaster nowadayshe came nowhere closer to battle than yliharma pekka was astonished when her sister stopped in her tracks and spoke in a low toneless voice oh you must not have got my last letter yet i never get them as fast as you think i should pekka answered they always read them and scratch things out first whats happened voice still flat elimaki said hes taken up with one of his pretty little clerks thats what he wants to leave our solicitors are snapping at each other oh no pekka exclaimed oh aye elimaki smiled wryly i doubt ill ever see him again right now i hope i dont he always thought he was too big for a provincial town like kajaani now he gets to try his luck in the capital and on someone else or maybe on a lot of someone elses he is sending me money for the house hes always been scrupulous about money other things pekkas sister shrugged and how are you i dont know i think im stunned pekka had intended to unburden herself to elimaki if she couldnt talk about men and life and love with her own sister with whom could she the answer to that looked to be no one uncle olavin is a louse uto said elimaki laughed a harsh laugh ive called him a lot worse than that but i try not to do it where uto can hear he picks up enough bad language without learning it from me uto looked proud when his aunt said that pekka had to stifle a giggle uto had always delighted in the mischief he caused they took the local leyline caravan to the stop where pekka had got out so often on her way home from kajaani city college then they walked up the hill to the lane with her house and elimakis beside it by then full darkness had fallen lights were few and far between pekka worried more about slipping and turning an ankle than about footpads robbers were few and far between in kajaani an advantage to provincial towns though kuusamans generally were lawabiding folk elimakis house lay closer to the opening of the lane than did pekkas why dont you come in with me her sister said ill fix some supper and something for both of us to drink and we can go on from there that sounds wonderful pekka said whats wonderful is to see you elimaki answered now i have someone i can let my hair down to she sighed im jealous of you and leino isnt that terrible pekkas ears heated not really she changed the subject in a hurry ill help in the kitchen elimaki didnt let her do much but she did fix them both stiff drinks uto hung around while the halibut steaks cooked he stared wideeyed at his mother all through supper elimaki these days surely felt more like a mother to him than pekka after supper though he hurried off to play before long a horrible crash came from a back room what was that elimaki called as she and pekka carried dishes back to the kitchen to wash them nothing uto answered sweetly pekka snickered she knew that tone altogether too well she and elimaki had a couple of more drinks while they did the dishes and they took more brandy out to the parlor eventually elimaki called uto and told him to go to bed he sent pekka the look of appeal she knew too well and hadnt seen in too long do i have to mother is this the time you usually go to sleep pekka asked powers above i dont even know reluctantly uto noddedelimaki would give him the lie if he did anything else then you do pekka told him but come give me a kiss first he ran to her they clung to each other then with less fuss than shed expected he went off to the back of the house pekka glanced over to elimaki hes growing up she emptied her glass ayewhen he feels like it her sister said hes probably reading under the covers for a while sometimes i let him get away with that elimaki drained her glass too then poured it full again and filled pekkas with it you havent said two words about yourself since you got off the caravan car well discretion warred with brandy for the moment discretion won pekka said there are a lot of things i cant talk about she could hear the beginning of a slur in her words brandy hadnt lost by much i know that elimaki said impatiently i dont care about what you do i wouldnt understand most of it anywayim no mage i want to know how you are do you pekka said her sister nodded the motion exaggerated enough to show shed had a good deal to drink too do you pekka repeated elimaki nodded again and pekka surprising herself even as the words poured out told her silence stretched and stretched after she finished i shouldnt have done that she thought and blamed the brandy but it wasnt just the brandy and she knew it one of the reasons shed come home was to talk with elimaki about fernao now shed done it if only olavin hadnt chosen the most inconvenient possible time to take up with someone else too at last elimaki said i dont know what to say i never expected anything like thisfrom olavin or from you especially from you i think i didnt really expect it either pekka said and knocked back the brandy elimaki had poured her it just happened these things do sometimes i know i ought to know elimakis face twisted she paused again then asked what are you going to do what are you going to tell leino i dont know pekka answered i just dont know i havent the faintest idea in the world ill cross that ice when i come to it i didnt expect it of you elimaki said again if anybody in the family was going to go off and take a lover i thought it would be me here i was sitting at home by myselfexcept for uto and thats a pretty big except but i sat here i was lonely but it wasnt that bad and now this her goggleeyed look also came only in part from the brandy i know but pekka stopped unsure how to go on her sister held up a hand never mind your face says it all if i doused every one of the lamps youd still glow does it would i pekka asked very solemnly indeed elimaki nodded so did pekka well its the truth its how i feel i know its not the way im supposed to feel but i do i dont know whether to be green with envy of you or to want to hit you over the head with a brick elimaki said these things usually dont have happy endings you know of course i know pekka said at least we arent algarvic people where they go to knives sometimes instead of solicitors and then even before her sister could say anything she remembered fernao was of algarvic blood that gave her something brand new to worry about as if i didnt have enough she thought behind garivaldwho was getting used to thinking of himself as fariulf lay the twegen river behind him also lay a good many artificers frantically repairing the bridges over the twegen the algarvians had knocked down with their sorcerously guided eggs ahead of him to the east were the rest of forthweg and all the redheads trying to keep his countrymen and him from taking any more of it to the north smoke rose from the burning city of eoforwic garivald supposed the algarvians could have given this bridgehead even more trouble than they had if they werent trying to put down the rebellious forthwegians in their capital that didnt mean mezentios men were idle here garivald wished it would have eggs started bursting not far away they were of the plain ordinary unsteered variety but if one burst in the hole where he crouched it would kill him just as dead as the fanciest product of inventive algarvian sorcery the eggs kicked up great choking clouds of brown dust coughing a little garivald marveled at that down in the duchy of grelz it would have been raining nowthe fall mud timewith snow on the way here rain fell mostly in the late fall and winter and snow was uncommon so hed been told anyhow he had trouble believing it but it looked to be true stay alert lieutenant andelot shouted they like to attack after they plaster us with eggs they think thats an efficient way to do things our job is to show em theyre wrong thats right garivald said from what hed seen of algarvian soldiers they were alarmingly efficient but he had to back up his officer that was part of what being a corporal was about and he spoke the absolute truth when he added weve got to hold on to this bridgehead no matter what a moment later somebody else let out a frightened yell here they come garivald quickly looked every which way there were the kilted algarvians loping forward some of them shouted mezentio as they ran they still acted as much like worldbeaters as they had when they overran his home village of zossen true theyd been driven out of unkerlant but that didnt seem to be because they were bad soldiers only because there werent quite enough of them to overwhelm the larger kingdom every which way also included behind garivald hed learned as an irregular to know where he would retreat before he had to fall back hed had that lesson brutally reinforced in swemmels regular army too a soldier who didnt think ahead wouldnt get many chances to think at all mezentio aye the redheads still knew their business as soon as the unkerlanters started blazing at them some of them dove for cover and blazed back others scrambled forward then they flopped down in turn while the troopers in back of them ran past them and toward the unkerlanter front line get up there curse it garivald yelled at a soldier too deep in his hole to fight youve got a better chance if you blaze at them too the soldier couldnt have been older than sixteen hed had his father yelling at him back in his home village not an underofficer with all the savage weight of king swemmel s army behind him his father losing his temper might beat him a corporal losing his temper could do or cause to be done far worse than that garivald didnt think he could ever make himself give a man over to the inspectors for sacrifice but the youngster didnt need to know that and his curses did what they were supposed to do they got the kid up and fighting he might want to blaze garivald along with or instead of the algarvians but he was blazing at them garivald blazed at one of them too the fellow kept running so he must have missed he cursed again this time at himself he looked back over his shoulder if the redheads kept coming hed have to scurry back toward that next hiding place he hoped no one else had marked itit wouldnt hide a pair of men just as he was about to jump out of his hole and fall back what seemed like all the eggs in the world descended on the algarvians the unkerlanters had moved a lot of eggtossers into the bridgehead a crystallomancer must have reached the men who served them and the efficient way they responded would have warmed king swemmel s heartassuming anything could whatever such efficiency would have done to swemmels heart it wreaked havoc on the algarvians their onslaught petered out smashed under a blizzard of bursts of sorcerous energy the ground shook under garivalds feetnot as it would have when one side or the other started sacrificing but simply because so many eggs were coming down close to him take that you whoresons lieutenant andelot screamed at the redheads he was only a youngster himself this probably seemed like a great lark to him we ought to go after the stinking buggers somebody said but youngster or not andelot knew how to follow orders no he said for the time being were just supposed to hold this bridgehead when do we break out sir the soldier asked when the generals tell us to andelot answered garivald found himself nodding sure enough that was how things worked once driven off the algarvians didnt resume their attack from what the handful of surviving oldtimers garivald had talked with said that was a change from the earlier days of the war mezentios men didnt have the reserves of strength theyd once enjoyed as far as he was concerned they were quite bad enough as they were andelot came over to him whats up sir he asked cautiously he didnt like drawing official attention to himself dont worry fariulfyoure not in trouble andelot said which did nothing to keep garivald from worrying i just wanted to say you did a good job of handling that fellow who wasnt blazing at the redheads oh garivald said thank you sir i think youve got the makings of a good soldiera fine soldier even andelot said would you like to move up in the army you might be an officer by the time the war ends wouldnt surprise me a bit garivald wanted to become an officer about as much as he wanted an extra head sir i dont have my letters he said thinking that would dispose of that ill teach you if you like andelot offered would you garivald stared nobody ever said anything like that to me before sir my village didnt even have a school the firstman there could read and maybe a few other people but not that many id give a lot sir to be able to read and write could write down my songs i could make them better i could make them last forever it would be my pleasure andelot said the more men who do know how to read and write the more efficient a kingdom unkerlant becomes wouldnt you say thats so corporal aye sir garivald replied new thoughts crowded in on the heels of his first excitement if i do write my songs down i have to be careful if the inspectors find them theyll know who i really am and if they know who i really am im in a lot of trouble he didnt show what he was thinking showing your thoughts could and often did prove deadly dangerous in unkerlant he did his best to look interested and attentive when andelot pulled a scrap of paper a pen and a bottle of ink from his belt pouch he wrote something on the paper in big letters heres your namefariulf fariulf garivald repeated dutifully wondering what his real name looked like he didnt ask if he ever got the hang of this writing business hed figure it out for himself thats right andelot smiled and nodded its not hard reallyall the characters always have the same sound so you just have to remember which sound each character makes see you have an f sound at each end of your name those both say f garivald asked andelot nodded garivald scratched his head why dont they look the same then ah lieutenant andelot said you use this formthe royal form people call itfor the first one because its the first letter of a name youd do the same thing if it were the first letter of a sentence the rest of the time you use small letters why garivald asked andelot started to answer then stopped chuckled and shrugged he looked very young in that moment i dont know why corporal its just how we do things its how weve always done them so far as i know oh garivald shrugged too rules didnt have to make sense to be rules anyone whod lived under king swemmel understood that perfectly well all right you make the one kind of mark forwhat did you say sir for the first letter of a name or the first letter of a sentence andelot repeated patiently thanks ill remember now and garivald thought he would not least because he couldnt read or write he had a very good memory to his surprise lieutenant andelot thrust the pen at him he recoiled from it almost as if it were a knife here take it andelot said write your own name go aheadyou can do it just copy what i did when garivald held the pen as if it were a knife andelot showed him a better way brow furrowed in concentration he made marks on the paper doing his best to imitate what the officer had written there he said at last does that say fariulf he nearly made the mistake of using his real name he might get away with that mistake once on the other hand he might not aye it does andelot beamed at him so he must have done it right the officer started to write again then stopped and fumbled in his belt pouch till he found a bigger leaf of paper he wrote a lot of characters on it these are the royal form and the regular form of all the letters in the right order do you know the childrens rhyme that helps you remember the order and the way each letter sounds no sir garivald said simply andelot sighed you really must have lived in the back of beyond garivald shrugged again he probably had andelot taught him the rhyme which had a catchy little tune he learned it quickly enough to please the lieutenant thats good andelot said thats very good here let me give you more paper you can have that pen too and heres a bottle of ink go practice shaping the letters and keep saying the rhyme so you know what each one sounds like in a couple of days ill show you how to read more things too thank you sir garivald said he went back to his own hole his head as full of that childrens rhyme as it had ever been with his own songs he wrote the alphabet several times reciting the rhyme as he wielded the pen thenfirst looking around to make sure no one could see himhe wrote garivald as best he could being certain to use the royal form of the g and then he crumpled up that leaf of paper and threw it in the closest fire he let out a small sigh of relief as he watched it burn in swemmels kingdom no one could be too careful fariulf he was and fariulf he would have to remain istvan raised an axe and brought it down on a chunk of firewood the chunk split into two smaller chunks the kuusaman guards who watched the woodcutting detail stayed very alertaxes were real weapons a few feet from istvan kun was chopping away too anyone can tell you didnt grow up cutting wood istvan said i do it well enough kun was touchy about everything that had got him into trouble with the guards at the captives camp a couple of times it would have been worse trouble if he hadnt managed to talk his way out of most of it i didnt say you didnt istvan answered ill say that szonyi told kun with a grin you dont cut as much wood as the sergeant or i do not even close youre both twice my size kun saidan exaggeration but not an enormous one by gyongyosian standards he was on the scrawny side even so istvan shook his head wed still do more even if we were your size or you were ours anybody can see that you waste motion if i were an unkerlanter youd complain i wasnt efficient enough kun said if you were an unkerlanter youd still be a lousy woodcutter szonyi said by the stars youd be a lousy woodcutter if you were an algarvian algarvians kun said and chopped away at the wood scattered before him with great spirit if not with great efficiency theyre strange people szonyi paused for a moment to wipe sweat from his face with a tunic sleeve like most early autumn days on the island of obuda this one was cool and misty but cutting wood was plenty of work to keep a man warm even the one who speaks our language is strange and the other three he rolled his eyes theyre even worse makes you wonder why we ever allied with them istvan said leaning on his axe theyre foreign kun laughed of course theyre foreign theyre foreigners by the stars did you expect them to be just like us actually istvan had expected something like that the only foreigners with whom hed had any experience up to now were unkerlanter and kuusaman enemiesand trying to kill one another hadnt proved the best way to strike up an acquaintanceand the natives of obuda whom he reckoned contemptible because they bowed down to whoever occupied their island he said i expected them to be more like us than they are ill tell you that why kun asked because were on the same side of course istvan answered szonyi nodded vigorous agreement were on the same side as the naked black zuwayzin too kun said do you think theyll be just like us istvan had trouble believing there really were people with black skins who ran around with no clothes on all the time it sounded like one of the stories big boys told their little brothers so those little brothers would look like fools when they repeated them to their parents he said ive never seen a zuwayzi and neither have you and we werent talking about them we were talking about algarvians aye but you were saying that foreigners shouldnt kun began no to talk a guard shouted in bad gyongyosian to work to chop with something close to relief istvan went back to cutting wood kun had a way of twisting things till they seemed upside down and inside out the former mages apprentice got back to work too but he didnt stop talking he never does istvan thought which wasnt quite fair kun continued foreigners shouldnt be different from us if were going to ally with them i think thats a silly notion no to talk the kuusaman guard yelled again this time kun did shut upfor a while after what seemed like forever the woodchopping detail finished its work the kuusamans carefully counted the axes before sending the captives back to their barracks istvan didnt know how anyone could hope to sneak an axe away but the guards took no chances in the barracks captain frigyes and borsos the dowser and the algarvian who spoke gyongyosianhis name was norandino which struck istvan as a thoroughly barbarous appellationhad their heads together istvan didnt like that both frigyes and from what hed been able to see algarvians in general were much too fond of blood sacrifice and the sorcerous power that sprang from it to suit him by the way frigyes looked up in alarm he and borsos and norandino had been plotting something whether it had to do with cutting some large number of gyongyosian throats here istvan didnt know he hoped he wouldnt ever have to find out norandino said something in questioning tones too low for istvan to make out the words frigyes answered a little more loudly oh aye theyre reliable enough nothing to worry about with them istvan knew he should have felt reassured complimented even flattered what he felt instead was something a man not from a selfstyled warrior race would unquestionably have called fear he had too good a notion of what sort of bloody thoughts went through his company commanders mind szonyi and the rest of the woodcutters went to their cots and relaxed without the slightest worryall save kun who caught istvans eye kun didnt say anything he hardly changed expression but istvan knew they were thinking the same thing and that it appalled them both norandinos laugh rang out it filled the barracks hall how could anyone who talked of slaughter sound so cheerful about it istvan didnt know but the redhead certainly seemed to manage and it wasnt a laugh of anticipation of someone elses trouble as might have come from a gyongyosian by the sound of it norandino knew his own neck might be on the line he not only knew he thought that was part of the joke or maybe im imagining things istvan thought as he lay down on his own cot he stared up at the boards of the ceiling and tried to make himself believe it he couldnt why would frigyes and a mage of sorts and an algarvian talk together if not for purposes of sorcery and sacrifice reliable captain frigyes thinks im reliable am i that he could even ask himself the question left him startled if i thought he could really do something to win the war for gyongyos i might not feel the same but he cant hurt anything but obuda and the fightings moved a long way from here which meant istvan knew what it meant he knew but he shied away from following the thought where it had to lead he glanced over toward kun who sprawled a couple of cots away kun was looking in his direction too istvan jerked his eyes away as if hed caught the other man doing something disgusting but he hadnt the disgust was all in his own mind with much of it aimed at himself kun didnt shy away from logic kun would know the choice perfectly wellwould know it and know what to make of it either you let your throat be cutor if you were lucky your friends throatsor you let the kuusamans know what was brewing istvan saw no middle ground hed talked about such matters talking about them he discovered was one thing actually nerving himself to speak to a guard that was something else again if i do it i can never go back if i do it i can probably never set eyes on another gyongyosian as long as i live but that wasnt it or wasnt the biggest part of it anyway if i do it will the stars still shine on me or will they cast me into eternal blackness once i die then borsos said something loud enough for himand for the whole barracksto hear no by the stars ill have no part of it the dowser sprang to his feet and hurried out of the building istvan let out a loud long sigh of relief he didnt care who heard him not right then he didnt the stars be praised blazed through his mind theyve arranged things so i dont have to betray my countrymen truly they are as kindly as people say even his cot all at once felt more comfortable than it had but he soon discovered the stars intended other things than keeping him happy captain frigyes called come over here a moment sergeant istvan sir istvan said his heart sinking he would sooner have gone into battle again in the trackless forests of western unkerlant than climb to his feet and walk over to the corner of the barracks hall where frigyes and norandino the algarvian sat captain frigyes nodded to him in a friendly way which only worried him more now sergeant the company commander said ive been telling norandino here that youre a man with good sense he has indeed his praise of you would make the stars blush in the sky norandino said that praise made istvan blush so did the redheads whole manner of speaking gyongyosian was a language in which a man said what he meant and had done the algarvian turned it into something that sounded flowery and unnatural when istvan merely stood mute frigyes pressed ahead youve said you know major borsos havent you he knew perfectly well istvan had said that istvan couldnt deny it now however much he wanted to aye sir he said unhappily and said no more captain frigyes beamed at him splendid he sounded almost as flowery as norandino then you wont mind talking him into seeing whats good sense will you i dont know sir istvan answered more unhappily still i really dont know what youre talking about sir that was a great thumping lie but how he wished it were the truth we want to do to kuusamo all we canis that not true norandino said and we see only one way of doing anything at all to kuusamo on this miserable little island is that not also true he made everything he said seem not only true but obvious istvan had his doubts about what was true to him nothing seemed obvious except that frigyes was daft daft or not frigyes was also his superior and so instead of saying what he thought he just shrugged norandino looked disappointed oh my dear fellow he began as if he were istvans close kin ill handle this frigyes broke in he aimed a forefinger at istvan as if it were a stick you swore an oath are you ready to live up to it or not answer me straight out sergeant sir i wasnt a captive then stowed away where i couldnt do ekrekek arpad or gyongyos any good istvan said frigyes eyed him with cold contempt begone oathbreaker believe me i can find someone else to make borsos see what needs seeing do what needs doing and as for you sergeant as for you may the stars forget you as you have forgotten them istvan stumbled away shame and joy warring in his heart eighteen a sharp peremptory knock on the bedchamber door woke krasta in the middle of the night who is it she asked muzzily though only one person was likely to presume on her so and even he had his nerve waking her out of a sound sleep sure enough colonel lurcanio spoke from the hallway i am a commercial traveler milady can i interest you in a new laundry soap with a snort krasta got out of bed and walked to the door the waistband of her pyjama trousers was getting tight her belly had finally started to bulge before long she would have to start wearing a larger sizeand then do it again and again until i finally have this baby she thought with more than a little annoyance shed opened the door before she realized she could have told lurcanio to go to the powers below if he suddenly took it into his head to want her at whatever ghastly hour this was she was ready to give herself to him no matter how much she might resent it later till she knew him shed never imagined a man could intimidate her so no one else had ever come close there he stood in full uniform from boots to jaunty hat complete with jaunty plume instead of taking her in his arms he swept off the hat and bowed goodbye my sweet and as much good fortune to you as you deserve or perhaps even a little over that because of you i have enjoyed priekule a good deal more than i thought i would he bowed again krasta swallowed a yawn instead of yielding to it another measure of how much of an edge lurcanio had on her her wits were still working slower than they might have whether she showed the yawn or not what do you mean goodbye she asked lurcanio smiled what most people mean when they use the word farewell is a synonym i believe but his amusement slipped then and he defined himself more precisely i mean that i am leaving priekule i mean that algarve is leaving priekule perhaps i will come back one day if the fortunes of war permit youre leaving krasta said algarve is leaving hed warned her that might happen but she hadnt believed it not down deep i said so it is the truth lurcanio answered long before the sun rises i shall be gone but what am i going to do krasta exclaimedas usual she came first in her own thoughts her algarvian lover shrugged i expect you will manage you have a knack for itand you are pretty enough to let you get away with a lot that would be intolerable from some other woman he stepped forward and slid his hand under the waistband of her trousers instead of fondling her as hed done so many times though he let his palm rest on her belly if by some accident the baby does turn out to be mine try not to hate it on that account he brushed his lips across hers then hurried down the stairs without a backward glance krasta took a step after him but only one she recognized futility when it hit her in the face lurcanio wouldnt stop for her or for anyone else she turned around and went to the bedchamber window a small swarm of carriages waited there lurcanio came out and said something in his own language as he got into one the algarvian drivers flicked their reins the carriages rattled away krasta watched till the last one vanished into predawn darkness how many algarvians were leaving priekule now by carriage and on horse and unicornback and aboard leyline caravans gliding west thousands tens of thousands krasta couldnt begin to guess the question nonetheless had an answer all of them lurcanio had said so what would priekule be like without redheads strutting through it krasta could hardly imagine it had been too long more than four years she thought with sleepy wonder she lay down again of itself her own hand went where lurcanios had lain only moments before only a little bulge under thereno sound at all of course no movement either or none to speak of she thought shed felt the baby stir once or twice but she wasnt sure why arent you valnus she whispered to her belly maybe you are valnus he had the first chance that day after all by the time shed fallen asleep she was more than halfway to convincing herself the valmieran viscount had to be the babys father rain on the roof woke herrain on the roof and the sounds of a raucous celebration downstairs she muttered something vile under her breath since shed started carrying that babyviscount valnu s baby of course it was viscount valnu s babyshed needed all the sleep she could get and an extra hour besides she started to shout for bauska then checked herself she could hear her maidservant making a racket along with the rest of the help and bauska wasnt likely to hear her muttering more unpleasantries she got out of bed threw on some clothes the trousers werent stylish but they werent tight either which counted for more and emerged from her bedchamber having emerged she slammed the door behind her that should have been plenty to make the servants downstairs grow quiet on the instant it should have but it didnt somebodywas that could that possibly have been her driverhowled out a suggestion for king mezentio that had to be the foulest thing shed ever heard in her life and shed heard a good deal a moment later one of the cooks topped it everyone down there roared laughter hearing that laughter krasta shivered a little that laughter didnt hold mirthor rather not mirth alone a hunger for vengeance lived there too with the algarvians gone like so many thieves in the night where would that hunger feed and the same to the twat upstairs someone else yelled which brought more laughter and several cries of agreement krasta shivered again shed just had her question answered for her she wished she knew whod shouted that last she would have dismissed him at once and with a bad character too a moment later though she squared her shoulders and marched down the stairs those were servants down there after all and who of noble blood could take servants quite seriously they were sittingsome sprawlingaround the big dininghall table eating her food and swilling down her ale and brandy abrupt silence fell when they saw her standing in the doorway here is the twat upstairs she said crisply now what do you intend to do about it that should have cowed them before the war it surely would have even now it almost didalmost but not quite after that silence stretched it tore one of the women pointed at her and said filthy whore shes got an algarvian baby growing in her belly those werent roars that rose from the servants now they were growls fierce savage growls krasta wondered if she should have left priekule with lurcanio she wondered if he would have taken her too late to worry about any of that if she didnt face down the servants this very minute she would never get another chance she might never get a chance to do anything else ever again smilgya youre sacked she said take whatever you have and go you cant tell me what to do any more smilgya screeched not when youve been spreading your legs for the redheads all this time whore traitor there sat bauska gulping ale and nodding vigorously krasta almost sacked her too but came up with something better instead how is brindza this morning bauska and what do you hear from captain mosco bauska flushed scarlet her halfalgarvian bastard daughter was almost three years old now the other servantssome of them anyhowstared at her not at krasta theyd come to take brindza for granted suddenly they had to remember her mother had had a redheaded lover too and she wasnt the only one either smiling spitefully krasta said how many women here havent bedded an algarvian or two you all know the truth she didnt know the truth herself but shed heard a lot of gossip when no one came back with an immediate sharp retort her smile got wider and more spiteful still then in a shrill voice smilgya said i never did by the powers above i believe that krasta replied with flaying contempt smilgya was chunky fiftyfive or so and homely she let out a shriek of fury but some of the other servantsmostly menlaughed at her krasta pressed an advantage she knew she might not keep for long i told youyoure dismissed get out of my house smilgya looked around for support she didnt see so much as shed expected springing to her feet she cried i wouldnt work for anyone who sucked up to the redheadswho sucked off the redheadslike you did not any more i wouldnt she stormed away adding i hope your algarvian bastard is born with the pox and i hope youve got it too krasta set a hand on her belly again this time she tried to forget lurcanios hand resting there in the middle of the night thats not an algarvian bastard in me she said i hope its not doing her best to ignore her own thought she went on rapidly its viscount valnu s and you all know what he did to the redheads and how they almost killed him for it thats not what youve been saying bauska pointed out well what if it isnt krasta tossed her head would you have told lurcanio youd been with another man and a valmieran at that or told your captain mosco when you were riding his prong i doubt it very much my dear bauska looked daggers at her she didnt care about that she cared about stopping what felt like a peasant uprising from years gone by someone chose that moment to hammer on the front door with the old bronze knocker there that helped distract the servants too be so good as to answer that valmiru krasta said almostbut not quiteas imperiously as she might have before the war the butler got to his feet two or three servants shook their heads one reached out to try to stop him valmiru just shrugged and headed for the door a moment later surprise filled his voice as he called back its viscount valnu milady there you see krasta said triumphantly the servants blinked and gaped bauskas eyes looked big as saucers krasta had hoped it might be valnu but hadnt dared expect it she started to hurry to the front door but changed her mind and took her time a gaggle of servitors trailed after her as if wanting to see the viscount for themselves before believing valmiru valnus smile lit up his bony face when krasta strode into the entry hall hello sweetheart he said and hurried up to plant a kiss on her mouth theyre gone at last isnt it wonderful it certainly is krasta answered that seeming a better choice of words than a grudging i suppose so asking whether valnu missed certain handsome algarvian officers didnt strike her as the best idea at the moment either instead she set a hand on her belly and said im so glad you came to see us viscount valnu s smile only got brighter life is full of such interesting possibilities isnt it he murmured and slipped an arm around krastas waist the staring servants sighedrelief disappointment krasta couldnt tell she didnt care either i got away with it she thought every time ealstan came home to her and saxburh vanai praised the powers above these days he had to sneak back to their block of flats for the algarvians had retaken this part of eoforwic while vanai was about her praises she squeezed in some gratitude that their block of flats remained standing two on the other side of the street were nothing but debris what is the point she demanded of him one evening the flat was a grim dark place the algarvians blazed without hesitation or warning at any light that showed and the shutters werent all they might have been it was also chillynone of the windows had any glass save a few knifelike shards left in it when the rains came in earnest she didnt want to think about that so far the autumn had stayed dry ealstan spooned up the stew of barley and peas and almonds shed cooked with wood taken from the ruins across the way hed brought back a couple of jugs of wine they both sipped from them the water still wasnt working here vanai had to carry water back from a fountain on a street corner a few blocks away weve got to keep trying ealstan said stubbornly why vanai demanded cant pybba see youve lost youll only get more men killed if you go on fighting you might get killed yourself she thought and made a gesture older than the kaunian empireor so brivibas had told her at any rateto turn aside the evil omen i wouldnt want to go on living if anything happened to you what would i do without you how would i go on living why would i care to but ealstan shook his head she could hardly see the motion there in the gloom we have to go on now and hope for the best when the redheads catch us these days they kill us they wont let us surrender if pybba tried to give up theyd slaughter all our fighters oh vanai hated the weakness and fear she heard in her own voice hated them but couldnt help them she was relieved when saxburh woke from a nap and started to cry as she went to get the baby though her husbands voice pursued her now the forthwegian fighters are starting to understand what being a kaunian in this kingdom was like they dont much care for it he laughed without mirth vanai brought her daughter out to the kitchen as she undid her tunic so saxburh could nurse she said stay here with me then dont go back to it at all youve done enoughcant you see that if we can drive the redheads out of eoforwic ourselves we have a better chance of dealing with the unkerlanters afterwards ealstan insisted so what vanai said so fornicating what even in the darkness she could see his mouth fall open she went on what difference does it make between you and mezentios men youve wrecked the city it wont be the same for the next fifty years and the unkerlanters are going to take it away from you or the algarvians sooner or later anyhow we have to try ealstan said again and vanai knew argument was useless forthwegian patriots were some of the bravest men on the continent of derlavai no one would have quarreled with that they were also some of the most blockheaded men on derlavai vanai expected she would have got quarrels there but she knew what she knew and ealstan gave her all the evidence she needed to prove it she thought about seducing him to get him to stay here instead of going back to the fighting spinello had taught her everything she ever needed to learn about trading favors for something she wanted but shed never done that sort of thing with ealstan and the idea of starting sickened her she hadnt married ealstan she hadnt borne his child to prostitute herself with him besides and even more to the point she didnt think it would work unlike spinello ealstan wasnt one to change his mind because a woman did or didnt go to bed with him in fact the next thing she found that would make him change his mind once hed made it up would be the first even though it was dark saxburh felt like playing once shed been fed and changed shed learned how to roll over not too long before and would do it again and again laughing each time her joy made ealstan laugh too something vanai hadnt been able to manage eggs burst not too far away saxburh had heard those roars so often they hardly bothered her any more she remained intent on what shed been doing vanai envied her unlike the baby she knew the havoc eggs could wreak by the time this is over there wont be much left of eoforwicyoure right about that ealstan said pybba should have thought of that before he raised his rebellion vanai answered saxburh just kept laughing the pure glee in the sound made vanai wish she were four months old too who would have thought mezentios men would fight back like this ealstan said bitterly and who would have thought the unkerlanters would sit quiet on the other side of the twegen and let the algarvians smash us algarvians are algarvians vanai pointed out weve known for years how theyre fighting this war and the unkerlanters are no bargain either except when you compare them to the redheads true every word of its true ealstan slammed his fist hard into the palm of his other hand but seeing it he hit himself again harder yet maybe he was hoping he could hurt himself you couldnt have done anything to change the way it happened vanai said guessing what was troubling him pybba wouldnt have listened to you even if you tried pybba doesnt listen to anyone but himself well thats true enough ealstan said still no vanai did her best to make her voice firm and unyielding youve done everything you could youve done more than anyone could have expected including yourself sometimes things dont work out the way you wish they would have and thats all there is to it i wish i could say you were wrong ealstan told her you dont know how much i wish i could say that oh i think i might vanai said he thought about that then nodded as if to stop thinking for a little while he picked up saxburh and cuddled her she promptly fell asleep she seemed to do that faster for ealstan than she did for vanai it sometimes annoyed vanaishe did most of the work of taking care of the baby so why should saxburh go to sleep more easily for ealstan when ealstan set saxburh in the cradle she woke up with a yowl vanai feeling vindicated scooped her out and rocked her till she quieted down again it didnt take long the baby was sleepy vanai got her back into the cradle without waking her ealstan sighed so did vanai lets go to bed she said with the lights working it wouldnt have seemed so late as things were as things were ealstan chuckled and asked how do you mean that vanai considered giving herself to him now wouldnt be the same as doing it in the hope of keeping him from going out to try to kill more algarvians and if we dont do it now we may not get another chance she did her best to suppress that thought as she did whenever ones like it crossed her mind after a pause almost surely too short for ealstan to notice she said however you like if youd rather just sleep thats all right he snorted im so far behind on sleep i dont think ill ever get even come to think of it im pretty far behind on the other too he caught her to him they hurried into the bedroom each with an arm around the others waist afterwards vanai lay awake for a while listening to the sounds of war in eoforwic ealstan sprawled beside her not moving hardly seeming to breathe he didnt usually roll over and go to sleep right after making love but he didnt usually set his life on the line every time he left the flat either jokes about men who rolled over and fell asleep went back at least to the days of the kaunian empire but vanai couldnt begrudge ealstan the rest he needed so badly pybba on the other hand she wished something unfortunate would happen to pybba he couldnt have known ahead of time how things would turn out who could all the same his miscalculation had brought eoforwic down in ruins along with his hopes all this death all this wreckageand even if they had thrown mezentios men out of eoforwic for good how much difference would it have made to swemmel of unkerlant even a coppers worth vanai didnt think so forthwegian pride had done nothing more than leave a lot of forthwegians dead and the algarvians are killing any fighters they catch have they finally run out ofkaunians vanai shivered she moved closer to ealstan for warmth and because she didnt want to be alone even if he was dead to the world couldnt mezentios men take blonds out of valmiera and jelgava vanai shrugged since the forthwegians in eoforwic rose up against the algarvian occupiers shed heard little about how the war was going in other corners of derlavai if ealstan hadnt been close to pybba she wouldnt have heard anything at all she started to set a hand on ealstans shoulder but quickly drew back before touching him shed made the mistake of doing that once and only once he might be asleep to the point of unconsciousness but he woke instantly and struck out as if someone were trying to kill him maybe someone had tried to kill him while he was asleep if so the redhead hadnt managed itand ealstan had never said a word about it to vanai time was when i had secrets from you but you had none from me vanai thought its not like that anymore when theyd first come together the year or so she had on him had often seemed like four or five it wasnt like that anymore either ealstan was a man with a mans silences hanging about him the thought made vanai at twentyone feel very old indeed she fell asleep at last without noticing shed done it saxburh let her sleep through the night sometimes the baby did sometimes she didnt when vanai woke gray gritty light was sneaking through the slats of the shutters she rolled toward ealstan and discovered he wasnt lying beside her she cursed in both classical kaunian and forthwegian as she got out of bed hed gone off to fight again and he hadnt even said goodbye hed done that before and it never failed to infuriate her she went out to the kitchen to build up the fire in the stove ealstan had left a note on the table there that was something not enough but something i love you hed written in classical kaunian because i love you i will be careful she hoped he wasnt lying to make her feel better and she wished he didnt love forthweg quite so much a lot of good that wish does me she thought and fought back tears come on skarnu said were going home by the powers above ive been waiting more than four years for this day but merkela instead of scrambling up into the seat of the wornout old carriage the valmierans had scrounged up for them from who could guess where hung back little gedominu in her arms i dont know she said and skarnu could indeed hear the doubt in her voice i never thought id go to priekule and im not so sure i want to dadadadada gedominu said cheerfully he might even have known what it meant he sometimes said mama too although to merkelas annoyance less often than the other dont worry about a thing skarnu said priekules our city again valmieras city again and were going back to settle accounts with all the traitors and collaborators you werent afraid to take on count simanu in the days when the kingdom had hardly any hope at all now we finally get to pay my sister back for sleeping with that redhead all these years that made merkela brighten but less than skarnu had hoped it would at last she came out with what was really bothering her when we get to priekule youll be a marquis again and ill just be a peasant wench oh nonsense skarnu said or something rather earthier than that when we get to priekule youll be the woman im going to marry and spend the rest of my days with and if any fancy bitch toting a sandyhaired baby instead of a proper blondhe reached out and ruffled gedominus fine whitegold hair the baby squealed with gleesays anything different i do believe ill break her pointy nose that wont make the bluebloods like me any better merkela said she was probablyalmost certainlyright skarnu was cursed if he would admit it and he had a point of his own to make youre coming into priekule with an underground leader youre coming into priekule as an underground leader if anybody doesnt like it blaze her that got a smile from merkela rather more to the point it got her to climb into the carriage gedominu tried to throw himself out of her arms he could crawl and pull himself upright and thought he could do everything he was wrong but he didnt know it plenty of people older than ten months had the same problem skarnu flicked the reins the horse a gelding almost as decrepit as the carriage it drew let out a resentful neigh but then got moving something felt wrong along the roads leading north toward the capital skarnu needed a little while to figure out what it was when he did he felt like whooping for joy all he said was no algarvian patrols i should hope not merkela said ive been hoping not ever since the king surrendered skarnu answered now the wish has finally come true they did run into a patrol after a while half a dozen armed valmierans most of them looking like farmers four carrying algarvianissue sticks the other two lighter weapons intended for blazing for the pot and two unarmed men with hands high when skarnu spoke the word pavilosta he might have unleashed a potent spell pass on sir one of the poorly shaven irregulars said its our kingdom again or most of it is well get the rest before too long skarnu said confidently and the other irregulars nodded in unison after the carriage bumped around a corner skarnu turned to merkela i wonder what they were going to do with those couple of captives they had with them nothing good i hope no there was no compromise in merkela not when it came to people who might have collaborated with the redheads and skarnu only nodded when it came to such people he felt very little compromise inside himself either getting to priekule took three days by the way the horse complained skarnu might have made it gallop all the way instead of taking it at the slow walk that seemed to be the beasts only gait this side of a dead stop little gedominu was complaining too even more loudly than the horse he didnt like being held so much he wanted to get down and make trouble another patrol this one of men in actual valmieran uniform halted the carriage on the southern outskirts of priekule again skarnu had no trouble convincing them who and what he was one of them said oh aye sir we know about you youre the marchioness krasta s brother isnt that right thats right skarnu agreed sourly what about it well sir if what we hear tell is right shes friendly with viscount valnu the fellow answered valnu hes been a big blaze in the underground since dirt or so they say good man to be friendly with if you ask meand if thats how things really go not knowing what to say to that skarnu didnt say anything he drove past the checkpoint and on into priekule friendly with viscount valnu merkela said with an underground leader skarnu spread his hands helplessly i heard the same thing you did who knows maybe lurcanio was lying to me when he said what he said i wouldnt put it past an algarvian he flicked the reins or maybe this fellow didnt know what he was talking about i cant tell you all i know is shes been with lurcanio since the redheads marched in and she never seemed unhappy about it that i heard so i have been given to understand that was how lurcanio had answered when skarnu asked if krastas baby was his not a ringing endorsement of her fidelity krasta had collected lovers like beads on a string in the days before the war who hadnt back then why would she have changed since she was constant even in things like inconstancy as they went deeper into priekule merkelas eyes got bigger and bigger its so huge she said i never believed a city could be this size shed thought the provincial towns in which theyd stayed were a match for the capital now she was finding out otherwise skarnu kept looking around too he hadnt been here for a long time something was wrong at last he put his finger on it the kaunian column of victory is gone you could see it from almost anywhere in the city you already knew the redheads knocked it down merkela pointed out i knew he said but i hadnt seen it a bonfire blazed on a street corner skarnu could still see some of the algarvian signs burning there signs that had directed mezentios soldiers to theaters and eateries and no doubt brothels as well no longer skarnu thought never again but then another thought went through his mind my sister is a whore no matter what that fellow said he shook his head i have no sister a downcast woman whod been shaved bald walked by people whistled and jeered at her mattressback algarvian slut stinking bitch she seemed to shrink in on herself even more trying to become invisible she deserves worse than that merkela said her voice and eyes cold as the land of the ice people maybe shell get it too skarnu said which seemed to satisfy her after what seemed both a very long time and hardly any time at all they came to the mansion on the outskirts of town an algarvian signpost still stood at the entranceway directing mezentios men skarnu supposed to colonel lurcanio and whatever hed done but then he forgot about that for merkela whispered you lived here aye skarnu answered and saw the astonishment on her face and will againand so will you if you want to if you dont well live somewhere else but first we have some business to finish he heard his own grimness he hitched the carriage in front of the house and handed merkela down then he strode to the door she followed little gedominu in her arms he hammered at the door with the knocker a maidservant opened she looked half nervous half haughty haughty won what do you want she demanded almost as sharply as krasta might have skarnu knew what she saw a weatherbeaten man in the clothes of a farmer with a peasant woman and a brat in tow what she didnt see was him hello bauska he answered making his voice milder than hed first intended i want to see my sister he said the words once more even if they felt like a lie in his heart bauskas eyes kept widening till they seemed to fill her whole face my lord marquis she whispered and dropped a curtsy of the sort skarnu hadnt seen since the algarvians overran valmiera come with me sir and she looked a question toward his companions merkela my fiancee skarnu said gedominu my son and heir bauskas eyes got wider still skarnu hadnt thought they could the servant led him inside hed forgotten how big the place was what had he done with all this space merkelas eyes were almost as wide as the maidservants a pretty little girl perhaps three years old ran by with a doll under her arm pretty ayebut with hair closer to bronze than to gold and with catgreen eyes merkela hissed something under her breath harshly skarnu asked is she krastas too no my lord bauska answered quietly she went pale first then red shes mine her name is brindza merkela started to snarl something skarnu shook his head later he said first things first a little to his surprise she nodded they followed bauska into a drawing room there sat krasta and to skarnus surprise viscount valnu the man from the patrol had known whereof he spoke after all and valnu was a big blaze among the underground leaders in priekule playing the most dangerous of double games with the redheads skarnu krasta exclaimed springing to her feet she knew him at any rate her belly bulged just a little welcome home she threw her arms around him and kissed him on the cheek then she pointed to merkela who is your friend my fiancee skarnu corrected and gave merkelas name again and gedominus his voice like iron he went on i stayed with my own kind you see krasta glared at him he looked back stonily expecting a tantrum from her and not about to put up with one but she surprised him one hand went to that bulging belly the forefinger of the other pointed at valnu nothing wrong with the blood of my child not with him as the father him skarnus eyes swung to valnu in astonishment the fellow with the stick had said friendly but that friendly you so i have been given to understand valnu saidthe exact same words lurcanio had used where lurcanio had sounded bedeviled though he merely seemed amused but but merkela seemed about to burst from the outrage trapped inside her that now against all expectations couldnt escape i will add that there have been times when the marchioness proved most useful to those opposing algarve valnu said which means there were also times when she wasnt skarnu thought but plainly he couldnt just throw krasta out of the mansion into the cold perhaps with her head shaved as hed intended doing she saw as much too and looked as smug as a mouse with a hole too deep for the cats paw that made him want to slap her all over again well find out he thought but couldnt help sighing we wont find out for quite a while curse it if ealstan could have blazed the algarvian major with his eyes the man would have fallen over dead the redhead ignored him and all the lesser forthwegian rebels who stood behind pybba he bowed to pybba as he might have bowed to a fellow noble in trapani my superiors have agreed to the terms you propose sir he said in good forthwegian all right pybba answered heavily all right powers below eat you we give over the fight and you treat the men who surrender as proper captives better than you deserve in my opinion the algarvian said my superiors feel otherwise however and so he shrugged one of his peoples theatrical shrugs the truce will hold till tomorrow noon at that time you shall come forth from your holesthose you have left anyone who does not yield himself up to us at noon tomorrow shall be reckoned a bandit and we shall treat him as one when we catch him he sliced a thumb across his neck theyd been doing that all along maybe theyd decided it made the rebels fight harder if treating the forthwegians as war captives let mezentios men regain their grip on eoforwic that must have seemed a worthwhile bargain to them curse you pybba said the algarvian only bowed again then he turned his back and marched away through the wreckage of the forthwegian capital its over somebody said in a dull voice everythings over pybba shook his head its not over till noon tomorrow when i get to hand myself to the algarvian general and thank him kindly for not murdering all of usonly most of us the rest of youhe looked from one shabby filthy disgruntled forthwegian to the nextyou can surrender or you can try and disappear of course the redheads will kill you if you try and disappear and dont quite make it odds are theyll kill us anyhow ealstan said the ordinary fighters will probably do all right but us why would the algarvians want to let us live im not telling anybody what to do not anymore pybba said look what that already got us maybe ill see some of you here tomorrow and maybe i wont broad shoulders slumped he strode off ill be here with you if they dont blaze me first ealstan called after him then stick in hand he too left the square where the arrogant algarvian majoras if there were any other kindhad delivered the surrender terms his kingdom would deign to accept as soon as he was out of sight of his comrades he gently set the stick on some rubble then took off his armband and tossed it down on top of the stick he didnt like lying to pybba but a lie here might help cover his trail if he failed to come in to surrender after saying he would people might think hed been killed between now and then who wanted to search for a dead man of course if he wasnt careful people might be right the block of flats he shared with vanai and saxburh lay in a district the redheads had already reconquered he still had to get there without drawing their notice they couldnt cover every inch of eoforwic could they he began to wonder in earnest before hed gone very far like cockroaches and lice and fleas algarvian soldiers seemed to be everywhere and seemed intent on making sure none of the forthwegian fighters got out of the small part of eoforwic they still held the algarvians had mages and ferociously barking dogs to try to keep their foes penned up mages or no mages dogs or no dogs ealstan wouldnt have worried back in gromheort hed known the town his whole life and felt sure he could have gone anywhere there without having foreigners notice but he was a relative stranger in eoforwic himself some of mezentios men might have been here as long as he had he didnt know the secret ways a local would and even had he known those ways how much good would it have done him not much was left standing in eoforwic and most of what might have been secret was now buried he didnt want to climb over rubble so he had to skirt it as best he could somewhere close by a dog growled a warning ealstan froze he wished he hadnt left his stick behind without it though he could hope to pass himself as somebody whod never been a fighter then a forthwegian cried out in fright the dog snarled and barked an algarvian shouted halting in accented forthwegian halting or blazing by the sound of thudding feet the other forthwegian didnt halt by the algarvians curses he missed his blaze to me to me after the whoreson he yelled in his own language more thudding feet told of other redheads rushing to his aid ealstan huddled against the wreckage of what had been a butchers shop thered been plenty of butchery in eoforwic since the place went up in flames three algarvian troopers ran right past him none gave him a second glance or even a first they knew he wasnt the man their shouting comrade was after whoever the other fellow was he led mezentios men on a long chase and one that took them away from ealstan seizing his luck he hurried toward his block of flats what better time than when all the redheads nearby were going after someone else before long ill be in the part of town theyve held for a while and then they wont pay any attention to me but that thought had hardly crossed ealstans mind before another redhead barked out halting feet skidding on broken bits of brick ealstan did halt the algarvian had a stick aimed straight at him if he tried to run he was a dead man he smiled a broad foolish smile trying to look anything but dangerous the algarvian a plump fellow came cautiously toward him ealstan noticed the redhead wore the uniform of a constable not a soldier some small hope blossomed in him mezentios soldiers had proved much more brutal in eoforwic than the algarvian constabulary the plump redhead tried to say something more in forthwegian made a complete hash of it and to ealstans surprise started over again in slow bad but understandable classical kaunian you following me aye i follow you ealstan replied in the same language good the algarvian seemed unaware of the irony of his using the speech of the folk his own people killed even so that he knew enough of it to use kept ealstans hope alive then the constable gestured with his stick and ealstan wondered how long his hopeand hewould live what you doing here the redhead demanded hard suspicion in his voice i am going home ealstan said which had the advantage of being literally true i mean no one any harm for the moment that was true too likely telling the constable sneered why you out you being fighter no i am not a fighter ealstan said carefully but if im not a fighter what am i doing out and about inspiration struck in the form of a couple of worthless toadstools sprouting from the dirt next to the bottom couple of courses of a wall moving slowly so as not to alarm the constable he bent picked them and held them out i was gathering mushrooms sir these are very good would you like them no not liking the algarvian made a horrible face you forthwegian crazy mushrooms faugh the last was a guttural noise of disgust but he didnt call ealstan a liar that meant hed been in forthweg a while and knew of the passion forthwegiansand kaunians in forthweg had for mushrooms a passion algarvians emphatically didnt share may i go now sir ealstan asked with an elaborate algarvian shrug the constable shook his head how i knowing you not being a fighter eh he said ealstans heart sank then the fellow did a very algarvian thing he stuck out his hand palm up trying not to shout for joy ealstan dug into his belt pouch and gave the redhead silver this is all i have sir he said it wasnt he wanted to keep some in reserve in case he had to pay off another venal constable or soldier but he thought it would do and it did the redhead had a belt pouch too the coins vanished into it going on he told ealstan i thank you ealstan said gravely he thought he remembered seeing this fellow around eoforwic for a while and also thought him a human being or as close to a human being as an algarvian constable was likely to come by the time another algarvian noticed him he was well inside the territory the redheads had retaken the soldier paid him no particular attention plenty of forthwegians trudged through the wreckage of eoforwic or else scrabbled through it looking for whatever they might find a couple of algarvians were pasting broadsheets on walls that hadnt been knocked down ealstan hadnt seen these before they showed king swemmel as a bleeding hog with his blood spilling out of unkerlant and pouring over eastern derlavai toward algarve and even the lands beyond facing the hog stood an algarvian with a butchers apron and an outsized cleaver the legend read help us stop the flood hed seen worse broadsheets he liked the unkerlanters only a little better than the algarvians plenty of forthwegians liked them less than they liked the redheads plegmunds brigade might get some new recruits of course with the unkerlanters already having overrun half of forthweg and with them rampaging forward in the south too how much good would a few new forthwegian footsoldiers do king mezentio not much or so ealstan hoped an algarvian colonel a short handsome fellow with the jaunty ferocity of a fighting cock was giving orders to some of the men he led come on my dears dont just stand there now that the fornicating forthwegians have thrown in the sponge the unkerlanters are sitting on their arses just across the twegen pretty soon theyll decide theyre done with their holiday and get around to fighting us again wed better be ready for them right right colonel spinello one of the redheads said in the indulgent tones soldiers used when they were fond of an officer wed better dig in then spinello said wed better do it deep and tight as deep and tight as i was into that kaunian girl of mine back when the war was new he sighed his men laughed ealstans hands folded into fists with a deliberate effort of will he made them relax dont give yourself away the algarvian colonel kissed his bunched fingertips that vanai she was a special piece she was i trained her myself ealstan stumbled and almost fell though he hadnt tripped on anything mezentios soldiers laughed as if theyd heard this colonels stories a great many times before they probably had i shouldnt have left my stick behind after all ealstan thought even without it ill find a way to kill him but that vow still left his feet unsteady beneath him as if he were drunk or stunned i am stunned what do i do when i set home to vanai what do i say what can do what can i say good questions all of them he had perhaps five minutes to find good answers bembos belt pouch was nicely heavy with silver these days as he strutted through the streets of downtown eoforwicor what was left of themhe was even acting as a constable again not as a soldier any more he should have been happy or at least happier he should have been but he wasnt some of the constables had gone back to business as usual the minute the forthwegian rebels finally surrendered and marched off to captives camps those who hadnt tried fitting back in among the ordinary people of eoforwic or the survivors thereof up in the tropical continent of siaulia there were supposed to be big birds that hid from danger by sticking their heads in the sand bembos complacent comrades reminded him of those big birds they wont look across the river he told orastehe had his old partner back for delminio had been badly wounded at the start of the fighting its going to happen but they dont want to think about it shut up oraste said i dont want to think about it either but you never want to think about anything bembo was still no braver than he had to be but before his spell as a soldier he would never have dared say anything like that to oraste its different with those other buggers they want to forget about the unkerlanters and how can we oraste looked west toward the twegen well fight like mad bastards when they cross the river he said of course we will bembo agreed but how much good will it do us his partners shrug was not the usual algarvian production how much good has fighting the stinking unkerlanters done us so far oraste asked bleakly sometimes you go into something and you figure you wont come out the other side thats all youre futtering stuck thats all bembo shivered though the day was mild enough he watched soldiers methodically preparing defenses against the attack they too knew was coming one of the soldiers looked up from his pickandshovel work and called hey constable when they come you think theyll pay any attention to which uniform youre wearing his laugh bembo thought was singularly unpleasant his question was singularly unpleasant too especially since the obvious answer was no bembo stuck his nose in the air that only made the soldier laugh harder forthwegian civilians with hods hauled rubble from hither to yon under the sticks of algarvian guards they might as well be kaunians bembo remarked with another one of those businesslike shrugs oraste answered better they get their throats cut than i get mine better nobody gets his throat cut bembo said but oraste looked at him as if that were beyond the realm of possibility given the sorry state of the world these days it probably was oraste walked on for a few paces then nudged him in the ribs oraste being who and what he was the nudge sent bembo staggering sideways and almost knocked him flat oraste grabbed him and held him up come over here with me he said steering bembo away from the forthwegian laborers why bembo asked do you want to murder me in privacy only sometimes oraste said patiently not right now now i want to make a bet with you ah that got bembos notice all right what do you have in mind before answering oraste looked around to make sure nobody but bembo was in earshot then he said name however much you want and ill lay you two to one that none of those forthwegians who gave up ever comes home again i figure it serves em right if we use em just like kaunians we said wed treat em like war captives bembo reminded him i know what we said his partner answered and if you think well really do it put your money where your mouth is bembo thought it over oraste suggestively jingled his belt pouch but bembo hesitated only a couple of seconds before shaking his head find another sucker oraste i wont touch that one i think youre too likely to be right oraste snapped his fingers there you see youre not as dumb as you look and all this time i thought you were funny bembo said ha ha very funny he paused what do you want to bet that the unkerlanters are getting rid of all the forthwegians they dont like too ill bet on it if you want oraste said will you bet against it me are you crazy bembo shook his head again even more decisively this time thats not a sucker bet thats an idiot bet never can tell oraste said plenty of idiots running around loose in algarve a lot of em wear fancier uniforms than we ever will and isnt that the sad and sorry truth bembo agreed the way things are these days i dont care if i ever get promoted all i want to do is get back to tricarico in one piece why not wish for the moon while youre at it oraste waved toward the west you suppose the unkerlanters want any of us to get home he seemed to have forgotten saying he didnt want to think about swemmels men instead of answering bembo just sighed he didnt suppose anything of the sort he wished he did he said i never wanted to meet those unkerlanter whoresons up close like this you havent met em up close yettheyre still on the other side of the twegen oraste said well most of them are anyway when theyre close enough to yell swemmel and blaze at you thats up close by all the stories they do worse than that if they catch you too bembos shiver was no little frisson of horror such as he might have known while hearing a scary story at an evenings entertainment with plenty of food and good northern wine around it was too large too robust for that and it had nothing to do with the weather it was plain honest fear if the unkerlanters caught you bad things happened that to algarvians in the west was an obvious truth and the unkerlanters did not have to catch mezentios men to make bad things happen to them bembo grabbed orastes arm dragons he shouted they both dove for cover as the rockgray beasts swooped down on eoforwic from unkerlanter dragon farms on the far side of the river powers below eat them oraste said his face buried in the dirt bembo lay perhaps a foot away from him between them some sort of nasty mushroom thrust up from the ground bembo was amazed some forthwegian hadnt picked it and taken it off as a prize a moment later as eggs began bursting uncomfortably close by he found more urgent things about which to be amazed the whoresons pretty much left us alone while we were fighting the forthwegians here he said why in blazes are they bothering us now of course they left us alone thenwe were doing them a favor oraste said now we arent killing forthwegians who might cause em trouble further down the ley line so they dont have to bother being nice to us anymore that exercise in cynicism might have upset bembo more if he hadnt come to a similar conclusion himself we need to get to a shelter he bawled go ahead if you want to oraste said me i think youll get your stupid self killed if you stand up again he had a point bembo stayed where he was enough piles of wreckage lay around to do a good job of shielding him and oraste unless an egg burst right on top of them somebody much too close by started screaming bembo couldnt tell if he was algarvian or forthwegian agony the constable had discovered sounded the same in any language bembo rolled from his belly to his back he saw no dragons but eggs more of them than ever kept bursting all over eoforwic theyve got their tossers limbered up too he said in dismay well if theyre going to pound on us odds are theyll pound on us with everything theyve got eh oraste said there wont be anything left of this place by the time theyre through with it bembo said there wasnt much left of it before they started aye we took care of that oraste said and im sure it breaks the unkerlanters hearts to knock the capital of forthweg flat whats that supposed to mean bembo asked punctuating the question with a yelp as a brick or a stone bounced off his belly he rolled back over onto his back dont you remember oraste said back before the six years war we split forthweg with the unkerlanters eoforwic used to belong to them as far as old swemmels concerned there shouldnt ought to be any such thing as a kingdom of forthweg well there wont be if his men keep doing this to eoforwic bembo said or if there is there wont be any forthwegians left alive in it after what they put us through whod miss em oraste said a point bembo said then new fear ran through him fear different from the simple elementary terror caused by knowing that sorcerous energy might sear him at any moment the only way he could find to exorcise it was to name it aloud you dont suppose swemmels men are pounding us like this because theyre getting ready to cross the twegen do you how in blazes should i know oraste answered crossly if you want to find out something like that why dont you swim across the river and ask marshal rathar hes over there somewhere oh good idea really good idea bembos voice dripped sarcasm maybe i should ask for leave again then i wouldnt be here when the avalanche came down on our heads futter you his partner told him everybody in gromheort wanted to kill you when you got leave once if you got it again somebody would up and murder you and besides by the time you got to tricarico how do you know the stinking lagoans and kuusamans wouldnt be holding it i dont bembo admitted but if you had to get captured whod be your first choice to nab you one of the islanders or an unkerlanter my first choice to capture me a redheaded gal with big tits oraste said second choiced be a blond wench with big tits its all downhill from there that wasnt what bembo had meant which didnt stop him from laughing anything that could make him laugh when the world was coming to pieces all around him was something to be cherished only later did it occur to him to wonder just how far his standards had fallen when it did he wished it hadnt marshal rathar as it happened was not right across the twegen river from eoforwic at that moment hed been summoned back to cottbus and left the fight in the north in general gurmun s capable hands dont strike till everything is ready hed warned the general of behemoths the worst mistakes weve made in this war weve made by hitting too soon aye lord marshal gurmun had said rathar had wondered if he could trust the younger man to hold himself in if king swemmel ordered gurmun to attack he would whether the situation called for it or not gurmun had also said i envy you he assumed swemmel was recalling rathar to confer some new high command on him going through papers as the leyline caravan glided west rathar hoped gurmun was right he hoped so but he had no guarantee of it for all he knew the king was summoning him to have him blazed outside the royal palace as a warning to others you never could tell with swemmel mile after mile of plain first forthwegian and then unkerlanter slid past before rathars eyes every time the ley line took him through or past a village he winced no village remained intact hardly any buildings remained intact what the war hadnt wrecked the algarvians had often deliberately smashed in their long slow stubborn withdrawal toward the east if we cant keep it you wont get any use from it either they seemed to say and the villagesthe whole ruined landscapelooked the same from early morning when rathar left the western suburbs of eoforwic till the sun set it would have gone on looking the same too had he been able to see longer all the way to the suburbs of cottbus the devastation would have continueddid continue though shrouded now in darkness how many years how many generations will unkerlant need before she is again what she was but that was a question beyond the ken even of marshals rathars caravan car boasted a couch he fell asleep on it an aide shook him awake saying sir were in the capital are we he yawned stretched and sat up the leyline caravan depot remained dark no algarvian dragon could reach cottbus these daysor so rathar hoped with every fiber of his beingbut the fear remained unkerlanters had always feared and suspected and admired the energetic redheads from the east these past three and a half years the algarvians had given them fresh reasons for all three descending from the caravan car gave rathar another anxious moment who would be waiting for him down on the ground his adjutant major merovec or some of swemmels hardeyed deadsouled guards there to haul him away to torment or death for some slight the king had imagined again you never could tell good evening marshal the voice was thin and high and would have been inconsequential but we have a new task for you of all the things marshal rathar had expected that king swemmel himself would meet him at the depot was among the last he wasted no time in going flat on his belly before his sovereign the slates of the floor were chilly so was the air autumn in cottbus was a different business from the mild days hed enjoyed outside of eoforwic your majesty he cried and poured out swemmels required praises with his forehead knocking the cold stone again and again failure to give the king his due would have been as immediate and thorough a disaster for ratharthough not for the kingdomas losing cottbus in the first desperate winter of the war arise swemmel said when the ritual was done rathar got to his feet the king went on marshal we are well pleased in you thank you your majesty rathar said if the king praised him in public he probably wouldnt get knocked over the head come with us to the palace swemmel said we have a good many things to discuss with you and they will not wait as you say your majesty so shall it be swemmel was a notorious insomniac and if he felt comfortable staying busy half the night his subjects had to accommodate themselves to his rhythms and his whims he would not accommodate himself to them hed proved that again and again rathar had wondered if he would ride in the royal carriage swemmel had granted only a handful of men that privilege throughout his reign hed executed about half of them shortly thereafter getting a carriage of his own did not unduly upset the marshal back at the palace king swemmel said in the matter of eoforwic you have done as we desire in all particulars thank you your majesty rathar said had he not done as the king desired gurmun would have gone into command in the north long before this and if gurmun dared go off and try things on his own and had something go wrong none of his past accomplishments was likely to save him from the royal wrath but now swemmel seemed in as benign a mood as rathar had ever seen him even the kings smile held little of the malice that usually informed it swemmel said that being so we purpose transferring you to the south that you may lead our armies there as they drive into algarve and drive toward trapani when you take mezentios capital it is our desire that you leave not a single stone piled upon another do we make ourself clear aye your majesty rathar bowed low thank you your majesty thank you from the bottom of my heart hed thanked swemmel a moment before too this time he really meant it mezentio started this fight i want to be there when we finish it you shall have your chance marshal the king said for all your hesitation early in the campaign you have served us well since and we are willing to acknowledge that for swemmel to acknowledge service to anyone else was no small step as rathar knew full well swemmel was convinced he was unkerlant and all his officers and servitors merely extensions of his will rathar didnt even feel particularly aggrieved at the kings slighting comment as he remembered things he hadnt been hesitantswemmel had been too eager but he wasnt surprised his sovereign recalled those days differently even an ordinary man often remembered things to his own best advantage how not a king especially one to whom nobody dared say no i dare every now and again rathar thought aye i dareand every time i dare i come away shaking and with my armpits soaked with the stinking sweat of terror telling swemmel anything he didnt want to hear was no work for the faint of heart how long the king asked suddenly your majesty rathar said whatever king swemmel was talking about he hadnt been able to follow the sudden leap how long swemmel repeated in sharp impatient tones then grudgingly he explained how long till we get to use king mezentio as we desire and of how much of our victory will lagoas and kuusamo rob us your majesty i wouldnt even hazard a guess about the first rathar replied which made king swemmel glare at him it does not depend on us alone you see it also depends on the algarvians as you say and on our allies mezentio right now faces choices we never had to make for which i praise the powers above never swemmel said not even when we had to choose how much of our kingdom we would yield to the redheads and how much to the gongs not even then rathar said the gyongyosians were neverwell hardly evermore than a nuisance to us the algarvians were the deadly threat but mezentio faces dreadful danger from both west and east if we dont move on trapani the islandersand for all i know the jelgavans and the valmieranswill he thought that was obvious but by the alarm flaring in swemmels eyes it hadnt been obvious enough no the king said hoarsely they mustnt they cant trapani shall be ours ours do you hear me his voice rose to a frightened shout a bodyguard peered into the audience chamber to make sure he was all right cursing he waved the man away marshal rathar did his best to calm the king as i say your majesty we have only so much control over all this if mezentios men fight us with everything they have but go easy in the east had he been king of algarve he might have given orders like that fighting the lagoans and kuusamans remained a polite civilized business but the war between algarve and unkerlant had seen no quarter asked or given since the moment it began if they steal our victory so swemmels voice was low low but full of deadly fury if they think they can batten on the blood we spill we shall show them they are wrong even if it takes us a thousand years rathar wasnt worried about what would happen a thousand years from now he couldnt do anything about that what would happen in the next few days the next few weeks the next few months was his province he said your majesty always remember the algarvians are our greatest danger once we crush them we can worry about other things until we crush them we have to keep them first in our thoughts a thousand years swemmel muttered but then to rathars vast relief he nodded algarve first aye but we do not forget anything else lagoas and kuusamo may steal some of our glory but we shall take it back when the time comes your majesty rathar said soothingly then he changed the subject er your majestyis it true the islanders have some new strong sorcery of a different sort from what the redheadsand we have been using the reports ive received havent been clear he hoped it was true he loathed the murderous magecraft the algarvians had devised and unkerlant had had to copy we are not surprised the reports have been unclear the king said with a scornful sniff we doubt whether archmage addanz understands everything he hears of these matters we often doubt whether he understands anything he hears of these matters come to that there is some new sorcery and it has been used in jelgava and perhaps on the sea past that we know little but we are working to learn more good rathar said worried about everyone around him swemmel had built up a highly efficient corps of spies not so very good swemmel grumbled addanz should have seen to this some time ago without our urging rathar only shrugged addanz was a fine courtier but no great shakes as a mage expecting him to act like what he wasnt asked too much after a moment swemmel went on you should also know that hajjaj of zuwayza has come to cottbus has he rathar said aye your majesty youre righti should know that for what purpose has he come for what purpose would you think king swemmel demanded to yield himself to us of course nineteen hajjaj hated coming to cottbus for any number of reasons he disliked having to wear clothes he really disliked going out in weather cold enough to make wearing clothes a good idea most of all though he disliked having to come to beg for mercy for his defeated kingdom so good to see you again your excellency said ansovald who had been king swemmel s minister to zuwayza and was now what the man who delivered swemmels terms to hajjaj certainly past that the zuwayzi foreign minister didnt know and preferred not to guess always a pleasure hajjaj lied as far as he was concerned ansovald was even more boorish than most unkerlanters funny were both speaking algarvian isnt it ansovald said now his laugh showed large yellow teeth pretty soon well squash the redheads flat and nobody will need to speak their miserable language anymore i assure you the irony was not lost on me either hajjaj said but unfortunately my unkerlanter has never been fluent that was true though unkerlant had held zuwayza throughout his youth and young manhood ansovald grunted your folks probably thought it was beneath em to have you learn that was also true though hajjaj unlike his host was too polite to say any such thing ansovald went on fat lot of good your algarvian will do you from here on out you may be right hajjaj said in tones as chilly as he could make them shall we get down to business thats what youre here forto get the business ansovald laughed hajjaj managed something an inattentive man might have reckoned a smile but the unkerlanter wasnt wrong he was crude but he wasnt wrong swemmel could dictate terms to zuwayza he could and he would go ahead hajjaj said outside there was frost in the gutters here in this stuffy chamber of the royal palace sweat ran down his face that had only a little to do with the unkerlanterstyle tunic he wore as if to make up for the cold in which they lived unkerlanters heated their buildings well past what even a zuwayzi thought the point of comfort i have here a list of conditions prepared for me by his majesty king swemmel himself ansovald declared he took a leaf of paper from his belt pouch unfolded it and studied it portentously go ahead hajjaj repeated he knew he sounded weary he felt weary down to the very core of his being hed hoped for more than four years that this day would never come hed feared for two years that it would now it was here and he had to endure it item ansovald said henceforward the border between unkerlant and zuwayza shall be that which was established by treaty here in cottbus at the end of the last war between our two kingdoms on behalf of king shazli i accept hajjaj said at once he tried not to show how relieved he was both he and his king had feared the unkerlanters would use the victories theyd won against zuwayza to extinguish the kingdom altogether anything short of that was by unkerlanter standards generosity item ansovald went on inexorable as a landslide for the rest of the war against algarve and for fifteen years afterwards unkerlant shall freely be able to move ships into and out of the ports on the east coast of zuwayza and shall freely be able to draw any necessary supplies from those ports i accept hajjaj said again reflecting that it could have been worse your admirals should bear in mind that our ports there are small they do not overflow with supplies thats your worry not ours ansovald told him hajjaj returned another of those almostsmiles ansovald continued item zuwayza shall give up her alliance with algarve and enter into alliance with unkerlant against king mezentio and all who fight alongside him i accept hajjaj said once more again hed expected nothing less item ansovald said zuwayzi soldiers shall capture disarm and turn over to unkerlant all algarvian soldiers sailors and dragonfliers now in your kingdom we shall do everything we can in that regard hajjaj said you must understand though that mezentios soldiers are resisting my countrymen by force of arms even as we speak much of that was an elaborate charade to let the algarvians safely withdraw from zuwayza hajjaj knew as much and also knew ansovald and swemmel had better never find out ansovalds sniff said he had his suspicions but he did no more than sniff he proceeded item zuwayza shall henceforth in her dealings with other kingdoms consult with unkerlant wherever necessary and shall bear unkerlants interests in mind at all times hajjaj couldnt smile at that king swemmel was imposing a protectorate after all still though it was a partial relatively polite protectorate he wasnt setting ansovald up in bishah as governor of a newor rather oldunkerlanter province and hajjaj told himself we never can forget our big southern neighbor however much we wish we could i accept he said he knew he sounded wounded but he couldnt do anything about that item ansovald went on for the damage zuwayza has done to unkerlant you shall pay an indemnity of seventy million unkerlanter thals in silver or in kind in the space of three years after signing this agreement once more hajjaj said what he had to say i accept that would beggar the kingdom it would beggar it aye but wouldnt quite break it someone had done some very precise calculating there silence fell hajjaj looked across the table at ansovald what else your excellency ansovald refolded the paper and set it on the tabletop those are king swemmel s requirements for peace with zuwayza is that all hajjaj didnt say it though he came undiplomatically close swemmel could have done far worse hed expected swemmel to do far worse his suspicion kindled why hadnt swemmel done worse he couldnt ask ansovald the only thing that occurred to him was that swemmel wanted to fight algarve without distractions and so granted zuwayza relativelybut only relativelymild terms i shall advise king shazli to agree to these terms hajjaj said they are not too high a price for us to pay for leaving this war you should have thought of that before you got into it ansovald said no doubt hajjaj said politely life would be simpler if we could know such things ahead of time he paused then added i do have one question for you go ahead ansovald said but if you think his majesty will change anything in there you can think again i wouldnt dream of imagining such a thing hajjaj said and meant it but there were once some broadsheets scattered about that spoke of a reformed principality of zuwayza under a certain prince mustanjid do i gather from what i see here that king swemmel no longer supports any such entity whatever it may have been a threat to overthrow shazli thats what it was did you hear it mentioned anywhere in these terms ansovald asked i did not hajjaj admitted then acknowledging it is not required of your kingdom ansovald told him hajjaj nodded and said no more up in northern unkerlant or southern occupied zuwayza the zuwayzi noble whod kissed king swemmels footor some other portion of swemmels anatomywas probably feeling illused right now the unkerlanters wouldnt install him as king or even reformed prince of zuwayza after all hajjaj was not prepared to waste much sympathy on mustanjid may i have access to a crystallomancer to tell king shazli your terms before i sign them he asked if you insist ansovald said but i thought you came here as a plenipotentiary with full power to make agreements on your own i did come here so i do have that power hajjaj said but king shazli is my sovereign as king swemmel is yours would you do anything without letting your sovereign know you were going to do it no for a moment stark fear glinted in ansovalds eyes hajjaj was not afraid of shazli he liked the bright young man who ruled zuwayza as hed liked shazlis father before him but hed thought he knew what unkerlanters thought of their king and what sort of power swemmel enjoyed in this great broad land now he saw he was right and the seeing saddened him ansovald needed to gather himself before he could say it shall be as you wish you may speak to your king when things happened in unkerlant they happened with a furious energy that almost kept a stranger from noticing how often they did not happen at all not five minutes after hajjaj had made his request a crystallomancer stood beside him andafter a brief colloquy with ansovald in unkerlanterspoke to him in halting algarvian your king excellency i see thank you hajjaj sank down on a stool before the crystal that held shazlis image your majesty let me give you the terms they will impose on us he said switching to zuwayzi go ahead shazli answered in the same language he stiffened ever so slightly like a man bracing himself for a blow hajjaj went through them one by one shazli asked a few questions he answered them when he was finished he said your majesty unless you order me not to do so i shall accept these terms i do not think we can do anything to improve them and they are not so harsh as they might have been more than that he would not say not when swemmel surely had someone who spoke zuwayzi listening to this conversation they are not light either shazli said which was also true from a different kingdom they might even have been reckoned onerous but swemmel was willing to leave shazli on the throne and zuwayza a kingdom in its own right had he chosen to go further he could have with a sigh shazli said i agree things being as they are we must accept go ahead your excellency thank you your majesty hajjaj said he turned to ansovald and came back to the algarvian they shared the king agrees as i was sure he would the terms are acceptable to zuwayza in a different kingdom the ceremony would have been more elaborate men from the leading news sheets would have crowded in to watch hajjaj surrender here what went into the news sheets came straight from swemmel and his ministers anyway hajjaj signed the new treaty in a barren little palace antechamber and had to remind ansovald to get him a second copy so he could take it back to bishah after he signed he did get supper an enormous plate of fatty boiled pork boiled cabbage and stewed parsnips ansovald got the same sort of supper and consumed it with relish washing it down with several mugs of ale food for a cold kingdom hajjaj thought he ate what he could it wasnt badly prepared but ran far from the direction his tastes usually took an enormous soft mattress with a princes ransom of wool blankets and fur coverlets was a bed for a cold kingdom too no matter how strange and foreign it felt to hajjaj though he slept well that night my kingdom will live how could he toss and turn with the relief that thought brought uppermost in his mind colonel sabrino had not seen such a great wild melee of footsoldiers and above all of behemoths since the great battles in the durrwangen bulge more than a year earlier now though the unkerlanters and algarvians were fighting east of patras between the yaninan capital and the border between yanina and algarve swemmels men had broken through the algarvian line with a great force of behemothswhereupon the algarvians at either end of the breakthrough responding as smartly as they might have back in the days when they seemed to have the world on a string fought toward one another and trapped the unkerlanters whod been overbold but whether the unkerlanters would stay trapped was a different question peering down from his dragon sabrino shook his head in sour wonder how many behemoths did swemmels men have around the town of mavromouni too manyhe was certain of that had the trap really closed on them or were they part of a trap closing on his countrymen sabrino whacked his dragon with the goad the beast screamed it swung its head toward him on the end of its long scaly neck he whacked it again harder no matter what it thought it wasnt going to flame him out of the harness he whacked it once more and it dove toward the ground the rest of his wing what was left of it followed wind howled by him a cold nasty wind the behemoths below swelled as if by sorcery before long he saw that some of them had yaninans aboard not unkerlanters his lips drew apart in a mirthless grin you whoresons wont get any more use out of them than we did he predicted however much he was tempted to attack the yaninans for betraying algarve he didnt without the unkerlanters to stiffen them and give them the courage they would surely never find on their own king tsavellas men were no great threat they never had been and they never would be the unkerlanters on the other hand sabrino chose his behemoth and steered toward its tail king swemmel s men aboard it had a moment to see horror diving on them a moment in which to try to swing their personal sticks his way one of them even got the chance to blaze though wildly then sabrino tapped the dragon on the side of the neck it was always glad to get the command to flame fire gushed from its jaws engulfing the unkerlanters and the behemoth they rode sabrino had had to wait till the dragon was almost on top of the behemoth before letting it flame algarve was desperately short of quicksilver these days and without it dragonfire lost much of its heat and distance that didnt matter so much against behemoths which had no hope of outrunning flame even at short range against unkerlanter dragons though it was one more disadvantage to set beside a crushing disadvantage in numbers against which algarve has what sabrino wondered as the dragon clawed its way back up into the air again experience came to mind he for instance had been flying dragons and commanding this wing since the day the war began but so many dragonfliers were dead and their replacements raw as any unkerlanters theyre so young sabrino thought it wasnt that they were young enough to be his sons some of them were young enough to be his grandsons he having fought in the six years war theyre so young and so brave theyre braver than i ampowers above know thats true they go up there not knowing anything and knowing they dont know anything but they go up anyway with a smile sometimes even with a song i couldnt do that not for anything here came a swarm of unkerlanter dragons all in the dingy rockgray paint that made them so hard to see especially against autumn clouds the men who flew them were better at what they did than they had been when the war was new the unkerlanters used many more crystals than they had in those days and responded to trouble much more quickly it made fighting a war against them look altogether too much like work but they held formation as rigidly as if theyd been glued together that was how theyd been trained to follow their leader and do as he did some few of them outgrew it and became pretty good dragonfliers more though never learned sabrino wasted no pity on them if they survived his lessons they would pick up something he hoped they didnt melee he shouted into his crystal break apart and melee against good dragonfliers in formation the order would have been suicidal break up a smaller force to oppose a larger betterdisciplined one madness nothing but madness the unkerlanters though werent good dragonfliers this wasnt a wing of freelancers of the skilled fliers the algarvians called swemmels falcons these were just the men whod been closest to the battle by mavromouni and if you could rely on any one thing from such men you could rely on their holding formation too bloody long sure enough when the algarvians started swooping at their tails and up from below at their dragons bellies they didnt break out of their box till several of them had already tumbled from the sky sabrino had seen that time and again if theyd just broken up and put two or three dragons on every one of his as they could have he would have had a much harder time of it but they didnt they wouldnt they never did they paid for their rigidity too as they usually did by the time sabrino ordered his wing back toward its latest makeshift dragon farm hed counted nine unkerlanter dragons slain hed lost three of his own followers the only thing troubling him was that even at three losses for one the foe could afford it better than he down fluttered his dragons some of them burned all of them weary to the dragon farm in what had probably been some yaninan peasants turnip field dragon handlers trotted forward to secure the beasts to their iron stakes and tend to their wounds and feed them whatever meat theyd managed to scrounge from the surrounding countryside the handlers were all algarvians yaninan handlers nowadays tended only yaninan dragons and yaninan dragons flew alongside the rockgray beasts of unkerlant sabrino wondered how major scoufas fared these days were it not for scoufas he would probably have been languishing in a captives camp he wished the yaninan officer no illbut if they met in the air he would do his best to kill him can i the question was more interesting than he would have liked scoufas made a firstrate dragonflier no doubt about it he would be flying a fresher dragon and one brimfull of brimstone and quicksilver sabrino kicked at the muddy ground angry at himself if you dont think you can win every time you go up you d do better staying on the ground that was an obvious truth another obvious truth was that he couldnt afford to do any such thing he kicked at the wet dirt again no algarvian could afford to do anything but whatever he was best at that might hold back the unkerlanter tide and to keep doing it till he either got killed or he collapsed from exhaustion sabrino knew he wasnt far from either a road ran not far from the dragon farm some yaninans fled east along it they couldnt stomach the unkerlanter alliance no matter what king tsavellas might have to say about it but others moved west something sabrino hadnt seen before maybe they lived farther east and were hoping to avoid long battles in their own neighborhoods or maybe they hated algarvians as much as their countrymen hated unkerlanters some yaninans did being the wing commander sabrino got the abandoned farmhouse instead of a tent with his old bones he was glad to have the comfort of four walls around him even beatup shabby walls he lit a couple of big tallow candles they filled the oneroom farmhouse with the stink of hot fat by their flickering light he started to write a report on the fight his wing had just been through how many reports have i written in this war too bloody many thats certain sure and then another even less happy thought occurred to him how many of them have done any bloody good he didnt know the answer there not in numbers but he knew what he needed to know not many not enough thats certain sure too he wondered why he bothered would anyone in trapani care if he fell silent someone mighthis silence could give a superior who wanted to sack him the excuse he needed to do it that thought alone was plenty to keep sabrino stubbornly writing he didnt make things easy for the foe why should he for his alleged friends a sentry knocked on the door and said someone to see you sir i dont want to see anyone sabrino answered not looking up i think you should sir the sentry said that made sabrino raise an eyebrow it also roused his curiosity he stuck his pen into the bottle of ink got to his feet and went to open the door there stood the sentry and there behind him in a common soldiers cloak and boots stood king mezentio what in blazes are you doing here sabrino asked harshly seeing how things fare in the field the king of algarve answered and that should be what in blazes are you doing here your majesty may i come in aye numbly sabrino stood aside mezentio walked in and closed the door behind him sabrino said i have some spirits if you want any no thank you your excellency mezentio took off his hat and cocked his bald head to one side who knows you might poison them sabrino shook his head i wouldnt go that far i might say i told you so i cursed well did tell you so your majesty and you powers below eat you you wouldnt listen to me and do you think it would have made a counterfeit coppers worth of difference if i had mezentio retorted we had no chance to take cottbus without doing what we did and we couldnt whip unkerlant unless we took cottbus and so so what sabrino said if mezentio felt like executing him for the lese majesty of interrupting he didnt much care so fornicating what we did it and we still didnt take fornicating cottbus and how many kaunians and unkerlanters are dead now whod be alive if wed left well enough alone how many tens of thousands mezentio shrugged i dont know i dont care the kaunians have been our deadly foes since time out of mind they deserve whatever happened to them if they all had a single neck i would have been rid of every one of them at the same time i may yet manage that you would do better to make peace sabrino said how many lagoans and kuusamans think our name is a stench in the nostrils of civilization these days all of them or near enough who will make peace with me now what sort of peace would it be mezentio asked two questions for which sabrino had no good answers the king went on unfortunately you are in large measure correct about the islanders and as for swemmel of unkerlantyou know the answer there as well as i do and so i shall triumph or i shall die and algarve with me he glared at sabrino and you your excellency you shall remain a colonel till one of those or the other happens i wondered if youd changed your ways but i see that was another wasted hope sabrino laughed king mezentio glared harder than ever laughing still sabrino said why am i not surprised your majesty rain spattered the surface of the twegen river blowing in from out of the west it spattered colonel spinello s face too as he looked across from the ruins of eoforwic to the unkerlanter emplacements on the other side of the river spinello didnt mind the rain so much were he down in the south of unkerlant it would long since have turned to sleet and snow what he minded was the feeling he needed eyes in the back of his head the forthwegians whod fought so long and hard had surrendered ayeor most of them had but some still blazed at the algarvians in eoforwic whenever they saw a chance spinellos brigade took a casualty or two from snipers almost every day he looked back over his shoulder hanging there from a balcony was the corpse of a forthwegian his men had caught a couple of days before along with the noose the fellow had a placard tied round his neck this is what you get if you blaze at an algarvian it warned in algarvian classical kaunian and presumably forthwegian although spinello couldnt read that last that kind of warning would have deterred him some forthwegians though were willing even eager to kill algarvians regardless of whether it cost them their lives it usually did and painfully but they were still hard to guard against he peered across the twegen again the river wasnt very wide had the unkerlanters wanted to force a crossing they probably could have done it instead they seemed content for the time being to pound eoforwic to pieces while they built up their forces some of them were walking along the riverbank as openly as if they were back in their own kingdom crystallomancer spinello shouted in some annoyance he had to shout it more than once which annoyed him further here sir a smoothcheeked youngster said at last spinello shook his head the youth looked like an apprentice not a real soldier but he would have to do connect me to our eggtossers spinello said those whoresons over there need to learn some respect for us aye sir the crystallomancer did make the etheric connection with commendable speed go ahead sir thank you spinello stared into the crystal at the image of a gruff officer who might have fought in the six years war he quickly explained what he wanted aye we can do that the veteran said cant have those bastards think they rule the roost even if they do eh he gestured sharply spinello supposed to his own crystallomancer spinellos crystal flared and then went inert a few minutes later eggs began bursting on the east side of the twegen the rain kept spinello from seeing as much as he would have liked but swemmels soldiers wouldnt go for their afternoon stroll along the riverbank any more he was sure of that theyd hide in holes the way he did the ones not too seared by sorcerous energy to worry about hiding ever again all that might have been true but the unkerlanters also took revenge spinello wondered how many eggtossers they had there on the other side of the twegen plenty to knock down big chunks of eoforwic that had somehow stayed standing through the forthwegian uprising plenty to stir around the chunks that had already fallen down and to make big chunks into little ones and plenty to make spinello laugh there in his hole with his face pressed to the earth and with his heart pounding from fear he couldnt quell the unkerlanters could have pounded eoforwic just as hard while the algarvians were crushing the uprising they could have but they hadnt and why should they have he wondered we were doing their dirty work for them now they have to do their own the other obvious implication there was that swemmels soldiers thought they could overrun eoforwic whenever they chose hed been fighting them for three years he had the nasty feeling they knew what they were about what does that say about algarve he thought at the ground quivered beneath him like an animal in pain does it say were going to lose the war if he looked at things rationally he couldnt see how it would say anything else but war wasnt altogether a rational business hed seen enough of it to know that too if our secret sorceries come to fruition or even if the lagoans and kuusamans get sick of staying allied to that madman of a swemmel it could happen many stranger things had happened being something of a student of history spinello knew as much lagoas and kuusamo were civilized kingdoms why would they stay in harness with a barbarian maniac like swemmel especially when they were all fighting against another civilized kingdom like algarve kaunians the word tolled in his mouth like an iron bell seeming louder than all the eggs bursting around and behind him but then he shook his head lagoans and kuusamans werent kaunian folk lagoans were algarvic with blood ties to algarve and sibiu why should they care what happened to blonds theyd fought plenty of wars against kaunian valmiera they dont want algarve lord of all derlavai that made spinello laugh too though he didnt really find it funny so they help swemmel against us and unkerlant becomes lord of all derlavai what good does that do them he laughed again thats the next war it isnt this one who worries about tomorrow when hes fighting to stay alive today the algarvians were fighting to stay alive today fighting in a way lagoas and kuusamo werentand having less luck with it somewhere not far away from spinello someone started screaming he cursed the scream had words and some of them he recognized as algarvian he wouldnt have cared much what happened to a forthwegian but a countryman was a countryman before he thought about what he was doing he popped out of his hole and ran toward the screams one of his troopers was doing the same thing get down colonel the soldier yelled his voice coming to spinello by fits and starts through the roar of the bursting eggs shut up spinello said the soldier didnt argue spinello almost wished he would have ive got a ribbon with my wound badge he thought do i really want another one he might easily get killed too but he refused even to think about that he couldnt do anything about it anyhow you could dive into a hole fool the rational part of his mind insisted but then he spotted the wounded algarvian and loped toward him the trooper followed it was he saw as he stooped beside the hurt man the crystallomancer whod put him in touch with the eggtossers belly the trooper said glancing at the wound thats not so good i know spinello didnt want to look at it here son he gave the crystallomancer a long draught of opiumlaced spirits it wasnt much but it was the best he could do when he started to put a dressing on the wound the crystallomancer only half conscious tried to fight him off the trooper grabbed the wounded mans hands were going to have to get him to the healers he said as spinello worked spinello tapped his wound badge my pals didnt let me down when i got hurt time to pay them back the common soldier only nodded he wore a wound badge too and already had two ribbons under it when they lifted the crystallomancer he shrieked like a cursed soul then mercifully he did pass out they half carried half dragged him back to a battered buildingmore battered now than spinello remembered it where healers were hard at work the place smelled of smoke and unwashed men and the butchershop odor of blood and the latrine stink of pierced entrails spinello did his best to hide his shudder hed been in places like this before when he was the one who suffered the smells made his body remember and remember too well hey quacks the trooper said perhaps hiding his own unease with bravado weve got another one for you to practice on a harried healer hurried over he took one look at the crimsoned soaking bandages and winced belly wound eh we cant do much with that here well have to put him on ice and ship him back to algarve maybe they can help him back there maybe not hell have some kind of chance anyway with a nod spinello said thats about what i thought a dragon had flown him out of sulingen after a sniper put a beam through the right side of his chest now he could take a more detached interest in the proceedings a couple of eggs burst close enough to make the ground shake under his feet irritably the healer said dont they ever run out of those cursed things almost on cue the pounding of eoforwic eased who knows spinello said in glad surprise maybe they do not bloody likely the healer put on a pair of long thick obviously insulated gloves he called for a colleague who did the same thing the two men lifted the crystallomancer and set him down in a box that looked something like a coffin and something like a rest crate without the gloves the spell inside the box would have sorcerously frozen their hands and arms in short order too the healer muttered a charm over the box then he scrawled on the outside a diagnosis in the muchabbreviated classical kaunian medical men used with a nod to spinello he said well get him out of here what happens after that is in the hands of the powers above i hope he comes through all right spinello said well need all the mages of any sort we can get our hands on i wish i could say you were wrong the healer answered when we start using our secret sorceries aye by the powers above spinello broke in eagerly youre a sorcerer yourself how soon do you think that will be i dont know the healer said i wish i did but only mezentio and i suppose a few of our firstrank mages could tell you for certain i will say this thoughit had better be soon it certainly should spinello said weve lost everything we ever got in unkerlant and so many men to go with that were practically back to the point where we were when we started fighting swemmel and the east he didnt want to think about the east he didnt want to think about the unkerlanters not being checked here in the west eitherthey were only gathering themselves for the next leap forward all true every word of it the healer sounded glum but thats not the worst the worst is where are we going to get the blonds to make the secret sorceries work i dont know spinello answered i wish i did we can start grabbing ordinary forthwegians i supposeor yaninans those filthy traitors on that gloomy note he took his leave he saw some ordinary forthwegians going through the ruins of eoforwic every so often one of them would stoop and put something in a basket gathering mushrooms he thought and made a face at the very idea algarvians didnt eat mushrooms as far as spinello was concerned people who did deserved whatever happened to them snow already lay thick on the ground in the naantali district pekka wasnt surprised it would be snowing down in kajaani too and kajaani had the sea to moderate its climate some of the mages from the northern more temperate parts of kuusamo and lagoas complained about the weather they couldnt do anything about itwhat mage couldbut that didnt stop them from complaining me ive come to like it better this time of year fernao said you can go outside without the mosquitoes eating you alive its only weather pekka said ignoring snowstorms in midautumn with the ease of someone who took hard winters for granted what i have to complain about isnt the snow its those she pointed first to one of the heavy sticks now emplaced around the hostel and the blockhouse then to another and another when she looked up to the sky she caught a glimpse of a patrolling dragon through a break in the clouds overhead the dragon was painted in a pattern of sky blue and sea green the colors of kuusamo we have a saying in lagoas fernao paused probably translating it into kuusaman from his own language trying to make soup after the dog has stolen the bone exactly pekka said how are the algarvians going to reach us now theyve left most of valmiera their dragons cant possibly fly here from the lands they still hold and none of these things were in place when that cursed dragon did attack us fernao took her hand she squeezed his when leino came home she would have a lot of things to worry about a lot of choices to make she knew as much meanwhile she enjoyed each dayand each nightas if tomorrow would never come later what was later slowly fernao said saying what the algarvians cant possibly do worries me a little theyve already done too many things nobody thought they could do too many things nobody thought they would do pekka said which wasnt quite the same thing too many things nobody thought anyone would do now fernao squeezed her hand what weve done here has gone a long way toward keeping people from doing things like that again thats mostly thanks to you you know to you and your experiments pekka shook her head master siuntio is the one who really deserves the credit and master ilmarinen i just did the work they were the ones who saw id stumbled onto something important and figured out what it meant you dont give yourself enough credit fernao said you never have nonsense pekka said and then i got a letter from my sister this morning shed wanted to change the subject and she succeeded fernao walked along in silence for a little while kicking up snow at every step at last he asked and what does she have to say nothing too much pekka answered olavins solicitors paid a call on her she wasnt very happy about that i believe it in fernaos long pale lagoan face his slanted eyes were usually a reminder that he had a little kuusaman blood in him too now though they just made his expression harder to read after a few more silent paces he said are we going to have to worry about that one of these days pekka had forced the future out of her purview now fernao brought it back she wished he hadnt i dont know she said i just dont know she kicked up some snow of her ownkicked it at fernao in fact lets go back to the hostel she turned and started off without waiting to see whether he followed he did and went up the steps only a pace behind her whatever happens well see it through he said what else can we do she said wishing he would keep quiet werent men supposed to be the ones who didnt want to commit themselves that didnt fit fernao he wanted to run away with her she was the one full of doubts full of complications she sighed why couldnt things be simpler going into the hostel certainly made things no simpler there stood ilmarinen just inside the front entrance he had been talking with a couple of the workmen still busy repairing the hostel after the algarvian attack but when he saw pekka and fernao together he broke off and came over to them and what were the two of you doing out there he purred by the way he said it the question could have only one possible answer but pekka replied dont be silly its much too cold outside for that ilmarinen looked disappointed fernao asked him and what have you been doing in here aye what have you been doing pekka echoed have you finished the calculations i asked you for the other day to her surprise ilmarinen nodded theyre finished all right and pekka asked when he said no more and its just what we thought it was the master mage answered grimly did you think the calculations would show it wouldnt work not bloody likely not after weve spent all this time tearing up the landscape around here you dont sound happy fernao observed though much the shorter of the two ilmarinen contrived to look down his nose at fernao should i what the algarvians visited on yliharma now we can visit on trapani shall i throw my hat in the air shall i shout huzzah now we can match the barbarians in barbarism huzzah indeed better that we be able to match them than that we not be able to match them pekka said thats the assumption weve been working on no ilmarinen shook his head the assumption weve been working on is that they had better not be able to match our new sorcery and they bloody well cant not so far as we can tell but that we use what we have for the same purposes as they use what they have he shook his head again no by the powers above we can do many more things with ours fernao said once the war is over it will turn the world upside down but for now he shrugged for now we do what needs doing and that means beating algarve theyre using it the right way up in jelgava throwing the algarvians spells back in their faces ilmarinen said mezentios mages deserve that and so do his soldiers but the other no he sounded very certain how is it any different from sending dragons over their cities to drop eggs on them pekka asked thats just war ilmarinen said everybody does it the otheryou wouldnt we wouldnt just be hurting a city if that ever happened and you know it pekka grimaced he wasnt wrong however much she wished he were but she didnt think she was wrong either as she answered we have to do what needs doing do we ilmarinen said dont you suppose the algarvian mages say the same old thingthe same old liejust before their soldiers start blazing kaunians or however they go about killing them to get their life energy thats not fair pekka said were not killing anyone to get the energy for our magecraft no thats truewere not and so what ilmarinen said if we use it the way you have in mind well be killing plenty on the other end thats different fernao said if you cant get a man to listen to you you hit him if he hits you you get a club if he hits you with a club you get a sword if he hits you with a sword you get a stick if he blazes at you with a stick you go after him with a behemoth and so on i dont like thinking of myself as a murderer ilmarinen said ill do it mind you but i dont like it think of the algarvians as murderers then pekka said they are you know even master siuntio thought this fight was worth makingand mezentios mages killed him remember im not likely to forget not when they came so bloody close to killing me too ilmarinen replied but im sick of war im sick of killing arent you of course i am pekka said but the fastest way to win it is the way fernao said to knock the algarvians down till they cant get up any more do you truly think anything else would do the job im not surprised you agree with him ilmarinen said and then laughed ah thereive gone and made you angry i wonder why youve made me angry all right pekka said tightly and ill tell you why because you didnt try to answer my question thats why you just took a cheap blaze at me now answer if youd be so kind do you think anything else would do the job or not this time ilmarinen hesitated before speaking even so he didnt quite answer her question what he said was theres more to you than meets the eye do you know that i dont much care pekka said im going to ask you a third time and i expect a straight answer can we beat the algarvians and the gyongyosians any other way than by knocking them flat asking ilmarinen for a straight answer could easily prove as frustrating as asking a toddler to stop making a nuisance of himself pekka didnt get one now either the master mage smiled at her till she wanted to punch him in the teeth he said ill give you the calculations tonight then irrepressible he leered ill just slide them under the door so ill be sure not to interrupt anything with a sweet carnivorous smile he strode away pekka glared after him fernao set a hand on her shoulder the more he gets you angry the more he wins thats what hes after you know no pekka shook her head youre close but youre not quite right the more he drives me crazy the more he wins hes good at it too hes been driving everyone crazy for the past fifty years well then dont worry about him fernao said she laughed as mockingly as ilmarinen had tell the sun not to come up tomorrow as long as youre in a mood to give advice she wondered if that might anger fernao instead he answered soberly ive been where the sun sometimes doesnt come up for weeksthe land of the ice people it can happen and you can ignore ilmarinen its not easy she said and then seized his hand come to my room if anything will help me do it that will had she ever been so blunt with leino she had trouble remembering in any case right now she wanted to forget ilmarinen did slide papers under her door and chose a very distracting moment to do it too a little while later fernao said i wonder if he did that on purpose he ran his hand along her flank the distraction hadnt ruined things pekka felt sated and lazytoo lazy to get up and get the papers on the instant she said he could tell by sorcery if he wanted to badly enough but i dont think he would bother i hope he wouldnt bother i hope youre right fernao answered are you going to see what the calculations say eventually pekka said part of me wants to know but the rest the restshe confessed to fernao what she would never have told anyone else wonders if ilmarinen isnt absolutely right though i wouldnt tell him that in a thousand years not when we have to do this come what may she felt a little better when fernao leaned over and kissed her but much better when he nodded to show he felt the same way the unkerlanter mage nodded to leudastthere you are lieutenant the fellow said all your flesh is the same age again leudast tried the leg that had been wounded without a doubt it felt worse than it had before the sorcerer cast his spell but he could still use it he nodded thanks he said the fellow who helped heal my wound by aging it warned me to make sure i got rid of the spell once it had served its purpose i believe that the wizard said after a moments thoughtful hesitation he went on do you mind if i ask you something go ahead leudast had a pretty good idea of what was coming and sure enough the wizard said how did your healer decide to use that particular charm on you very often we reserve it for ah special cases what do you mean special cases leudast asked in turn the mage didnt answer but leudast had little trouble drawing his own conclusions it had to mean something like people more important than a lieutenant with a peasant accent he said marshal rathar personally promoted me that had impressed the healer whod treated him it impressed this mage too he said no wonder the man used it with you then not what you knowwho you know leudast had had that thought before anybody could become a sergeant going that far was easy if you were a good soldierand if the algarvians didnt kill you of course hed been pretty lucky getting away with only two wounds he wondered how many unkerlanter soldiers whod started the war with the redheads were still in it then he wondered how many of them had become officers hed been lucky in more than staying alive and he knew it youre ready to go lieutenant now that the sorcerer knew leudast knew marshal rathar or at least that rathar knew himhe was noticeably more polite thanks very much leudast used a little politeness himself he strode out of the yaninan farmhouse the regimental healer was using out into a rain that was beginning to freeze his leg did hurt a good deal more than it had before hed had the other wizards spell removed he limped a little he didnt care hed already waited longer than he should have to get rid of that magic over the next month he knew exactly how much the limb would improve and i know i wont get killed in the next month too he thought had he been about to die his leg would have told him of it i can be as reckless as i want on the field the algarvians cant touch me for a month ive got a charmed life but was that really true what would happen if say he picked up a stick right now and blazed out his own brains hed be dead and his leg wouldnt have warned him about it he shook his head to clear it thinking about such things was as likely to make that head ache as drinking too deep from a jar of spirits he laughed under his breath it wasnt nearly so much fun either his company occupied the rest of the village or what was left of it the algarvians had made a stand here a few days before and most of the huts actually the houses were a good deal finer than those in peasant villages in unkerlanthad either burned or gone up in bursts of sorcerous energy in the nasty process of forcing them out the ones who hadnt got out still lay here and there no one had bothered burying the corpses only the chilly weather kept the stink from being worse than it was some of the men who couldnt fit into the handful of houses still boasting walls and roofs kept dry in tents plundered from the redheads the rest made do with their greatcoats and stout felt boots the unkerlanter army did issue those to everyone even if swemmels men might not get tents or for that matter much in the way of food but regardless of whether swemmels quartermasters got supplies to them the soldiers had no trouble keeping themselves fed brass pots bubbled over fires the rain made smoky but couldnt douse even the men who had only greatcoats seemed contented enough one thing unkerlanters knew was how to take care of themselves in the cold and rain once upon a time leudast had assumed everybody all over the world knew such things the trouble the redheads had in the snow the first winter of the war taught him otherwise so did the fancy food and shelters he and his comrades kept taking from dead algarvians how could anyone who needed so much help to fight a war in bad weather seriously expect to win it trying without much luck not to limp on his injured leg leudast went over to one of the stewpots and took out his mess tin a cook with the hood to his greatcoat protecting his face ladled the tin full there you go sir he said his voice was curiously neutral leudast hadnt been with the company long enough to have created much of an impression for good or ill thanks he said now and dug in with a tin spoon the stew was hot which felt good it had barley and oats and some rather nasty vegetablesthe yaninans ate things unkerlanters didntand bits of meat prodding one of those with his spoon leudast asked do i want to know what this is could be cursed near anything sir the cook answered theres chunks of two three different beasts in the pots these days behemoth and horse and unicorn maybe even some real pork too but im not sure about that i wont worry about it leudast said whatever it is itll keep me goingand it doesnt taste too bad the cook beamed when he added that eggs started bursting not very far to the east as always the algarvians fought hard over every inch of ground they yielded they counterattacked whenever they saw the chance it was as if they were saying to the unkerlanters if you think you can beat us you re going to have to pay the price the ground shook under leudasts feet for a moment he thought the eggs accounted for that but then somebody said more behemoths coming in he looked back toward the west toward unkerlant sure enough the big burly beasts were plenty to make the ground tremble whats it like up ahead one of the men on the lead behemoth called as the beasts squelched forward what do you think its going to be like leudast answered there are redheads up there and they wont kiss you when they see you well kiss them by the powers above the fellow riding the behemoth leaned over to pat the heavy stick mounted on the beasts armored back well kiss them with this well kiss anybody who gets in our way you bet we will good they deserve it leudast paused then asked have you had any trouble from the yaninans not much theyd be sorry if they gave us any ill tell you that the man on the behemoth said some of em like us better than mezentios whoresons and thats fine some of em like the algarvians better i expect but they havent had the nerve to show it and theyd better not the army is on our side leudast snorted aye ive heard the same thing and itll do us just as much good as it ever did the algarvians it can soak up some casualties the behemoth crewman said better the yaninans than us youre right about that weve paid our share and then some leudast said the fellow on the behemoth nodded and waved the beast trudged forward its big feet came out of the mud one after another with heavy squelching sounds despite the snowshoes that spread its weight the whole long column of behemoths followed by the time they all went through the road was a river of ooze stinking of behemoth dung one of leudasts men said therell be another big fight coming up pretty soon they dont move behemoths forward unless they mean it youre probably right leudast answered only thing we can do about it is try and whip the redheads and not get hurt too bad ourselves that would be good the soldier didnt sound as if he thought it were very likely to happen though had leudast been the stuffy sort of officer he would have given the man a hard time and lectured him about efficiency since hed never been able to stand that kind of officer before getting promoted himself he kept his mouth shut before long the regimental commanderhimself only a captaincame into the village with orders we go forward this afternoon aye sir leudast nodded i thought as much when the behemoths came through earlier in the day youre no fool are you the captain saidhis name was drogden theres plenty whod tell you otherwise sir leudast said and got a laugh from drogden before going on my guess is ive just seen a lot of war our whole kingdom has seen a lot of war and my guess is that weve got a good deal more to see yet before the redheads are licked captain drogden said my guess is thats a pretty good guess leudast said drogden nodded he was an older man close to forty weatherbeaten enough to show hed seen a lot of war too maybe he was a jumpedup sergeant like leudast or maybe hed spent a long long time as a lieutenant aye the algarvians have no quit in em he said thats plain enough but still and all thingsll be different once we finally go and break into algarve his voice held an odd anticipation different how sir leudast asked ill tell you how the regimental commander said we get to pay those whoresons back for everything they did to unkerlant when their peckers were up thats how we can burn their farms pretty cursed soon we can wreck their villages our mages can tear up their ley line and speaking of peckers up we can throw their women down on the ground and do what we want with them leudast grunted he knew the algarvians had done such things in the unkerlanter territory theyd overrun powers above ive never even seen a redheaded woman before he said neither have i but if we dont get blazed i expect were going to it should be fun with a leer drogden slapped him on the back spread the word through your company itll give the men something extra to fight for most of his troopers leudast discovered had already had that thought for themselves some looked forward to it but one man said far as im concerned we should just kill all the algarvians the men and the women both then we wont have to worry about em ever again leudast couldnt deny that that notion held more than a little appeal for him too when the attack went in that afternoon the unkerlanters pushed forward for a couple of miles without much trouble then they came to the skamandros river which the rain had made too wide and swift to ford and discovered that the redheads had wrecked all the bridges over it they also discovered that the algarvians had a demon of a lot of wellconcealed eggtossers on the far bank what now leudast asked when he saw captain drogden again now we wait for the artificers to make some new bridges or else for our dragons and eggtossers to smash up the redheads and give us some kind of chance to cross drogden answered dont know what else we can do its not so bad sir leudast said were moving forward and that counts for more than anything else sidroc hadnt liked unkerlanters and they werent that much different from forthwegians now that the algarvian army was forced back into yanina and plegmunds brigade with it he discovered that he really didnt like yaninans wheres your food he demanded of a skinny villager with cold dark eyes and a big gray mustache he said it in forthwegian and then in algarvian the yaninan looked back at him shrugged and spread his hands as if to say he didnt understand blaze the son of a whore ceorl suggested thatll teach him it wont do us any good though sidroc said here watch me be as efficient as an unkerlanter go inside the house there and bring out this bastards wife dont get rough with her or anything but bring her ceorl laughed ill do it i think i know what youve got in mind in he went the yaninan villager looked alarmed he looked a lot more alarmed when the woman cried out but when he took a step toward the house sidroc aimed his stick at the fellows face dont even think about it pal he said either the words or the gesture got through the yaninan froze though his mouth twisted in a snarl of hate out came ceorl manhandling a graying woman about half his size sidroc knew no yaninan but he was sure she was calling ceorl everything she could ceorl realized that too i hope the old shitter stays clammed up he said id enjoy doing in this bitch well find out in a minute sidroc switched back to algarvian one more time pal where is the food shell be sorry if you keep quiet looking daggers at him the yaninan answered in pretty good algarvian of his own dig under the water barrel he looked as if he wanted to say a good deal more than that but he bit it back that was one of the wiser things hed ever done no sidroc gestured you dig pal and you had better come up with some good stuff too he went into the house with the yaninan and watched the skinny old man dig up the dirt floor what came out was plenty to satisfy him hams and sausages all securely wrapped to keep them safe while they were out of sight at his delighted exclamation ceorl came in to see too well all right the ruffian said enthusiastically i guess we let the old whore live you see sidroc said to the yaninan you just saved your wife but the two of you this is too much for you the man with the gray mustache said weve got friends sidroc grabbed a long string of sausages come on ceorl lend a hand between them they did a good job of plundering the peasants larder when they showed their comrades what theyd got they were the heroes of the moment havent eaten this well since we got out of forthweg sergeant werferth said he was exaggerating but not by a great deal sudaku the blond from the phalanx of valmiera whod broken out of the mandelsloh pocket with the men of plegmunds brigade nodded good food he said in algarvian he was eating enough for two himself if we had more spirits wed have more spirits ceorl said and laughed loudly at his own wit sidroc chuckled too he wasnt going to let a fellow forthwegian down not even a son of a whore like ceorl werferth said maybe you ought to go shake down that yaninan of yours again if he hid the food under the water barrel hes probably got a distillery on the roof i would not be a bit surprised sidroc saidin algarvian so the men who werent forthwegians but had attached themselves to the now motley unit could understand he nodded to ceorl what do you say we go have a look probably find that ugly bastard and his uglier woman drunk and screwing their brains out ceorl started to heave himself to his feet before he got upright eggs started landing not far away he threw himself flat so did sidroc so did all the men whod been sharing the booty theyd found veterans knew better than to stay on their feet or even sitting when the unkerlanters started getting frisky more of the eggs landed west of the yaninan village than square on it that cheered sidroc but not for long a couple of minutes later algarvians and a few forthwegians and a couple of the valmieran kaunians whod taken service with king mezentio came running back from their forward positions in the din he needed a little while to catch what they were shouting when he did he wished he hadnt it was behemoths unkerlanter behemoths sergeant werferth stuck his head up in the hope of spotting an algarvian officeror perhaps in the hope of not spotting one when he didnt he spoke in algarvian i am in charge here we are going to get over that river east of the village as quick as we can we have no hope of fighting their behemoths without some of our own that was a bitter truth the men of plegmunds brigade and the algarvians had learned in too many encounters throughout eastern unkerlant sidroc said once were over the bridgehe hoped there was a bridge hed swum one stream to escape swemmels soldiers and didnt want to have to try it againwed better wreck it to keep the enemy from getting a foothold on the other side sounds good to me ceorl said sergeant werferth only shrugged hed always paid more attention to the proper rules of soldiering and less to what would save his own neck than made sidroc comfortable but he was the one whod ordered the retreat he didnt expect his men to do the impossible too many of them had died trying sidrocs boots squelched through mud that would slow the behemoths down too even if it wouldnt slow them down so much as he would have liked here over here that was an algarvian voice and one full of the authority the redheads effortlessly assumed here is the crossing of the skamandros we shall pass over it hold it open as long as we can and then destroy it to keep the unkerlanters from following there you see sidroc said cheerfully i ought to be an officer you ought to get a good kick in the slats ceorl also sounded cheerful as if he would have enjoyed delivering the kick all things considered he probably would have the bridge when they reached it was wooden and narrow a miserable rickety piece of work like a lot of the things sidroc had seen in yanina behemoths would have a demon of a time crossing on this he said as he started across it himself dont want footsoldiers crossing either werferth said swemmels whoresons are downright nasty when it comes to grabbing bridgeheads he was without a doubt right about that sidroc sighed with relief when he stepped into the mud on the far bank the unkerlanters would be a while crossing anyhow a couple of algarvian mages stood on the eastern bank of the skamandros one said to the other well give it a few minutes more and then bring down the bridge we dont want to let the unkerlanters get close enough to try a counterspell and stop us thats the truth the other wizard said ive still got hopes of living to get old and gray and crotchety a few behemoths in the wrong place dont do those plans any good they both laughed algarvians took pride in absurdity sidroc didnt he was just glad hed got over the river before the redheads sorcerously smashed the bridge to me called the algarvian officer whod known where the crossing was theres a village ahead we can shelter in it who knows sidroc said maybe the stinking yaninans will have more hams buried under the water barrel heres hoping marching made him weary as it always did but he wasnt hungry that in itself made a pleasant novelty he hadnt gone far before a rending crash behind him announced the demise of the bridge if swemmels sorcerers had tried a counterspell it hadnt worked sergeant werferth said keep moving boys the sooner we get to this village wherever it is the happier well be the village wasnt far ahead yapping dogs announced its presence before the road came out from among a grove of fruit trees and let sidroc see it hed had the same thing happen more than once back in unkerlant keep moving the algarvian officer commanded leading from the front as his kind usually did were going to dig in here were going to stop the unkerlanters in their tracks as his kind usually did he sounded utterly certain of that what difference did it make that powersaboveonlyknewhowmany similar declarations had been wrong before sidroc knew what difference it made wed cursed well better stop swemmels bastards he said we havent got a lot of room left to play around with he scowled at the village ahead and at the dogs trying to nerve themselves for a run at the soldiers tramping up the road towards them weve got to keep trying no matter what sergeant werferth said if we dont were cooked on account of he suddenly stopped talking he suddenly stopped walking too crumpling down to the roadway as if he were a marionette with cut strings he twitched a couple of times and lay still hes dead ceorl said in slow wonder i fornicating cant believe it i was fornicating sure hed outlive every fornicating one of us that thought had gone through sidrocs mind too now only anger filled him he pointed ahead the beam came from that first house there i saw it now we pay back the bastard who did it now we pay back the whole fornicating village said sudaku the man from the phalanx of valmiera he might be only a kaunian sidroc thought but hes a pretty cursed good soldier a low growl ran through the menforthwegians kaunians and algarvians everyone whod known werferth had liked him and he was one of their own and a civilian sniper had blazed him they shook themselves out into a skirmish line and advanced on the village at a purposeful trot most of the dogs in front of it fled yelping in dismay the soldiers blazed the ones that didnt another beam winked at them from that farmhouse window this time it didnt hit anybody a couple of soldiers blazed back while others moved toward the farmhouse along with the rest sidroc trotted into the village out he shouted in algarvian out out out a dozen a score of voices took up the cry a couple of men even knew how to say it in yaninan confused and frightenedlooking villagers started coming forth sidroc blazed the first one he saw a woman a few years older than he was she fell with a shriek the rest of the yaninans cried out in horror then their yells turned to agony too for all the men who fought for mezentio started blazing at them it was vengeance swift and sure vengeance a hundredfold for the soldier their countryman had slain afterwards sidroc remembered the massacre in red fragments an old man with no teeth yammering in mushy terror mouth open very wide till sidrocs beam blew out the back of his head a young man charging the soldiers but falling before he could use his fists the only weapons he had a young woman running and then twisting every which way as three beams caught her at once a fat grandmother standing and dying so she almost blocked the doorway to her house the little girl who came out when the grandmothers body didnt block the doorway well enough and who died a moment later too it didnt take long the massacre they had it coming sidroc said a few yaninans still writhed and moaned most lay where they had fallen of course they had it coming the young algarvian officer said now dig in i dont know how long the line of the skamandros will hold the unkerlanters not long enough curse it he was likely right about that sidroc got to work twenty somewhere not far ahead the algarvians waited leino knew it sometime soon they would try to strike back the kuusaman mage didnt know that not for a fact but he felt it in his boots mezentios men had already yielded half of jelgavamore than half farther to the south if they were going to hold the armies of kuusamo and lagoas away from their own border they would have to strike back soon he started to say as much to xavega but she picked that moment to look up from the grimoire she was studying and announce its too hot in here well so it is leino said you could always go outside the tent for some air it will be too hot out there too even in clean abstract classical kaunian xavega had no trouble sounding querulous this is autumn the weather should be changing it has changed leino said xavega shook her head sending copper curls flying but he went on it was much too hot now it is only too hot jelgava is a warm kingdom much warmer than either kuusamo or lagoas disgusting xavega said i am always as sweaty as if we had just finished making love she put the grimoire aside and glanced over at him since i am already sweaty shall we without waiting for an answer she started undoing the toggles of her tunic leino went to her everything they had that was worth keeping they had in bed here in this tent in a couple of narrow lumpy uncomfortable cots he stroked her she was sweaty in short order so was he he might have been bloody too her nails had scored his back afterwards she dressed quicklyno lazing in the afterglow and she went back to studying the grimoire with the same dour intensity after a few minutes she looked up and said this is the strangest sorcery i have ever had to learn i think it is fascinating leino said and whenever he studied that sorcery he saw pekkas handprints all through it she hadnt said much about what she was doing ever since the war started shed been very closemouthed about her work but everything leino saw in these spells corresponded to the little hints hed got from her he understood now why shed kept so quiet this is a cleaner way to get more out of sorcery than the algarvians do with all their murders what could be better than that i will tell you what could be better xavega answered at once the spells could be in lagoan or even in classical kaunian because they are in kuusaman i have to learn them phonetically and i do not see how anyone pronounces your language i have no trouble with it leino said laughing now the sneezes and sounds through your nose that go into lagoani think no sensible language should have those lagoan is a beautiful language xavega said lagoan is the most beautiful language in the world only sibian and algarvian even come close you think so because theyre algarvic languages too leino thought he didnt raise the issue with xavega some things simply werent worth arguing about before he could find some safe way of steering them away from the beauty or lack of some in lagoan a soldier outside did it for him by calling out in kuusaman you wizards decent in there how noisy had xavega been leino hadnt paid close attention to that doing his best not to sound embarrassed he answered aye what needs doing the soldier stuck his head into the tent xavega squawked she hadnt followed the brief conversation still speaking kuusaman the soldier said sorry to bother you but weve got a jelgavan here he speaks some classical kaunian can you translate aye ill do that leino replied in kuusaman he translated the exchange for xavega then added unless you would rather no you go ahead she said you would have to translate for me if i did it this way i can keep studying here you see how efficient i amjust like our allies to the west by her expression she didnt mean that as a compliment to the unkerlanters fair enough leino said no point discussing what he thought or didnt think of king swemmel and swemmels kingdom not right now he returned to kuusaman telling the officer take me to this jelgavan then the blond proved bigger and younger than hed expected hail i am talsu son of traku he said and then had to stop and think as the officer had said he knew some classical kaunian but he wasnt fluent in it as an educated man would have been after that pause he went on algarvian line amuh isbefore the town of skrunda aye of course leino answered and it was indeed of course the islanders had been tapping at that line for most of a week but hadnt yet found a weak spot then he realized why the jelgavan might have come so he asked do you know a way through it talsu son of traku nodded i do i am living in skrunda all of mine life i amwasin army of king donalitu s now i am irregular hereabouts he could make himself understood even if his grammar left something to be desired but leino said did not the irregulars in these parts suffer a great blow not long ago that am truth talsu said grimly we not can to fight much but i am knowing the of the barbarians position i am knowing way past it men can to go behemothses can to go he murdered conjugations declensions and syntax leino didnt care he liked what he was hearing regardless of how it was phrased when he translated for the kuusaman officer that worthys smile said he liked it pretty well too he said tell this fellow well find him an officer or two who can follow kaunian and he can lead them and they can lead our men well flank those fornicating algarvians right out of their boots when leino translated that quite literally talsus pale eyes lit up with a fierce fire let us bring woe to the barbarians he declared and then with a grin that made him look even younger than he was hortatory subjunctive i remember how to make good leino said not smiling so broadly as he would have liked right now i think remembering how to make trouble for the algarvians is more important even so talsu agreed when he stuck to stock phrases he did well enough i will come with you until we find a combat officer with whom you can talk leino said i am only a mage i fear i am not worth much in the field if you can stop the of the barbarians sorcery you are worth of much talsu said you can to save many of kaunians blood after leino turned that into kuusaman the officer whod got him nodded and said hes right leino nodded too he couldnt very well disagree the officer continued well lets find some more overeducated types who call tell what this fellows going on about it would be handy if more of us spoke jelgavan leino said itd be even handier if this bastard spoke kuusaman the officer said come on with me i have two or three fellows i can ask he had to go through five men before finding two who could handle classical kaunian tolerably well when he did he gave leino half a bow i think you can get back to whatever you were doing before sir his eyes twinkled maybe youll be ready to do it again that would be nice leino said dryly but i dont think id better if you do go and outflank mezentios men they wont stop at anything to push you back i dont know what that means as far as fighting goes but i know just what it means when you talk about magecraft i think xavega and i ought to be ready to try to block it youre right the officers lips skinned back from his teeth in what looked like a smile but wasnt heres hoping you dont have to do what youre ready to try please to translate talsu said leino pretended he hadnt heard the jelgavan already knew what the algarvians might do leino didnt feel like talking about it he knew what he and xavega were supposed to do if mezentios men did start their sorcerystart murdering blonds he glossed mentally but hed never tried the counterspells and didnt care to dwell on that or even to admit it confidence counted for a great deal in a mage when he got back to the tent he found xavega so deeply immersed in the grimoire she hardly noticed his return that pleased him they both needed to be ready to do what they could against the algarvians after a while she did glance up from the book what did the jelgavan want she inquired leino explained xavega nodded let us hope he can do what he says he can hortatory subjunctive leino murmured she looked puzzled this time he didnt explain instead he said if we do look like flanking them they are liable to start killing people when they do we shall feel them we cannot help but feel them and we shall have to try to stop them and turn their accursed sorcery back on them that made xavega turn serious on the instant she said you are right of course i think the first time you had better do the incanting draw on me for power i will give you everything i have but i am not positive i can cast a proper spell in kuusaman let it be as you say leino replied if you are not positive you can you should not try not when you would be going into the teeth of the algarvians conjuration my thought exactly xavega said thank you for seeing things the same way and not reckoning me a coward what an algarvic notion leino thought we kuusamans mostly have better sense than to try something we know is beyond us aloud he said anyone would haveeveryone does havegood reason to worry about what mezentios mages are doing to his surprise she kissed him not many lagoan men would be so understanding she said she was probably right too lagoans as hed thought only a little while before were cousins to the algarvians and if any folk in this war had tried something beyond their power it was the one mezentio led with soft muffled calls and the clank of armor on behemoths and their crewmen a goodsized force of kuusaman soldiers left the camp heading west leino hoped talsu knew what he was talking about he also hoped talsu wasnt leading his countrymen into a trap some few jelgavans loathed king donalitu enough to stay loyal to mezentio no matter what his men did to blonds then leino stopped caring about politics for xavega kissed him again more emphatically this time telling the kuusaman officer he wouldnt yield to temptation was one thing but he and xavega had both started getting undressed once more when they suddenly froze him with her nipple between his thumb and forefinger curse the algarvians he said his reasons now intimate along with the widerranging ones of the war but that heaviness in the air almost palpable to a sorcerer meant mezentios mages were murdering more kaunians now we find out what we can do xavega said aside from that i mean she let her hand rest affectionately on his crotch for a moment but then grabbed her tunic and started closing it once more probably just as well that she is leino thought i cant afford to be distracted not now not trying an important spell for the first time gathering himself he began the charm he was sure his wife had helped shape he tasted the irony once more then set it asidehe had no time for it now it too was a distraction so was xavega coming up behind him and setting a hand on his shoulder as he incanted but she was a necessary distraction here with the magecraft she gave unstintingly of herself more than she did in bed he felt power flowing from her into him as he chanted and made his passes and he felt the powers within both of them building as he shaped the spell building into a sorcerous lance he could aim at the redheads could use to oppose the darker power they were unleashing couldand did with a groan almost like the one he would have made at the end with xavega he loosed the force pent up inside him and he felt it strike home felt it pierce the enemys own potent magecraft whatever theyd been doing with their murderous magic it was ruined nowand so he thought were the wizards whod attempted it xavega felt the same thing eyes shining she turned him toward her and kissed him we did it she exclaimed leinos answering nod was dizzy for more reasons than one how much had the conjuration taken out of him not too much he hoped xavega dropped to her knees where were we she asked looking up at him with eyes full of mischief they hadnt been quite there but it seemed to leino as good a place as any and far better than most he set a hand on the back of her head urging her on this way talsu said to one of the kuusaman officers who spoke about as much classical kaunian as he did do you to see no barbarians here some on that side of hills others on this side but none here they not to know of way through here i see the dark little slanteyed man replied this is good if we get through this is very good i think now that we get through he spoke in his own oddly rhythmic language to his countrymen a couple of them answered in the same speech talsu understood not a word of it but he still would have guessed the kuusamans were pleased with the way things were going we give the algarvians right up the the kuusaman officer used a phrase talsu hadnt heard before he didnt even know whether the last couple of words were kuusaman or classical kaunian he didnt care very much either whatever language they were in he got the message he laughed out loud he liked it too he led the kuusamans on the winding track past skrunda the algarvians probably didnt even know it was there they couldnt find out everything about the kingdom theyd occupied and they wouldnt have needed to do any fighting here since the earliest days of their invasion if then plenty of people could have told the kuusamans and lagoans about it talsu happened to be the one who had if the kuusamans get in behind skrunda the redheads will have to pull back he thought and if they pull back they ii leave my family alone after that they ii have to because they wont be able to reach them powers above grant that everyone is still safe they wouldn t have done anything to them would they ill find out once the algarvians are gone ill find out thats what the kuusamans and the lagoans are good for driving out mezentios men we couldnt do it for ourselves but its still going to get done there he pointed for the kuusaman officer do you to see you are gone by skrunda now no algarvian positions here no barbarians here your men can to go ahead i see the foreigner said except for algarvians he was among the first foreigners talsu had ever dealt with he called out to his own men and to the behemoths with them then he slapped talsu on the back he had to reach up to do it he was a head shorter than the jelgavan and so were most of his countrymen he was short beside algarvians too but with a stick in his hands what size he was didnt matter much he grinned and repeated himself right up the aye talsu said fiercely the kuusaman called out again in his own language his men and behemoths went forward without the slightest hesitation they shared that trait with the algarvians when they found an opening they swarmed to take advantage of it talsu didnt think any part of the jelgavan army had ever moved so fast during this war that was a good reason why there was no jelgavan army any more unless king donalitu was reconstituting one in the lands the lagoan and kuusaman armies had regained for him from where talsu stood he could see a long way into the flat country west of skrunda he could see where the algarvians suddenly realized a dagger had been thrust through their defenses and he could see the kuusamans rushing past the redheads handful of pickets giving them enough attention to keep them from slowing things down and not a copper more that was another lesson mezentios men had taught another lesson the jelgavans hadnt learned what are you going to do about that you stinking whoresons talsu said almost hugging himself with glee how do you like it when it happens to you but then almost as soon as the words were out of his mouth the ground quivered under his feet like an animal in pain he cried out in horror and in fear the algarvians wasted no time hitting back either and he knew just how they were doing it with the life blood of kaunians what would what could the kuusamans do about that he waited for disaster to strike them as it had struck the band of irregulars of which hed been a part after they did too good a job of harassing the redheads talsu waited but that didnt happen what did happen was a flash of light somewhere off to the west almost at the edge of his vision and after that he felt no more of the sorcery that had wrecked his comrades in the steeper hills to the south what had the kuusamans done the first fellow hed talked to the one whod spoken classical kaunian really well had worn a mages badge had he had something to do with whatever had just happened how should i know talsu wondered it didnt really matter anyhow what mattered was that the redheads magic had failed them did the kuusamans here even know what their sorcerers had done talsu doubted it that didnt really matter either the redheads in these parts hadnt been able to stop their foes through force of magecraft now they would have to try through force of arms and i dont think theyve got the force of arms to do it not when their flank s been turned he wasnt he didnt have to be part of the battle for skrunda and the surrounding territory watching it unfold without risk to him was a rare luxury like expensive wine or extrasoft wool for a pair of trousers a steady stream of kuusaman soldiers slogged past him heading into the fight he waved to the men of each company they were doing his kingdom an enormous favor he wondered if they thought of it that way or whether they were as resigned to doing as they were told as he had been during his army days the latter he would have bet dragons flew low overhead dragons hard to spot because they were painted in kuusaman sky blue and sea green no algarvian dragons that he saw rose to challenge them he hadnt seen many algarvian dragons here in jelgava not at any time and especially not the past year or so where are they he thought defending algarve itself i suppose and trying to hold back the unkerlanters but mezentios soldiers in these parts are paying a big price because the redheads dont have enough that left him something less than brokenhearted he trudged forward sticking to the fields by the side of the track so the advancing kuusamans would get the benefit of the best ground before hed gone very far he passed a crater in the ground and a corpse with nastily mangled legs he gulped even if the algarvians didnt have soldiers covering this route theyd buried eggs in the ground to slow up an enemy advance haifa mile farther on lay a dead behemoth with its right hind leg only a bloody mess talsu gulped again here came some kilted algarvians back toward him they werent part of a counterattack none of them carried a stick and all of them held their hands high over their heads they were captives herded along by a couple of bowlegged little kuusamans when jelgava fell a handful of algarvians had taken a battalions worth of talsus countrymen into captivity now they were tasting the humiliation theyd dished out some of them looked weary more had that beatendog grin of relief at being alive going down onto lower ground meant talsu couldnt see skrunda anymore but he knew where it lay and made for it without hesitation he kept peering northwest for fear hed see a great column of greasy black smoke rising into the sky that would mean the redheads were fighting there or else that theyd fired the town to help cover their retreat he hoped they would do no such thing but knew he couldnt be sure what they might try to the kuusamans he was just one more civilian now he did his best to stay out of their way too some of them were liable to blaze first and ask questions later then the road rose and let him see his home town again he felt like cheeringit looked more or less intact he hurried toward it with the eagerness of a lover rushing toward his beloved and he was rushing toward his beloved too for gailisa was thereor he hoped with all his heart she was he trudged into skrunda an hour or so later the first thing he saw was two jelgavan bodies hanging from lampposts the placards tied round their necks said they fought against algarve neither of them was anybody talsu knew well he let out a silent sigh of relief at that he made for the grocers shop his fatherinlaw ran maybe gailisa would be there if she wasnt her father would surely know where she wasand he would know about talsus mother and father and sister too but the grocers shop wasnt there anymore talsu stared in startled dismay hed been away from skrunda for a couple of months now how many times had dragons come over the town and dropped eggs on it in one of those visits the grocers shop had gone up in flames as his own familys tailors shop had earlier now he had to hurry toward the tent city on the west side of town where refugees like his family had been staying maybe he could find gailisas father there too maybe gailisas father and gailisa herself had been in the grocers shop when eggs fell on and around it talsu tried not to think about that a couple of people who knew him nodded cautiously as he hurried past them a couple of others turned their backs some folk in skrunda still thought the algarvians had let him out of their dungeon because hed betrayed his countrymen for them there was very little truth in that but how could he prove it he was about the plunge into the tent city and make for the tent where hed been sheltering before he had to flee when someone called his name talsu ausra he said whirling toward his sister recognizing her voice even before he saw her she threw herself into his arms he squeezed the breath out of her and kissed her on the cheek are you all right is gailisa are father and mother aye were all fine she answered and he kissed her again harder this time but she went on gailisas father oh powers above talsu said i saw the shop on the way here he didnt get out ausra shook her head im afraid not gailisas taken it pretty hard i believe that talsu said though hed always thought of his fatherinlaw as a plump not particularly goodnatured nonentity one of the least interesting people hed ever known when did it happen the ruins looked pretty fresh just last week his sister told him he ground his teeth ausra took his arm but come on i dont think the redheads are looking for you anymore i didnt see any algarvians in town talsu said and i think skrunda is as good as free because the kuusamans have broken through beyond the town and the redheads will have to pull back or be trapped how do you know that ausra asked because i showed the kuusamans the route they could use to break through talsu answered proudly this time ausra kissed him that was nice but the looks on the faces of traku and laitsina and best of all gailisa were finer still a couple of minutes later and kissing his wife was ever so much finer than kissing his sister youre home gailisa said youre safe she started to laugh and cry at the same time im home im safe he agreed and were free were rid of the redheads for good here you go sergeant kun said as he and istvan cut wood together in the captives camp on obuda you might want these he took a few sicklygreen leaves from his pocket and held them out to istvan oh i might might i istvan didnt take the rather wilted leaves stars above why kun leaned closer and spoke in a hissing whisper because theyll give you a good twoday dose of the galloping shits thats why istvan gaped at him are you out of your mind why would i want a dose of the shits theyre too stinking easy to get here anyway the kind of slop the slanteyes feed us will you take the accursed weeds before the guards start giving us the fishy stares kun snapped startled kun didnt usually sound so vehementistvan did stick the leaves in his own pocket and go back to chopping kun started swinging his axe again too nodding he said thats more like it more like what istvan said plaintively i still havent got the faintest idea what under the light of the stars youre talking about corporal kun rolled his eyes as he had a habit of doing when sorely tried youre such a naturalborn innocent who can guess how youve managed to live this long but if youve got any sense at all youll chew those leaves tonight right around suppertime his axe bit into a chunk of pine chips flew he smote again the chunk split in two im not going to do any such thing till you tell me why and have it make sense istvan said stubbornly that only made kun roll his eyes again just as you say then he was most dangerous when most exquisitely polite tonight youve got yourself a choice you can leak out your arsehole and go into the infirmary and feel better in a couple of days or else you can leak out of a cut throat and not feel better ever again thats it depending on how you choose it may be the last choice you ever get to make oh no matter how naive istvan was he couldnt very well misunderstand that he attacked the chunk of pine in front of him with more violence than it really needed theyre going to do it tonight no i just want to give you the shits kun replied that way when you get over them you can come back and beat the stuffing out of me i really enjoy having people beat the stuffing out of me especially when theyre twice my size you have leaves of your own istvan asked of course not the former mages apprentice said i really enjoy having my own throat cut too so i gave you all the leaves i had istvans ears heated maybe kun didnt deliberately treat him as if he were an idiot on the other hand maybe kun did tooand maybe hed earned it with that particular question but he didnt worry about it for long he asked did you give szonyi some of these precious leaves too if hed hit the wood harder than he had to kun splintered the piece in front of him with his next couple of blows at last he answered i tried to give him some but he wouldnt let me hed rather take his chances with captain frigyes you can too if you think he and the algarvians and major borsos will really do anything worthwhile istvan wished he thought that dying for gyongyos what could be more fitting for a warrior from a warrior race but he wouldnt be dying for gyongyos here he was too mournfully sure of that he would be dying for captain frigyes for no one and nothing else even if frigyes and borsos and the redheads made a sorcery to blast the island of obuda down to the bottom of the bothnian ocean how much would that help gyongyos and ekrekek arpad in the war against kuusamo not very much not so far as istvan could see never mind he said now that it came down to the sticking point he couldnt stomach betraying his countrymens plot to the kuusamans but he didnt want to be part of it either escaping with a sore belly seemed a better way out of the dilemma than most i just wish you could have got szonyi to see sense so do i kun told him but hes not in the mood to listen and he told me dont waste the sergeants time getting him to nag me either i know what im doing i dont think he does but he shrugged im glad you tried istvan said he also resolved to try to talk to szonyi himself no matter what the trooper had told kun woodchopping seemed to take forever at last the guards released the labor detail istvan hurried off to try to find his longtime comrade but szonyi wouldnt talk to him not about that ive made up my mind was all he would say id rather go out giving the enemy one more lick than spend the rest of my days rotting away here on obuda istvan found no good reply to that he finally set his hand on szonyis shoulder and said may the stars enfold you in their light forevermore then may it be so szonyi gave him an anxious glance you and kun wont betray us will you i know youve talked about it no by the stars neither one of us istvan said may they leave us in eternal darkness if i lie i just dont think youll do as much as captain frigyes thinks you will i think youre wrong sergeant szonyi turned away istvan started to argue some more then saw it would do no good he walked off shaking his head when he saw kun a few minutes later the onetime mages apprentice raised a questioning eyebrow istvan shook his head kun sighed and shrugged along with their suppers both of them ate the leaves istvan had expected or at least hoped for a little leisure before they acted and a little dignity while they were working he got neither the effect put him in mind of having an egg burst in the middle of his guts both he and kun raced for the latrines at a dead run kun s face was pale as milk istvan had no doubt he looked the same way neither of them made it to the slit trenches they both had to yank down their leggings and squat in the middle of the compound while guards cursed them in kuusaman and gyongyosian istvan stayed on the ground clutching at his belly kun tried to get to his feet then sank down again must be something we ate he moaned that was true too if not quite in the way he meant it the guards had to drag them to the infirmary they threw them onto cots in a room of their own and gave them chamber pots that suited istvan perfectly he spent a lot of unpleasant time squatting over his as night replaced day when he asked kun when they chanced to be squatting side by side i dont know kun answered well find out when it happens in the meantime shut up that was doubtless good advice istvan tried to tell his guts the same thing they wouldnt listen to him at some point that evening istvan asked what time is it now since things had started for him hed lost a good deal of interest in the outside world but that still mattered not to kun not at the moment i dont know and i dont care he grunted that he was squatting again no doubt made him even shorter with questions than he would have been otherwise after a bit he added and i already told you to shut up who knows whos liable to be listening istvan guessedand it was only a guesshe fell into an exhausted sleep somewhere around midnight he knew he hadnt been asleep very long before getting jolted awake by a short sharp earthquake he dove under his bed as he would have done back in his home valley and hoped the roof wouldnt come down on his head although kun came from gyorvar he knew enough to dive under his cot too most of gyongyos was earthquake country through the roar of the ground and the shudder of the infirmary all around them he shouted this isnt just a regular earthquake so what istvan shouted back that doesnt mean it cant kill us kun didnt answer that istvan concluded that for once hed outargued his clever comrade even after the ground stopped shaking rending and tearing noises went on and on most of them from outside the captives camp kun stayed right where he was istvan started to come out but seeing kun on his belly made him decide not going anywhere might be a good idea kun said well they managed to get the spell to work no doubt about it so they did istvan said now what have they done with it if theyve done enough if theyve done enough maybe i should have let them cut my throat maybe the stars will turn away from my spirit and leave it in eternal darkness am i accursed for cowardice kun said we wont find out till morning at the earliest if he felt the least bit guilty about remaining alive where his comrades had perished he showed no sign that istvan could see and a gyongyosian captive in the next chamber of the infirmary proved him wrong a moment later calling by the stars half the walls have fallen down we could escape istvan exclaimed go ahead kun said if you want to skulk through the woods up on the slopes of mount sorong till the kuusamans hunt you down with dogs go right ahead me i dont see much point to it if i thought we could get back to an island we still held or even one where we were still fighting thatd be different as things are he shook his head no thanks that made more sense than istvan wished it would have some of his countrymen thought otherwise outside the infirmary booted feet pounded across dirt toward what had been the palisade a kuusaman shouted in bad gyongyosian to halt to halt or to blaze those feet kept running a moment later a shriek rang out and then another one after that istvan heard no more running feet inside the captives camp and then a few minutes laterafter he and kun had cautiously emerged from their shelterhe did all the shouting this time was in kuusaman which he didnt understand the slanteyes will have found the bodies kun said do you know that or are you just guessing istvan asked it did strike him as a good guess i can understand some of what theyre saying kun answered not a lotkuusaman is a peculiar language if anyone wants to know what i think much worse than unkerlanterbut enough all istvan had ever learned of either were such phrases as hands high and come out of there ill take your word for it he said a kuusaman guard charged into their chamber stick at the ready he looked at them saw they were where they were supposed to be and not making trouble and relaxed a little sounding innocent kun asked what happened magic the guard answered bad magic many to be dead his gyongyosian was halting but understandable to kill themselves to make magic bad very bad shaking his head he backed out of the room istvan sniffed i smell smoke aye somethings burning kun agreed he sniffed too not close i dont think nothing we have to worry about he paused then went on that guard was right you know it was bad magic and i dont care that our allies used it first neither do i istvan said and did his best to believe he was telling the truth when the sun rose he peered eagerly out the window sure enough most of the walls were down but the kuusamans had posted an armed man every ten feet or so to prevent escapes the leyline depot was also wrecked and the smoke he found came from the direction of the port the kuusamans had built he could see as much through the gaps in what had been the palisade but he could also see that the kuusamans remained in firm control of the island of obuda regardless of what frigyes and borsos and the redheads andmost importantszonyi and the other gyongyosians whod laid down their lives had done it was a waste of magic he said and would have felt vindicated if he hadnt felt so bad halt garivald called what are you doing seeing any movement was enough to make him swing his stick toward it what he saw in the bridgehead by eoforwic wasnt an algarvian soldier but a graybearded forthwegian with a stooped back when the old man smiled a placating smile he showed a mouth full of bad teeth nothing sir he said im only mushrooms garivald didnt know the missing word but had no trouble figuring out what it meant even a grelzer could follow bits and pieces of forthwegian just as the locals could understand a little of what he said come with me he commanded come with me to my lieutenant why the forthwegian asked his smile got wider he said something else garivald couldnt understand it but could make a good guessprobably something like i wasnt doing any harm he shrugged come he repeated orders all civilians to be questioned when theyre found where theyre not supposed to be only mushrooms the forthwegian said he held up his basket then held it out to garivald ill give them to you no garivald liked mushrooms but not so much as the locals did certainly not enough to let himself be bribed with them come along right now or youll be sorry muttering under his breath the old man came none of what he said sounded like a compliment as they went deeper into the bridgehead he spoke a few words garivald could understand need to piss later with a stick in his hand garivald could afford to be heartless but the old man whined need to piss again with such dramatic urgency that garivald relented he pointed to a stout tree somehow still standing despite all the eggs that had landed on the bridgehead the old man disappeared behind it perhaps a heartbeat slower than it should have that roused garivalds suspicions hey what are you doing back there he barked and hurried over to find out for himself the old man wasnt standing there easing himself he was loping toward a fallen tree not far away keeping the stillstanding one between himself and where garivald had been halt garivald shouted again the old man ran harder than ever nobody though nobody could outrun a beam garivalds caught him in the middle of the back just as he was about to dive behind the tree trunk he shrieked and went over on his face he was still moving feebly when garivald trotted up to him with a glare he said something garivald couldnt understand the blood running from his mouth garbled it whatever it was it didnt sound like forthwegian garivald wished he hadnt blazed to killbut that hed found was almost always what a soldier intended to do he hadnt thought of doing anything else till much too late with a last unintelligible mumble the old man died garivald knew the exact instant life left his body for his looks changed in that instant suddenly he no longer looked like a forthwegian but like an algarvian whod let his beard grow out as forthwegians were in the habit of doing magic garivald exclaimed his hands twisted in the sign grelzers used when they ran across magecraft where they didnt expect to in an abstract way he admired the redheads thoroughgoing imposture it wasnt just the beard the fellow had spoken good maybe perfect forthwegian and had even acted as if he liked mushrooms which mezentios men werent in the habit of doing what have you got corporal somebody called from behind garivald an unkerlanter at least i think hes an unkerlanter garivald thought dizzily nothing in the world seemed so certain as it had a moment before what have i got he echoed ive got a spy thats what go fetch lieutenant andelot right away he needs to see this and to hear about it too the unkerlanter soldiers eyes widened he took off at a run garivald was only a corporal but common soldiers obeyed him as if he were marshal rathar of course he had to obey sergeants and real officers the same way while rathar had to obey only the king with everyone else in unkerlant obeying him the marshal has it easy garivald thought andelot came trotting back with the trooper a spy he said and stared down at the dead algarvian how in blazes did he get so far inside our lines fariulf because he looked just like a fornicating forthwegian till i blazed him sir garivald answered and explained what had happened ive heard of such sorcery andelot said when he was finished some of the kaunians here in forthweg used it to keep the redheads from finding them and killing them but this is the first time ive heard that the algarvians are using it to try to make themselves look harmless while they come snooping around i hadnt heard of it at all sir garivald said like i told you i was taking this fellow back to you so you could question himhe wasnt supposed to be inside the perimeter he must have thought we had a wizard waiting to test him andelot said he panicked and got himself killed and gave the game away if he looked like an old forthwegian probably i would have just cursed him and told him to make himself scarce i wouldnt have guessed he was anything but what he seemed to be i sure didnt sir garivald said i was never so surprised in my life as when i saw him change as soon as he died but you did what you were supposed to do by bringing him in lieutenant andelot said and you did what you were supposed to do by blazing him when he tried to escape no one could possibly have asked for more from you sergeant fariulf serge garivald saluted thank you very much sir he didnt much want to be promoted the higher he rose the more likely people were to take a long look at him a look he couldnt afford but he would also draw long looks if he seemed unhappy about getting a higher rank youre welcome youve earned it eventually your pay will show that youre getting it too andelot made a wry face the men who gave out money in the unkerlanter army plainly didnt think efficiency was anything they had to worry about do you think you could write me a report of everything that happened here sergeant write you a report garivald was more alarmed than he had been when he saw the sorcerously disguised algarvian trying to get away from him sir you only showed me my letters a few weeks ago how in blazes am i supposed to write a report just write down what happened the same as if you were telling it to me the company commander answered dont worry about your spelling or anything fancy like that you would be amazed at how many men who went to good schools cant spell some simple words to keep the powers below from eating them believe me you would i wont care about that i promise but you are the eyewitness i want the facts down on paper in your words not mine ill try sir garivald said dubiously he pointed to the algarvians body what do we do with that leave him here andelot answered ill want a mage to look at him just the way he is i dont know if hell be able to learn anything but i want to give him a chance all right sir that makes sense garivald said get some paper sergeantill give you some if you cant find it anywhere elseand go write that report andelot told him get everything down while its still fresh in your mind dont leave anything out maybe itll help if you pretend youre talking to me instead of writing maybe garivald knew he still didnt sound convinced he did have to get paper from the lieutenant once he got it he sat apart from his men and started to work he wrote awkwardly as a child might have that annoyed him it also made his writing harder to read he knew he guessed at the spelling of about every other word and found he had to imitate a conversational style as andelot had suggested it was the only one within his grasp he couldnt very well imitate other things hed read because he hadnt read anything to speak of at last after what seemed like forever and was in fact two leaves of paper he finished when he brought lieutenant andelot the report he trembled even more than he had when first going into battle no man relishes the feeling that hes just made a fool of himself he had to force his voice to steadiness to say here you are sir thank you sergeant andelot replied his mention of garivalds new rank made garivald feel better and more nervous at the same time lets see what weve got here he began to read then looked up and nodded you make your letters very clearly youre too kind garivald muttered he had the feeling that was the kind of compliment you got when no others seem to present themselves and sure enough andelot said anyone would know though that you havent had much in the way of formal schooling i havent had any sir and you know it garivald said well so i do andelot kept reading he put down the first leaf and methodically worked his way through the second when he finished that one too he glanced up at the nervously waiting garivald he tapped the report with his index finger this isnt at all what i expected sergeant im sorry sir garivald said i did the best i could andelot looked surprised sorry powers above what for do you think i meant you did a bad job oh i see you do no no no sergeantjust the opposite in fact this is splendid work except for the spellingwhich you cant help of coursei would be sure youd been writing reports for years he shook his head no thats not true i would think youd been writing romances or poems not reports reports arent made to be interesting and most of them arent this thoughhe tapped againthis makes me feel it happened to me not to you only a real storyteller a born storyteller has that gift youve got it ii dont know what to say sir garivald said maybe i really can write down my songs or write new ones that would have been a safer ambition in almost any other kingdom besides unkerlant but he had it even so you dont need to say anything andelot told him you do need to know that im going to have you write more reports whenever you happen to need to that will give you good practice writing and ill have the fun of reading them he had to mean it he wouldnt say something like that just to make garivald feel good real officers didnt much care how underofficers felt why should they they could tell underofficers what to do and what else mattered garivald said ill try it again sir but i dont want the kind of surprise that stinking redhead gave me i dont blame you a bit fariulf andelot said the cursed algarvians have given us too many surprises all through this fight thats the way algarvians are they always come up with new things but we gave them a surprise too you know we didwe stodgy old unkerlanters we did garivald asked in honest amazement what kind of surprise we didnt fall over and die when they hit us and they thought we would andelot said the forthwegians did and the sibs and the valmierans and the jelgavansand they chased the lagoans right off the mainland of derlavai with their tails between their legs but they hit us and we kept hitting backand look where we are now garivald didnt particularly want to be in a bridgehead in the middle of forthweg even so though he nodded andelot had a point fernao plowed through a kuusaman news sheet as he ate an omelette for breakfast by now after a couple of years reading kuusaman he took it almost as much for granted as he did lagoan some of the mages from his kingdom grumbled about it but lagoans always grumbled whenever they had to pay more attention to kuusamo and its ways than they wanted to anything interesting ilmarinen asked from across the table he was working his way through a plate of smoked salmon and onions and capers and pickled cucumbers i dont know about interesting but this report on something that went wrong on the island of obuda is strange fernao answered he passed the sheet to ilmarinen who put on spectacles to read it it sounds like something happened there that was too big to ignore and bigger than the writer really wanted to admit oh that the kuusaman master mages voice went hard and flat i know about that fernao believed him he knew all sorts of things he had no business knowing some of the people who ran our captives camp for the gongs made a big mistake there most of them are too dead to courtmartial now but we would if we could stupidity is usually its own punishment it was here now youre going to have to tell me you know fernao said or else what but ilmarinen was grinning he loved to gossip and made no bones about it after an odorous bite of salmon and onions he went on well for one thing they let some sort of mage get in with the ordinary captives uhoh fernao said uhoh indeed ilmarinen agreed and then they put some algarvian leviathanriders into the camp too and just in case you havent heard the gongs have figured out how to work the sorceries that make me hope algarve and unkerlant end up destroying each otherbut were never that lucky are we erno fernao said from what i know of the gyongyosians that surprises me theyre warriors aye but not murderers youre right they arent murderersnot that kind of murderers any how but so what ilmarinen paused for another bite fernao remembered to eat too the kuusaman master mage continued theyre warriors sure enoughand they volunteer they really and truly do volunteer to put their necks to the knife for the greater glory of gyongyos and for the stars that dont give a fart about them oh fernao wished he hadnt started eating again and thats what happened on obuda thats what happened on obuda all right ilmarinen said smashed things up pretty wellabout like a real earthquake say he shrugged now were putting the pieces back together and we wont let it happen again a bad nuisance but only a nuisance and a lot of dead gyongyosians fernao said dead for nothing ilmarinen nodded for nothing much anyhow i gather the officer who led this thought doing something was better than sitting around doing nothing and waiting for the war to end only goes to show that sometimes sitting around isnt so bad you should have thought of that before you went to the blockhouse by yourself fernao said after impressive deliberation ilmarinen made a face at him if we were all as smart as we knew how to make everyone else very likely the world would be as much of a mess as it is right now aye very likely fernao had wondered if the old man would be able to get an aphorism out of his cynical start hed had his doubts when ilmarinen paused there but the theoretical sorcerer had come through are you ready for the experiment tomorrow i am always ready for experiments ilmarinen answered sometimes unfortunately experiments are not ready for me he popped more onions and capers and soft pinkorange fish into his mouth i tell you this id a hundred times sooner experiment than stand in front of a chamber full of eager secondraters and tell them what i know i rather like to teach fernao said i havent minded teaching you ilmarinen said fernao realized only later the size of the compliment hed got the old man went on but these people who want it spelled out and have to have it that way because they cant see it if it isnt theyd make a lovely rock garden dont you think dont they think they dont and thats the trouble fernao finished his own breakfast and went off to teach a class of magesmostly lagoans with a few kuusamans to fill out the twenty sure enough the questions he got were of the sort ilmarinen disliked show me how these two verses work what does this formula mean do we really need to know that no you dont really need to know that he answered his own temper fraying if you want to kill yourself when you try this spell go ahead and forget it youre not being very helpful complained the woman whod asked the question youre not being very imaginative fernao said would i have talked about this if you didnt need to know it well you never can tell the woman said later fernao did some complaining of his own to pekka i wanted to pound my head against the wall weve made this as simple as we can have we really made it simple enough for the people wholl have to use it can we make it simple enough for these people to use it instead of giving him the sympathy he craved she annoyed him by laughing ive spent years trying to pound sorcery into the heads of people who dont much want to learn it he said the ones we have here are pretty bright powers above help our kingdoms he exploded i hope they will i hope they do she answered and he found nothing to say to that then she added they must be looking out for me otherwise how would i have met you fernaos annoyance evaporated his ears heated that must have been visible from the outside as well as palpable from within for pekka giggled fernao bowed you do me too much credit i think pekka shook her head i dont think so she answered if i did would you make me so happy before his head swelled to the point where her chamber couldnt hold it she added if i didnt think so would i have let my life get so complicated when i didnt intend to he found nothing to say to that either his life wasnt complicated his life had been complicated before they found themselves together because hed wanted to be with her when she hadnt wanted to be with him now as far as he was concerned everything was fine of course he wasnt torn in two directions at once however much he wished pekka werent he knew she was they lay close together on her narrow bed after making love that night when she suddenly said its snowing how can you tell he asked the way the air feelsall still and quiet she said and turned on the bedside lamp thereyou see sure enough the light showed snowflakes softly striking the doubleglass window that helped hold cold at bay it doesnt have to be still and quiet for snow fernao said down in the land of the ice people it blows like this he held his forearm parallel to the mattress then he added and id sooner look at you than at snow any day pekka kissed him he gathered her in before too long he sighed ten years ago i could have promised you twice in a row now i have to be lucky for thatnot that im not lucky you understand dont worry about it pekka said the holding is fine too all by itself she reached out to turn off the lamp they fell asleep in each others armsand woke up a couple of hours later fernao with an arm asleep pekka with a leg that seemed dead below the knee as they untangled themselves and fernao got into his clothes to go back to his own room he yawned and thought so much for romance something closer to romance came the next day when they rode out to the blockhouse under furs in a sleigh as theyd done when they first began experimenting down in the naantali district hed been conscious of pekka as an attractive woman even then now if his hands wandered a bit and if hers did the furs kept the driver from noticing but when they and the other theoretical sorcerers got down from the sleighs and went into the blockhouse pekka was all business you know what were going to try today she said were going to use the energy from the sorcery weve developed to touch off a landslide and close off a pass in the bratanu mountains to make the algarvians have a harder time moving men and supplies from their kingdom east into jelgava i dont think anyone has ever projected so much sorcerous power so far and so precisely in the history of the world thats bound to be true fernao thought its a demon of a long way from here to the border between jelgava and algarve some of the excitement of what theyd been doing came back to him making everything cut and dried so people with no spark no flair of their own could use it had drained away a lot of that excitement he was glad to feel it return hed wondered if it would i begin pekka said and chanted the ritual phrases kuusamans used before every conjuration fernao had snickered behind his hand when he first heard them hed heard them so many times by now magecraft undertaken without them would have felt strange unnatural hed only half understood them when he first heard them hed understood hardly anything of the kuusaman cantrips that followed he did these days he wouldnt have wanted to try drafting an original spell in kuusaman but he had no trouble following one now if anything went wrong he knew much more than he had about how to repair it ilmarinen and piilis joined the incantation so did raahe and alkio fernao felt the power build part of it was his flowing from him through pekka whose hand he held it put him in mind of pleasure building when they made love but when his eyes flicked her way her face was serious intent nothing at all like the way she looked when the two of them were alone she didnt glance at him she kept on chanting doing what she had to do thats all any of us are doing he thought what else is there if not for the worlds energy grid more commonly used in traveling along ley lines they never could have located the mountain pass so precisely an alert algarvian mage somewhere between the naantali district and the pass might have detected the sorcery when at last it burst forth he might have detected it but that would have done him no good by the time he knew it was there he would have been far too late to stop it fernao felt the spell seize the stones and the alreadydrifted snow along the sides of the pass felt it seize them and jerk them and send them crashing down onto the road and the ley line at the bottom mezentios mages might have achieved the same effect by killing a camp full of kaunians but never from this range never probably from a quarter of this range and this spell was cleanno murder attached to it afterwards all the mages sighed now fernao could squeeze pekkas hand without distracting her she smiled and nodded we did it she said i could feel that we did it aye fernao nodded too the algarvians will have harder work now in jelgava and its likelier your husband will come through safe should i be happy about that aye curse it i should leinos not my enemy hes fighting my enemies he kept his face straight he didnt want pekka to know what he was thinking there we do have to be civilized about these things curse it ever since shed spied spinello stalking through the wreckage of eoforwic vanai had known she would try to kill him if she ever saw even the slightest chance she hadnt known how badly she needed to go looking for that chance till the day before pybbas rebels surrendered to the algarvians the day the redheads agreed to treat the forthwegians as proper war captives instead of butchering them for bandits ealstan had slipped out of the pocket pybbas men still held hed slipped into and out of that pocket a good many times before then vanai had always hated it but she couldnt deny he knew what he was doing and when hed come home full of gloom shed thought she understood however foolish she reckoned forthwegian patriotism ealstan felt it in his heart in his belly just as she felt her own kaunianity but she hadnt understood or hadnt understood everything even if shed thought she had shed found that out a couple of hours later after putting saxburh down for a nap ealstan by then had gone through a good deal of the wine in the flat she hadnt even worried about that though kaunians often sneered at forthwegians for drunkenness shed long since seen ealstan didnt let wine and spirits rule him and that day hed had more sorrows to drown than usual hed also had more sorrows to drown than she knew hed looked up from the mug when she walked into the kitchen looked up from it and voice not blurry in the least hed asked did you ever run across a redhead named spinello the question had crashed into her like a lightning bolt from a clear sky her face must have given her away for shed seen his mouth tighten after that what point to lying aye shed answered quietly back in oyngestun how did you know maybe that hadnt been the perfect question for it had made him gulp down all the wine left in his mug i heard him mention your name talking to his men how could he know i speak algarvian mentioning her name undoubtedly meant going into obscene detail over all the things hed made her do back there in her home village with a sigh vanai had said he wanted to get my grandfather to collaborate with the redheads that would have meant something in scholarly circles you saw him once when he was out looking at an imperial kaunian site with my grandfather and me i remember ealstan had said hed hesitated then vanai gave him credit for it but hed gone on he wanted something else from you vanai had nodded what else could i have done she wondered nothing nothing at all my grandfather said no shed told ealstan he kept saying no you met him you have some small idea what a stubborn man he was and so spinello threw him into a labor gang he wasnt young hed never done work like that in his life it was killing him i watched it happen for a little while i couldnt stand it whatever else he was he was the only kin i had left in the world and so i up till then shed managed to sound as cool as detached as if she were talking about building a fence but the last few words came out in a ragged gulp as tears spilled down her cheeks i made a bargain with spinello shed stood there waiting once she got it out what would ealstan do slowly hed climbed to his feet is he going out the door she remembered thinking will he come back will he even look back will he hit me this once i could bear it without hating him afterwards hed come toward her she remembered bracing herself too then hed put his arms around her and switched from the forthwegian theyd been speaking to his slow clear classical kaunian brivibas i think was luckier in you than he realizedperhaps luckier than he deserved and may the powers below eat that spinello vanai really had burst into tears then and buried her face in the hollow of his shoulder they were very nearly of a height she hadnt had to stand on tiptoe to do it she remembered whispering thank you over and over again but she still wasnt sure if shed said it loud enough for ealstan to hear but she was sure what hed said before she looked up again may the powers below have some help eating that spinello hed sounded thoroughly grim hed sounded so grim in fact that hed terrified her shed thought about killing spinello hed sounded as if he intended to march out right that minute and do it and so shed clung to him and exclaimed no hes not worth the risk of you by the powers above he isnt ealstan and besides before long the unkerlanters are bound to do it for us they havent done it yet hed grumbled but he hadnt gone charging out of the flat then and so far as vanai knew he hadnt tried stalking spinello since she hoped that meant hed listened to her as well as hearing her she hoped so but she wasnt sure he hadnt seemed any different with her after that dreadful day and he hadnt seemed any different with saxburh either vanai dared take that for a good sign even so she knew that if she was going to try to get rid of spinello sooner was definitely better ealstan she feared would also tryand even if he succeeded he was all too likely to get caught if he did try he would pick the most obvious most direct way vanai knew him too well to have any doubts on that score but what algarvian would pay any particular attention to a forthwegian woman vanai wasnt standing by a mirror to see her own smile but suspected it showed a lot of pointed teeth every now and then being thelberge to the world had its advantages but being anyone in eoforwic these days also had its disadvantages and they were many and large few unkerlanter eggs had burst close to the block of flats but that didnt mean swemmels soldiers couldnt start lobbing them this way whenever they chose staying in eoforwic meant living with danger staying in eoforwic also meant living with hunger not a lot of food came into the forthwegian capital and the redheads kept more than their share of what did people haunted the markets they also pocked through the wreckage that made up so much of the city looking for jars of olives and for smoked or salted meat and for wine and most of all for rest crates filled with sorcerously preserved food find one of thoseand get it home without having it stolenand you might eat well for a long time find silver or jewelry and you could pay the piratical prices in the markets and as happened every fall people hunted mushrooms over every inch of bare ground in eoforwic sometimes vanai would go out with ealstan and they would pass the baby back and forth no matter how dismal things were saxburh could make ealstan smile if it werent for mushrooms you wouldnt be here he would tell her she hadnt the faintest idea what he was talking about but she always gurgled with delight when he talked to her and sometimes vanai would take saxburh out by herself nobody in shattered eoforwic seemed to need bookkeepers but there were plenty of daylaborer jobs and ealstan took them without complaint especially when he got paid in food instead of silver plenty of forthwegian women took them too but vanai couldnt even if shed had someone to take care of saxburh she didnt dare stay out in public for the long shifts such work required if her sorcerous disguise wore off she didnt want to think about that no one kept track of a mushroom hunters hours though head down the baby in the crook of her arm or sometimes in a cloth harness shed made from scraps of old clothes she eyed damp ground in the park where shed first shown herself to the world as thelbergewhere in fact ealstan had given her the name shed used ever since sometimes she had good luck sometimes not so good more people were harvesting a lot less space than had been true around gromheort and oyngestun but mushrooms werent like gold or silvergetting some out of the ground today didnt mean more wouldnt spring up tomorrow you couldnt live on mushrooms alone but they did help and they made barleyoften stale barley sometimes moldy barleymuch more bearable and less monotonous than it would have been without them paying close attention to small patches of ground helped vanai keep from noticing how ravaged the park was sometimes though as when a score of new craters from bursting eggs pocked its face like some ghastly disease she couldnt help it ealstan was along with her that morning with a sad sigh she said this place was shabby when you brought me here a couple of years ago nownow its like looking at a corpse a murdered corpse he agreed but if wed been here when those eggs came down wedve been the ones who got murdered maybe vanai said but maybe not too ive had to jump into craters a few times when the unkerlanters started tossing eggs across the river or when their dragons came over the city its just something we need to do these days thats all she wondered what her former self from oyngestunherself from before the warwould have made of that calm matteroffact statement she would have reckoned it madness she was sure of that what else could it possibly be but why if it were madness was ealstan soberly nodding ive had to do the same thing myself he answered and showed his teeth in a mirthless grin life in the big city it isnt even what irks me these days you know what is tell me vanai said but then she stopped listening because shed seen some meadow mushrooms peeping out from the edge of a clump of woods she hurried over picked them and put them in her basket im sorry now tell me you know about plegmunds brigade everybody knows about plegmunds brigade he said and vanai nodded ealstan muttered something under his breath about his cousin sidroc then got back to things at hand the algarvians have cooked up something like that for forthwegian women now powers below eat them for women vanai said do they give them sticks no no he shook his head they call them hilde s helpersyou know after plegmunds queen and what hilde s helpers do is they cook and they bake like maniacs and then they give the redheads everything they make they just ignore forthwegian laborersive seen that too curse them i heard one of them say the algarvians deserve the best of everything because theyre defending us from swemmels savages do people really believe that can people really believe that vanai asked this gal did ealstan said he held saxburh up in front of his face she didnt even know as much as you do she didnt come close saxburh laughed vanai didnt no kaunian of course could prefer algarvians to unkerlanters but even now some forthwegians evidently could fools she thought but there were also forthwegians who preferred the algarvians not in spite of what theyd done to the kaunians of forthweg but because of it she saw some of hilde s helpers a couple of days later they wore blueandwhite armbandsforthwegian colorsand sure enough carried baskets and trays of food they all looked well fed themselves too vanai quietly cursed them and had they known what she was they would have cursed her she hoped unkerlanter dragons would raid eoforwic while hilde s helpers were serving algarvian soldiers if that wasnt poetic justice what was they would deserve it she told saxburh the baby smiled showing a new tooth that had cost vanai an almost sleepless night babies didnt argue except when you wanted them to go to bed and then vanai smiled too and kissed saxburh her daughter laughed out loud a moment later so did vanai she knew what she needed to do she knew how to do it ill have to get another basket she said a little one a special one and ill need a bit of luck but do you know what sweetheart for once in my life i wont need much saxburh grinned as if proud of that new tooth so did vanai
