harry turtledove american front prelude october outside camp hill pennsylvania t he leaves on the trees were beginning to go from green to red as if swiped by a painters brush a lot of the grass near the banks of the susquehanna down by new cumberland had been painted red too red with blood a courier came galloping back to robert e lees headquarters his face smudged with blackpowder smoke but glowing with excitement beneath the minstrelshow markings we have em sir he cried to lee as he reined in his blowing horse we have em general jackson says for me to tell you d h hills division is around mcclellans left and rolling em up god has delivered them into our hands he says that is very fine lee murmured he peered through the thick smoke but piercing it was impossible even with the polished brass spyglass that lay on the folding table in front of him he had to rely on reports from couriers like this eager young man but all the reports from just after the rising of the sun when the battle was joined till now with it sinking in blood more blood he thoughtbehind him had been what hed prayed to hear colonel robert chilton his assistant adjutant general was no more able than the courier to contain his excitement very fine sir he burst out its better than that with longstreet holding the yankees in the center mclaws outflanking them on the left and now stonewall on the right theyre in a sack napoleon couldnt have got out of and if theres one soldier in the world whos no napoleon its the young napoleon the federals have general mcclellan whatever his virtues is not a hasty man lee observed smiling at chiltons derisive use of the grandiloquent nickname the northern papers had given the commander of the army of the potomac those peoplehis own habitual name for the foewere also perhaps illadvised to accept battle in front of a river with only one bridge offering a line of retreat should their plans miscarry i should say theyve miscarried the courier said some of general jacksons artillery is far enough forward its shelling that bridge right now we do have them sir colonel chilton said he stiffened to attention and saluted general lee lee glanced back over his shoulder perhaps an hours worth of light remaining he said then turned to the courier once more tell general jackson he is to exploit his advantage with all means at his disposal preventing as best he can the enemys retreat to the eastern bank of the susquehanna better than any other man alive jackson knew how to turn a vague order like that into the specific steps needed to destroy the foe before him yes sir the lieutenant said and repeated the order back to make sure he had it straight wheeling his bay gelding he galloped off towards general jacksons position the army of the potomac cannot hope to resist us not after this colonel chilton said philadelphia lies open to our men and baltimore and washington itself id not relish attacking the works those people have placed around washington city lee replied but you are of course correct colonel that possibility is available to us another consideration we cannot dismiss is the probable effect of our victory here upon england and france both of whom have president davis tells me been debating whether they should extend recognition to our new nation theyll have the devils own time not doing it now chilton declared either we are our own nation or we belong to the united states those are the only two choices he laughed and pointed toward the smokebefogged battlefield abe lincoln cant say were under his tyrants thumb not after this diplomacy is too arcane a subject for a poor simple soldier to vex his head over its niceties and peculiarities lee said but on this occasion colonel chilton i find it impossible to disagree with you november the white house washington dc both horses that brought lord lyons carriage to the white house were black so was the carriage itself and the cloth canopy stretched over it to protect the british minister from the rain all very fitting lord lyons thought for what is in effect a funeral whoa the driver said quietly and pulled back on the reins the horses welltrained animals both halted in a couple of short neat strides just in front of the entrance of the american presidential mansion the driver handed lord lyons an umbrella to protect himself against the rain for the few steps hed need to get under cover thank you miller lord lyons said unfurling the umbrella i expect they will make you and the animals comfortable and then bring you back out here to drive me off to the ministry upon the conclusion of my appointment with president lincoln yes sir the driver said lord lyons got down from the carriage his feet splashed in the water on the walkway as he hurried toward the white house entrance a few raindrops hit him in the face in spite of the umbrella miller chirruped to the horses and drove off toward the stable in the front hall a colored servant took lord lyons hat and overcoat and umbrella and hung them up john nicolay stood waiting patiently while the servant tended to the british minister then lincoln s personal secretary lincoln s de facto chief of staffsaid the president is waiting for you sir thank you mr nicolay lord lyons hesitated but then as nicolay turned away to lead him to lincolns office decided to go on i would like the president to understand that what i do today i do as the servant and representative of her majestys government and that in my own person i deeply regret the necessity for this meeting ill tell him that your excellency nicolay sounded bitter he was a young manhe could hardly have had more than thirty yearsand had not yet learned altogether to subsume his own feelings in the needs of diplomacy when you get right down to it though what difference does that make when you got right down to it american idiom lord lyons thought it made very little difference he was silent as he followed nicolay upstairs but for the personal secretary and the one servant he had seen no one in the white house it was as if the rest of the staff at the presidential mansion feared he bore some deadly contagious disease and so in a way he did john nicolay seated him in an antechamber outside lincoln s office let me announce you your excellency ill be back directly he ducked into the office closing the door after himself lord lyons hoped he was delivering the personal message with which he had been entrusted he emerged almost as quickly as he had promised president lincoln will see you now sir thank you mr nicolay lord lyons repeated striding past the secretary into the office of the president of the united states abraham lincoln got up from behind his desk and extended his hand good day to you sir he said in his rustic accent outwardly he was as calm as if he reckoned the occasion no more than an ordinary social call good day mr president lord lyons replied clasping lincoln s big hand in his the american chief executive was so tall and lean and angular that merely by existing he reminded lord lyons of how short pudgy and roundfaced he was sit yourself down your excellency lincoln pointed to a chair uphol stered in blue plush i know what youre here for lets get on with it shall we its like going to the dentistwaiting wont make it any better erno lord lyons said lincoln had a gift for unexpected apt and vivid similes one of the british ministers molars gave him a twinge at the mere idea of visiting the dentist as mr nicolay may have told you yes yes lincoln interrupted he did tell me its not that im not grateful either but how you feel about it hasnt got anything to do with the price of whiskey hed aged ten years in the little more than a year and a half since hed taken office harsh lines scored his face into a mask of grief that begged to be carved into eternal marble just say what youve come to say very well mr president lord lyons took a deep breath he really didnt want to go on he loathed slavery and everything it stood for but his instructions from london were explicit and admitted of no compromise i am directed by lord palmerston prime minister for her majesty queen victoria who is i am to inform you operating with the full approbation and concord of the government of his majesty napoleon iii emperor of france to propose mediation between the governments of the united states and confederate states with a view to resolving the differences between those two governments earl russell our foreign secretary generously offers himself as mediator between the two sides there it was said on the surface it sounded conciliatory enough below that surface lincoln was astute enough to see what lay below i do thank lord palmerston for his good offices he said but as we deny there is any such thing as the government of the confederate states earl russell cant very well mediate between them and us lord lyons sighed you say this mr president with the army of northern virginia encamped in philadelphia i would say it sir if that army were encamped on the front lawn of the white house lincoln replied mr president let me outline the steps her majestys government and the government of france are prepared to take if you decline mediation lord lyons said again unwillinglybut lincoln had to know what he was getting into first the governments of great britain and france will immediately extend diplomatic recognition to the confederate states of america youll do that anyhow like john nicolay lincoln was bitterand with reason we shall do more than that at need the british minister said we are prepared to use our naval forces to break the blockade you have imposed against the confederate states and permit unimpeded commerce to resume between those states and the nations of the world that would mean war between england and france on the one hand and the united states on the other lincoln warned indeed it would mr presidentand as the united states have shown themselves unequal to the task of restoring the confederate states to their allegiance i must say i find myself surprised to find you willing to engage in simultaneous conflict with those confederate states and with the two greatest powers in the world today i admire your spirit i admire your courage very muchbut can you not see there are times when for the good of the nation spirit and courage must yield to common sense lets dicker lord lyons lincoln said the british minister needed a moment to understand he meant bargain lincoln gave him that moment reaching into a desk drawer and drawing out a folded sheet of paper that he set on top of the desk i have here sir a proclamation declaring all negroes held in bondage in those areas now in rebellion against the lawful government of the united states to be freed as of next january first i had been saving this proclamation against a union victory but circumstances being as they are lord lyons spread his hands with genuine regret had you won such a victory mr president i should not be visiting you today with the melancholy message i bear from my government you know sir that i personally despise the institution of chattel slavery and everything associated with it he waited for lincoln to nod before continuing that said however i must tell you that an emancipation proclamation issued after the series of defeats federal forces have suffered would be perceived as a cri de coeur a call for servile insurrection to aid your flagging cause and as such would not be favorably received in either london or paris to say nothing of its probable effect in richmond i am truly sorry mr president but this is not the way out of your dilemma lincoln unfolded the paper on which hed written the decree abolishing slavery in the seceding states put on a pair of spectacles to read it sighed folded it again and returned it to its drawer without offering to show it to lord lyons if that doesnt help us sir i dont know what will he said his long narrow face twisted as if he were in physical pain of course what youre telling me is that nothing helps us nothing at all accept the good offices of her majestys government in mediating between your government and that of the confederate states the british minister urged him truly i believe that to be your best course perhaps your only course as gladstone said last month the confederate states have made an army a navy and now a nation for themselves with slow deliberate motions lincoln took off his spectacles and put them back in their leather case his deepset eyes filled with a bitterness beside which that of john nicolay seemed merely the petulance of a small boy deprived of a cherished sweet take what england deigns to give us at the conference table or else end up with less thats what you mean in plain talk that is what the situation dictates lord lyons said uncomfortably yes the situation dictates lincoln said and england and france dictate too he sighed again very well sir go ahead and inform your prime minister that we accept mediation having no better choice truly you will go down in history as a great statesman because of this mr president lord lyons replied almost limp with relief that lincoln had chosen to see reasonwith americans you never could tell ahead of time and in time the united states and the confederate states still having between them a common language and much common history shall take their full and rightful places in the world a pair of sturdy brothers lincoln shook his head your excellency with all due respect to you i have to doubt that the citizens of the united states want the federal union preserved no matter what the rebels did to us we would fight on against themif england and france werent sticking their oar in my government seeks only to bring about a just peace recognizing the rights of both sides in this dispute the british minister answered yes you would say that wouldnt you lord lyons lincoln said freighting the title with a stinging load of contempt all the lords and sirs and dukes and earls in london and paris must be cheering the rebels on laughing themselves sick to see our great democracy ground into the dirt that strikes me as unfair mr president lord lyons said though it wasnt altogether unfair a large number of british aristocrats were doing exactly as lincoln had described seeing in the defeat of the united states a salutary warning to the lower classes in the british isles but he put the case as best he could the duke of argyll for instance sir is among the warmest friends the united states have in england today and many other leaders by right of birth concur in his opinions isnt that nice of em lincoln said his backcountry accent growing stronger with his agitation fact of the matter is though that most of your high and mighty want us cut down to size and theyre glad to see the rebels do it they reckon a slaveocracys bettern no ocracy at all isnt that right as i have just stated sir no i do not believe that to be the case lord lyons replied stiffly oh yes you said it you just didnt make me believe it is all lincoln told him well you englishmen and the french on your coattails are guardian angels for the rebels are you what with them and you together youre too strong for us youre right about that i do admit the ability to see what is sir is essential for the leader of a great na tion the british minister said he wanted to let lincoln down easy if he could i see what is all right i surely do the president said i see that you eu ropean powers are taking advantage of this rebellion to meddle in america the way you used to before the monroe doctrine warned you to keep your hands off napoleon props up a tinpot emperor in mexico and now france and england are in cahootsanother phrase that briefly baffled lord lyonsto help the rebels and pull us down all right sir he breathed heavily if thats the way the games going to be played we arent strong enough to prevent it now but i warn you mr minister we can play too you are indeed a free and independent nation no one disputes that nor will anyone lord lyons agreed you may pursue diplomacy to the full extent of your interests and abilities mighty generous of you lincoln said with cutting irony and one fine day i reckon well have friends in europe too friends wholl help us get back whats rightfully ours and what youve taken away a european powerto help you against england and france for the first time lord lyons was undiplomatic enough to laugh american bluster was bad enough most times but this lunacy good luck to you mr president good luck i g eorge enos was gutting haddock on the noisome deck of the steam trawler ripple when fred butcher the first mate sang out smoke off the starboard bow that gave george an excuse to pull the latest fish off the deck gut it toss it down into the icy brinesmelling hold and then straighten up and see what sort of ship was approaching his back made little popping noises as he came out of this stoop im getting too old for this line of work he thought though he was only twentyeight he rubbed at his brown mustache with a leathergloved hand a fish scale scratched his cheek the sweat running down his face in the late june heat made the little cut sting he followed butchers pointing finger with his eyes a lot of smoke he said whistling low thats not just another georges bank fishing boat or a tramp freighter either his boston accent swallowed the rs in the final syllables of the last two words liner id guess or maybe a warship i think youre right butcher said he was little and skinny and quick and clever his face seamed by wind and sun and spray till he looked to have ten more years than the fortyfive or so he really carried his mustache was salt and pepper about evenly mixed like enos he grew it thick and waxed the ends so they pointed toward his eyes half the men in the united states who wore mustaches modeled them after the one gracing kaiser wilhelms upper lip captain patrick odonnell came out of the cabin and pressed a spyglass to his right eye warship sure enough he said his boston mixed with a trace of a brogue fourstackergerman armored cruiser unless im wrong if you say it captain well take it to the bank fred butcher answered that wasnt applepolishing odonnell had spent years in the us navy rising to chief petty officer before he retired and went into business for himself hed seen german warships at a lot closer than spyglass range hed exercised alongside them out in the middle of the atlantic and maybe in the pacific too shes going to pass close to us enos said he could see the great gray hull of the ship now almost bowon to the ripple the plume of black coal smoke trailed away behind captain odonnell still had the telescope aimed at the approaching ship imperial german navy sure enough he said i can make out the ensign nowis that the roon or the yorckl he kept looking and finally grunted in satisfaction the yorck and no mistaking her see how her cranes are pierced if she were the roon theyd be solid if you say so captain youre the one with the spyglass after all enos chuckle suited his wry sense of humor he took another nakedeye look at the oncoming yorck the cruiser was nearly bowon when he spoke again he sounded anxious we see her captain but does she see us the question was anything but idle as the yorck drew near she seemed more and more like an armored cliff bearing down on the steam trawler the ripple was feet long and displaced gross tons that made her one of the bigger fishing boats operating out of boston harbor all at once though enos felt as if he were in a rowboat and a pintsized rowboat at that how big is she captain fred butcher asked the huge hull and great gun turrets gave him pause too at the waterline feet inches odonnell answered with the automatic accuracy of the longtime navy man he was she displaces tons four inch guns ten inchers crew of fourinch armor amidships twoinch belts at the ends shell make twentyone knots in a sprint if she runs us down she wont even notice in other words enos said thats about right george odonnell answered easily he took pride in the strength and speed of naval vessels as if having served on them somehow magically gave him strength and speed as well even so though his glance flicked to the american flag rippling atop the foremast the sight of the thirtyfourstar banner rippling in the brisk breeze must have reassured him theyll see us just fine here if youre still worried ill send up a flare that i will he dug a cigar out of his jacket pocket scraped a match against the sole of his boot and puffed out a cloud almost as malodorous as the coal smoke issuing from the yorcks stacks as if his cigar had been a message to the german cruiser signal flags sprouted from her yards odonnell raised the telescope to his eye once more the cigar in his mouth jerked sharply upward a sure sign of good humor by jesus they want to know if we have fish to sell he burst out he turned to butcher tell em yes and dont waste a second doing it the affirmative pennant went up almost as quickly as the order had been given the yorck slowed in the water drifting to a stop about a quartermile from the ripple then everyone aboard the steam trawler whooped with delight as the german cruiser let down a boat hot damn yelled lucas phelps one of the men minding the trawl the ripple had been dragging along the shallow bottom of georges bank the germans theyll pay us bettern the bay state fishing company ever would and it all goes into our pockets too fred butcher said gleefully on fish that made it back to boston the crew and the company that owned the boat split the take down the middle butcher went on were light five hundred a thousand pounds of haddock thats not ever gonna get noticed the happy silence of conspiracy settled over the ripple before long the eight men in the yorcks lifeboat came alongside the trawler permission to come aboard asked the petty officer who evidently headed up the little crew permission granted patrick odonnell answered as formally as if he were still in the navy he turned to enos let down the rope ladder george right enos hurried to obey he liked extra money as well as anybody dapper in their summer whites alarmingly neat alarmingly well shaved the german sailors looked out of place on the untidy deck of the ripple where some of the haddock and hake and cusk and lemon sole that george hadnt yet gutted still flopped and writhed and tried to jump back into the ocean blood and fish guts threatened the cleanliness of the sailors trousers i will give you for six hundred kilos of fish forty pfennigs the kilo the petty officer said to odonnell in pretty good english odonnell scowled in thought then turned to butcher would you work that out fred youll do it faster n straighter than i would the first mate got a faraway look in his eyes his lips moved in silent cal culation before he spoke two hundred forty marks overall that makes sixty bucks for thirteen hundred pounds of fish more or less nickel a pound captain a hair under herr feldwebel well make that deal odonnell said at once every body on board did his best not to light up like candles on a christmas tree back in boston theyd get two cents a pound three if they were lucky then odonnell looked sly or since it aint like its your money youre playing with why dont you give me fifty pfennigs a kiloyou can tell your officers what a damn jew i amand well throw in a bottle of rum for you and your boys he turned and called into the galley hey cookie bring out the quart of medicinal rum will you ive got it right here captain charlie white said coming out of the galley with the jug in his hand he held it so the german sailors on the ripple could see it but any officers watching from the yorck with field glasses couldnt the smile on his black face was broad and inviting although george expected the rum to be plenty persuasive all by itself he was fond of a nip himself every now and then the petty officer spoke in german to the seamen with him the lowvoice colloquy went on for a minute or two before he switched back to english most rimes i would do this thing now it is better if i do not the bargain is as i first said it is have it your way feldwebel odonnell answered i said id make that deal and i will his eyes narrowed you mind telling me why its better if you dont take the rum now just askin out of curiosity you understand oh yescuriosity the petty officer said as if it were a disease hed heard of but never caught you have on this boat captain a wireless telegraph receiver and transmitter no odonnell told him id like to but the owners wont spring for it one of these days maybe how come i should not anything say the petty officer answered and he didnt anything say either instead he gave odonnell the marks hed agreed to pay odonnell handed the money to butcher who stuck it in his pocket the captain of the ripple kept on trying to get more out of the german sailor but he didnt have any luck finally in frustration he gave up and told george enos hell with it give em their fish and well all go on about our business right enos said again had he got the extra ten pfennigs a kilo he would have worked extra hard to make sure the yorck got the finest fish he had in the hold some of the haddock scrod down there the little fellows just over a pound would melt in your mouth when charlie fried em in butter and bread crumbshe got hungry just thinking about it but the young fish would also bring better prices back at the docks he gave the germans the bigger haddock and sole the trawl had scooped up from the bottom of the sea theyd be good enough and then some the germans didnt raise a fuss they were sailors but they werent fishermen their boat rode appreciably lower in the water when they cast off from the ripples rail and rowed back to the cruiser from which theyd come the yorcks crane lifted them out of the water and back on deck more flags broke out on the signal lines as the yorck began steaming toward boston once more thank you captain odonnell read through the spyglass signal youre welcome fred sure will captain the mate said and did george wished he had a good tall tumbler of cookies rum moving better than half a ton of fish out of the hold was hard work with that on his mind he asked lucas phelps ever hear of a sailor turning down the jug not when you stand to get away with it clean as a whistle like them squareheads did phelps answered wonder what the hell was chewin on their tails thats good rum cookies got too how do you know enos asked him phelps laid a finger alongside his nose and winked by the veins in that nose he knew rum well enough to be a connoisseur george enos chuckled sure enough hed wheedled a shot or two out of charlie himself it helped compress the endless monotony of life aboard a fishing boat they hauled in the trawl full of flipping twisting bottom fish once the load had gone into the hold captain odonnell peered down in there to see how high the fish were stacked they could have piled in another couple of trawlfuls but odonnell said i think were going to head for port were up over twenty tons the owners wont have anything to grouse about and well have some extra money in our pockets once fred turns those marks into dollars at the bank nobody argued with him nobody would have argued with him if hed decided to stay out another day or two and fill the hold right up to the hatches with haddock he made his pay by having the answers enos went into the galley for a mug of coffee he found fred butcher in there killing time with the cookie by the rich smell rising from butchers mug he had more than coffee in there enos blew on his own mug sipped and then said bet wed be out longer if that petty officer hadnt got the captain nervous bet youre right the mate said captain odonnell he doesnt like not knowing whats going on he doesnt like that even a little bit cookie nodded solemnly so did george butchers comment fit in well with his earlier thought about the captain if he didnt have the answers hed go after them the ripple puffed back toward boston at nine knots she was most of a day away from t wharf and home supper near sunset was corned beef and sauerkraut which made the sailors joke about charlie whites being a german in disguise hell of a disguise aint it the cook said taking the ribbing in good part he unbuttoned his shirt to show he was dark brown all over you must be from the black forest charlie and it rubbed off on you captain odonnell said which set off fresh laughter enos hadnt heard of the black forest till thenhed gone to work when he was a kid and had little schoolingbut from the way the captain talked about it he figured it was a real place in germany somewhere they rigged their running lamps and chugged on through the night the next day they passed between deer island light and the long island head light and then between governors island and castle island as they steamed toward t wharf on the north side of the charles river over in charlestown lay the boston navy yard enos looked that way as soon as he got the chance so did captain odonnell with the spyglass theres the yorck all right along with the rest of the western squadron of the high seas fleet he said doesnt look like anythings wrong aboard em any more than it does on our ships all quiet seems like he sounded annoyed as if he blamed the germans and the americanseasily distinguishable because their hulls were a much lighter grayfor the quiet fred butcher had his eye on profit and loss he was looking ahead to t wharf not many boats tied up he said we ought to get a good price at the fish exchange they tied up to the wharf and came up onto it to get their land legs back after more than a week at sea an old whitebearded man awkwardly pushing a fish cart with one hand and a hook mounted on the stump of his other wrist folded his meat hand into a fist and shook it at charlie white you go to hell you damn nigger he shouted in a hoarse raspy voice wasnt for your kind we wouldnt have fought that war and this hered still be one country you go to hell shaw enos shouted back at him he turned to the cookie dont pay him any mind charlie remember his family were muckymucks before the damn rebels broke loose they lost everything after the war and he blames colored folks for it lots of white folks do that charlie said and then shut up it was hard for the few negroes in the united states to get away from the scapegoat role that had dogged them for more than fifty years now compared to their colored brethren south of the masondixon line they had it easy but that wasnt saying much the rebels didnt have nigger hunts through the streets either those were an american invention like the telegraph and the telephone youre jake with us charlie lucas phelps said and all the fishermen from the ripple nodded theyd proved that in brawls on the wharf and in the saloons just off it george enos rubbed a scarred knuckle hed picked up in one of those brawls t wharf was chaoshorsedrawn wagons and gasoline trucks pushcarts and cats and dealers and screeching gulls and arguments and supreme above all else fishin the wagons in the trucks in the carts in the air shouting newsboys only added to the racket and confusion george didnt pay them any mind till he noticed what they were shouting archduke dies in sarajevo bomb blast kills franz ferdinand and his wife austria threatens war on serbia read all about it he dug in the pocket of the overalls he wore under his oilskins for a couple of pennies and bought a globe his crewmen crowded round him to read along a passage halfway down the column leaped out at the eye he read it aloud president roosevelt stated in philadelphia yesterday that the united states as a member of the austrogerman alliance will meet all commitments required by treaty whatever the consequences saying a nation at war with one member of the alliance is at war with every member he whistled softly under his breath lucas phelps finger stabbed out toward a paragraph farther down in richmond confederate president wilson spoke in opposition to the oppression of small nations by larger ones and confirmed that the confederate states are and shall remain part of the quadruple entente phelps spoke up on his own hook england and france ll lead em by the nose the way they always do the bastards theyll be sorry if they try anything by jingo enos said i did my two years in the army and i wouldnt mind putting the old greengray back on if thats what it comes down to same with me phelps said everybody else echoed him sometimes with profane embellishments except charlie white the negro cook said they dont draft colored folks into the army but damned if i know why they gave me a rifle id shoot me a confederate or three good old charlie george declared course you would he turned to the rest of the crew lets buy charlie a beer or two the motion carried by acclamation from the heights of arlington sergeant jake featherston peered across the potomac toward washington dc as he lowered the field glasses from his eyes captain jeb stuart iii asked him see anything interesting over there in yankeeland no sir featherston answered his glance slipped to one of the threeinch howitzers sited in an earthen pit not far away time may come when if we do see anything interesting well blow it to hell and gone he paused to shift the chaw of tobacco in his cheek and spit a stream of brown juice onto the red dirt id like that so would i sergeant so would i captain stuart said my father got the chance to hit the damnyankees a good lick thirty years ago back in the second mexican war he pointed over the river they repaired the white house and the capitol but we can always hit them again he struck a pose intended to show featherston he was not only a third generation confederate officer but also as handsome as either his famous father hero of the second mexican war or his even more famous grandfather hero of the war of secession and martyr during the second mexican war that might even have been true though the mustache and little tuft of chin beard he wore made him look more like a frenchman than a dashing cavalry officer of the war of secession well featherston had nothing against handsome though he didnt incline that way himself though he was a firstgeneration sergeant he had nothing against thirdgeneration officers so long as they knew what they were doing and he certainly had nothing against frenchmen the guns in his battery were copies of french s pointing over to the one at which hed looked before he said sir all you got to do is tell me which windows you want knocked out of the white house and ill take care of it for you you can rely on that oh i do sergeant i do captain stuart answered a horsefly landed on the sleeve of his butternut tunic the british called the same color khaki but being traditionbound themselves they didnt try to make the confederacy change the name it used stuart jerked his arm the fly buzzed away if theyd had guns like this in your grandfathers day sir wed have given washington hell from the minute virginia chose freedom featherston said not much heavier than an old napoleon but four and a half miles worth of range and accurate out to the end of it that would have done the job sure enough stuart agreed but god was on our side as things were and the yankee tyrants could no more stand against men who wanted to be free than king canute could hold back the tide he took off his visored capwith piping in artillery redand fanned himself with it hot and sticky he complained as if that were surprising in virginia in july he raised his voice pompey when the servant did not appear at once he muttered under his breath shiftless worthless lazy nigger pompeyr here i is suh the negro said hurrying up at a trot sweat beaded his cheeks and the bald crown of his head took you long enough stuart grumbled fetch me a glass of some thing cold while youre at it bring one for the sergeant here too somethin col yes suh pompey hurried off watching him go stuart shook his head i do wonder if we made a misake letting our british friends persuade us to manumit the niggers after the second mexican war he sighed i dont suppose we had much choice but even so we may well have been wrong theyre an inferior race sergeant now that they are free we still cant trust them to take a mans place so what has freedom got them a little money in their pockets to spend foolishly not a great deal more featherston had been a boy when the confederacy amended the constitution to require manumission he remembered his father an overseer cussing about it fit to turn the air blue captain stuart sighed again he might have been thinking along with featherston for he said the amendment never would have passed if we hadnt admitted chihuahua and sonora after we bought them from maximilian ii they didnt understand things so well down therethey still dont come to that but we wouldnt have our own transcontinental railroad without them so it may have been for the best after all better than having to ship through the united states thats certain yes sir featherston agreed the yankees thought so too or they wouldnt have gone to war to keep us from having em and look what it got them stuart said their capital bombarded a blockade on both coasts all the naval losses they could stand their cities up on the great lakes shelled stupid is what they wereno other word for it yes sir the sergeant repeated like any good southerner he took the stupidity of his benighted distant cousins north of the potomac as an article of faith if austria does go to war against serbia it wasnt changing the subject and captain stuart understood as much he picked up where featherston left off if that happens france and russia side with serbia you cant blame em the serbian government didnt do anything wrong even if it was crazy serbs who murdered the austrian crown prince but then what does germany do if germany goes to war and especially if england comes in were in the scrap no doubt about it and so are they featherston looked across the river again and washington goes up in smoke his wave encompassed the heights our battery of threeinchers here is a long way from the biggest guns weve got trained on em either not hardly stuart said with a vigorous nod you think cowboy teddy roosevelt doesnt know it he spoke the us presidents name with vast contempt havent seen him south of philadelphia since this mess blew up nor anybody from their congress either featherston chuckled you dont see anybody much there when it gets hot he wasnt talking about the weather the last thirty years they find somewheres else to go when it looks like theres liable to be shooting between us and them they were skedaddlers when we broke loose from em and theyre still skedaddlers today stuart spoke with conviction then his arrogant expression softened slightly one thing they always did have though was a godawful lot of guns now he looked across the potomac not at the white house and capitol so temptingly laid out before him but at the heights back of the low ground by the river on which washington sat in those heights were forts with guns manned by soldiers in uniforms not of butternut but of green so pale it was almost gray the forts had been there to protect washington since the war of secession theyd been earthworks then some those with fieldpieces like the ones captain stuart commanded still were those that held big guns though were concrete reinforced with steel again like their confederate opposite numbers i dont care what they have featherston declared it wont stop us from blowing that nest of damnyankees right off the map thats so captain stuarts gaze swung from the united states back to his own side of the river and arlington mansion the doriccolumned ancestral estate of the lee family that wont survive either theyd have wrecked it thirty years ago if their gunnery hadnt been so bad they arent as good as we are nowagain he spoke of that as if it were an article of faithbut theyre better than they used to be and theyre plenty good enough for that fraid youre right sir featherston agreed mournfully they hate marse robert and everything he stood for which only proves what kind of people they are stuart said he turned his head heres pompey back at last took you long enough is right sorry marse jeb said the negro he carried on a tray two sweati ng glasses in which ice cubes tinkled invitingly fs right sorry yes i is herei was makin this here nice fresh lemonade fo you and marse jake is what took me so long july in virginia aint no fun for nobody here you go suh featherston took his glass of lemonade which was indeed both cold and good as he drank though he narrowly studied pompey he didnt think stuarts servant was one bit sorry when a negro apologized too much when he threw marse around as if he were still a slave odds were he was shamming and behind his servile mask either laughing at or hating the white men he thought he was deceiving thanks to what jakes father had taught him he knew nigger tricks what could you do about that kind of shamming though the depressing answer was not much if you insistedrightly featherston was convinced blacks show whites due deference how could you punish them for showing more deference than was due you couldnt not unless they were openly insolent which pompey hadnt been in fact his show of exaggerated servility had taken in his master get on back to the tent now pompey stuart said setting the empty glass on the negros tray he smacked his lips that was mighty tasty i will tell you glad you like it suh pompey said hows yours marse jake fine featherston said shortly he pressed the cold glass to his cheek sighed with pleasure and then put the glass beside the one stuart had set on the tray with a low bow pompey took them away hes all right even if i do have to get down on him stuart said watching the negros retreat you just have to know how to handle niggers is all yes sir featherston said once more this time with the toneless voice noncommissioned officers used to agree with their superiors when in fact they werent agreeing at all stuart didnt notice that any more than hed noticed pompey laying the dumbblack act on with a trowel he was a pretty fair officer no doubt about it but he wasnt as smart as he thought he was of course when you got right down to it who was cincinnatus stepped on the brake as he pulled the duryea truck up behind the warehouse near the covington docks he muttered a curse when a policemanworse by the peacock feather in his cap a kentucky state trooper happened to walk past the alleyway and spy him the trooper cursed too and loudly he didnt have to hide what he thought he yanked his hogleg out of its holster and approached the negro at a swagbellied trot pointing the revolver at cincinnatus face he growled you better show me a pass or you is one dead nigger got it right here boss cincinnatus showed more respect than he felt he pulled the precious paper out of his passbook and handed it to the state trooper the mans lips moved as he read cincinnatus works for kennedy shipping and has my leave to drive the kennedy shipping truck in pursuit of his normal business needs thomas kennedy proprietor he glowered at cincinnatus i dont much hold with niggers drivin any moren i do with women then grudgingly but it aint against the lawif youre really tom kennedys nigger what do you say if i call him on the tellyphone hey go ahead boss cincinnatus said he was on safe ground there the trooper stuck the pistol back in its holster ahh the hell with it he said but i tell you somethin an you better listen good he pointed north toward the ohio river just across there its the younited states right he waited for cincinnatus to nod before going on any day now all hells gonna break loose between us and them some people they see niggers like you down here by the docks or anywhere near they aint gonna ask to see your pass they gonna figger youre a spy an shoot first then stop an ask questions i got you boss cincinnatus assured him the trooper nodded and went on his way when his back was turned cincinnatus allowed himself the luxury of a long silent sigh of relief that hadnt turned out so bad as it might have not anywhere near he was resigned to playing the servant to every white man he saw if you didnt want to end up swinging from a lamppost you did what you had to do to get by and the state trooper had even given him what the man meant as good advice that didnt happen every day as far as cincinnatus was concerned the fellow was crazy but that was another matter keep all the black folks away from the covington docks good luck mr trooper sir cincinnatus said with a scornful laugh every longshoreman and roustabout on the docks was colored white men dirty their hands with such work cincinnatus laughed again then all at once he sobered maybe the state trooper wasnt so crazy after all if war came no riverboats would come down the ohio from the united states or up it from the mississippi and the heart of the confederacy both sides had guns up and down the river trained at each other without that trade what would the dockworkers do for that matter what would cincinnatus do he looked toward the ohio himself one thing he wouldnt do he figured was try to run off to the united states no matter how the trooper worried about that in the confederacy there were more negroes around than whites wanted except when dirty work needed doing so the whites gave them a hard time in the united states which had only a relative handful of negroes the whites didnt want any moreso they gave them a hard rime shit even them bignosed jews got it better up there than weuns do cincinnatus muttered somebody could doubt whether you were a jew wasnt any doubting about whether he was black wasnt any doubt hed spent too long daydreaming in the truck either a bigbellied white man in overalls and a slouch hat came out of the warehouse office and shouted that you out there cincinnatus or did tom kennedy get hisself a real fortrue dummy for a driver this time sorry mr goebel cincinnatus said as he descended for once he more or less meant it he knew he had been sitting when he should have been working sorry he says goebel mournfully shook his head he pointed to a hand truck come on get those typewriters loaded last things i got in this warehouse he sighed liable to be the last yankee goods we see for a long time i aint old enough to remember the war of secession but the second mexican war that was just a little feller this one here its liable to be bad cincinnatus didnt remember the second mexican war he was within a year either way of twentyfive but the newspapers had been screaming war for the past week troops in butternut had been moving through the streets politicians were ranting on crates on every corner dont sound good cincinnatus allowed if i was you id get out of town goebel said my cousin morton he called me from lexington yesterday and said clem he said clem you shake your fanny down here where them cannons cant reach and i reckon im gonna take him up on it yes i do white folks take so much for granted cincinnatus thought as he stacked crated typewriters on the dolly and wheeled it out toward the duryea if clem goebel wanted to get out of covington he just upped and went if cincinnatus wanted to get out of town and take his wife with him he had to get written permission from the local commissioner of colored affairs get his passbook stamped wait till acknowledgment came back from the state capitalwhich could and usually did take weeksthen actually move reregister with his new commissioner and get the passbook stamped again any white man could demand to see that book at any time if it was out of order well you didnt want to think what could happen then jail a fine he couldnt afford to pay anything a judgebound to be a mean judgewanted the typewriters were heavy the stout crates in which they came just added to the weight cincinnatus wasnt sure hed be able to fit them all into the bed of the truck but he managed by the time he was done the rear sagged lower on its springs sweat soaked through the collarless unbleached cotton shirt he wore clem goebel had stood around without lifting a finger to help he took it for granted that that sort of labor was nigger work but he wasnt the worst white man around either when cincinnatus was done he said here wait a second and disappeared into his little office he came back with a bottle of dr pepper dripping water from the bucket that kept it if not cold cooler than the air thank you sir thats right kind cincinnatus said when goebel popped off the cap with a church key and handed him the bottle he tilted back his head and gulped down the sweet spicy soda water till bubbles went up his nose when the bottle was empty he handed it back to goebel go on keep it the warehouseman said cincinnatus stowed it in the truck after thanking him again for once he felt only half a hypocrite hed gladly pocket the penny deposit he cranked the engine to start it got the truck in gear and headed south down greenup street toward kennedys storerooms a policeman in gray uniform and one of the tall britishstyle hats that always reminded cincinnatus of fireplugs held up a hand to stop him at the corner of fourth and greenup a squadron of cavalry big wellmounted white men with carbines on their shoulders revolvers on their hips and sabers mounted on their saddles was riding west along fourth probably going to camp in devon park cincinnatus thought peoplewhite peoplecheered and waved as the cavalry went by some of them waved maltesecross battle flags like the one that flapped at the head of the squadron others stars and bars like the sixteenstar banner above the post office across the street from cincinnatus the cavalrymen smiled at the pretty girls they saw a couple of them doffed their plumed hats which looked much like the one the kentucky state trooper had worn but were decorated with the yellow cord marking the mounted service after the last horse had clopped past the covington policeman reveling in his small authority graciously allowed northsouth traffic to flow once more cincinnatus stepped on the gas hoping his boss wouldnt cuss him for dawdling hed just pulled up in front of tom kennedys establishment when a buzzing in the air made him look up god almighty its one o them aeroplanes he said craning his neck to follow it as it flew up toward the ohio what are you doing lollygagging around like that goddamn it kennedy shouted at him but when he pointed up into the sky his boss stared with him till the aeroplane was out of sight the head of the shipping company whistled i aint seen but one o those before in all my born daysthat barnstorming feller who came through town a couple years ago doesnt hardly seem natural does it no sir said cincinnatus whose acquaintance with flying machines was similarly limited that wasnt no barnstormin aeroplane thoughdid yall see the flag painted on the side of it didnt even spy it kennedy confessed i was too busy just gawpin and thats a fact he was a big heavyset fellow of about fifty with a walrus mustache and ruddy tender irish skin that went into agonies of prickly heat every summer especially where he shaved now he turned a speculative eye toward cincinnatus he was a long way from stupid and noticed others who werent you dont miss much do you boy try not to sir cincinnatus answered never can tell when somethin you see it might come in handy thats a fact kennedy said youre pretty damn sharp for a nigger thats another fact you arent shiftless you know what i mean you act like you want to push yourself up get things better for your wife the way a white man would dont see that every day cincinnatus just shrugged everything kennedy said about him was true he wished he hadnt made his ambition so obvious to his boss it gave kennedy one more handle by which to yank him as if being born white werent enough all by itself sometimes he wondered why he bothered with ambitions that would probably end up breaking his heart sure he wanted to push himself up but how far could you push when white folks held the lid on right above your head the wonder wasnt that so many negroes gave up the wonder was that a few kept trying seeing he wasnt going to get anything more than that shrug kennedy said you pick up the whole load of typewriters all right sure did sir they was the last things left in goebels warehouse though he aint gonna be left much longer his own selfsays hes headin down to lexington with his cousin this war scare got everybody jumpy cant say as i blame clem neither kennedy said i may get out of town myself matter of fact havent made up my mind about that wait till it starts i figure and then see what the damnyankees do but you you got nowhere to run to huh no not hardly cincinnatus didnt like thinking about that kennedy had more in the way of brains than clem goebel if he didnt think covington was a safe place to stay it probably wasnt he understood cincinnatus was stuck here too sighing the laborer said let me unload them typing machines for you boss that kept him busy till dinnertime he lived down by the licking river south of kennedys place close enough to walk back and forth at the noon hour if he gulped down his corn bread or salt pork and greens or whatever elizabeth had left for him before she went off to clean white folks houses a shape in the rivera cheese box on a raft was what it looked like caught his eye he whistled on the same note tom kennedy had used when he saw the aeroplane by treaty the united states and the confederate states kept gunboats off the waters of the rivers they shared and the waters of tributaries within three miles of those jointly held rivers if that gunboatthe yankees called the type monitors after their first one but southerners didnt and wouldntwasnt breaking the treaty it sure was bending it cincinnatus whistled again a low worried note more people higherup people than goebel and kennedy thought war was coming mobilize flora hamburger cried in a loud clear voice we must mobilize for the inevitable struggle that lies before us the word was on everyones lips now since president roosevelt had ordered the united states army to mobilize the day before newsboys on the corner of hester and chrystie half a block from the soapboxactually it was a beer crate filched from the croton brewery next doorshouted it in headlines from the new york times and the early edition of the evening sun all those headlines spoke of hundreds of thousands of men in greengray uniforms filing onto hundreds of trains that would carry them to the threatened frontiers of the united states to maryland and ohio and indiana to kansas and new mexico to maine and dakota and washington state just by looking at the crowded streets of the tenth ward of new york city flora could tell how many men of military age the dragnet had scooped up the men who hurried along chrystie were most of them smoothfaced youths or their graybearded grandfathers the newsboys werent shouting that the reserves the men of the previous few conscription classes whod served their time were being called up with the regularsthey wouldnt reveal the governments plan to the rebels or to the britishlickspittle canadians their terms but flora had heard it was so and she believed it the papers told of pretty girls rushing up and kissing soldiers as they boarded their trains of men who hadnt been summoned to the colors pressing twentydollar gold pieces into the hands of those who had of wouldbe warriors flocking to recruiting stations in such numbers that some factories had to close down the croton brewery was draped in redwhiteandblue bunting so was public school number seven across the street the entire countrythe entire worldwas going mad flora hamburger thought up on her soapbox she waved her arms and tried to bring back sanity we must not allow the capitalist exploiters to make the workers of the world their victims she declared trying to fire with her own enthusiasm the small crowd that had gathered to listen to her we must continue our ceaseless agitation in the cause of peace in the cause of workers solidarity around the world if we let the upper classes split us and set us one against another we have but doomed ourselves to more decades of servility a cop in a fireplug hat stood at the back of the crowd listening intently the first amendment remained on the books but hed run her in if she said anything that came close to being fighting wordsor maybe even if she didnt hysteria was wild in the united states if you said the emperor had no clothes you took the risk of anyone who spoke too clearly but the cop didnt need to run her in the crowd was less friendly than those before which she was used to speaking somebody called are you socialists going to vote for teddys war budget we are going to do everything we can to keep a war budget from becoming necessary flora cried even three days earlier that answer to that question had brought a storm of applause now some people stood silent their faces set in disapproving lines a few booed one or two hissed nobody clapped if war comes that same fellow called will you socialists vote the money to fight it youre the second biggest party in congress dont you know what youre doing why werent you mobilized flora thought resentfully the skinny man was about twentyfive close to her own agea good age for cannon fodder in a man few to match him were left in the neighborhood flora wondered if he was an agent provacateur roosevelts democrats had done that sort of thing often enough on the east side disrupting the meetings not only of socialists but also of the republicans who hadnt moved leftward when their party split in the acrimonious aftermath of the second mexican war but she had to answer him she paused a moment to adjust her picture hat and pick her phrases then said we will be caucusing in philadelphia day after tomorrow to discuss that as the majority votes the party will act she never would have yielded so much a few days before here in new york city sentiment against the war still ran strongor stronger than most places anyhow but many of the socialists constituentsthe miners of pennsylvania and west virginia the farmers of minnesota and dakota and montanawere near one border or another and were bombarding their representatives with telegrams embracing not the international brotherhood of labor but rather the protection of the american frontier almost pleadingly flora said can we let the madness of nationalism destroy everything the workers not just here in the united states but also in germany and austria and in france and england and even in canada and the confederacyyes i dare say that for it is true she went on over a chorus of boos have struggled shoulder to shoulder to achieve i say we cannot i say we must not if you believe the sacred cause of labor is bound up in the idea of world politics without war give generously to our cause she pointed down to a washedout peach tin the label still on that sat in front of her crate give for the workers who harvested that fruit the miners who by the sweat of their brow dug out the iron and tin from which the can is made the steelworkers who made it into metal the laborers in the cannery who packed the peaches the draymen and drivers who brought them to market give now for a better tomorrow a few people stepped up and tossed coins into the peach tin one or two of them tossed in banknotes flora had plenty of practice in gauging the take from the racket the money made she would have done better today working in a sweatshop and donating her wages to the cause she thanked the small crowd less sincerely than she would have liked picked up the can and started down the street with it toward socialist party headquarters shed gone only a short way when a beer wagon full of barrels pulled by a team of eight straining horses rattled out of the croton brewery and down chrystie street it got more applause than she hadseeing a load of barrels was supposed to be good luckand would make far more money for its firm than flora had for the socialists the thought depressed her the party had been educating the proletariat all over the world showing the workers how they could seize control of the means of production from the capitalists who exploited their labor for the sake of profit theyd made progress too no civilized government these days would call out troops to shoot down strikers as had been commonplace a generation before surely the revolution whether peaceful or otherwise could not be far away what sort of weapon could the plutocrats devise to resist the united strength and numbers of the working classes her lips thinned into a bitter line how simple the answer had proved threaten to start a war all at once you estranged german workers from french english from austrian american from confederate though the rebels also called themselves americans few socialists had imagined the proletariat was so easily manipulated tenth ward party headquarters was on the second story of a brownstone on centre market place across the street from the raucous market itself a kosher butcher shop occupied the first story flora paused for a moment in front of the butchers plateglass window before she went upstairs some of her dark wavy hair had come loose from the bobby pins that were supposed to hold it in place with quick practiced motions she repaired the damage inside the shop the butcher aptly named max fleischmann waved to her she nodded in reply fleischmann came out and looked down into the peach tin he shook his head youve made more he said in yiddish then reached into his pocket and tossed a dime into the can you didnt have to do that flora felt her face heat her eyes flicked to her reflection in the window she couldnt tell if the flush showed probably not not with her olive skin youre not even a socialist so i voted for roosevelt this means my money isnt good enough for you feh fleischmanns wry grin showed three gold teeth if you people go bankrupt and have to move out from upstairs who knows what kind of crazy maniacs i get right over my head when we moved in you called us crazy maniacsand worse than that flora reminded him she stared down into the can of peaches that charity dime made the days take no less pathetic shaking her head she said the whole world is going crazy now though were the ones who are trying to stay sane to do what needs doing crazy is right fleischmann clenched a workroughened hand into a fist the confederates theyre moving all sorts of troops to the border trying to get the jump on us and the canadians their great lakes battleships have left port it says in the papers what are we supposed to do what with them provoking us from all sides like this flora gaped at the butcher in blank dismay the bacillus of nationalism had infected him too and he didnt even notice it she said if all the workers would stand together thered be no war mr fleischmann oh yes if we could trust the rebels this would be wonderful fleischmann said but how can we we know they want to fight us because theyve fought us twice already am i right or am i wrong flora we have to defend ourselves dont we am i right or am i wrong but dont you see the confederate workers are saying the same thing about the united states fools max fleischmann snorted realizing the argument was hopeless flora started upstairs the butchers voice pursued her am i right or am i wrong when she didnt answer he snorted again and went back into his shop the socialist party offices were almost as crowded as the tenements all around desks and tables and file cabinets jammed into every possible square inch of space leaving a bare minimum of room for human beings two secretaries in smudged white shirtwaists tried without much luck to keep up with an endless stream of calls they mixed english and yiddish in every conversationsometimes it seemed in every sentence herman bruck nodded to her as usual he seemed too elegant to make a proper socialist what with his twobutton jacket of the latest cut and the silk ascot he wore in place of a tie his straw boater hung on a hat rack near his desk he looked so natty because he came from a long line of tailors how did it go he asked her though hed been born in poland his english was almost without accent not so good flora answered setting down the can with a clank do we know whats what with the caucus brucks sour expression did not sit well on his handsome features a telegram came in not half an hour ago he answered they voted eightyseven to fourteen to give roosevelt whatever money he asks for oy flora exclaimed now the madness is swallowing us too on theoretical grounds the vote does make some sense bruck said grudgingly after all the confederacy is still in large measure a feudal economy defeating it would advance progressive forces there and might lift the negroes out of serfdom would might flora laced the words with scorn and have they declared canada feudal and reactionary too no bruck admitted they said nothing about canada putting the best face on things they could i suppose putting the best face on things doesnt make them right flora said with the stern rectitude of a temperance crusader smashing a bottle of whiskey against a saloon wall bruck frowned a moment before hed been unhappy with the delegates of his party now because it was his party and he a disciplined member of it he defended the decision it had made be reasonable flora if theyd voted to oppose the war budget that would have been the end of the socialist party in the united states everyone is wild for this war upper class and lower class alike wed have lost half our members to the republicans maybe more whenever you throw away whats right for whats convenient you end up losing both flora hamburger said stubbornly of course everyone is wild for the war now the whole country is crazy gottenyu the whole world is crazy does that mean we should say yes to the madness how wild for war will people be when the trains start bringing home the bodies of the laborers and farmers the capitalists have murdered for the sake of greed and markets bruck raised a placating hand youre not on the soapbox now flora our congressmen our senators are going to vote unanimouslyeven the fourteen said theyd go along with the party will you stand alone no i suppose not flora said with a weary sigh discipline told on her too if we dont back the caucus what kind of party are we we might as well be democrats in that case thats right bruck said with an emphatic nod youre just worn out because youve been on the stump and nobodys listened to you what do you say we walk across the street and get something to eat all right she said why not it has to be better than this bruck rescued his boater from the hat rack and set it on his head at a jaunty angle well be back soon he told the secretaries who nodded with a flourish he held the door open for flora saying if you will forgive the bourgeois courtesy this once she said something more than half seriously a lot of bourgeois courtesy was a way to sugarcoat oppression then out in the hall bruck slipped an arm around her waist hed done that once before and she hadnt liked it she didnt like it now either and twisted away glaring at him be so kind as to keep your hands to yourself you begrudge bourgeois courtesy but youre trapped in bourgeois morality bruck said frustration on his face socialists should be free to show affection where and how they choose flora answered on the other hand they should also be free to keep from showing affection where there is none does that mean what i think it means it means exactly that flora said as they started down the stairs they walked across centre market place toward the countless stalls selling food and drink in a silence that would have done for filling an icebox from behind the butchershop counter max fleischmann watched them and shook his head all of richmond streamed toward capitol square reginald bartlett was one more drop of water in the stream one more straw hat and dark sack suit among thousands sweating in the early august sun he turned to the man momentarily beside him and said i should be back behind the drugstore counter is that a fact the other replied not a bit put out by such familiarity not today i should be adding up great long columns of figures myself but how often do we have the chance to see history made not very often bartlett said he was a roundfaced smiling freckled man of twentysix the kind of man who wins at poker because you trust him instinctively thats why im on my way the pharmacist told me to keep things running while he went to hear president wilson but if hes not there will he know im not there not a chance of it the accountant assured him not even the slightestoof someone dug an elbow into the pit of his stomach quite by accident he stumbled and staggered and almost fell had he gone down he probably would have been trampled as things were he fell back several yards and was replaced beside bartlett by a colored laborer in overalls and a cloth cap nobody would be asking the negro for a pass not today if he got fired tomorrow for not being on the job he took the same chance bartlett did there werent many negroes in the crowd far fewer in proportion to the mass than their numbers in richmond as a whole part of the reason for that probably was that they had more trouble getting away from their jobs than white men did and part of it too was that they had more trouble caring about the glorious destiny of the confederate states than whites did the bell in the tower in the southwestern corner of capitol square rang the alarm over and over again clang clang clang clang clang clang clang clang clang most often those three chimes endlessly repeated meant fire in the city today the alarm was for the nation as a whole bartlett nimbly dodged round carriages and automobilessome fords imported from yankee country a rolls full of gentlemen in top hats white tie and cutaways and several manassas machines built in birmingham that could make no headway with men on foot packing the streets even bicycles were slower than shanks mare in this crush he rounded a last corner and caught sight of the great equestrian statue of george washington in capitol square washington in an inspiring gesture pointed southtoward the state penitentiary wags said whenever scandal rocked the confederate congress the bronze washington also pointed toward an even larger more imposing statue of albert sidney johnston he and the bronze warriors in forage caps who stood guard at the base of the pedestal he topped memorialized the brave men prominent and humble alike who had fallen for freedom in the war of secession just to one side of the johnston memorial a team of carpenters had hastily run up a platform to set dignitaries above the level of the common throng the pine boards of the platform were still bright and yellow and unweathered the same could not be said for the men who sat in folding chairs upon it a lot of the graybeards had seen service not merely in the second mexican war but also in the war of secession nor were the beards all that was gray there side by side sat patrick cleburne and stephen ramseur wearing identical uniforms of the obsolete color more like what the yankees wore nowadays than modern confederate military dress aging lions though could wear what they pleased as everyone else was doing bartlett wiggled as close to the platform as he could if the crush on the street had been bad that within capitol square was appalling not twenty feet from him somebody shouted in outrage hed had his pocket picked sneak thieves were probably having a field day for people were packed so tight they couldnt help bumping up against one another and accidental contact was hard to tell from that made with larcenous intent the few ladies in the crowd were bumped and jostled almost as much as their male counterpartsnot intentionally perhaps but unavoidably beg your pardon maam bartlett said after being squeezed against a pretty young woman more intimately than would have been proper on a dance floor he couldnt tip his hat he hadnt room to raise his arm to his head she nodded accepting his apology as shed probably accepted a dozen others the remembered feel of her body pressed to his made him smile as the motion of the crowd swept them apart hed been politethat came automatically as breathing to a wellraised young manbut his thoughts were his own to do with as he would by dint of stubbornness worthy of what folks said about new england yankees bartlett slithered and squirmed up to within a few yards of the ring of butternutclad soldiers who held the crush away from the platform with bayoneted rifles dont you take a step back watkins damn you the officer in charge of them shouted make them do the moving bartlett wondered if the guards would have to stick someone to make the crowd stand clear the pressure behind him was so strong it seemed as if the people could crush everything between themselves and the platform a high muckymucknot a graybeard but a portly dapper fellow with a sandy pointed beard like that of the king of englandleaned down over the railing and spoke to that officer after a moment bartlett recognized him from woodcuts hed seen that was emmanuel sellars the secretary of war was he giving the command for a demonstration against the crowd bartlett couldnt hear his orders if he was it would be pandemonium bartlett got ready to flee and hoped the stampede wouldnt run over him the officera captain by the three bars on either side of his collar shouted to his men bartlett couldnt make out what he said either but fear ran through him when some of the guards raised the rifles to their shoulders but they aimed up into the air not at the people and fired a volley bartlett hoped they were shooting blanks if they werent the bullets were liable to hurt somebody as they fell into the sudden startled silence the gunshots brought a fellow with a great voice shouted hearken now to the words of the president of the confederate states of america the honorable woodrow wilson the president turned this way and that surveying the great swarm of people all around him in the moment of silence the volley had brought then swinging back to face the statue of george washingtonand incidentally reginald bartletthe said the father of our country warned us against entangling alliances a warning that served us well when we were yoked to the north before its arrogance created in our confederacy what had never existed beforea national consciousness that was our salvation and our birth as a free and independent country silence broke then with a thunderous outpouring of applause wilson raised a bony right hand slowly silence or a semblance of it returned the president went on but our birth of national consciousness made the united states jealous and they tried to beat us down we found loyal friends in england and france can we now stand aside when the german tyrant threatens to grind them under his iron heel no bartlett shouted himself hoarse along with thousands of his countrymen stunned deafened he had trouble hearing what wilson said next jealous still the united states in their turn also developed a national consciousness a dark and bitter one as any so opposed to ours must be he spoke not like a politician inflaming a crowd but like a professor setting out argumentshe had taken the one path before choosing the other the german spirit of arrogance and militarism has taken hold in the united states they see only the gun as the proper arbiter between nations and their president takes wilhelm as his model he struts and swaggers and acts the fool in all regards now he sounded like a politician he despised theodore roosevelt and took pleasure in roosevelt s dislike for him when war began between england and france on the one hand and the german empire on the other we came to our allies aid as they had for us in our hour of need i have as you know asked the congress to declare war upon germany and austriahungary and now as a result of our honoring our commitment to our gallant allies that man roosevelt has sought from the us congress a declaration of war not only against england and france but also against the confederate states of america his servile lackeys misnamed democrats have given him what he wanted and the telegraph informs me that fighting has begun along our border and on the high seas leading our great and peaceful people into war is a fearful thing not least because with the great advances of science and industry over the past halfcentury this may prove the most disastrous and terrible of all wars truly a war of the nations indeed a war of the world but right is more precious than peace and we shall fight for those things we have always held dear in our hearts for the rights of the confederate states and of the white men who live in them for the liberties of small nations everywhere from outside oppression for our own freedom and independence from the vicious bloody regime to our north to such a task we can dedicate our lives and our fortunes everything we are and all that we have with the pride of those who know the day has come when the confederacy is privileged to spend her blood and her strength for the principles that gave her birth and led to her present happiness god helping us we can do nothing else men of the confederacy is it your will that a state of war should exist henceforth between us and the united states of america yes the answer roared from reginald bartletts throat as from those of the other tens of thousands of people jamming capitol square someone flung a straw hat in the air in an instant hundreds of them bartlett s included were flying a great chorus of dixie rang out loud enough bartlett thought for the damnyankees to hear it in washington someone tapped him on the shoulder he whirled aroundand stared into the angry face of milo axelrod his boss i told you to stay and mind the shop dammit the druggist roared youre fired bartlett snapped his fingers under the older mans nose and this here is how much i care he said you cant fire me on account of i damn well quit they havent called up my regiment yet but im joining the army now is what im doing go peddle your pillsus real men will save the country for you a couple of months from now after weve licked the yankees you can tell me youre sorry ii n ellie semphroch huddled behind the counter in the ruins of her coffeehouse wondering if she would die in the next instant shed been wondering that for hours ever since the first confederate shells began falling on washington dc beside her her daughter edna wailed when will it stop mother will it ever stop lord help me i dont know the widow semphroch answered she had twice her daughters twenty years on her bitter experience seamed the long oval face they otherwise shared i just dont know it wasnt like this when a shell crashed down nearby the ground quivered and jerked as if in pain fragments sprayed through the blank square that had been the front window before it shattered early in the bombardment edna brushed dark blond curlsa brighter shade than nellies which were streaked with gray out of her eyes and repeated despairingly will it ever stop it wasnt like this when the southerners shelled us before nellie said at last able to get in another complete sentence when i was a girl they bombarded washington yes but after an hour or so they were done i was scared then but only for a little while thats why we didnt leave when now instead of a shell edna interrupted her we should have mama we should have gotten out while we could along with everybody else not everybody left nellie said her daughters bitterness making her defensive a great host of people had though as crisis in some distant part of europe became by the magic of farflung alliances crisis in america too while washington remained the nations capital congress hadnt met there since the second mexican war going about their business under confederate guns had seemed intolerable before war was declared an endless procession of wagons and buggies and motorcars jammed the roads leading north out of the capital and every train bringing in soldiers had been full of civilians on its outbound journey but nellie and edna had sat tight selling coffee to panicky bureaucrats and swaggering soldiers alike theyd made a lot of money and nellie had been certain that even if war broke out the rebels would not seek to destroy what had once been their capital too they hadnt back in shed been wrong sweet jesus christ how wrong shed been she knew that now to her everlasting sorrow the confederacys bombardment of washington a generation before had been more a demonstration that the south could be frightful if it so chose than actual frightfulness in and of itself having hit a few targets the confederates had gone on to fight the war elsewhere this time they seemed intent on leaving no stone in the capital of the united states standing upon another once just before sunrise nellie had gone to a well to draw a bucket of watershelling had burst the pipes that carried water through the city the capitols dome was smashed the building itself burning not far away the white house had also become a pile of rubble and the needle of the washington monument no longer reached up to the skythat despite the rebels claims to revere washington as the father of their country too more guns boomed these not the confederate cannon across the potomac but american guns replying from the high ground north of washington shells made freighttrain noises overhead then thudded to earth with roars like distant thunder kill all those rebel bastards edna shouted blow arlington to hell and gone so we dont have the goddamned lees looking down on us like lords blow their balls off every fucking one of them nellie stared at her daughter where ever did you learn such language she gasped absurdly at that moment her first impulse was to wash ednas mouth out with soap after a moments reflection though she wished she let the words out more readily herself she knew themoh she knew them and when hell came up here on earth what did a few bad words matter im sorry mama edna said but then her chin came up no im not sorry not a bit of it i wish i knew worse to call the confederates if i did i would and thats the truth what you just said is pretty bad nellie had not led a sheltered lifefar from itbut shed seldom heard a lady curse as her daughter just had then again shed never been in a situation where tons of death fell randomly from the sky as the judge said of the man who knifed a poker partner because he spotted an ace coming out of his sleeve there were mitigating circumstances more freighttrain noises filled the air these from the east and south rebel artillery striking back at us guns because the confederates were trying to hit the cannons shells stopped falling on washington itself and began smashing the hills that ringed the city edna stood up maybe we can get out of town now mama she said hopefully maybe nellie rose too the air was thick with smoke and dust and a harsh odor she supposed came from explosives half the chairs and tables in the coffeehouse lay on their sides or upside down the fine linen tablecloths that gave the establishment a touch of classand that nellie was still paying forwere rags now torn rags a shell fragment had ripped into the fancy brass coffee grinder that gleamed out in front of the counter nellie wouldnt be grinding coffee with it again not any time soon she shivered and had to grasp the counter for a moment if a fragment had done that to sturdy machined brass what would it have done to flesh a few feet to one side and she would have found out no hadnt been like this she walked toward what had been her front window and was now a square opening with a few jagged shards round the edges out in the street which had suddenly acquired deep pocks like the face of a man whod never been vaccinateda shattered delivery wagon sat on its side the horses that had drawn it gruesomely dead in the traces nellie gulped shed killed and plucked and gutted plenty of chickens and even a few pigs but artillery was a horrifyingly sloppy butcher she hadnt imagined horses had that much blood in them either a scrawny stray dog came up and sniffed the pool she shouted at it it ran away behind the wagon she could just see an outflung arm no the driver hadnt been luckier than his animals can we get out of town do you think ma edna repeated nellie raised her eyes from the street to the high ground for a moment she did not understand what she was seeing and thought a midwestern dust storm had suddenly been transplanted to those low rolling hills dust there was aplenty but no wind to raise it instead it came from the carpet of shells the confederates were laying down when she looked more closely she spied the ugly red core of fire in each explosion she wondered how anything could live under such bombardment and if anything did her question there was answered a moment later for not all the flames came from landing shells some sprang from the muzzles of us guns hurling death back at the enemy to her amazement she discovered she could briefly follow some of the big american shells as they rose into the sky she turned her head toward the potomac smoke and buildings obscured most of her view there but from what she could tell the virginia heights were taking as much of a pounding as those around washington good she thought savagely from behind her edna said lets go ma nellie waved her daughter up alongside her and pointed to the bombardment raining down outside of town i dont think wed better she said looking at that were safer where were at edna bit her lip but nodded across the street something moved inside a battered cobblers shop nellies heart jumped into her mouth until she recognized old mr jacobs who ran the place he waved to her calling you are still alive widow semphroch i think so yes nellie answered which brought a twisted smile to the cobblers wizened face before she could say anything more the sound of many booted men running made her turn her head a stream of greengrayclad american soldiers in matching forage caps pounded past the wrecked delivery van and dead horses sunlight glinted from the bayonets theyd fixed to the ends of their rifles you civilians better get back under cover one of them shouted the damn rebsbeg your pardon maamtheyre liable to try comin across the river they do were gonna give em what for aint that right boys the soldiers made harsh eager grunts unlike any nellie had heard before not all of them were fuzzbearded boys some had to be close to thirty mobilization had scooped up a lot of men whod done their two years a long time ago and put them back in the army a couple of the soldiers were trundling a machine gun along on its little wheeled carriage when they came to shell holes in the street they either maneuvered it around them or manhandled it over its fat brass water jacket must have been newly polished for it gleamed brighter than the bayonets one of the machinegun handlers stared at edna and ran his tongue over his lips as if he were a cat that had just finished a saucer of cream nellie glanced over to her daughter who was filthy bedraggled exhausted but young unmistakably young men nellie thought a oneword indictment of half the human race not long ago or so it seemed theyd looked at her that way and shed looked back shed done more than look back in fact that was the start of how edna came to be and why her name had changed from houlihan to semphroch in such a tearing hurry she heard a fresh noise in the air a sharp quick whizz a couple of soldiers looked up to see what that was a couple of others wiser or more experienced threw themselves flat on the ground only a couple of seconds after the whizz first reached her ears it was followed by a huge bang at the head of the column men reeled away from the explosion shrieking there were more whizzes in the air now too the confederates had spotted the moving infantrymen and decided to open up on them bang bang bang shells struck up and down the length of the battalion nellie didnt see all the slaughter they worked get down she screamed to edna even before the second whizzing shell fell and burst to make sure edna listened and didnt stare back at the machine gunner bold in his uniform she dragged her daughter to the floor more fragments whined past overhead the shells that went whizzbang werent very big the front wall of the coffeehouse stopped most of their fragments though plenty screamed through what had been the window and scarred the plaster above the counter the barrage stopped as suddenly as it had begun that didnt mean the street was silent far from it cries and screams and moans and wails and sounds of pain for which nellie had no descriptive words filled the air she got to her feet and looked out the street had been a sorry sight before the slaughter now was worse than anything shed ever imagined men and pieces of men lay everywhere the ones who were dead were less appalling than the ones who were wounded a trooper tried to stuff spilled intestines back into his belly through a neat slit torn in his tunic another sat staring foolishly at his right arm which hed picked up off the pavement and was holding in his left hand quietly without much fuss he crumpled over and lay still we have to help them ma edna said we have plenty of rags and things nellie hadnt noticed her daughter get up beside her she nodded though she knew what would happen if more shells caught them out in the open stretcher bearers were taking charge of some of the wounded they nodded gratefully though when they saw nellie and edna come out with old clothes in their hands the second man nellie bandaged was the machine gunner whod leered at edna now his face was waxy pale instead of ruddy and alight with lust nellie had to force his handsprotectively cupped too lateaway from the wound at the base of his belly before she could try to stanch the bleeding if he lived he wouldnt be doing much with the girls not any more off to the west rifle fire rang out you lived in the city you heard guns every so often you got to know what they sounded like but a moment later nellie heard a sound shed never known before it was something like gunfire something like a giant ripping a piece of canvas the size of a football field it made the hair stand up at the back of her neck mangled and in agony though he was the machine gunner smiled a little he knew what the sound was though nellie didnt seeing his knowledge made her understand too so thats the noise a machine gun makes nellie murmured the palefaced soldier nodded a single short jerk of his head good nellie told him that means the rebs are catching it hot he nodded again the wheat was turning golden under the warm august sun from the front porch of his farmhouse arthur mcgregor surveyed the crop with dour satisfaction the quickripening hybrid marquis strain hed put in the ground these past few years beat the old red fife all hollow here a quarter of the way from the us border to winnipeg every day you could shave off the growing season was a good one especially since half your ground lay fallow each year mcgregora tall lean man his face weathered almost like a sailors from endless exposure to sun and windwatched the wheat bow and then straighten politely acknowledging the breeze the fields seemed to go on forever he let out a sour snort that was partly because hed had the work of plowing and planting them but the manitoba prairie was flat as a sheet of newspaper flat as if it had been pressed and so in a way it had from what the geologists said great sheets of ice had lain here in ancient days squashing down any irregularities that might once have existed for hundreds of miles the only blemishes on the surface of the land were the belts of wire and the fortifications on either side of the border between the united states and the dominion of canada mcgregor sighed thinking about that long thin porous border late rains or early frost could blight his crops so could war his wife maude came out of the house to stand beside him theyd been married fifteen years ever since hed got out of the army and gone into the militia almost all his adult life in other words and all of hers if they hadnt thought alike back in the days when they were courtinghe wasnt quite sure about that not after so longthey certainly did now and so it was maude who said theyve come over the border eh they have arthur mcgregor sighed after winnipeg ive no doubt only a slight difference in accent an extra tincture of scots that made the last word sound like doat told him from one of the americans he despised and feared they take the town they cut the country in half they do maude turned and looked southward as if in fear of locusts though soldiers from the united states were liable to prove even more destructive under her bonnet she wore her red hair tightly pinned down against her head but it was so fine wisps kept escaping the pins and springing out in front of her face she brushed them back from her gray eyes with workroughened hands like her husband shed never known an easy day in her life the devils own lot of them down there she said her voice worried dont i know it dont we all know it mcgregor sighed again sixty sixtyfive million of them maybe eight million up here by the way he spoke he expected everyone in the united states young or old man or woman to parade past the farmhouse in the next few minutes were not alone eh maude said maybe she was seeing sixty or sixty five million angry americans in her minds eye too weve england with us and the confederacy and the empire of mexico england s going to be busy close to home her husband answered with the ingrained pessimism of a man whod been wrestling with a stubborn mother nature for a living since before he needed to shave mexico s nothing maybe less and the yanks outweigh the confederates two to one or more too they can fight them and have plenty to spare for us maude peered south again this time as if looking past the usa to the csa i dont know i much care for having those people on our side when you get down to it the way they treat their colored people they might as well be russians arthur mcgregor suggested wryly the czars on our side too the yanks are no bargain either wed never have had conscription up here if they didnt start it first and these days down there from what the newspapers say you fill out a form for this you fill out a form for that you fill out a form for the other thing same as you would if the kaiser was running things only free land on the continent is where were standing seems to me pa pa his son alexander came running toward the house his voice cracking in excitement as any fourteenyearolds was apt to do theres soldiers coming pa he pointed to the north arthur his mind focused on the threat from the united states hadnt looked back toward winnipeg in a while now he did sure enough as his son had said here came a cavalry troop small in the distance down toward the border with dakota alexander jumped up and down waving frantically at the soldiers arthur mcgregor waved too but in a more measured way he had a much better idea than his son of what war actually entailed the troopers waved back then to mcgregors surprise one of them peeled off from the rest and guided his chestnut toward the farmhouse at a fast trot he reined in just in front of the porch a little sallow fellow with waxed mustache who lifted his cap to maude before nodding gravely to arthur and less gravely to alexander who was all but hopping out of his overalls good day my friends the cavalryman said with a french accent that explained his swarthiness i am pierre lapin lieutenanthis fingers brushed the single pip on his shoulder boardof the horse is it that my men and i could use your well for the purpose of watering ourselves yes sir go right ahead all of you mcgregor had to make a conscious effort not to stiffen to attention the couple of weeks he spent drilling every year made him give an officer automatic deference you are gracious merci lapin said and waved to his men they all followed the path he had taken dippers in the bucket maude mcgregor said pointing to the well lieutenant lapin tipped his hat to her again which made her flush and giggle like a schoolgirl unlike lapin who carried a pistol on his officers sam browne belt his troopers wore carbines slung on their backs and had sabers fixed to the left side of their saddles they queued up at the well chattering in the odd mix of english and french mcgregor remembered from his own days in the army not so long ago as such things went canadians who used french and those who spoke english had disliked and distrusted one another but with both groups disliking and distrusting their giant neighbor to the south even more the older rivalry was less remembered mcgregor went up to lapin who was waiting for his men to finish before he drank himself quietly so maude wouldnt hear the farmer asked will they get this far when the cavalry lieutenant didnt answer he went on ive got a rifle in the houseuse it for hunting ill hunt things in greengray if i have to lapins shoulders went up and down in a gallic shrug whether they will come so far i cannot say with certainty i will say though if they do come so far and you have not been called to the colors to resist them be cautious with that rifle the americans they take their lessons from the baches his curled lip said what he thought of thatand the boches in the war with france in the last century were harsh against francstireurs thank you sir ill bear that in mind mcgregor said but if they invade your country and youre defending your home shouldnt matter whether youre in uniform or not what should matter and what does matter monsieur are not one and the same thing i regret to say lapin answered with another shrug a muttering in the distance almost too deep almost too soft almost too far to hear thunder a long ways off mcgregor thought but it wasnt thunder not on this fine bright dayhe realized that with the thought hardly formed thats artillery he said his voice flat and harsh vous avez raison lieutenant lapin agreed i could wish you were wrong but yet another shrug and so perhaps it grows more likely the americans will reach this place but if they do they will have paid a stiff price good mcgregor said what price will you have paid though that is of no consequence not to my country lapin replied his turn at the well came at last he drained the dipper dry refilled it and drained it again it is the price i agreed to pay when i joined the army he touched the brim of his cap in half a salute i thank you for the water and i wish you the best of fortune in the hard days that surely lie ahead he swung up onto his horse calling on his men to hurry and remount they soon rode away more of what wasnt thunder came from the south it didnt sound closer but it was louder more guns in action or bigger guns both most likely mcgregor judged now that the fight had started the americans the canadians and the men of the mother country would throw everything they had into it with that growing rumble in the background mcgregors satisfaction in his fields of amber grain evaporated with his country and the united states harvesting the fruits of longtime enmity any chance hed have to bring in his own harvest seemed small and dim instead of watching the waving wheat he kept gazing southward after the cavalrymen before long he saw motion on the road coming up from the south without turning his head he said fetch me the rifle alexander yes pa his son answered the boy thundered up the stairs two at a time and returned a moment later holding the pumpaction winchester with the careful confidence of someone long used to guns arthur mcgregor checked to make sure he had a cartridge in the chamber then stood and waited to see what sort of onslaught was coming before he could raise the rifle to his shoulder he realized he wasnt seeing the imminent arrival of the americans only people fleeing from them fear had almost made him fire on his own countrymen thin across the wheatfields their shouts reached him urging him to join them he had a buggy in the barn if he hitched up the horses to it and loaded maude and alexander and his two little daughters into it he could be on the road to winnipeg inside an hour and there the day after tomorrow will we go pa alexander asked the sight of other folks fleeing seemed to have given him the idea that war was something more than a game mcgregor thanked god something this side of getting shot ator maybe this side of getting shothad done that he shook his head no we wont go well stick it out a bit longer see what happens alexander looked proud more soldiers went down the road a long column of marching infantry some canadian some british then trucks painted khaki then more marching men a plume of coal smoke rose from the stack of a distant southbound train mcgregor would have bet all the acres he had that every compartment on every car was full to overflowing with men in tunics and puttees some of them would be gay some frightened that wouldnt matter and wouldnt say anything about what sort of soldiers theyd make once they got to the fighting the rumble of artillery went on and on he went on too on about his chores when you were forking hay or pulling weeds or shoveling manure for long stretches of time you could forget about what your ears were telling you then as you paused to wipe your face on your sleeve youd notice the noise again in absurd surprise almost as if it had snuck up behind you and tapped you on the shoulder to make you jump it was getting louderand unquestionably getting closer he hadnt wanted to believe that at first when you noticed the thunder only every so often you didnt think to compare it from then till now or think your hearing was telling you the enemy was drawing nearer which meant your own men were falling back but that was true by the time evening camethe sun didnt set quite so late as it had at the height of summerthere could be no doubt left the family sat down to chicken stew with dumplings and carrots in a grim mood no one not even julia and mary who usually prattled on in spite of children should be seen but not heard said much the girls helped their mother wash the dishes while arthur mcgregor smoked a pipe he checked the tin from which he filled it virginia tobacco an import from the confederate states not the usa that made him feel better he woke several times in the night not something he usually didif god had invented anything more exhausting than farm labor mcgregor hadnt heard of it but when he sat up in the blackness he heard the crash of guns not so steady as they had been during the day but not stopping either and whenever he sat up the guns were closer he woke for good in the pale gray of false dawn one arm flopped across the other side of the bed which was empty he sniffed and smelled tea steeping maude was up before him then he put on his overalls and boots and went downstairs a couple of cups of strong tea heavy with milk and sugar gave back some of what hed lost in sleep a lot of work to do today he said as if that were the only thing on his mind maude nodded as if she believed him he was working when the sun came up hammering a fresh board onto the side of the chicken coop something moving in the fields caught his eye it was a man a soldier he saw after a moment heading north without the slightest thought for road or anything else trampling down the nearly ripe wheat and not caring at all mcgregor opened his mouth for an angry shout it died unspoken that first soldier hed seen was but one of many trotting through the wheat their bodies hidden only heads and shoulders showing they looked like nothing so much as shipwreck survivors bobbing in the sea here though what might have been wrecked was canada before long horsemen joined the retreat they were in better order than the infantry stopping every so often to fire shots in the direction of an enemy arthur mcgregor could not yet see a cavalry officer leading a couple of packhorses and a squad of soldiers who seemed to be under his command rode up to mcgregor lieutenant lapin he said in surprise oui monsieur we meet again the frenchcanadian officer answered wearily if hed slept at all since riding south the previous day he didnt show it but he still had fight in him pointing to the packhorses he went on i have here a pair of machine guns ammunition and soldiers who know how to use them i desire to make strongpoints of your house and your barn we have as you see been thrown back we may yet damage the invader though go ahead mcgregor said at once he knew his permission was irrelevant lapin had disguised a firm statement of intent with politeness but the intent remained the farmer went on can your men drive the livestock out of the barn first and give me and mine a chance to get clear of the house strongpoints drew fire he knew that all too well id better hide the rifle he thought secrecy came easy to him and fear made it come easier that is but a matter of common decency though i fear in war decency is anything but common lapin gave the orders more men seeing him not in headlong retreat rallied around him a firing line stretched across the wheatfield mcgregor got maude and alexander julia and mary and took them off away from the house they led the family cows and horses no time to hitch the horses to the buggy not now mcgregor didnt know where to go with his family and the animals toward the road was the only idea he had to join the stream of refugees trudging toward winnipeg he was about halfway to the dirt track when alexander exclaimed here come the americans you could tell them from the canadian defenders by their greengray uniforms by the shouts of hurrah that burst from their throats every few paces by the fact that they werent looking back over their shoulders and by how many of them there were they came in a great wave close together as far as the eye could see again mcgregor had the horrible mental picture of everybody in the united states grabbing a gun and heading for winnipeg now though the soldiers were heading for him then the machine guns began to hammer back in the buildings the neighbors had helped his father run up their hideous racket made his head snap back toward the house and barn when he looked back in the direction of the american soldiers once more it was as if his fields had had a thresher go over them where the soldiers had been wheat they were mowed into stubble more of them came forward and more of them went down as the machine guns spat fire through their ranks they were too far away for mcgregor to see how they died only that they died not all of them died at once of course a great chorus of agony rose from the fields even above the racket of machine guns and rifle julia clamped her hands over her ears make them stop it papa she screamed make them stop mcgregor couldnt make them stop if he could have he wouldnt he exulted to see the americans fall and writhe and die what business did they have invading his country like their german allies they seemed to specialize in attacking small defenseless nations that had done them no harm one way or another he vowed to himself he would make them pay they were paying now but they were also still moving forward a bullet kicked up dust not far from mcgregors feet he heard more bullets smacking into the timbers of the house and the barn where pierre lapin was holed up the machine guns kept working a fearful slaughter but the skirmish line lapin had set up was thin and did not could not hold to east and west yanks in greengray bypassed the strongpoint as if it were high ground still above water in the middle of a flood that didnt last long the americans swung round behind the buildings firing around themfiring inside themgrew to a crescendo before abruptly falling silent a couple of soldiers came up to the mcgregors they held their rifles at the ready by the way they panted by the way their eyes glittered they would open fire at any excuse or none arthur mcgregor was careful to keep his hands in plain sight and to make no sudden moves he was glad he didnt have the rifle on his shoulder too that there your house asked one of the yanks a fellow with corporals stripes on his sleeves he and his companion smelled the way mcgregor did before maude heated up water for a saturday night bath only more so its mine mcgregor said shortly the american corporal gestured with his rifle go on back to it put your critters in the barn again we cleaned out your soldiers and we aint got nothin against civilians go on back he scratched his cheek maybe the upswept wings of the kaiser bill mustache tickled ever think maybe civilians have something against you alexander said his voice hot you got a mouthy kid the corporal said to arthur he gets too mouthy maybe the house and the barn catch on firejust by accident understand i understand mcgregor said he didnt know whether in the end canada could win the war he did know he and his family had just lost it dowling the generals voice cracking and full of phlegm echoed through the st louis headquarters of the us first army god damn it to hell dowling have you gone and died while i wasnt looking get yourself in here this instant or youll be sorry you were ever born yes sir coming sir major abner dowling hastily finished buttoning his fly at the moment he was sorry hed ever been born of all the men to whom he could have been adjutant dowling wheezing thunderthe general hadnt heard him the general was hard of hearing not surprising since he was heading toward seventyfive even when he did hear he was confounded hard of listening here sir dowling rushed into the office he wanted to wipe off his face he was built like a rolltop desk and moving quickly in hot muggy weather made sweat pour down his ruddy cheeks but that would have been a violation of military decorum and his commanderthe first armys commandermade men pay for such trifling lapses about time major the general grumbled but let it go at that dowling knew some relief the old fool was just as likely to have kept riding him all day get me a cup of coffee man and put something in it to open my eyes up you know what i mean yes sir dowling said the coffeepot sat on top of an alcohol lamp to keep what was inside hot more alcohol rested in the sideboard drawer brandy of a finer grade than the army used for medicinal purposes the general liked his medicine though his adjutant poured a hefty nip into the coffee cup then handed it to him thank you very much now that hed got exactly what he wanted the general was gracious absurdly he preened as well as a fat old man shoe horned into a uniform three sizes too small could preen peroxided locks spilled out from under the hat he wore indoors and out to hide the bald crown of his head hed dyed his drooping mustachios too the color of piss dowling thought uncharitably when the general sipped the coffee his rheumy blue eyes did open wider that is the straight goods major glad you like it general custer dowling said with your permission he waited for custers nod before filling his own cup not without regret he substituted cream and sugar for the commanding generals brandy custer drank his coffee almost as fast as he would have had the cup contained nothing bur firewater he held it out in an imperious liverspotted hand for a refill dowling didnt lace it with as much brandy this time if the commander fell asleep over his maps the first army would do even less than it had up till now and it hadnt done much im not satisfied with the reports the cavalry is bringing us from western kentucky custer declared not satisfied at all by god major they call that scouting they call that gathering intelligence why when i was in a blue uniform instead of this mosscolored monstrosity dowling inserted a couple of mental earplugs as his commander ranted on most of the men whod fought in the war of secession were dead and just about all the ones who werent dead had long since been put out to pasture custer should have been as far as dowling was concerned but he hadnt hed flourished albeit more on account of persistence and luck than any military virtue past blind aggressiveness hed been on the plains when the second mexican war broke out and spent that conflict the graveyard of so many us military reputations using gatling guns on the kiowas and then on a division of canadians led over the border by a british general even more blindly aggressive than he was having made himself a hero in two wars conspicuously lacking suchand having made sure the newspapers let the world know just what a hero he washed assured his rise to lieutenant generals rank and his tenure in the army for as long as his bloated body would endure it hadnt given out yet the real problem was that hed had only a couple of new thoughts since the s and none since the s gently dowling tried to bring him up toward modern times much harder for cavalry to move now sir than it used to be machine guns have been hard on horses you know our aeroplanes have brought back excellent sketches of confederate defenses though and with them machine guns are all very well for mowing down savages but properly trained and disciplined troops shouldnt be so leery of them custer said our troops are shying from them like so many virgins at the touch of a man and as for aeroplanes he snapped his fingers theyre all very fine for impressing yahoos at county fairs but you cant take them seriously as weapons of war mark my words major in five years time the newfangled contraptions will be as forgotten as ozymandias yes sir dowling said that seeming a safer course than asking who ozymandias was and having to sit through a lecture that had nothing to do with the war still trying valiantly to remind custer that they had reached the twentieth century he went on the couple of armored automobiles weve been able to deploy have also given good service newfangled contraptions custer repeated as if scoring a point i know what we need to do major i merely need to ensure the navys cooperation before we undertake it if we can throw a strong force of infantry into kentucky theyll beat down the confederates defenses there allowing our cavalry to get into the enemys rear and complete his destruction as he flees if the sailors can hold off the rebel river monitors yes sirif dowling said if on the other hand one of those heavily armed heavily armored craft got loose among the barges and such shipping americans across the river the slaughter would be horrendous and since the monitors were so heavily armored holding them away from the landing force would be anything but easyno wonder the navy was shillyshallying about that i shall go to the front custer said suddenly catching dowling off guard yes thats what ill do my presence there will surely inspire the men to give the utmost effort and he added with an angry snort i am sick to death of being bombarded with telegrams demanding that i move faster roosevelt delights in having the war department nag me he has delighted in making my life difficult for more than thirty years the general commanding first army and the president had fought the british together during the second mexican war by all the signs neither had enjoyed the experience custer went on we are punching into canada i hearbut that is all roosevelt will let me do hear about it i mean yes sir dowling said in his most placating tones that did no good custer was off to the races damn it to hell and gone i should be the one punching into canada roosevelt knows what i owe the goddamn canucks they murdered my brothershot him down like a dog in front of my eyes i deserve that command and the chance to take revenge at last but do i get it have i any chance of getting it no by jingo roosevelt has had it in for me since and he will not give it to menot till my dying day i wager the one thing i want more than any other in all the world and i cannot have it do you knowhave you got any ideahow maddening that is im sure it must be sir dowling said with some sympathysome but not much for hed been listening to custer on the same subject for longer than he wanted to custer would not let it go he clung like a bulldog or considering the bare natural state of his gums perhaps more like a leech he took a couple of deep breaths then went on we are fighting hard all across the plains we have invaded western virginia so why the brass hats in philadelphia demand dont i move idiots cretins imbeciles because teddy roosevelt has it in for me they do too to them dowling the ohio and the mississippi are little squiggly blue lines on a map nothing more i am the one who has to find the way across make arrangements at once to transfer headquarters to vienna illinois as soon as is practicable why are you still standing there gaping ill attend to it immediately sir dowling promised custer had a pointthrowing an army into confederate territory wasnt going to be easy here but if he thought his presence at the front would help things along he was probably fooling himself whether he understood it or not war had changed over the past fifty years most of the soldiers wouldnt know he arrived and most of the ones who did know wouldnt care and one more thing custer ordered keep it secret half these missourians and more than half the downstate lllinoisans wish they were rebs our scouts may have trouble in kentucky but theirs i have no doubt enjoy a fine old time here ill take care of that too sir dowling said if the germans can keep their plans secret from the damned frenchmen they rule in alsacelorraine i expect we can keep the wouldbe southerners from getting word of ours wed better custer bared his teeth in what was meant for a fearsome grimace since those teeth were far too white and even and perfect to have stayed in his own mouth for threequarters of a century the effect was more nearly ludicrous than frightening dowling quickly turned his back so the commanding general wouldnt see him giggle then hurried off to do custers bidding baking in the late summer sun the plains of kansas didnt look much different from the plains of sequoyah just to the south hellfire corporal stephen ramsay said once we got past the barbed wire we aint had any trouble atall good sergeant bobby brock answered we want to do this quick and get the hell out he looked around at the two companies of cavalry we aint got the men to stand up to any big bunch o yankee soldiers both menramsay little and lithe brock taller thicker through the shoulders and slowermovingrode just behind the standard bearer the stars and bars flapped lazily pointing to it ramsay said maybe the damnyankees up in kingmanll think thats the united states flag till were right up on top of em they look enough alike now dont they sure enough do brock agreed ramsay liked to talk anything that makes our job easier is all right by me he said i dont expect any trouble here not even the yankees got enough men to cover all the barbed wire on all the frontier our boys shoot off some cannon a ways east of us they all go runnin over there to find out what were doin an we slip across easy as you please yeah brock let his horse a big sorrel gelding trot on for another few paces then went on i wonder how many soldiers the yanks got into our country the same kind o way however many there was only way theyll come out is feet first ramsay said confidently theyre only yankees after all we licked em twice running an well do it again hellfire warll be over by winter on account of theyll have done given up thatd be good brock said and let it go from which ramsay concluded his sergeant had some doubts he shrugged bobby brock could be a bit of an old lady sometimes but you didnt want anybody else along when the fighting got serious they rode past a farmhouse the farmer was out in his fields he knew right off they were from the confederate states and started running like hell back to his farmhouse shall we get rid of him sir ramsay asked the captain in charge of the raiders captain hiram lincoln often made himself out to be the toughest bird around maybe because he had such an unfortunate last name but now he shook his head cant waste the time he said fellow doesnt have any telephone wires goin into his house so hes not going to get word to anybody we keep riding well hit the railroad track pretty soon remind me again sir ramsay said bowing to the appeal to military necessity we going in west of kingman or east west captain lincoln answered the blockhouse they built to protect the railroad is on the east side of town we dont want to tangle with that them damn machine guns theyre liable to take all the fun out of war the standardbearer a kid named gibbons pointed ahead to a smudge on the horizon reckon thats kingman sir swing left lincoln told him well want to set ourselves on the track a couple miles away from town up ahead a church bell began ringing as if announcing the end of the world a machine gun in the blockhouse began to chatter but the bullets fell far short of the confederates ramsay nodded to himself captain lincoln had known what he was talking about all right he glanced over to brock the sergeant nodded back at him it was nice to have an officer who knew which end was up theres the track lincoln said lets go they knew what to do some of them had grandfathers whod done the same thing in the war of secession they had better tools for mischief than their grandfathers had used though under captain lincolns direction the troopers fanned out to cover the demolition crew the specialists got to work with their dynamite one of them hit the plunger on the detonator ramsays horse shied under him at the flat harsh bark of the explosion clods of dirt came raining down on him and the animal both he hadnt moved back quite far enough you could make a hell of a hole with dynamite a hole that would take a long time to fill by pickandshovel work the explosive also did a good job of twisting rails out of shape till the yanks brought in some fresh iron they werent going to be using this line to ship things from one coast to the other dismounting ramsay gave the reins to a cavalryman who was already holding two other horses then he went over to the pack animals and started pulling crowbars off the panniers they carried to either side come on boys he shouted lets tear up some more track the confederates fell to work with a will laughing and joking and whooping as they separated the iron rails from the wooden ties that bound them the demolition men used gasoline to start a fire on the prairie they didnt worry about its spreading as they would have back in their own country if it got out of hand that was the yankees problem come on ramsay said again he lugged a cross tie over to the fire and threw it in the rest of the troopers followed his example then several men to a rail they hauled the lengths of track over and threw them in too theyd slump in the heat and have to be taken to an ironworks to be straightened they had one rail left to cast into the fire when gunshots rang out in the east over toward kingman not just rifle shots but the hard quick chatter of a machine gun mount and form skirmish line captain lincoln yelled no more horseplay not a bitweve got some real work to do now ramsay reclaimed his horse and sprang into the saddle he checked to make sure he had a round in the chamber of his tredegar carbine then made sure his front pockets were full of fresh fiveround clips he had a cavalry saber a copy of the british pattern of strapped to the left side of his saddle but who could guess whether hed get a chance to use it against a machine gun captain lincoln was holding a pair of field glasses up to his eyes looks like theyve got maybe half a company of horse he said half a company of horse anduhoh they got one of those newfangled armored automobiles with em too thats where the machine gun is at a predatory grin stretched across his face well lets go see what the contraption is worth move em out his voice rose to a shout again before long ramsay could pick out the armored car without any help from field glasses as it bounced over the prairie it kicked up more dust than half a dozen horses would have the confederate pickets fell back before it the yankee horsemen encouraged by the mechanical monsters presence pursued a lot more aggressively than they would have otherwise considering how outnumbered they were the armored car didnt move much faster than a trotting horse the ma chine gun it mounted sat in a steel box on top of the superstructure the gunner swung it back and forth through a slit in the metal giving him about a ninetydegree field of fire ramsay waved toward the vehicle we get around to the side and it cant hurt us he called to the squadmates who rode with him he rapidly discovered that wasnt quite true not only did the gun traverse in its mounting but the driver by swinging the front end of the armored car this way and that could bring it to bear on targets it wouldnt have been able to reach otherwise and the yankee troopers were doing their best to make sure the confederates couldnt outflank the ugly noisy thing anyhow a bullet cracked past ramsays head the noiseand the fright it gave himmade him realize this wasnt practice any more the us soldiers were doing their damnedest to kill him and their damnedest by the way his comrades and their horses were crashing to the ground was better than hed expected hed never seen combat before not even fighting mexican bandits along the frontier with the empire his cherry was gone now by jesus he raised his carbine to his shoulder and fired at a greengrayclad yankee the fellow did not pitch from the saddle so he had to have missed he worked the bolt to get rid of the casing and chamber a fresh round then fired again another bullet zipped past him and another now he didnt bother looking after he fired to see what effect each round had the more he put in the air the better his chance of hitting something a lot of bullets were hitting the armored car the sound of them rattling off its side put ramsay in mind of hail hitting a tin roof but the car kept on coming like an ironclad smashing its way through a navy of wooden ships the comparison was apt for it was doing more damage to the confederates all by its lonesome than all the troopers who came with it bobby brock made a noise somewhere between a groan and a scream there was a neat hole in the front of his uniform tunic as he slumped down over his horses neck ramsay got a look at the hole the bullet had made going out through his back that wasnt neat at all it looked more as if somebody had set off half a stick of dynamite in his chest the trooper right alongside of brock went down as his horse took three bulletsneck barrel and hockfrom that damned machine gun in the space of a second and a half the cavalryman pulled himself free but he didnt bounce to his feet having a horse fall on your leg wasnt the best thing that could ever happen to it for a couple of dreadful minutes ramsay was afraid the armored car would win the little battle all by its lonesome even though the confederate troopers were mopping the floor with the damnyankees whenever they could engage them away from the car with its machine gun but then the vehicle all of its tires shot out slowed to walking pace and when it went into a hole couldnt pull itself out no matter how the engine growled and roared and sent up clouds of stinking exhaust ramsay threw back his head and let out the catamount wail of a rebel yell damn thing is stuck boys he shouted now we can get around behind it and settle the rest of these bastards the confederates went wide to right and left around the boggeddown armored car getting away from the deadly arc of fire its machine gun could command once that gauntlet was run chasing the yankee cavalry back toward kingman proved the work of only a few minutes and now we settle with this goddamn thing captain lincoln said riding toward the armored car from the rear the machine gunner proved to have a firing port in the back of the steel box that enclosed him he banged away with a pistol the range was still long for a handgun and he missed captain lincoln yelled parley dammit the us soldier held his fire lincoln said you come out of that damned iron turtle of yours or well chuck a couple of sticks of dynamite under it and blow yall to kingdom come with a squeal of metal against metal a hinged roof on top of the armored car and a door in its side came open the machine gunner stood up with his hands in the air and the driver stepped out all right youve got us the gunner said with a grin sounding and looking a lot more jaunty than he should have considering how much damage hed done to good southern men and horses take us and he never got any farther than that somebodys carbine barked at almost pointblank range the back of his head blew off in a spray of blood and brain and bone he collapsed dead before he knew what hit him with a cry of horror the armoredcar driver tried to dive back into his machine several more shots stretched him lifeless beside it chew our people up and make like its a game you can just walk away from will you ramsay said he hadnt fired at the men whod surrendered but he didnt miss them a bit either you want to fight us get on a horse and fight fair somebody else added which made troopers heads bob up and down in agreement captain lincoln set his hands on his hips and snarled in exasperation god damn it to hell now we got to blow up that machine he said otherwise the yankeesll find the bodies like that and start shootin our prisoners too the armored car went up in a ball of flame as a stick of dynamite set off the gasoline in the fuel tank machinegun bullets ignited by the fire added brisk popping sounds as they cooked off one after another all right we did what we came to do lincoln said looking from the funeral pyre of the armored car to the wrecked stretch of track lets get back home ramsay was happy to obey yes theyd done what theyd come to do but the cost of every three men whod left sequoyah only two were going back and one of them was wounded and all that or almost all of it from one armored car that bogged down pretty fast he spurred his horse up close to captain lincolns sir whats cavalry supposed to do when we run into four or five of those machine guntotin machines not just the one like we fought today lincoln didnt answer for so long ramsay started to wonder if hed heard the captain looked back over his depleted command i dont know corporal i just dont know come on come on come on captain irving morrell urged his men forward dust spurted up under his boots as with every stride he penetrated deeper into confederate sonora the faster we move the less chance they have of setting up lines against us one of his soldiers sweat soaking through his uniform as he slogged through the desert under the weight of a heavy pack pointed up into the sky they already got their lines set sir he said morrell hadnt heard the buzz of a spying confederate aeroplane but looked up anyhow he burst out laughing no aeroplane up there just half a dozen vultures all of them circling hopefully they wont get us altrock he said theyre waiting for us to feed em some rebs that must be how it is sir the infantryman agreed he stepped up his pace to match that of his commander you bet thats how it is morrell said kicking at the light brown sandy dirt didnt we give em a blueplate special when we crossed from nogales into new montgomery several men nodded enthusiastically in response to that the bombardment of the confederate town had done everything it was supposed to do silencing the enemys guns and sending civilians streaming away in panic white confederates their black servants and laborers and the brown folk whod lived there since the days before the rebels bought sonora from a mexico strapped for cash to pay england and france what it owed the garrison had fought but theyd been outnumbered as well as outgunned the way into sonora toward guaymas and the pacific end of the confederate railway net lay open morrell meant to do everything he could to make sure that line got cut he was a lean man in his midtwenties with a long face light eyes and sandy hair he wore cropped close to his skull he gulped a salt tablet and washed it down with a swig of warm water from his canteen other than that he ignored the sweat gushing from every pore he ignored everything not directly concerned with the mission and pursued everything that was with a driving energy that brought his men along too come on he called again stepping up the pace weve cracked the shell now we get to suck the meat out one of his first lieutenants a big gangly fellow named jake hoyland moved up alongside him map in hand next town ahead is imuris he said pointing theres some mines around there too copper mines cocospera he read the name off the map with the sublime disregard for spanish pronunciation growing up in michigan gave him the division will secure those and the united states will exploit them morrell said we have an advantage over our german allies here jake sir hoyland wasnt much given to strategic thought hed make captain one day but he probably wouldnt rise much further than that patiently morrell explained germany is attacking france on a narrow front and the french and the damned english can be strong against them all along it we have about the population of germany and the confederacy and canada together close to the population of france but we have thousands and thousands of miles of frontier with our enemies not a few hundred except in a few places defense in depth becomes impossible oh i see what you mean maybe hoyland even did he pointed to the map again how will we exploit these cocospera mines probably with the niggers the rebels brought in to work them morrell answered shrugging thats not our worry our worry is to take them yes sir now hoyland wiped his face with his sleeve leaving a smear of dust on his cheek even hotter here than it was up in the usa you ask me weve only come twenty miles for gods sake morrell said in some exasperation weve got a long haul before we get to guaymas he looked back over his shoulder dust clogged the horizon to the north hiding the men and horses and cannon and horsedrawn wagons and motor trucks that had stirred it up he knew they were there though intent on sealing the western part of the confederacy from the rest of the country not only was guaymas a railhead it was the only real pacific port the rebels had shut it down and this part of the south withered on the vine the rebels knew as much too their frontier force had been smashed in the opening us attack but they were still doing what they could to resist off to the northeast of imuris the desert rose up into low rolling hills theyd mounted some threeinch field guns up on the high ground and were banging away at the advancing us column more dust rising from the us left showed cavalryor more likely mounted infantrypeeling off to deal with the confederates those nuisance field guns had accomplished their objective to distract some of the american force from its primary mission morrell refused to be distracted he scrambled between strands of barbed wire that marked the outer bounds of some ranchs property he could see the ranch house and its outbuildings a couple of miles ahead shimmering in the heat haze as on the us side of the border ranches were big here because water was scarce and precious and the ground scrubby as a result you needed a lot of acreage for your stock he didnt see any of that stock the owner whoever he was an oldtime mexican or a southern johnnycomelately morrell wondered had run it off to keep the us forces from getting their hands on it theyd probably run off themselves toowith luck so fast they hadnt had a chance to take everything out of the ranch house whatever they hadnt taken the us army would a rifle barked up ahead a bullet kicked up dirt maybe fifty yards from morrells feet as if that first one had been a test a fusillade of rifle shots rang out morrell threw himself flat on his belly somewhere behind him a wounded man let out a breathless angry curse from the volume of fire the confederates were there in about platoon strength morrell didnt hear the deadly chatter of a machine gun for which he thanked god even after the bombardment of new montgomery machine guns in the ruins had chewed holes in the us forces well flank em out he shouted hoyland your platoon to the left koenig yours to the right foulkes ill stay with your boys here in the center well advance by squads lets go the confederates had had time to dig themselves holes and their duncolored uniforms werent easy to spot against the graybrown dirt here at least they matched the terrain better than the us troops did they could not let themselves be taken from the sides though and began falling back toward the ranch house and other buildings as their foes moved forward here and there a brave man or two would stay in a hole and die in place buying his comrades time to retreat one of those diehards popped up not ten feet from morrell the us captain shot first with a cry of pain the confederate fell back he wasnt through though he tried to bring his rifle to bear once more morrell sprang down into the hole and finished him with the bayonet he got out and resumed the advance we cant let em get set he said press em hard every one of you a us soldier was already sprawled behind a woodpile near the house firing at the rebels inside a body sprawled out through a window and poured blood down onto the flowers below with better cover though the confederates were taking a heavy toll on the us troopers firing came not only from the ranch house but also from the barn the chicken coop and what looked like a little separate smithy then three of morrells men rushed into the smithy after a sharp short volley it became a us strongpoint rather than a confederate one but heavy firing still came from both the ranch house and the barn several men in butternut burst out of the barn and ran toward the house which was closer to the advancing us soldiers come on morrell shouted to his own men he burst from the cover of a scraggly bush and sprinted toward the confederates firing as he ran they fired too a couple of bullets cracked past him he didnt have time to be afraid he fired again saw one man fall worked the bolt on his springfield and pulled the trigger his only reward was a dry click hed just spent the last round in the magazine no chance to fumble for a fresh one the rebels couldnt have been more than twenty or thirty feet away hed always been pretty good with the bayonet if he stuck one confederate maybe the rest would run shouting once more for his men to follow him he rushed at the enemy the bullet caught him in the right thigh the rifle flew out of his hands and crashed to the ground so did he looking down at himself he saw in mild surprise that a chunk of meat about the size of a clenched fist was missing from the side of his leg blood spilled out onto the hot dry thirsty ground he didnt hurtand then he did his groans were lost in the racket of gunfire nobody could come to retrieve him not when he lay right between the two battling forces nobody fired at him to finish him off either he was not altogether sure that was a mercy the fierce sun beat down on him next thing he remembered the sun was in a different part of the sky somebody was rolling him over onto his back did they think him dead the very idea made him indignant but noprivate altrock was wrapping something around his leg get that belt good and tight lieutenant hoyland said hes already lost a hell of a lot of blood yes sir altrock said and grunted as he pulled the makeshift tourniquet tighter did wetake the position morrell asked each word a separate effort yes sir hoyland told him you take it easy now well get you out of here off to one side a couple of men were improvising a stretcher from two poles and a shelter half when they were done altrock and hoyland got morrell onto it lifting him like a sack of grain he remembered the stretcher coming off the ground but blacked out again after that he woke up out of the direct sun looking up at greengray cloth a hospital tent he thought dimly a man in a gauze mask bent over him with an ethersoaked rag wait morrell croaked if you go into close combat make sure youve got the last bullet the rag came down and with it blackness iii t he dakota slowed to a crawl to let the fuel ship vulcan come alongside sailors cursed and grunted as they wrestled with the hose from the vulcan and started pumping heavy fuel oil into the battleship seaman first class sam carsten looked on the refueling process with something less than approval he was swabbing the deck nearby and saw more work piling up for him every moment cant you lugs be careful he demanded bunch of filthy slobs is what you are sorry mother dearest one of the men on the refueling party said in a high scratchy falsetto his comrades laughed so did carsten who leaned on his mop to watch the work go on he laughed easily even at himself he was a big slowmoving blueeyed blond his skin ever more sunburned these days wish we were back in san francisco he said wistfully it was right nice theregood weather for a paleface like me another couple days of this and you can spread me with butter and marmalade because ill be a piece of toast its hot sure as hell the other sailor agreed black oil stains spotted his dungarees it aint near as hot as were gonna make it for the goddamn limeys though thats right another hosehandler agreed he eyed carsten youre gonna be toast are you maybe well use you for the sandwich islands then he snickered at his own wit pretty funny carsten said amiably he swabbed a few strokes to satisfy any watching petty officer then took it easy again hed been in the navy five years and was used to its rhythms and routines things had sped up on account of the war sure but not that much on a ship you had to do things by the numbers even in peacetime which wasnt so true in the army he paused to roll himself a cigarette lighted it with a match he scraped to life on the sole of his shoe and sucked in a breath of smoke before going on any luck at all well cornhole the limeys but good cornhole em hey one of the hose jockeys said i like that damned if i dont were sure comin up at em the wrong way yeah carsten plied the mop again if you looked busy people would figure you were if you didnt theyd find something for you to do probably something youd like less than what you were doing now as he worked he thought again about cornholing the royal navy the more he thought about it the better he liked it the us pacific fleet had put to sea days before war was declared sailing out of san francisco bay and los angeles and san diego the seattle squadron was still up there to face the british and canadian ships based in vancouver and victoria but the main fleet had swung west and south in a long loop around the western end of the sandwich island chain and now wish wed have beaten the british to annexing those damned islands said the sailor with the oilspotted dungarees then we could have sailed from there stead of the west coast and wed be steaming for singapore or maybe for the philippines carsten said the japs theyre england s good pals one of these days we kick them in the slats too he tried to think like admiral dewey if they could boot the british out of the sandwich islands they booted them all the way across the pacific to singapore and australia theyd have only the one chance though if things went wrong here british battleships would be steaming up and down the west coast of the united states for the rest of the war and thered be damn all anybody would be able to do about it sowe roll the dice he muttered if the pacific fleet took the sandwich islands away from england the usa would have an easier time resupplying them than the british did now theyd run around the chain so the limeys wouldnt spot them on the way in and now they were picking up fuel for the last run on pearl harbor one good surprise and the islands would be theirs one good surprise alarms began to ring battle stations battle stations came the cry aeroplane spotted not known whether hostile the fleet had launched a pair of aeroplanes a couple of hours before to scout out what lay ahead but were these american aeroplanes returning or british machines doing some scouting of their own if they were british the fleet had to knock them out of the sky before they could report back to the royal navy and to the landbased guns defending pearl harbor carstens battle station was at the starboard bow loading fiveinch shells into one of the guns of the dakotas secondary armament he threw his cigarette over the side as he ran to the sponson bringing it in would have been his own funeral except that the gunners mate a bruiser named hiram kidde would have taken care of that for him behind him the hose went back aboard the vulcan as if an elephant had owned a retractable trunk they had enough fuel on board for the attack and they could worry about everything else later you ready sam kidde asked carsten would have bet any money you cared to name that the gunners mate would have beaten him there no matter where he was on the ship when the call for battle stations rang out he sometimes thought kidde could just wish himself to the sponson from anywhere on board aye aye capn carsten answered with a salute more extravagant than he would have given dewey capn kidde chuckled hed had the inevitable nickname for as long as hed been in the navy the sponson was tiny and cramped with plenty of sharp metal corners to gouge your legs or your arms if you werent careful bare electric bulbs in wire cages on the ceiling shed a harsh yellow light the place stank of paint and brass and nitrocellulose and old sweat odors no amount of swabbing could ever wash away kidde patted the breech of the gun affectionately as if it were a trollops backside in some barbary coast dive in san francisco wish we had some highexplosive shells for this baby along with armor piercing shed make a hell of an antiaircraft gun wouldnt she damned if she wouldnt carsten said have to fuse em just right to burst around the aeroplane but damned if she wouldnt you ought to talk to somebody about that one mate you really should ahh its just stack gas kidde said with a shrug by then the other loader and the gun layer were in their places luke hoskins the numbertwo shell jerker was slower than he should have been kidde reamed him up one side and down the other with a tongue sharp enough to chip paint have a heart capn kidde hoskins said first decent shit ive had in three days and the goddamn battle stations sounds when i got my pants around my ankles in the aft head tough kidde said flatly next time dont waste time wipin your ass it wont matter what you smell likewe get into a real scrap and well all be shittin ourselves any which way carsten laughed till he incautiously jerked around and barked his shin on the edge of an ammunition rack he swore but kept on laughing part of that was good nature part of it nerves he didnt try to figure out which part was which a runner came by with word that the aeroplane spotted had been one of the ones theyd launched hes floatin on the water now an the new york its fishin him out of the drink with a crane he reported old man says to stay at battle stations though he hurried away the gun crew looked at one another if they were staying at battle stations that meant theyd be heading toward pearl harbor for the attack and sure enough the rumble of the big steam engines got louder as they picked up steam the vulcan and the rest of the support ships would be dropping behind nowthis was a job for the warships and the transports that carried a regiment of marines and a whole division of army men toward oahu another man stuck his head inside the blazinghot metal box where carsten and his comrades waited for orders voice cracking with excitement the sailor said word is the limeys aint done much with their fleet an a lot of its still in the harbor we caught em with their pants down you think its really true hoskins breathed why not sam carsten said battle stations got you that way didnt it the other seaman glared at him but he wasnt easy to get angry at if its so kidde said you can serve those englishmen up with tea and crumpets because theyre dinner they hit us a low blow back in granddads day comin in on the side of the rebels now we give it back sweet suffering jesus do we ever all those ships sittin inside pearl harbor waiting for us to smash em his smile was beatific carsten peered through one of the narrow vision slits the sponson afforded torpedoboat destroyers sprinted ahead of the battleships their creamy wakes vivid against the deep blue of the tropical pacific the dakota and her fellow capital ships were still picking up speed too the steel deck hummed and shuddered against his feet as the engines reached full power they had to be making better than twenty knots at that rate it wouldnt be long until there it is he exclaimed excitedly land on the horizon well give em whatfor any minute now well holy jesus what the rest of the gun crew the ones who werent looking out themselves all shouted the question together harbor defense guns just opened up on us they may not have known we were here but they sure as hell do now he didnt see the shell splash into the sea almost a minute later though the sound of the great cannon reached him a thunder that cut through not only the roar of the dakotas engines but also the hardened steel armor of the sponson and then bare seconds after that the battleships main armament cut loose the two fourteeninch guns in the forward superfiring turret and then the three from the a turret just below and ahead of it hed heard the noise from the distant british cannon the roar of the guns from his own ship enveloped him so that he felt it with his whole body more than with his ears when the guns went off the dakota seemed to buck for a moment before resuming its advance sailors crowded up to see what they could see the shore and the harbor wouldnt be in range of their secondary armament for some time to come it was like having a moving picture unreel right before your eyes carsten thought except this had soundall the sound in the world not some pianopounding accompanistand bright colors more thunderclaps came from the guns of the other battleships in the fleet the shore defenses sent up answering gouts of smoke and flame this time carsten spied the splashes from a couple of shells if you took a ford loaded it with explosives and dropped it into the sea from a great height youd get a plume of water like that some of the splashes were close enough to the destroyers for the upthrown seawater to drench the men aboard christ altogether involuntarily carsten turned away from his viewing slit one shell from the salvo hadnt landed by a destroyer but on it the ship might suddenly have rammed headlong into a brick wall in an instant it went from a yappy little terrier leading the fleet into action to a pile of floatingor rather rapidly sinkingwreckage a lot of good men there hiram kidde said as if carving an epitaph on a headstone so in a way he was the dakota began to zigzag violently at what seemed like random intervals armored against such shells it could take far more punishment than a thinskinned destroyer that didnt mean you wanted to be punished anything but capn kidde summed that up in one short phrase hate to be zigging when we should have zagged wish you hadnt said that hoskins told him the grin the gunners mate gave him in return looked like a deaths head sam carsten made himself look some more a few men in life jackets bobbed in the water near the stricken destroyer he hoped theyd get picked up before the sharks found them he raised his gaze to oahu ahead shells slammed down around the forts holding the coastdefense guns smoke and dust rose in great clouds but the guns kept pounding back in answer and more smoke rose from within the sheltered waters of pearl harbor smoke that did not spring from shells carsten said i think theyre gonna come out and fight theyre in a bad way kidde said relishing the prospect they cant just sit there and take it but if they come out were going to cross the t on em sure enough one of the dakotas zigs to port became a full turn so that she presented her whole tengun broadside to the emerging british warships which could reply only with their forwardfacing cannon hit everybody screamed at once as gouts of smoke spurted from a stricken british vessel and then again a moment later hit the ships of the royal navy were firing back across blue water orange flame and black smoke belched from the muzzles of their guns and their gunnery was good with a noise like a freight train roaring past when you were standing much too close to the tracks a salvo of three shells smashed into the ocean a couple of hundred yards short of the dakota the battleship heeled to port as the captain took evasive action wish i could see what was happening on the port beam carsten said have they bracketed us sam is that somethin you really want to know kidde asked him after a moment carsten shook his head if they put one salvo in front of you and one behind the next one came down right on top of you we in range for our piece yet capn hoskins asked not quite but were gettin there the gunners mate replied but then the dakota turned so the gun didnt bear on the enemy carsten pictured the turrets that housed the main armament swinging back into position to carry on the fight you fought your ship to bring them to bear on the most important targets the enemy had if a torpedo boat or destroyer made a run at you the fiveinchers like the one carsten manned were supposed to settle its hash they were good for giving shore batteries hell too batteries that werent main harbor defenses anyhow now though all carsten could do was stare out to sea and wait for his turn it bothered him less than hed thought it would out there were the transports with the soldiers and marines if they all landed safely the sandwich islands would fly the stars and stripes the odds looked good hell of a start he muttered the dandy up from charleston studied the painting with a curious and critical eye his pose was so languid and exquisite anne colleton thought that he should have been wearing knee breeches and frock coat and sneezing after a pinch of snuff not in a dinner jacket and smoking a fragrant habana his low country drawl only strengthened the impression of aristocratic effeteness upon my word miss colleton we surely have here an extraordinary series of contrasts do we not she brushed back a lock of pale gold hair that was tickling her cheek i can think of several she said starting with why are you here at marshlands while both my brothers have gone to serve their country but to say that out loud would have been impolite and however often she flouted the code of a confederate gentlewoman she still adhered to some of it and so not a hint of worry showed in her voice as she went on which ones cross your mind mr forbes alfred forbes pointed to the canvas he had been examining first and foremost hanging that sensestretching cubist portrait and all these other pieces from picasso and duchamp and gauguin and braque and the other moderns here in this hall strikes me as making contrast enough all by itself he examined the painting once more then grinned impishly are you sure its right side up quite sure anne replied with less frost in her voice than she would have liked duchamps nude descending a staircase had been upside down for a day before anyone noticed it hadnt been the fault of her negro servants either a curator whod accompanied the exhibition from paris had made the mistake they couldnt even ship him home in disgrace not with yankee and german warships prowling the atlantic she went on ill have you know marshlands was avantgarde in its day too no doubt no doubt forbes said now his smile was somewhere between speculative and predatory but even should i have been so ungallant as to doubt i could point out that yesterdays avantgarde is tomorrows he checked himself yes anne colleton said sweetly you were about to say tomorrows treasured tradition i was about to say he replied hed probably been about to say something like tomorrows crashing bore but hed managed to find something better his blue eyes were so wide and innocent anne smiled in spite of herself she said supposing that to be a contrastit was one that had amused her ever since shed arranged to bring the sampler of the best of modern painting from paris to the confederacywhat other odd juxtapositions do you find that you chose to hold the show here among others alfred forbes answered worthy though st matthews is it hardly ranks with richmond or charleston or new orleans or even columbiathat a low country mans dig at the decidedly up country capital of south carolinaas a center of cultural advancement it does now anne said these works would never have been seen in the confederate states if i hadnt made the effort and spent the money she thought although saying that would have been vulgarto bring them here this is my home sir where would you have me exhibit them the new york armory perhaps forbes laughed out loud showing off even white teeth not likely the next progressive yankee i know of will be the first when the usa ships in art from abroad its fat german singers in brass unmentionables bellowing about the rhine while the orchestra does its level best to drown them out presumably not in the said river anne smiled again they deserve each other the yankees and the germans the smile slipped but we dont deserve either of them and we have the yankees on our border and the germans helping to harry the coast which brings me to yet another contrast forbes said how long the exhibition was supposed to stay on these shores and how long it may actually be here wouldnt want these paintings sunk no though a yankee ship captain would likely boast of having rid the world of them anne colleton dismissed the usa with that sentence and a curl of her lip but the usa was not so easily dismissed a pity the royal navy took such a beating in the sandwich islands last week a date which will live in infamy for the british fleet forbes agreed sadly the butler approached with a silver tray he wore white tie but as if his dark brown skin were not enough to mark his status his vest had stripes and the buttons on his cutaway were shiny brass just as they would have been in london something to drink madam sir he asked his voice the bass pipe of an organ thank you scipio anne said and took a crystal champagne flute forbes took one too scipio headed into the drawing room to serve some of the other art aficionados hes well spoken forbes remarked cant say that for most of the niggers hereaboutsi can scarcely fathom their jargon we had him specially trained in elocution anne said a butler after all reflects the standards of the house very true alfred forbes raised his glass and heres to culture on the congaree let new york keep the rancid rhine the wave of the future is here anne drank to that quite happily forbes hung around and tried to draw her out tried to make her interested in his admittedly handsome wellgroomed person she could all but read his thoughts a woman who is a patroness of cubist art is surely a woman with other modern ideas and a woman with modern ideas is surely a loose woman she pretended not to notice his hints when he stepped forward to try to set his hand on her arm she moved to one side not in any offensive way for he had not been offensive but not permitting the contact either after a while he gave up and went off to look at other paintings a couple in their fifties came up to scrutinize the picasso isnt it exciting the woman said you can see her back and her er bosom both together there its a whole new way of looking at the world maybe it takes special eyesight the man replied with a dubious chuckle the left sleeve of his jacket hung limp anne wondered whether hed lost the arm during the second mexican war or less romantically in a railroading accident oh joseph you are such a philistine his wifethe wedding band sparkled on her ring fingersaid in mock despair they both laughed comfortable as old shoes together and with a nod to anne went on to the next painting the salt of the earth she thought with mingled admiration and scorn joseph and his wife obviously would never do anything scandalous but theyd never do anything interesting either life should be interesting she thought if its not what point to living it she felt like eleanor of aquitaine free beyond the common limits of the world in which she lived royal birth had given eleanor that freedom modern times were simpler money did the job for anne colleton the useless swamp along the congaree aside most of the land between st matthews and columbia was colleton cotton country she tapped a finger against the gleaming mahogany banister brains hadnt hurt eleanor of aquitaine and they didnt hurt her either shed doubled profits from the land in the five years since her father died and they hadnt been low before after a couple of protests more for forms sake than because they really wanted the job her brothers had let her run the plantation as suited her why not she let them have allowance enough to get into all the mischief they liked and they liked quite a lot shed grown used to patronizing tom and jacob in her mind what they were getting into these days was worse than mischief the casualty lists in the newspapers were hideously long and the battles not going so well as everyone had been sure they would too many damnyankees she thought bitterly and who would remember the marshlands exhibition of modern art now except as the show that was going on when war raced around the world she knew to the penny what the show had cost to set up and publicize shed made that backshe couldnt remember the last investment where shed failed to turn a profitand the artists had sold a good many works but much of the fame that should have come to both the marshlands mansion and to herself was gone forever now lost in the cannons roar one more reason to hate the united states but even if not quite so notorious as shed hoped in this modern age what difference between notoriety and fame she was still free and still reveling in that freedom as she sometimes had before she wondered how best to enjoy it work for the vote for women that thought had crossed her mind before too as she had when it last did she shook her head for one thing advocates of suffrage were earnest to the point of boredom and she did not want to be bored life was too short for that the cause while worthy reeked of bourgeois respectability and for another south carolina had only recently come to grant the vote to all white men and its districts were so arranged that half of those white men or more might as well not have had it making headway against such resolute conservatism struck her as a long slow job what then she didnt know she had time to find something she was only twentyeight with the whole world stretched out before her that thought had hardly passed her mind when some sort of commotion broke out at the front of the mansion she hurried forward to see what was going on looking out the window she spied a new automobile near the mansion a dusty manassas probably hired in st matthews but getting out of it was she threw open the door and hurried forward stopping to curtsy as her grandmother might have done before the war of secession mr president she exclaimed i had no idea you would honor me with a visit here part of that was why didnt you telegraph ahead dammit but another part a gloating part said now people will remember this exhibition by god woodrow wilson tipped his hat to her this is entirely impromptu miss colleton im due in charleston tomorrow to christen a new submersible as she goes off the shipway there when i remembered your showing was on the way down from richmond or at least not too far out of the way i decided to stop and see the paintings that have the world so intrigued his smile soured frankly this is more congenial to me than blessing another instrument of war you are very welcome anne told him i am glad to hear you say it wilson replied your support for the whig party has been generous and i certainly hope it may continue i dont think you need to worry on that score anne said with a slow thoughtful nod she wondered just how impromptu the presidents visit really was maybe wilson himself didnt know politicians in her experience inevitably and inextricably mixed politics with every other facet of their lives and her support for the whigs had always been anything but ungenerous she went on please come in your excellency dont stand there in the sun if you had a heatstroke theyd probably shoot me for treason wilson smiled back from everything shed heard hed never been averse to smiling at a pretty woman anne knew her own good looks were about as useful to her as her money fanning himself with his straw hat wilson said im delighted to accept that invitation your climate here makes richmond feel temperate by comparison something many people would reckon impossible servantsall save scipio who remained gravely impassivegaped as the president of the confederate states came into the marshlands mansion anne colleton on his arm he let her guide him through the exhibition he also let her shield him from people who might have pestered him this time she smiled inside where it didnt show wilson knew who was important and who wasntand she was after gravely studying several of the paintings the president turned to her and said this is why we fight you know to me it is even more important than ties of blood and sentiment nothing so so progressive as these works could possibly come into being in the united states or the german empire we truly are preserving civilization not just preserving it anne said helping it grow of course he accepted the correction with good grace accepted it and took it as his own but then the creases in his long thin face got deeper the price though the price is dreadfully high you have a brother in the service dont you two brothers she answered proudly the worry she couldnt help feeling she kept to herself i hope i pray they will come through safely wilson said i do the same for every man in the army and navy too oftenfar too often already my prayers have gone unanswered before anne could decide how to answer that scipio came back with his silver tray would you like a glass of champagne your excellency she asked the president thank you wilson said and took one so did anne he lifted his crystal flute to her to civilization to victory and to the safe return of your brothers ill gladly drink to that anne said and did she turned to scipio you may go yes madam he bowed and went on his way back straight wide shoulders braced almost as if he were on parade a finelooking fellow wilson remarked wellmannered too yes im lucky to have him here anne watched scipio go he did make an impressive servant no two ways about it as butler scipio was of course a house servant with quarters within marsh lands for himself but not least because hed been chief cook before becoming butler he kept up a closer relation with the outside negroes than most servants of similar station would have done he knew how much the larder depended on their ingenuity and goodwill if they said hunting and fishing werent going well how could he prove they were lying but the outside food bill would go up and hed catch the devil for that from the mistress lightning bugs flashed on and off as he made his way out to the rows of negro cottages behind marshlands he had every right to make the trip but glanced back over his shoulder anyhow it wasnt the mistress he thought was staring at him it was marshlands itself the threestory georgian mansion had been sitting here for more than a hundred years and seemed to have a life of its own an awareness of what went on inside and around it the mistress would have called that superstitious nonsense scipio didnt care what she called it he knew what he knew perhaps today he also still felt the presence of woodrow wilson though the president had gone back to st matthews to reboard his train and continue on down to charleston his mistress associated with any number of prominent peoplewhich meant he did too not that they paid him much attention he was after all only a negro a groom coming out of the barn stared at him through deepening twilight evenin he said nodding almos didnt recnize yougettin dark earlier nowadays i is still me scipio answered wherever white folks could hear him he talked like an educated white man that was what the mistress wanted and what she wanted she got among his own people he spoke as he had since the day he first began forming words he hadnt made a mistake switching back and forth between his two dialects in more than ten years candles and kerosene lamps lighted the negro cottages marshlands had had electric lights for a long time now the mistress had plenty of money for paintings but for wires for the help scipio shook his head if he held his breath waiting hed be blue under his black some of the little brick cottages were already dark if you worked in the fields sunup to sundown you needed all the rest you could get sundown to sunup but you needed a little time to live too from out of open windows and doors flung wide against the muggy heat came snatches of song cries of joy or dismay as dice went one way or the other and the racket of children more children made more racket outside running after one another and pretending to be soldiers none of them ever admitted hed been killed scipio shook his head again too bad the real war didnt work out that way here and there a mother or a father taught children to read mostly from books and magazines and newspapers the white folks had thrown away scipio whod been in his teens when manumission came remembered the days when teaching a negro to read had been against the law hed managed to pick up the knowledge anyway as had a good many of his friendstoo many things were being printed to keep them all out of negroes hands black literacy was legal now but south carolina still had no school for negroes scipio walked past jonahs cottage and was surprised to find no light burning in there jonah and his woman letitia were always ones for singing and playing and dancing and carrying on when he got to cassius cabin though the door was open and light streamed out into the night is you in there he called good manners by the standards of the field hands the mistress standards were something else again scipio moved between two sets of etiquette as readily as he did between dialects if he ever thought about how he did what he did he probably wouldnt be able to do it any more no aint nobody to home here cassius answered that drew raucous laughter from whoever else wasnt in there with him snorting scipio went inside if you took cassius seriously you were in trouble hed pull your leg till it came off in his hands then walk off and leave you to hop home without it but he was also the best hunter on the plantation and that had been so for a long time if you wanted something special for the larder as scipio did tonight he was the man to talk to even if you had to take your chances on everything else now cassius threw a hand up before his eyes lord kip you gwine blind we the light shinin off them brass buttons that way again his crew of rascals and easy women laughed with him the only thing that surprised scipio about the inside of the cottage was that he didnt see any quart whiskey bottles on the mantel or sitting atop one of the rickety tablesor clamped in somebodys fist cassius and the rest of the male field hands wore unbleached cotton shirts and trousers with no shape to them nothing like scipios fancy suit of clothesthough better suited to this breathless heat a couple of them had bright bandannas on their heads or wrapped around their necks to give themselves a spot of color the women by contrast were in eyesearing calicoes and plaids and paisleys with no shade of red too hot no green too vibrant you done been talking wid de president cassius said you don reckon you too good to talk wid de likes of we now i talks wid de president scipio agreed with a weary sigh de president he dont talk wid me you hear what i say cassius nodded that was how things worked for blacks in a white mans world sowhat kin i do fo you this day kip he asked you come here you always want somethin it could have been an accusation but it came out like a goodnatured joke which relieved scipio for it happened to be true in spite of that invitation coming straight out with what you wanted was rude where jonah scipio asked i see he cabin dark an he usually carry on damn near much as you do jonah cassius shook his head he aint here no more not he he leff this afternoon gone fo good i reckon he leff what you mean cass he leff that nigger pick cotton here since he big enough to do it an letty too not no mo cassius said he say he light out fo columbia he work in one o them factories makin shells and things scipio stared they don let no niggers work in they factories those is jobs fo white folks nobody else whole powerful lot o white folks is gone to be sojers cassius pointed out but they still got to have they shells to shoot o the damnyankees kick they butts nigger kin do the job nigger gonna get the job they don pay he like he was white folks so the factory bosses they happy an jonah he happy too cause they do pay moren he make here an letty she gwine try an fin work at one of they textile plants takin care o the cotton after it picked stead o befo mought do that my own self said one of cassius friends a big man called island for no reason scipio had ever been able to learn mo money fo less work sound right good mo money yeah cassius said less work he snorted when you ever know white folks give mo money cep fo mo work an heaps o times not then neither island thought about that then nodded but he said hard to think o anything bein mo workn growin cotton scipio who knew how lucky he was to have escaped the fields also nodded plenty of field hands would think the same way he was sure of that jonah and letitia wouldnt be the only ones to head off the plantation for the factory he was sure of that too and how would the mistress like it not much he figured could she do anything about it he wasnt sure about that she was a power but not the only one in the state not by a long shot marshlands though wasnt the state here for those who remained here her word was still law scipio said mistress want a couple gobblers for she dinner party tomorrow night kin you get em cass reckon i kin the hunter answered his eyes cool and confident flicked to the shotgun above the mantel yeah reckon i kin scipios eyes also went to the gun and the mantel on the length of pine wood sat a pamphlet or little book upside down and open what this scipio asked and reached for it expecting to find a religious tract and sure enough the bright blue paper cover said dr gilrays collection of christian hymns printed in richmond csa in the year of our lord idly he picked it up wondering what hymn cassius whod never struck him as pious was learning at that same moment island slammed the door to the cottage shut scipio hardly noticed he was staring down at the page to which the pamphlet had been opened the printing was as bad and smudgy as hed expected the words were anything but what hed expected of all the classes that stand face to face with the bourgeoisie today the proletariat alone is a really revolutionary class the other classes decay and finally disappear in the he noticed how quiet it had grown inside the cottage he looked up from the page and saw cassius and island and the rest of the people whod been in there with him and how they were all staring at him he didnt like what he saw in their eyes those intent looks frightened him even more than the book he held in his hands and that wasnt easy do jesus he said softly the mistress find out you got this she not gwine whip you she gwine hang you aint gonna bother with no law aint gonna bother with no cout niggers what spread revolutionary propagandahe brought out those two words in his educated voice as hed never imagined saying them in the dialect hed been born speakingthey gots to die we knows cassius said just as softly so they kills we fast stead of slow so what white folks they in this big war they aint got time to pay no attention to we we who is doin they work fo they one fine day they aint spectin it nohow the revolution come it a whole new world then come the revolution one of the women cherry her name wassaid with a longing croon in her voice the way a lot of women sounded in the clapboard baptist church of a sunday morning praying for jesus second coming come the revolution this here gwine be a different country it sho will something glittered in island s hand a knife scipio watched it with horrified fascination he gathered himself to fight knowing how bad his chances were island glanced over at cassius we got to shut he up he a house nigger tell everything he know to the mistress somehow perhaps by magic cassius had produced a knife too al most meditatively he said kip here he have the chance to do me wrong plenty times he never do it oncet not even he even take the blame hisself when huntin go bad maybe he keep a secret here too kip what you think o that book you holdin i think niggers rise up against white folks we get licked scipio answered truthfully i think i wish i wasnt so curious how long had karl marx been here at marshlands the mistress didnt have the first notion red revolution was simmering under her nose scipio hadnt the first notion either what was that white poets line ignorance is bliss that was it that white folks had known what he was talking about cassius said mos times sho we get licked aint so many guns away from the border now aint so many white folks to tote em neither we rise up they gonna use they army gainst we damnyankees tromp they into the mud they try that he wasnt arguing hed already made up his mind and might have been a preacher talking about the gospel his gaze sharpened now tell me true kip you gwine say about this to the mistress not a word scipio declared he thought about adding some strong oath to that but in the end held his tongue it was likelier to make cassius and the others think he was lying than to make them believe him i still say we stick he island said but cassius shook his head i don think he talk he pay if he do on account of we aint the onliest ones here an he don know who all we is an mistress she don know bout she don care bout no revolution all she care about them crazy paintings look like splosion in a shingle factory she don sniff roun way some masters do she start changin she mind bout that kip he tell us aint that so kip that so scipio agreed through dry lips too much had happened too fast today having president wilson come to marshlands was a surprise knowing karl marx had come to marshlands was a shock finding out marx had come to marshlands had almost proved deadly but he would live his legs swayed under him in reaction and relief then he realized how he would be living from here on out playing both ends against the middle didnt begin to describe it a phrase a preacher had used a few weeks before fit better caught between the devil and the deep blue sea that was how he felt all right corporal chester martin paused behind an oak to spy out the ground ahead somewhere not far ahead was the confederate strongpoint his squad had been sent out to find in this miserable country they were liable to find it by blundering onto it in which case none of them would be able to bring the news back to the artillery so the boys with the red piping on their hats could give it a good walloping i think god had his mind on something else when he was making this part of virginia he muttered under his breath one of his privates sprawled beneath a bush close enough to let him hear that mutter roger hodges chuckled almost inaudibly you ought to know bettern that he answered in an upcountry twang that said hed been born not far away god aint had nothin to do with it this here part of the world is the devils business and no mistake wont get any arguments from me martin answered nothin but upanddown mountains and trees and brush and little creeks that dont go anywhere the couplethree farms we found they look like theyre right out of daniel boone and the people talk even funnier than you do roger hell of a place to try and fight a war thats all i got to say captain said do it so we do it hodges sighed with a chuckle chester slapped him on the back youve got the right attitude thats for damn sure he wasnt supposed to let a soldier know he liked him that was bad for discipline but he had a hard time hiding it when he was around roger hodges the west virginian took to the business of war the way a duck took to water he was always ready always resourceful and groused as if hed been in the army for thirty years when he complained it was about things that mattered not the little stuff that couldnt be helped or didnt count anyhow smiling still martin grunted and slid forward another few feet toward the top of catawba mountain he wasnt a mountain man himselfhed been working in a steel mill in toledo when his regiment was mobilizedbut even these early days of the war had impressed on him the need to be careful with every move you made the confederates didnt have anywhere near the numbers of the us force that had entered enemy territory from west virginia but the men they did have in the alleghenies might all have been born there by the way they used the rough country to bushwhack one unit after another then fell back to the next high ground and did it all over again this heres the last piece of high ground they got to play with for a while though he muttered to himself wiping his face with a sleeve he wasnt altogether sorry so much of the fighting had been under the trees he had the pale freckled skin that went with green eyes and sandy hair and sunburned easy as you please his wasnt the only squad looking for rebel positions on catawba mountain when the us forces found those positions they found them all at once a rifle shot or two rang out and then the deadly hammering of machine guns martin threw himself flat as bullets stitched through the trees clipping leaves and twigs and men the smell of mud and mold was thick in his nostrils better that he thought than the latrine stink of somebody with a belly wound hed been watching friends die ever since the army crossed the border he didnt want to do it again he didnt want anybody watching him die either he didnt want that at all see any of the bastards he called to hodges nope the west virginian answered martin smacked a fist into the ground in frustration hodges lived in country like this if he couldnt tell what was going on how was a city boy supposed to manage hodges went on reckon they dug themselves holes to hide in make it harder for weuns to find em youre probably right martin said scowling they probably had niggers up here too diggin those holes for em probably took em out of the iron mines around big lick brought em to work while we were fighting our way up this far then took em back down again i expect thats how it went all right hodges agreed they dont give niggers guns but theyre worth almost as much as soldiers way they free up white men to fight messengers from the squad that had first developed the confederate position must have got back to the artillery because shells began whistling down on the enemy line some of them fell short one burst only a dozen yards or so from martin showering him with clods of dirt and sending shrapnel balls whistling malignantly above his head sons of bitches hodges shouted through the din theyre more dangerous to us than they are to the damned rebels the barrage went on for half an hour more shells fell short not far away somebody screamed like a lost soul you got hurt just as bad if your own side nailed you as you did from an enemy shell when the bombardment abruptly ended whistles blew up and down the american line piping like insistent sparrows martin scrambled to his feet ignoring the pack that weighed him down like a mule come on you lugs he shouted to his men lets go get em fear made his feet light as he rushed toward the confederate line that hadnt been a very long pounding and the little mountain howitzers that were the only guns able to move up through this godawful country hardly threw any kind of shell at all plenty of rebels would be left to draw beads on the oncoming men in greengray maybe one of them was drawing a bead on his brisket right now roger hodges light on his feet as a gandy dancer sped past martin then he tripped and staggered and started to fall but was arrested by something just above waist high wire he wailed in despair that was the last thing he ever said as he hung there writhing trying to twist free of the iron barbs that snagged him two bullets smacked home in quick succession they sounded like fists he still hung after that but no longer writhed martin cautiously approached the area where his squadmate had found the wire the hard way the confederates hadnt made a real belt of it just two or three strands to slow up their attackers that had been all they needed to pot poor roger hodges if you knew the wire was there a few snips with a cutter and you were through it martin ran on now he could see the rebels firing pits and the flames that spurted from the muzzles of their rifles whenever they pulled trigger all those flashes seemed aimed right at him the confederates were much more readily visible than his own comrades who took advantage of every bit of cover they could find for the last few yards there was no cover yelling like fiends us troopers were crossing those yards and routing out the confederates with rifle fire and with bayonet chester martin yelled too it helped not much but a little he sprinted toward the nearest hole he saw he was almost there when a big fellow in butternut popped up in it and started to bring his rifle to his shoulder martin shot from the hip drill sergeants said you never hit anything that way he proved them right because he missed but he didnt miss by much and he did rattle the rebel enough to make him miss too the man never got a chance for a second shot martins bayonet punched into his throat while he was still working the bolt to his rifle blood sprayed into martins face the confederate made a horrible gobbling noise and clutched both hands to his neck he swayed tottered and fell in dozens of little fights like that one the us soldiers cleared the rebels from their line the confederate machine guns fell silent the men who fought under the stars and bars were brave enough and to spare most of them died rather than retreating a few plunged back into the trees and made for their next line up closer to the crest of catawba mountain martin looked around for his squad trying to keep some order as the americans advanced roger hodges he didnt need to worry about he already knew that he was jolted though to find he had only five men with him another soldier was dead besides hodges he heard and three more wounded as they formed up one of his privates a tall blond kid named andersen said if we lose half our guys every time we attack how long till nobodys left any more hed probably meant it for a joke the kind of graveyard humor that came naturally in the middle of a battle but chester martin had the sort of mind that figured things out lose half the squad in the next attack and youd have three left do it again and youd have one and a halfsay two if you were lucky do it one more time after that and youd be down to your last guy no law said that guy had to be corporal martin either by the looks on the soldiers faces they were working through the same calculation and not liking what they came up with any more than he did he paused to roll himself a cigarette and then after hed lighted it to go through the pockets and pack of the rebel hed killed for whatever tobacco he had on him the little cloth sack in which the fellow had carried his fixings had blood on it but there was nothing wrong with the fine virginia weed inside martin stuck it in his own pocket handling the enemys corpse gave him the answer or part of it he pointed to the body and then to all the other sprawled corpses in the defense line the american troops had stormed cost us a good bit to get here yeah he said but it cost them plenty too trying to hold us back and we did what we were supposed to and the rebels didnt besideshe pointed back the way hed comeweve got replacements moving up behind us to help on the next push wont be us right on the shit end of the stick all the damn time that seemed to satisfy his men and sure enough reinforcements were coming up soldiers whose greengray uniforms were less draggled than his own and who stared mouths and eyes open wide at bodies and pieces of bodies lying on bloodsoaked grass and dirt the sight of a few glum confederate prisoners some of them wounded being hustled off to the rear did not seem an adequately glorious compensation come on you birds martin called the secondline soldiers sergeants looked to be as stunned as any of the men they were supposed to be leading this is what it looks like this is what they pay us for aint you glad you was drafted thats telling them corporal said captain orville wyatt the company commander martin hadnt seen him since the attack started glad youre okay sir he said now that you mention it so am i wyatt said offhandedly he was about thirtyfive with a little thin mustache instead of the more common kaiser bill it suited his long thin pale face better than a kaiser bill would have martin had to admit as much he didnt know how the devil the captain would get through the war with a pair of steelframed spectacles riding his nose but that was wyatts problem not his the company commander knew his business which was what counted most some of the rebs whod run off into the woods hadnt run all the way back to their next line after all instead they started sniping at the us troops whod taken away their firing pits and trenches a couple of groups of cursing americans turned the captured machine guns around and fired long bursts at the trees upslope that reduced the enemy fire but didnt stop it somewhere probably on the reverse slope of the mountain the confederates had a battery of their quickfiring threeinch howitzers martin had already come under fire from them and didnt like them worth a damn now shells started landing in and around the captured line not a lot of shells and not very accurately delivered but not the sort of greeting he wanted either as with fire from your own guns you were just as dead from a lucky hit as you were if somebody drew a bead on you and drilled you through the chest captain wyatt as if annoyed at untimely rain remarked were not going back and i dont much fancy staying here only thing left to do is advance martin tossed the tiny butt of his cigarette into the dirt and ground it out with his heel you heard the man he told his squador what was left of it into the woods we go off to grandmothers house keep your eyes open and watch where you set your feet we already know theres wolves in there his men chuckled if you laughed you could let on that you werent scared your buddies would believe it or make like they did if you got lucky you might even believe it yourself theyd gone a couple of hundred yards farther up the mountain trading shots with confederates they couldnt see and who god willing had trouble seeing them too when they came to a clearing an oval meadow maybe two hundred yards wide and a hundred across it would have been the most inviting place in the world except for the machine gun hammering away from the far side of it cant just charge that martin said almost as if someone had asked him to do it wed have dead piled up higher out there than they did at camp hill his grandfather had been wounded in that fight hed worn a peg leg ever afterwards and counted himself lucky to come out alive well have to flank it out captain wyatt agreed and the corporal let out a silent sigh of relief in spite of knowing what he was doing wyatt was a west point man and sometimes they got funny ideas about being dutybound to die for their country chester martin was more in favor of living for his country captain wyatt sent him and his squad around to the left of the clearing and another one off to the right martin and his men never made it to the machine gun a couple of rebels in the woods held them up and wounded one of them before they finally got flushed out and killed private andersen didnt say anything but his gloomy features had i told you so written all over them a fusillade of rifle fire put an end to the machine guns deadly chatter wonder what that cost andersen said glumly ahh shut up paul martin told him if you arent demoralizing the rest of the guys youre sure as hell demoralizing me they swarmed on up toward the top of catawba mountain the forest was full of men in greengray now with just enough rebels in butternut lurking and shooting from concealment to make everybody jumpy and triggerhappy and to make sure that every so often a us soldier got shot by his own buddies instead of the confederates martin would have sworn that a couple of near misses came from behind him not ahead but what could you do except hope you didnt draw the short straw this time he and his men found the confederate barbed wire before it found them cutters clicked the wire went twangg as the tension on it was released as before the rebs had run up only a couple of strands not enough to impede troops who were alert for itand a lot of men who hadnt been alert before were dead now martin crawled and snaked forward till he could see the earth the confederatesor rather their negro laborers had thrown up in front of their firing pits more and more us soldiers joined him in the bushes blazing away at the southerners in the firing pits whistles sounded up and down the line screaming like fiends martin and his comrades sprang to their feet and rushed the confederate position as before the fight was sharp but short the us forces had brought enough men forward that the advantage fighting from cover gave their foes wasnt enough to check them come on captain wyatt shouted even before the last rebels in the line had been slain were almost at the top of the mountain still yelling their blood up the soldiers followed him and other officers on past the wrecked confederate line and sure enough another couple of hundred yards took them to the crest martin looked east toward the roanoke river toward the iron town of big lick on this side of it toward the smokes rising from it and from the mines close by toward the other stream of smoke from the train chugging out of the station big lick was a major railroad junction once the us army fought its way down the mountain and to the river it would badly hurt the confederacy here a shot rang out seemingly from nowhere not twenty feet from martin a private clutched at his throat and fell theyve got snipers in the trees the sneaky bastards somebody shouted well get em out martin said grimly only a few miles separated him from big lick he wondered how long it would take to get there lucien galtier clucked to his horse and flicked the reins the horse snorted reproachfully twitching its ears in annoyance i mean it you old fraud galtier told it in his quebecois french do you want me to get out the whip and show you i mean it the horse snorted again and got the wagon moving a little faster galtier chuckled under his breath he and the horse had been playing this game for the past ten years he hadnt used the whip since summer before last he didnt expect to need it for another year or two more they understood each other the horse and he drizzle slid down out of a leaden sky he pulled his hat lower over his facedark heavy eyebrows swarthy skin deepset brown eyes a goodly nose above a mouth that was almost a rosebud dimpled chin in need of shaving and wished hed put on oilskins like the sailors wore his shrug might have come from paris not even a farmer could guess right about the weather all the time not even a saint can do that he thought he couldnt see far through the rain he didnt need to see far though he knew where he wasa couple of miles outside riviereduloup on the st lawrence river the countryside was the same here as everywhere else in the neighborhoodfarmland with wooden houses painted white with the beams of the redpainted roofs projecting forward to create a veranda because of the drizzle he couldnt see the tin spires of the churches in stmodeste and stantonin but he knew they were there to look at things all was as it might have been years before and then as he drew nearer to riviereduloup things changed the land grew pocked with shells and the neat farmhouses and outbuildings were neat no more but many of them charred ruins the canadians and british had made a stand trying to keep the damned americans from reaching the st lawrence theyd failed it is a terrible thing war galtier told his horse he and his ancestors hadnt seen the thing close up in a century and a half not since the days when the british took quebec away from france it was here now though his nostrils twitched even through the rain he could smell the sickly sweet odor of dead horsesand maybe dead men too his horse also knew the odor for what it was and made a nervous snuffling noise go on lucien told it go on my old it cannot be helped and must be endured how many times had his father said that to him and his brothers and sisters how many times had he said it to his two sons and four daughters boom with a snort of fright the horse stopped dead galtier wondered if hed have to use the whip after all boom boom having reached the st lawrence the americans had put a battery of field guns with their wheels right on the edge of the bank now they were shooting at merchant ships on their way down to montreal ships whose captains hadnt got the word that the southern bank was in enemy hands boom boom just when lucien was reaching for the whip the horse let out a humansounding sigh and went on before long the church spires of riviereduloup loomed out of the mist ahead the town which sat on a spur of rock that projected out into the st lawrence was bigger than stmodeste and stantonin put together big enough to boast several churches not just one when father pascal had had perhaps a glass of wine too many he talked about riviereduloups being a bishopric one day like everyone else lucien listened and smiled and nodded and didnt hold his breath boom boom now the sound of the artillery mingled with the plashing roar of the waterfall that plunged off the rock of riviereduloup and down ninety feet into the great river below boom like every other man his age galtier had done his time in the army hed been an infantryman like most conscripts but he knew a little something about artillery he wondered how the devil the fool of an american could find a target let alone hit it in this wretched weather houses grew closer together as he came into town artillery had wrecked some of them once a whole block was nothing but burntout wreckage the stench of death lingered here too some of the telegraph poles that had connected riviereduloup to the outside world were down some leaning drunkenly some standing but with the wires tangled at their bases posters now turning soggy in the drizzle had been nailed or pasted to a lot of the telegraph poles free at last from british tyranny some of them said in french and showed quebec s fleurdelis banner side by side with the stars and stripes i for one did not feel myself tyrannized lucien galtier saidsoftly for he was not alone on the road now he leaned forward and asked his horse did you feel yourself tyrannized the horse did not answer which he took for agreement the poles that did not have the free at last poster mostly bore another this one printed in red and in both french and english curfew pm to am violators will be shot on sight ah this is what freedom means galtier murmured i am so glad the americans educate us in it a newsboy stood on a corner with a box of papers covered by a paintsmeared chunk of canvas tarpaulin read cesoir he called to lucien hear of the great victories of the americans over the confederates and of germany over russia and the english no thank you galtier answered and rode on toward the market cesoir had experienced a remarkable change in content since the americans came to riviereduloup before then it had trumpeted of confederate russian and french triumphs against the usa austria and germany it all depends on how you look at things galtier thought to hear the newspaper talk now you would never know that germany had invaded france or that the englishmen there were defending their ally from the boches that wasnt bad propaganda but it would have been better had the townsfolk not enjoyed the memories god gave to normal intelligent human beings free at last another poster shouted several american soldiers bayonets fixed on their springfields stood on a street corner keeping an eye on people they were almost invisible in the mist till lucien got right up close to them their greengray was even better than khaki at blending into the background here but lucien had known they were there long before he saw them the harsh sounds of english filled his ears hed learned some of the language in the army but not used it much since some fishermen who came into town from the maritimes spoke it but he had little to do with them beyond passing the time of day in a tavern now like the americans it had invaded riviereduloup and they spoke of freeing the area from british tyranny englishspeaking canadians for the most part had had the courtesy to stay away the hens in the back of the wagon clucked that drew the american soldiers eyes to lucien galtier hey buddy one of them called you want to sell me one of them birds hell with that pete another soldier said just take onetake a couple from the damn frenchy and if he dont like it give him some caliber persuading the fellow laughed showing bad teeth galtier licked his lips if they wanted to rob him they could what would he do afterwards complain to their officer he did not think he would get far he hadnt heard that the americans were looting had he heard that he would have stayed on his farm instead of venturing into town but the soldier whod spoken firstpeteshook his head cant get away with that kind of stuff here in town too many people watching wed wind up in dutch and i got some money in my pocket he turned to lucien how much for a chicken hey combien that hed tried a word of french made galtier dislike him a little less he answered with a high price as he would have in the marketplace haggling with a housewife fifty cent monsieur he knew how rusty his english was and hoped the american soldier would understand to his amazement the american instead of offering half that or less reached into his pocket pulled out a silver coin and tossed it to him it was a halfdollar a us halfdollar of course with president reeds plump profile on one side and the american eagle in front of crossed swords on the other but fifty cents was fifty cents canada the usa and the csa all coined to the same standard carefully keeping his face blank galtier stuck the coin in his own trouser pocket and pulled a chicken out of the latticework traveling coop for pete obliged the soldier said holding the chicken by the feet with its head down toward the ground hed come off the farm then odds were here lemme buy one too said the soldier whod proposed robbing lucien he sold five birds in the space of a couple of minutes at half a dollar apiece he was delighted so were the soldiers one of them said pal if youd been eating hardtack and canned beast ever since the damn war started youd know how much we crave real grub for a change was he supposed to sympathize with them if they hadnt come over the border into his country they could have been eating whatever they pleased back in new york his only answer though was a shrug he had his wife to think of and his children he could not take chances not when he was one farmer with nothing more dangerous than a folding knife in his pocket and they soldiers with rifles and bayonets he reminded himself of that a couple of times when it became clear none of the rest of them wanted more chickens he went on to the town market square where he did not get nearly the price the americans had given him for the birds another us soldier walked by but he was not interested in poultry he had his arm around the waist of one of the girls who served drinks at the loupdunord the best tavern in town angelique her name was the respectable wives of riviereduloup saw that too and clucked like the chickens lucien was trying to sell and here came father pascal almost as close to a heavyset american ma jor galtier knew what the gold oak leaves on the officers shoulder boards meant as angelique was to her soldier the major was speaking french clear parisian french which stood out almost as much as english did from the quebecois dialect englishspeaking canadian soldiers said quebecois french sounded like ducks making love a claim always good for starting a fight when you were bored galtier couldnt make out much of what the major was saying whatever it was father pascal was listening hard that worried the farmer a little father pascal was a good man but ambitious witness his desire for riviereduloups becoming a bishopric if the americans fed his ambitions he was liable to go further with them than he should well one lucien galtier couldnt do much about that having sold his chickens and made more for them than hed expected thanks to americans too stupid to bargain he got into his wagon and started for home boom boom boom the american field guns south of town which had fallen silent opened up on another ship out in the st lawrence galtier looked back over his shoulder yes there was a dim shape moving on the river and then to his surprised delight that dim shape answered with booms of its own booms attenuated by traveling over some miles of water but plainly of much larger caliber than the threeinch popguns that had fired at them explosions followed almost instantly thereafter in the place from which the field guns had been firing some of the housewives jumped up and crossed themselves galtier waited to hear if the field guns could reply to what had to be at least a cruiser out there they remained silent he drove home a contented man iv p aul mantarakis wished he had a chaplain of his own faith with whom he could pray hed heard there were a few orthodox priests in uniform but hed never seen one protestant ministers yes catholic priests yes rabbis even yes but none of his own he fingered his amber worry beads and murmured kyrie eleison christe eleison lord have mercy christ have mercy leave off your latin and your rosary declared gordon mcsweeney a dour scotsman in his platoon they are the road to hell its not latin mantarakis said wearily for about the hundredth time mcsweeney just glared at him with pale angry eyes if you prayed in a language that wasnt english it was latin to him he even thought jews prayed in latin mantarakis would have liked to give him a good kick but mcsweeney made two of the little greek both of the two armored in cementhard muscle shut up both of you sergeant peterquist said come on get moving onto the damn barge onto the damn barge they moved each man weighed down with pack and ammunition and rifle if you went into the ohio before you made it ashore on the kentucky side youd surely drown theouthelontos god willing that wouldnt happen a couple of shells went by overhead and crashed down behind the small town badly misnamed metropolis illinois the rebs were still shooting but us artillery had beaten down their guns to the point where general custer thought the invasion of the confederacy could begin mantarakis wasnt nearly sure he agreed with that but he was just a private so who cared what he thought metropolis had already given him a taste of the south with its rolling lawns and its magnolias the south philadelphia neighborhood where hed cooked dolmades and cheese steaks hadnt been anything like this not even close but the little town had its own slums down by the bridge the rebs had dynamited when the war broke out brickbat ridge they called it come on pack in tight you birds peterquist yelled in his raspy foghorn voice come on come on come on all over the barge noncoms and officers said the same thing in a lot of different ways mantarakis already felt like one anchovy in a whole tin anchovies and sardines you packed the fish in tight as you could because the oil that went in with em was worth more than they were finding out stuff like that was the only bad part of being a cook as far as he was concerned sometimes because you were in the business you learned things youd rather not know well now he was in the business of killing people and he had the feeling he was going to learn all kinds of things hed rather not know at the moment what he was trying to learn was how to breathe without moving his chest were tight enough now dont you think paddy orourke said in his musical brogue if i was jammed up against the pretty girls nowbut faith its all you ugly bastards the men around him laughed when everyone exhaled at once it did seem to give more room mantarakis said youre pretty ugly your own self paddy ah but i cant see me the irishman answered what seemed like all the artillery shells in the world opened up then on the illinois side of the river the roar of the guns large and small was music to mantarakis ears the more shells that came down on the rebels heads the fewer of the sons of bitches would be left to try and shoot him he stood on tiptoe trying to get a look at just what kind of hell the kentucky side of the river was catching but he couldnt see over the shoulders of his bigger comrades the steam engine that powered the barge started up making the timbers tremble under his feet cast off somebody yelled mantarakis heard the order through the thunder of the artillery somebody must have obeyed because ever so slowly the barge crawled away from the landing and out into the ohio if he turned his head to one side mantarakis could see the river and catch glimpses of other barges wallowing across the current toward kentucky something came down with a splash between his barge and the one closest to it cold water fountained up and splashed down on him that came too damn close to hitting us somebody behind him said only then did paul realize the something had been a confederate shell if a shell did hit a barge packed with soldiers he dug in his pocket and started working the worry beads again if that happened it would be like an explosion in a slaughterhouse with young men playing the role of raw meat more shells landed in the river mantarakis got splashed again and then again somewhere off to his left he heard a shell hit a barge and then heard a clamor of anguish from it when you headed for battle this way you were as helpless as a cow being driven along the chute to the fellow with the sledgehammer you couldnt even fire back the way you could when you got to solid ground how long to cross the river it seemed like forever though it couldnt have taken above fifteen minutes twenty at the most the soldiers in the front rows who could see where they were going passed word back that they were nearing the enemy side of the ohio one of them said hope the rebs dont have no machine guns down by the bank or we aint ever gonna make it onto dryland you dont shut up smitty somebody else said fiercely im gonna shove you in the river and you sure as hell wont make it to dry land paul fingered the worry beads harder than ever his sympathies were with the soldier whod threatened to push smitty overboard the very idea of machinegun bullets stitching through men who couldnt even duck was enough to make his testicles try to crawl up into his belly a big shell landed in the river all too close to the barge mantarakis whod already been wet was now soaked to the skin most of the shell fragments and shrapnel balls fortunately went into the water though a couple of unlucky soldiers howled as they were wounded the barge itself dipped and then recovered almost as if it were a buggy jouncing over a pothole in the road mixed in with the racket of artillery came the sharper discharges of rifles and off in the distance sure enough the endless deathrattle bark of machine guns a couple of men at the front of the barge started shooting too mantarakis didnt know whether he liked that or not it was liable to draw confederate fire onto men who couldnt shoot backhim for instance the barge lurched again paul didnt hear any explosions especially close by no more upthrown water drenched him before he had time to think about what that might mean whistles started squealing at the front of the barge and men screamed out you bastards move run weve gone aground all at once paul could move along with his squadmates he ran forward and jumped off the bow of the barge he got splashed then the water into which hed leaped came up past his knees the mud on the bottom of the ohio tried to pull his boots off his feet the water got shallower fast ahead of him soldiers were running up onto dry land and then fanning out as they moved away from the bank now he saw what the artillery had done to the local landscape it had probably been pleasant before the war started it wasnt pleasant any more whatever grass and bushes had grown here were churned out of existence he could tell that there had been trees down along the riverbank but they were stumps and toothpicks now beyond the treesbeyond what had been treesthe ground looked as if a chunk of hell had decided to take up residence in the confederate states he hadnt imagined anything could be so appalling as that cratered landscape the us guns had done their work well surely nothing could have survived the bombardment theyd laid down he made it up to the riverbank himself his feet squelched dankly in his boots as he pounded inland he reminded himself to put on dry socks if he ever got the chance you let your feet stay soaked all sorts of nasty things happened to them he had cousins who worked on the wharfs in philadelphia whod made that mistake demetrios was still trying to get cured up ahead something moved or paul thought it did then for a split second he thought hed made a mistake and then as flame spat from a rifle muzzle he realized he hadnt it was just that the confederates uniforms made them almost impossible to spot when they were in the dirt the rifle spat fire again ten or fifteen feet to mantarakis left a man went down clutching at his leg paul went down too landing heavily enough to jolt half the wind from him he brought his springfield to his shoulder and drew a bead on the shell hole where hed spotted the reb was that movement he fired then crawled away on his belly his own uniform especially smeared with mud and dirt gave pretty good concealment too he found out how good the concealment was a moment later when an american soldier he hadnt even seen got up peering into the hole at which hed shot and waved everyone on paul got up and started to run before realizing hed just killed a man i should be feeling something he thought the only thing he felt was fear he stumbled in a hole in the ground and fell counting himself lucky he didnt twist an ankle when he got back to his feet he looked behind him hed intended to see how the men on the barge were doing and whether it was all unloaded but he kept staring heedless of the occasional bullets still flying at the grand spectacle of the ohio river the river was full of barges and ferries of every size and age with all the vessels laden to the wallowing point almost to the capsizing point with men in greengray smoke billowed from scores hundreds of stacks a deep black smoke different from the kind artillery explosions kicked up paul cheered like a madman at the display of the might the united states were putting forth with that great armada with the stunning artillery the gunners were laying down to ease the way for the americans how could the confederate states hope to resist the plain answer paul thought was that they couldnt he cheered again seized for a moment by wars grandeur instead of its terror and then without warning most of the barrage still descending on the confederates ahead ended what the hell paul said when the shelling eased up hed been in combat half an hour at most but hed already learned a basic rule if anything strange happens hit the dirt but he kept looking back over his shoulder and to his horror he spotted a gunboat flying the stars and bars steaming west toward the lumbering vessels struggling across the ohio the engineers were supposed to have put mines in the river to keep rebel craft away from the defenseless barges but something had gone wrong somewhere and here this one was a tiger loose among rabbits the river monitor mantarakis knew the rebs didnt call them that but he did carried a turret like those aboard armored cruisers out on the ocean shooting up barges at pointblank range with sixinch guns was like killing roaches by dropping an anvil on them much more than the job required but the job got done either way when a sixinch shell hit a barge it abruptly ceased to be you could if you were so inclined watch men and pieces of men fly through the air they flew amazingly high then the monitors turret would revolve a little pick another target and blow it out of the water if that kept on for very long it wouldnt have any targets left to pick shells rained down around the gunboat too and on it that was why the us artillery had stopped its covering fire for the landing if the guns didnt knock it out in a tearing hurry there wouldnt be a landing or not one with any chance of success all at once paul realized he was in enemy country behind him the ohio looked uncrossably wide he wondered if hed ever see the other side of it again if the gunboat wasnt destroyed then he wondered if hed ever see the other side of it if the gunboat was destroyed a shell slammed into the armored turret holding the monitors big guns slammed into it and bounced off those turrets were armored to keep out projectiles from naval guns shells from field pieces they hardly noticed but the rest of the confederate riverboat was more vulnerable the stacks were shot away so was the conning tower rifle and machinegun fire from the shore and from the barges kept the rebels from putting anyone on deck to make repairs then the rudder went the monitor slewed sideways at last a shell penetrated to the boiler the monitor blew up even more spectacularly than the barges it had wrecked the barges it hadnt wrecked kept on coming across the ohio more loaded up and left the us side of the river the united states had a lot more manpower than did the confederacy paul mantarakis wondered if they had enough manpower to compensate for the mistakes their generals were bound to make he rose grunting under the weight of his pack and moved forward deeper into kentucky one way or another hed find out jefferson pinkard always got the feeling hed died and gone to hell on the job flame and sparks were everywhere you couldnt shout over the triphammer din no point in even trying if you got accustomed to it you could hear people talking in their ordinary voices under it you could even hear a whisper sometimes steel poured from a crucible into a castiron mold the blast of heat sent pinkard reeling godalmightydamn he said in the harshsoft accent of a man whod grown up on an alabama farm bringing up a gloved hand to shield his face i dont care how long you work iron you dont never get used to that and doin it in summertime just makes it worse you think im gonna argue with you jeff youre even crazier than i know you are bedford cunningham answered theyd worked side by side at the sloss furnaces for going on ten years now and were like as two peas in a pod broadshouldered fairhaired men with pale skins that turned red from any sun and even redder from the furnace atmosphere in which they labored the big crucible from which the molten metal had come swung away not so smoothly as pinkard would have liked new kid handlin that thing dont know what the hell hes doin he observed cunningham nodded hes gonna kill somebody fore they take him off and it aint likely itll be hisself god dont usually work things out that neat he spat into the new pig of steel as if quenching it his spittle exploded into steam the instant it touched the metal meditatively he added wish ol herb hadnt got hisself called to the colors yeah pinkard spat too in disgust with the world how the hell they gonna fight a war bedford if they take all the men who know how to make things and stick em in the army if they dont turn out guns and shells what the hell they gonna shoot at the damnyankees you dont need to go preachin to the choir cunningham said i already believe i surely do bunch o damn fools runnin things up in richmond dogged if they aint then he paused again he was more given to contemplation than his friend course the other thing is if they aint got enough soldiers they cant fight the war neither they want more soldiers they should oughta pull em off clerkin jobs and such like that not the ones we do here jefferson pinkard said stubbornly folks like us we should be the last ones chose not the first reckon theres somethin to that cunningham admitted i think maybe jeff never did find out what he thought maybe because a steam whistle blew then the shrill screech cutting through even the insensate racket of the foundry cunningham grinned i think maybe im goin home when pinkard turned around he found his replacement and bedford cunninghams waiting to take over for them after a couple of minutes of the usual chatter half sloss furnace gossip half war news the two men going off work grabbed their dinner pails and let the evening shift have the job another steelworker sid williamson joined them from the next big mold over he could have been cousin to either one of them though he was several years younger and hadnt been at the furnace as long tired he said and then fell silent he never could rub more than a couple of words together along with a lot of other tired dirty sweaty men in overalls and cloth caps they all trudged out toward the gate some of the workersthe sweepers the furnace stokers men with jobs like that were black they kept a little bit apart from the white men who did more highly skilled work and made more money coming in with the evening shift was a whitemustached white man who wore a black suit and a plug hat instead of overalls he dressed like a country preacher but jeff pinkard had never set eyes on any preacher who looked so lowdown mean he strode up to pinkard and cunningham as if he owned the walkway then stopped right in front of them so they either had to stop or run into him do somethin for you pinkard asked not much deference in his voice by his clothes and bearing the stranger had more money than he was ever likely to see but so what one white man was as good as another that was what the confederate states were all about the stranger said wheres your hiring office back over yonder pinkard pointed to a long low clapboard building that got whitewashed about once a week in a neverending battle against the soot sloss foundry and the rest of the birmingham steel mills poured into the air to get a little of his own back for the fellows arrogant attitude pinkard added lookin for work are you you aint as cute as you think you are by the way a cigar twitched in the strangers mouth he was about ready to bite it in two i got me seven prime buck niggers done run off my plantation this past two weeks lookin for city jobs and i aim to get em back every damn one good luck friend pinkard said as the man stomped past him he and bedford cunningham exchanged glances as soon as the irascible stranger was out of earshot pinkard said he aint ever gonna see them niggers again bet your ass he aint cunningham agreed hiring office they dont care what a niggers passbook says not these days they just want to know if hes got the muscle to do the job if hes a prime cottonpickin nigger strong like that theyll fix his passbook so it looks the way it ought to yeah pinkard walked on another couple of steps then said that aint the right way to do things you know not even close i know cunningham said but what are you gonna do jeff this place has been jumpin out of its tree ever since it looked like the war was comin when we went to three shifts we had to get the bodies from somewheres you know what i mean hell we was runnin tight for two way things was night shift i hear tell they got niggers doin white mans work on account of they just cant get enough whites i heard that too pinkard said an i seen it when we come on shift in the mornin an that aint right neither what are you gonna do cunningham repeated shrugging they dont pay em like they was white but even so if youre chopping cotton for seventyfive cents a day a dollar an a half in the foundry looks like big money yeah an when they get enough niggers trained you know whats gonna happen next pinkard said theyre gonna turn around and tell us well pay you a dollar an a half a day too an if you dont like it julius caesar herell take your job mark my words that days comin its the damn war cunningham said mournfully plants gotta make the steel no matter what you complain about it even a little bit they say you aint a patriot and somebody else has your job even if it aint a nigger what the hell can we do were stuck is all the conversation had carried them out of the sloss furnace grounds and into the company housing that surrounded them the negro workers lived to the right of the railroad tracks in cabins painted oxide red the paint like the cabins was cheap pinkard and cunningham lived side by side in identical yellow cottages on the white mens side of the tracks cunninghams was closer to the foundry he waved to pinkard as he went up the walk toward his veranda see you in the mornin he called nodding pinkard headed for his own house the windows were open and so was the front door to let some air into the place a delicious aroma floated out pinkard tossed his cap onto a chair and fetched his dinner pail into the kitchen lord that smells good he said slipping an arm around the waist of his wife emily she turned and kissed him on the tip of the nose the motion made her blue cotton skirt swirl away from the floor so he got a glimpse of her trim ankles chicken and dumplings and okra she said cornbread biscuits already baked spit flooded into his mouth he thumped himself in the belly and it wasnt even your cooking i married you for he exclaimed oh something that looked like ignorant innocence but wasnt sparkled in her blue eyes what did you marry me for then instead of answering with words he gave her a long deep kiss even though she wasnt wearing a corset he could almost have spanned her waist with his two hands she wore her strawberryblond hairalmost the color of flames really in a braid that hung halfway down her back she even smelled and tasted sweet to him when they broke apart she said you still havent answered my question he poked her in the ribs which made her squeak on account of you were the prettiest gal i ever saw an you look better to me now than you did five years ago hows that they didnt have any children yet he wondered how that was too not from lack of trying that was for certain emily smiled at him you always were a sweettalkin man probably why i fell for you why dont you get a couple of bottles of beer out of the icebox supper should be ready in about two shakes the beer was homebrew alabama had gone dry a couple of years before which meant they didnt ship jax up from new orleans any more as he yanked the corks out of the bottles pinkard supposed going dry was a good thing for a lot of people but a beer every now and then didnt seem to him like drinkingand it went awful well with chicken and dumplings he handed one bottle to emily then cautiously swigged from the other with homebrew you never could tell what youd get till you got it he nodded in satisfaction and took a longer pull old homer he did this batch pretty good emily drank too hes done worse ill tell you that she agreed why dont you go sit down and ill bring out supper the chicken was fallingoffthebone tender he used the cornmeal biscuits to sop up the gravy on his plate as he ate he told emily about the planter whod come to the foundry looking for his field hands we got more work to do now than we got people to do it a lot more he said and mentioned how negroes were doing white mens work on the night shift she paused before answering it wasnt a fullmouth pause she was thinking something over at last she said i went into town today to get some groceries so much cheaper than the company commissary when weve got the cash money to pay for things right there and they were talkin about that same kind of thing about how theres so much work and not enough hands its not just the foundry its all over the place grocer edwards he was grumbling how hed had to raise his clerks pay twice since the war started to keep him from goin off and workin in one o them ammunition plants wish somebodyd go an raise my pay jeff said way things look theyre liable to end up cuttin it instead once more he summarized part of what he and bedford cunningham had said they arent hiring niggers to work at the ammunition plants here abouts i know that for a fact emily said she paused again so long that jeff wondered if something was really wrong then instead of going on she got up carried the plates to the sink and lighted the kerosene lamp that hung not far from the table only after that did she continue in a rush i hear tell they are hiring women though dotty lanchester i ran into her at the grocers she says shes gonna start next week she says they really want women what with sewin and everything were good with little parts an stuff an shells have em i guess even if you wouldnt think it to look at em milo s letting dotty go to work at a factory pinkard said surprised if your wife had to work that meant you couldnt support her the way you should shiftless wasnt a name you wanted to wear she said it was her patriotic duty to do it emily answered she said our boys in butternut need everything we can give em to beat the damnyankees and if she could help em she would how were you supposed to argue with that jefferson pinkard turned it over in his mind far as he could see you couldnt argue with it not very well and then after yet another hesitation emily said you know honey i wouldnt mind goin to work there my own self they got lots of ladies like i said so it wouldnt be like i was the only one and with an extra two dollars a day we could really set some money aside for when we do have younguns she looked at him sidelong might be any day you never can tell two dollars a day was a little more than half what the ammunition factory paid the men who worked there better than nigger wages but not a whole lot that was probably one reason the bosses were hiring women but women were dexterous too pinkard wouldnt have argued with that hed struggled a couple of times to thread a needle with his clumsy workroughened hands watching emily do it easy as pie made him swear off trying to sew for good but wages werent what made him hesitate any other time id say no straight out he said i know you would honey emily answered but id be able to keep things goin here too i know i would it aint like im thinkin about it just on account of gettin out of housework or that i dont love you or that i dont think youre workin hard enough to make us all the money we need its nothin like that i swear to god its not you know im speakin the truth now dont you yeah i do he admitted he knew she was wheedling too but he didnt know what to do about it what with the war all of a sudden nothing was simple no sooner had that thought crossed his mind than emily said if the damnyankees lick us it dont hardly matter that we stuck by what was right and proper beforehand now does it he threw his hands in the air in defeat all right emily thats what you want to do you go do it like you say the wars makin everything all topsyturvy well put it back to rights oncet we done licked the united states again shouldnt take long i reckon thank you honey emily got up threw herself down into his lap and flung her arms around his neck the diningroom chair creaked it wasnt used to holding two peoples worth of weight they didnt stay there long though pretty soon they got up and went into the bedroom from a mile in the air the world looked like a map spread out below you not many people had been lucky enough to see the world that way but lieutenant jonathan moss was one of them he had a speck of something on the inside of one lens of his goggles it wasnt enough to interfere with his vision but it was annoying speck or no speck though he knew he could keep a close eye on the us army troops pushing from new york into ontario and on the struggles of the canadians and british to stop them shells pounded the enemy line south of hamilton thats the way to go boys moss shouted slamming a fist down on his thigh the us eagle and crossed swords were painted big and bold and bright on the fuselage wings and tail of his curtiss super hudson pusher biplane he liked the pusher configuration it gave him a better view of the ground than he could have got from a tractor machine and also let him mount a machine gun in front of him to shoot at any aeroplanes that rose up to challenge his aircraft if you mounted a forwardfacing machine gun on a tractor aeroplane youd chew your own prop to bits when you opened fire somebody ought to do something about that moss thought the idea vanished from his head a moment later though for a canadian battery started returning fire on the advancingor rather the stalledamericans scribbling awkwardly in a notebook he held between his knees moss noted the position of the guns when he landed hed pass the sketch on to artillery the enemy guns would get a wakeup call in short order theyve had too damn many wakeup calls already he muttered the wind in his face blew the words away the words were gone but not the fact for all the big talk in the united states about mopping the floor with the dominion of canada reality as reality has a way of doing was proving harder the damned canucks and limeys had spent years fortifying the niagara peninsula the part that ran west from niagara falls every time they were blasted and bayoneted out of one position they fell back to the next just as tough as the one before forcing the crossing of the welland canal alone had put women by the thousands into mourning black but the canal had been crossed now the canadians and british were moving back toward their last line the one that ran from hamilton on lake ontario through caledonia to port dover on lake erie when the united states broke through there the country would widen out and numbers would count for more than they had yet as yet the breakthrough hadnt happened and indeed though the enemy had been thrown back on hamilton in the north they were still holding part of the line of the grand river south of caledonia farther west the assault from michigan hadnt been the walkover everyoneeveryone south of the border anyhowhad figured it would be the line centered on london ontario hadnt cracked yet either and when it would was anybodys guess moss sighed we put too much money into great lakes battleships he told the unheeding sky hed told everybody the same since the day the war started a fat lot of good it did too great lakes battleships werent really battleships to rank with the great vessels in the atlantic and pacific fleets they were smaller and slower and didnt mount so many guns in navies like holland s or sweden s they would have been called coastdefense battleships what people in the usa had called them was victory each great lake had its own flotilla of them and the canadians didntcouldntbuild ships to match in quality or numbers when war came theyd bombard enemy towns and positions with a weight of metal you couldnt move by land the only problem being it hadnt worked out that way the first thing the canadians had done when war broke out was to sow the great lakes with mines as thickly as potato soup was sown with potatoes the perry and the farragut both steaming full tilt toward toronto had blown up and sunk within a couple of hours of each other as had the john paul jones over on lake huron losing millions of dollars worth of ships and a couple of thousand trained sailors had made the flotillas less intrepid in a hurry as if that werent bad enough the canadians had submersibles too nobodynobody american anyhowknew how many but theyd picked off a great lakes battleship and a couple of light cruisers too before scuttling back to their home ports put it all together and it meant the army was advancing through the toughest part of the enemys defenses without a good bit of the fire support it had expected to have and so the going was tough jonathan moss peered down at the canadian and british guns from a mile in the air they looked like tiny lead toys and the barechested men who served them like pink ants he scribbled some more on the makeshift map the enemy lines really did look like lines from up here a zigzagging series of entrenchments that cut across the land even the entrenchments that ran back from the frontline positions zigzagged to make a shell landing in one of them do as little damage as possible those bastards have been thinking about this for a long time moss said penciling squiggles over the page to represent the zigzag entrenchments the american positions facing the foe were less neat for one thing the us forces had to form their lines in territory theyd taken away from the canadians and every inch of that territory had been fought over till it was nothing but a crumpled battered landscape that reminded moss of nothing so much as telescopic photographs of the craters of the moon for another the americans hadnt planned to conduct such a grinding campaign of attrition and hadnt yet worked out the doctrine for fighting in those conditions even getting supplies forward to the troops at the sharp end of the wedge was anywhere from hard to impossible the railroads had been chewed up along with everything else in the territory over which the americans had advanced food and ammunition had to come forward by wagon or else on peoples backs by contrast the rail network the defenders used was all but intact moss watched several trains chugging along toward the front each one full of troops or munitions or food and fodder he made a sour face you could move more faster by train than with horses or people that was what the second half of the nineteenth century had been about if you looked at it the right way it gave the defenders what struck him as an unfair advantage he was so busy noting the arriving trains he didnt spot the other aero plane till it started shooting at him the sound of lewisgun bullets drumming through the fabric of his wingsand whipcracking past his headgot his attention in a hurry he was banking to the left before he even looked up the avro ahead of him tried to turn with him but his aircraft was more agile than the tractor machine he swung away from the area the observer in the front cockpit could cover with his machine gun the pilot in the rear cockpit blazed away at him with a pistol but only fool luck would let you hit anything with a pistol when both you and your target were moving crazily and at high speed in different directions at high speed the avro was faster on the level than his super hudson and could climb faster too that would nullify his ability to turn inside it if he didnt do something in a hurry he lined up the nose of his aircraft on the canadian biplanes tail and squeezed the triggers of his maxim gun brass cartridge cases streamed out of the breech glittering in the sun as they fell away in the avro the pilot threw up his hands and slumped forward against the fairing that helped deflect the slipstream the canadian aeroplanes nose went down it began to dive and then to spin maybe the observer hadnt properly fastened his safety belt maybe it gave way under the strain however that was the luckless fellow was thrown out of the avro as he plunged toward the earth he looked like a man treading water but the thin thin air would not bear his weight he fell the fringed end of his red wool muffler flapping above him jesus jonathan moss shook like a man with the grippe hed never fired the maxim gun in anger before hed never expected to have to fire it despite reports of other aerial combats he hadnt even wanted it mounted on his aeroplane but it had just saved his life the avro smashed into the ground and burst into flame a few hundred yards inside the enemys lines dutifully moss noted the position on his sketch map the observer had undoubtedly smashed into the ground too but moss could not see him jesus he said again and licked his lips with the wind blasting in his face they would have been dry anyhow some pilots smeared petroleum jelly on them before taking off moss lips were drier now his stomach turned loops that had nothing to do with the acrobatic abilities of the super hudson hed thought one of the nice things about being an aerial observer was not having to kill anybody personally war down on the ground was a filthy nasty business filthier and nastier than anyone had expected when it broke out watching the slow advance across the niagara peninsula had shown moss that and hed seen it from high in the air as if he were looking down on a chess match where both players could move at the same time an awful lot of poor damned pawns had been captured and removed from the board i was above all that he muttered meaning it both literally and metaphorically like a knight he could jump over intervening space and appear where he was needed on the board now abruptly he realized that like a knight he also faced danger he too could be sacrificed hed killed yes but it was a fair fight so he told himself over and over the fellows in the avro had had just as much chance to send his aeroplane spinning down in ruins as hed had to shoot down theirs he wasnt some conscript rifleman reduced to a corpse by a machine gunner who wasnt aiming at him or by an artilleryman back of the line whod never seen him at all merely pulled a lanyard and hoped for the best thousands of randomly killed men lay down there sometimes the stink of them made him wish the super hudson would fly higher to let him escape it a fair fight single combat maybe that did make him a knight not one from a chess set but a noble warrior from the days of chivalry going forth into single combat as if into a joust that was a better way to look at things he decided it shielded him from the blunt reality of having killed two men to keep them from killing him a knight he said and touched the maxim gun as if it were the lance a knight in shining armor carried into battle with him a knight of the air he carefully scanned the sky to make sure the canadian aeroplane had been as alone up here as his own machine he spied no other aircraft with red maple leaf inside white circle inside blue yes it had been true single combat if you were going to fight that was the way to do it he had a sudden mental image of teddy roosevelt going into the gladiatorial arena againstwould he fight robert borden or the duke of connaught prime minister or governor general either way moss figured tr would quickly dispose of his foe then he could take on woodrow wilson and after hed slain both enemy leaders the united states would be declared winner of the war and could take whatever spoils it wanted from canada and the confederacy that would be the easy way the cheap way to go about it he said it was also a pipe dream as he knew full well statesmen didnt go out to fight for themselves that had fallen out of fashion after the crusades he didnt know exactly when statesmen sent young men out to do the killingand the dyingfor them if you have to do it moss muttered feeling on the shaky side still as he turned back toward his aerodrome i suppose being a knight of the air is the way to go about it the only trouble was nobody had seen fit to issue him a suit of shining armor jake featherston yanked the lanyard of his threeinch field gun and hoped for the best the piece belched flames the other five men on the gun crew working like steampowered machinery even though two of them were raw replacements reloaded the gun five seconds after the first round another was on its way hell of a gun featherston shouted appreciatively them frenchies they knew what they were do in when they made the model he pulled the lanyard yet again boom another shell went on its way toward the yankee positions just outside of glen rock pennsylvania thanks to the muzzle brake on the frenchdesigned howitzer its recoil was a lot less than that of us guns of similar caliber which meant corrections between rounds were also less which meant a good gun crew could get off a dozen rounds a minute featherston had a damn good gun crew a horsedrawn wagon full of wooden crates stenciled with the confederate battle flag came rattling up jake featherston and his crew let out a cheer bout time we got more rounds shouted jethro bixler the loader you didnt show up soon they was gonna give us tredegars an stick us in the damn infantry cant have that the driver said his grin exposing a missing front tooth he glanced over to the colored servants who were standing by the team of horses that would move the field gun ahead as the confederacy continued its conquest of southeastern pennsylvania and maryland git your asses over here you lazy damnfool niggers unload this bastard sos i can go fill er up agin nero and perseus cameat a faster clip than theyd used when the war first broke out then they might have been picking cotton for a plantation owner they despised theyd come to realize though that keeping their crew in shells was liable to mean keeping themselves alive as with the soldiers they served survival was a powerful incentive toward good performance each crate held twelve shells counting the weight of the wood in the crate itself the weight the blacks were hauling was up close to a couple of hundred pounds each go grunting with effort they unloaded crates as the driver and the gun crew watched then sweat running down their faces they went back to the animals theyd been watching lazy the driver repeated he flicked the reins the horses strained in harness the driver tipped his hat to the artillerymen and headed southwest down the dirt track called school road toward the division supply dump jethro bixler attacked the tops of the ammunition crates with a pry bar nails squealed as the tops came up bixler flung each aside in turn he would have made two of either nero or perseus a big blond broadshouldered fellow with the look of a blacksmith to him when one of the ammunition crates wasnt close enough to the howitzer to suit him he picked it up singlehanded and set it where he wanted it then he struck a circus strongman pose as if to proclaim to the world that that had been a deliberate demonstration of prowess not a white man stooping to do nigger work other wagons turned off from school road for the rest of the guns in the battery the negroes attached to the artillery unit stopped what they were doing to unload the shells through the roar of guns that kept firing featherston listened to the artillerymen screaming at the blacks to hurry flip those lids over jethro featherston said when bixler was through opening up the new crates dont want anybody stepping on a nail hed miss all the fun he let out a wry chuckle right yare sergeant bixler said i tell you i done had just about all the fun i can stand thank you kindly fore we started wasnt nobody said itd be like this here the damnyankees theyre toughern paw an granddad made em out to be several of the other men nodded agreement to that jake featherston among themit was hardly something you could deny featherston said if everything went the way it was supposed to wed be over the susquehanna by now drivin for the delaware river yeah jethro bixler slammed a meaty fist into an equally meaty thigh in his enthusiasm my family we had kin in baltimore back before the war of secession hellfire for all i know we still do but nobody on our side o the borders heard from em in fifty years we should have taken maryland away from the damnyankees after we made peace with em the first time and delaware added pete howard one of the shell carriers all that country is ours by rights by jesus before its ours we got to take it featherston said which drew more nods from the rest of the crew we aint even in baltimore yet aint supposed to be in it answered bixler who fancied himself a strategist supposed to wheel around and cut it off so it damn well falls yeah but we aint done that yet is the problem featherston retorted the damnyankees still got that railroad goin through down alongside chesapeake bay we cant wheel round an cut that line theyre liable to do some cuttin of their own and leave us stranded up here the wheel was supposed to have taken them to the west bank of the delaware by wilmington and to have cut off the area south of the front from any possible support by the united states it might still do that jake hoped to god it would still do that but every day they fell farther behind their planned advance line and that was another day the us forces could ship more men and munitions down from philadelphia the confederate army still had to cross the susquehanna lee had done it after hammering mcclellan outside of camp hill but lee hadnt had to face machine guns that could melt a regiment down to platoon size in a matter of minutes if you tried attacking them head onand how else were you going to attack them if you were forcing a river line featherston looked back over his shoulder down school road it hadnt been much of a road to begin with it was even less now after yankee artillery had chewed it upand confederate artillery too before the men in butternut advanced so far half a mile back from the battery mechanics worked on a couple of motor trucks that had broken down trying to bring supplies forward the front demanded a flood of materiel thanks to the miserable roads it got a trickle no wonder the yanks are givin us such a hard time jake muttered captain jeb stuart iii trotted up to featherstons gun get the team hitched to your piece the battery commander called were moving forward maybe a mile he pointed northeast the damnyankees are holed up in a couple of stone farmhouses out that way and theyve got a whole regiment stalled on its trackhavent been able to clear em out with rifles and machine guns so they want us to knock the houses down you hear that nero perseus featherston called as stuart went off to give the order to the rest of the battery the two negroes nodded and brought the horses over hitching the animals to the gun trail was a matter of a few minutes for they were already in harness hitching the other team to the supply wagon that followed the gun was also quickly done then swearing and sweating nero and perseus lifted the crates of shells theyd just unloaded from one wagon up onto another move em out captain stuart was shouting and waving his cap in his hand to urge the men on pompey brought him a glass of something cool to drink he upended it gave it back to the servant and went on shouting to the gun crew and to the laborers without whom they wouldnt have been nearly so efficient it hadnt rained for several days so the roador rather trackto the new position wasnt muddy when a howitzer bogged down hubdeep in muck everybody blacks and whites together put shoulders to it to keep it moving leaves on some of the trees were beginning to go from green to gold and red they wouldnt have started turning this early in september back in the csa since the dirt track was dry they got dust instead of mud by the time they reached the new position everyone was the same shade of grayish brown featherston no less than nero the artillery sergeant peered through the field glasses at the farmhouses captain stuart wanted the battery to destroy range about thirtyfive hundred yards id make it he said and worked the elevation screw to lower the field guns barrel to accommodate the shorter range stuart had been right the confederates had advanced past the farmhouses to either side but were halted in front of them even through field glasses corpses were tiny at two miles but featherston saw a lot of them he studied the gunsight again then traversed the barrel slightly to the left load it and well fire for effect he said jethro bixler set a shell in the breech then closed it with a scrape of metal against metal he bowed to featherston as if they were a couple of fancy gentlemensay jeb stuart iii and one of the sloss brothersat an inaugural ball in richmond would you care to do the honors hell yes jake said with a laugh and pulled the lanyard the field gun barked he got the field glasses up to his eyes just as the shell hit three or four seconds later miss he said and clucked to himself in annoyance long and still off to the right he lowered the barrel a little more and brought it over another few minutes of arc to the left the second round fired for effect was straight but still long the third fell a few yards short by then the other guns in the battery had gone into action too so he had to hesitate before he could be sure the round he had seen really came from his gun he turned the elevation screw counterclockwise about a quarter of a revolution waited a couple of seconds for a fresh load and fired again at the farmhouse hit the whole gun crew shouted it together smoke and dust shot up from the building through the field glasses featherston saw a hole in the roof now we give it to em he said and shell after shell rained down on and around the farmhouse its stone walls might have been thick enough to keep out smallarms fire but they werent proof against artillery the building fell to pieces even faster than it would have under assault from a steam crane and wrecking ball he swung his field glasses to the other farmhouse half the guns in the battery had chosen that one and it was in no better shape than the one his howitzer crew had helped to destroy confederate troops swarmed up out of the shallow trenches theyd dug to protect themselves from the fire coming out of those two buildings and rushed toward them to his dismay and anger he saw the barrage though it had wrecked the farmhouses hadnt killed or driven off all the enemy soldiers in them men in butternut fell not quite in the horrific numbers featherston had seen in some assaults but far too many all the same we gotta keep hitting em he shouted to the gun crew more shells went out fast as the artillerymen could serve the howitzer featherston kept watching the assault on the farmhouses the confederate infantrymen surged toward them still taking casualties but advancing now featherston held fire when they reached the buildings not wanting to hit the soldiers on his own side when he saw tiny figures in butternut waving their comrades forward past the farmhouses he knew the position had been carried good job boys he said it wasnt every day you could actually see what your firing had accomplished a lot of the time your shells were just part of a massive bombardment aimed at targets too far away for you to tell whether youd done any good against them or not perseus pointed up into the sky lookit thatits one o them aeroplane contraptions the negro shouted wonder whose side its on reckon its a yankee machine featherston said also looking up if it was one of ours it wouldnt be hangin up there over our linesitd be spyin on the enemy instead what he wished was that he had a gun able to knock that snooping us aeroplane right out of the sky wishing though didnt magically provide him with one as the machine passed nearly overhead something fell out of it and sped toward the ground for a moment jake hoped that meant the pilot had gone overboard or whatever the aeronautical equivalent was he realized the shape was wrong he also realized two or three some things were falling not just one and with that he realized what the somethings were hes dropping bombs on us he shouted indignantly boom boom boom there were three of them they fell a couple of hundred yards behind the battery of field guns the noise from the explosions smote featherston like a thunderclap clouds of smoke and dust rose but the bombs didnt seem to have done any damage jethro bixler looked back at where theyd blown up then shook his fist at the aeroplane which was now flying away toward the yankee lines but then he grinned and shrugged that wasnt so much of a much he said by the sound of those things they werent a whole lot biggern what our threeinchers throw an we can put em just where we want em and put a whole bunch of em there stead o droppin a couple an runnin for home they can put em back of our lines farther than artillery can reach featherston said giving such credit as he could the confederacy had bombing aeroplanes of its own after all and he didnt want to think they were useless but he also took pride in what he did reckon youre right though set alongside these here guns i dont figure aerial bombsll ever amount to much as george enos came into his house his wife sylvia greeted him with bad news theyre going to cut the coal ration this month and it looks like its going to stay cut thats not good he said an understatement if ever there was one he took off his cap and set it on the head of fouryearold george jr naturally it fell down over his sons eyes the boy squealed with glee the fisherman went on hard enough cooking if they cut the ration any further but winters coming and this is boston how will we keep warm if we cant get as much coal as we need mr peterson at the coal board office he didnt say anything about that and you can bet there were a lot of people asking him too sylvia enos thin face was angry and tired and frustrated she often looked that way when she got home from a couple of hours of fighting coal board paperwork but more so today than usual all he said was the factories have to have coal if theyre going to make all the things we need to fight the war and everybody else gets whats left over the surtax is going up another penny a hundredweight too i already knew that much george enos said some company bigwig was grousing about it when we coaled up ripple before we went out last monday well sit down and rest a bit sylvia told him i havent seen you since then you know and little george and mary jane havent either its hard for them their father gone days at a time supperll be about twenty minutes more all right enos said the pleasant smells of clam chowder and potatoes fried in lard wafted into the living room from the kitchen sylvia started to head back into the kitchen then turned with hands on her hips i swear to goodness the forms they give you to fill out before you can even get a speck of coal now are worse than they ever used to be maybe we should burn all the forms enos said then we wouldnt need so much coal you think youre making a joke sylvia said its not funny when mrs conevals mother came over yesterday she was complaining about them too she remembers back before the second mexican war and she says there didnt hardly used to be any forms like there are now that was a long time ago george answered which got him a dirty look from sylvia after a moment he realized hed pretty much called her friends mother an old woman defensively he went on well it was from what people say things havent been the same since his wife nodded sadly always the war scares i dont know how many from then till now but a lot of them and all the factories busy all the time making guns and shells and ships and i dont know what all else to use if the war came and now its come but wed have had so much more for ourselves if we hadnt been worrying about the war all the time but wed probably have lost it too because the rebs have been building every bit as hard as we have he said harder maybe if they use their niggers in their factories they dont have to pay em anything to speak of same with the canadians except they dont have niggers talking about niggers made him think of charlie white but the cookie was somebody he worked with a friend who just happened to have dark brown skin and hair that grew in tight curls it wasnt the same though he couldnt have put his finger on why it wasnt sylvia said the canadians they have frenchies instead of niggers she sniffed loudly but not on account of french canadians i have to turn those potatoes or theyll burn and ill start frying the fish with them in a couple of minutes too all right george enos sat down and lighted a cigar he wondered how long hed be able to keep doing that most tobacco came from the confederate states and they werent going to be shipping any up north not while they and the united states were shooting at each other george jr came over and hugged one of his legs seeing that mary jane toddled up and hugged the other one she tried to imitate everything her older brother did which often made her the most absurd creature george had ever seen dadadada she said enthusiastically she was a year and a half old now and sometimes said daddy but when she got excitedas she always did when her father first came home from the seashe went back to baby talk fresh sizzling noises from the kitchen said the fish had gone into the frying pan the enoses like any other fisher folk ate a lot of fish nobody begrudged georges bringing home enough to feed his family he didnt have to fill out any forms to get it either through the sizzle sylvia called when do you think youll be going out again dont know exactly he answered soon as captain odonnell or somebody from the company can lay hold of more coal i expect business is good prices are up and so theyre sending us out as often as they can might be the day after tomorrow might be somebody knocked on the front door hard might be tomorrow morning enos said heaving himself up out of his chair in the kitchen sylvia groaned but softly he understood what she was feeling because he was feeling all the same things himself getting to see his family once in a while mattered a lot but hed brought home a lot of money in the weeks since the war started prices were up too but as long as he stayed busy he stayed ahead of them he opened the door sure enough there stood fred butcher hate to do this to you george the mate said but weve swung a deal for some fuel we sail at half past five tomorrow morning ill be there enos saidwhat else could he say butcher nodded i know you will you and cookie we can always count on the two of you some of the others im going to have to pry em out of the saloons and sober em upif i can find em he touched a finger to the bill of his cap see you on the wharf tell your missus im sorry he hurried off a busy man with more work ahead of him george enos shut the door suppers on the table sylvia called at the same moment as he walked into the kitchen she went on i can guess what that was all about nice i get to give you one meal before charlie white gets his hands on you again you eat more of his cooking than you do of mine seems like maybe i do enos said but i like yours better that made sylvia smile for a moment she didnt look so tired george wasnt sure hed told her the truth but hed made her happy which counted too sylvia cut up bits of fish and potato for the children george jr handled his fork pretty well one day soon hed start using a knife with mary jane sylvia had to make sure she ate more than she threw from the high chair onto the floor it was about an evenmoney bet have to get them to bed early tonight george remarked if we can i dont want to go to bed early his son declared indignantly mary jane wasnt old enough yet to know what he was talking about youll do as youre told though enos said george jr knew that tone brooked little argument he changed his tack asking why do i have to go to bed early mama daddy why just because you do sylvia answered glancing at her husband with an expression half amused half harassed when you had only occasional nights together you needed to make the most of them and there were reasons sailors coming home from the sea had a salty reputation again george sylvia whispered in the darkness of their bedroom feeling him rise against her flank for the fourth time you might as well be a bridegroom shouldnt you sleep instead i can sleep on the ripple he said as he climbed back on top of her i cant do this she laughed and clasped her arms around his sweaty back when the alarm clock jangled at four in the morning he wished hed slept more and done other things less he made the clock shut up then found a match scratched it and used the flame to find and light the gas lamp staggering around like a halfdead thing he fumbled his way into his clothes by the time he was dressed sylvia whod thrown a quilted robe over her white cotton nightdress pressed a cup of coffee into his hands he gulped it down hot and sweet and strong you should go back to bed he told her she shook her head as she did whenever he said that in the small hours of the morning she puckered her lips he set down the cup and kissed her goodbye some of the streets on the way down to t wharf had gaslights some new brighter electric lamps the lamps werent bright enough to keep him from seeing stars in the sky the air was crisp and cool fall wasnt just coming fall was here they might get a couple of weeks of indian summer and then again they might not t wharf didnt care about day or night it was busy all the time and sure enough there ahead of him strode charlie white a knitted wool cap on his head hey cookie george called the negro turned and waved for a wonder the whole crew got to the ripple on time wouldnt even expect that in the navy patrick odonnell said his highest praise a few minutes later coal smoke spurted from the steam trawlers stack along with lucas phelps george cast off the mooring lines the ripple chugged out toward georges bank the cookie served out more coffee and then more still a lot of the fisher men were short on sleep and if any of them were hung over well coffee was good for that too the day dawned bright and clear gulls screeched overhead they knew fishing boats were a good place to cadge a meal but they werent smart enough to tell outbound boats from inbound off in the distance floated a plume of smoke from a warship outbound ahead of the ripple enos liked seeing that it made trouble from confederate cruisers and submarines less likely the warship intent on its own concerns soon left the ripple behind the smoke vanished over the eastern horizon though the ripple was a trawler everyone fished with long lines on the way out to georges bank no point wasting travel time the cod and mackerel they caught went into the hold so did a couple of tilefish shallower watern youll usually see em in lucas phelps remarked pulling in a flopping threefoot fish more of em now than there have been too since they almost disappeared thirty years back my pa used to talk about that george enos said cold currents shifting almost killed em off or something like that he headed up to the galley for yet another mug of coffee when they reached the georges bank that night the trawl splashed into the sea the ripple crawled along dragging it over the ocean bottom to keep from drawing raiders captain odonnell left the running lights off he posted a double watch to listen for approaching vessels and avoid collisions but they might have been alone on the ocean another clear dawn followed with water around them stretching as far as the eye could tell all the way to the end of the world no smoke told of other fishing boats or warships anywhere nearby enos was gutting fish when the captain spotted a smoke plume approaching from the east freighter heading in toward boston he judged after a spyglass examination he looked some more carrying something under tarps on the bow something else at the stern the freighter must have spotted the ripple too for she swung toward the trawler odonnell kept watching her every couple of minutes enos thought he was worrying too much but on the other hand he got paid to worry and then the captain shouted cut the trawl free weve got to run for it those are guns under there too late one of the guns roared a sound harsh even across a couple of miles of water a shell splashed into the sea a hundred yards in front of the ripples bow then the other gun the one at the armed freighters stern belched smoke and fire that shell landed about as far behind the steam trawler signal flags fluttered up the freighters lines captain odonnell read them through the telescope surrender or be sunk they tell us he said like the rest of the fishermen george enos stood numb unbelieving you never thought it could happen to you not so close to home but that freighter while no match for the cruiser that hadnt seen it could do with the ripple as it would one of those shells would have smashed the steam trawler to kindling what do we do captain enos asked odonnell was an old navy man surely hed have a trick to discomfit the approaching ship which george could see now flew the stars and bars above the signal flags but odonnell after kicking once at the deck folded the telescope and put it in his pocket what can we do he said and then answered his own question by turning to fred butcher and saying run up a white flag mate theyve got us v r ain with sleet in it blew into arthur mcgregors face as he rode his wagon into rosenfeld the hamlet on the manitoba prairie nearest his farm at the edge of town a sentry in a greengray us army rain slicker stepped out into the roadway his boots making wet sucking noises as they went into and came out of the mud lets see your pass canuck he said in a harsh bigcity accent wordlessly mcgregor took it out of an inside pocket and handed it to him the farmer had wrapped the pass in waxed paper before setting out for rosenfeld knowing hed need it the americans were sticklers for every bit of punctilio theyd set up in the territory they occupied and people who didnt go along disappeared into jail or sometimes just disappeared period after carefully inspecting the document the sentry handed it back awright go ahead he said grudgingly as if disappointed he didnt have an excuse for giving mcgregor more trouble he gestured with his springfield water beaded on the bayonet hed done a good job of greasing it to keep it from rusting rosenfelds only reason for being was that it lay where an eastwest railway line and one that ran northsouth merged into a single line heading northeast in the direction of winnipeg along with the train station it boasted a general store a bank a couple of churches a livery stable run by the blacksmith who also did his best to fix motorcars not that he saw many a doctor who doubled as a dentist a weekly newspaper and a post office mcgregor hitched the horses in front of that last shut the door behind you called wilfred rokeby the postmaster when mcgregor came in the farmer obeyed not blaming him a bit the coal stove made the interior of the post office deliciously warm mcgregor stood dripping on the mat just inside the door for a couple of minutes before going on up to the counter rokeby nodded in approval he was a small fussy man with a thin mustache and with mousebrown hair parted precisely in the center and held immovably in place by some cinnamonscented hair oil that always made mcgregor think of baked apples and what can i do for you today arthur he asked as if certain the farmer had something new and exotic in mind mcgregor took out another sheet of waxed paper this one was folded around half a dozen ordinary envelopes want to mail these he said rokeby looked pained he always did but today more than usual theyre going to destinations in the occupied zone i hope cant send em anyplace else from here now can i mcgregor answered sourly any mail wagon goes from one side of the line to the other first the yanks shoot it up and then we do that is unfortunately correct the postmaster made it sound as if it were mcgregors fault he pointed to the envelopes lying on the counter between them thosell have to go through the american military censor before i can send em out you know yeah id heard about that mcgregors expression said what he thought of it too its all right he spread the envelopes out fanfashion so rokeby could read the addresses on them two to my brothers two to my sisters and brothersinlaw two to my cousins just to let em know im alive and well and so is the rest of the family censors can read em till their eyes cross far as im concerned all right arthur wanted to make sure you remembered is all wilfred rokeby lowered his voice the yanks have arrested moren a couple of people on account of they were careless about what they put in the mail wouldnt want anything like that to happen to you thanks mcgregor said gruffly he dug in his pocket and came out with a handful of change setting a dime and two pennies on the counter beside the envelopes he went on why dont you let me have the stamps for them then ill do that the postmaster scooped up the coins and dropped them into the cash box then he pulled out a sheet of fifty carmine stamps tore off a strip of six and handed them to mcgregor here you go thanks ill mcgregor took a closer look at the stamps rokeby had given him the color wasnt quite rightthat was what had first drawn his eye when he took that closer look he saw they didnt bear the familiar portrait of king george v either they were us stamps with a picture of benjamin franklin on them on franklin s plump face the phrase manitoba mil dist was overprinted in black ink what the devil are these the stamps we have to use from now on rokeby answered ugly arent they but i dont have a choice about what i sell you military governor says no mail with the old stamps goes out any more penalty for disobeying is more than you want to think about one after another mechanically mcgregor separated the stamps from the strip the postmaster had given him licked them and stuck them on envelopes even the glue tasted wrong or he thought it didmore bitter than that to which he was accustomed the taste of occupation he thought the us stamps specially made up for the occupied area hereabouts brought home to him that the americans expected to be here a long time in a way nothing else not even the soldier outside of town had done he shoved the letters at rokeby then turned on his heels and stomped out of the post office without another word suddenly the warmth in there felt treacherous deceptive as if by being comfortable rokeby was somehow collaborating with the united states he knew the idea was absurd but it wouldnt go away once it occurred to him the cold nasty rain that beat in his face when he went outside was a part of his native land and so seemed oddly cleansing the general store was a couple of doors down his feet thumped on the boards of the sidewalk a bell jingled when he went in henry gibbon looked up from a copy of the rosenfeld register he took a pipe out of his mouth knocked it against an ashtray and said morning to you arthur havent seen you in a while everything all right out at your place right enough anyhow mcgregor answered a measure of life in wartime we didnt get hurt thank god and we didnt lose our buildings or too much of the livestock ive heard of plenty of people who came through worse thats a fact the storekeeper said henry gibbon looked like a store keeper bald and plump and genial with a big gray mustache hiding most of his upper lip he wore a white apron none too clean over a collarless shirt a considerable expanse of belly and black wool trousers you got your family you got your house you can go on mcgregor nodded he didnt tell gibbon about how his wife had tried endlessly to get rid of the bloodstains on the floors and walls or about the chunks of board hed nailed over dozens of bullet holes to keep out the cold the farmhouse looked as if it had broken out in pimples so what can i sell you today gibbon asked unlike some storekeepers mcgregor had known he made no bones about being in a business where he gave customers goods in exchange for money thing i need most is ten gallons of kerosene the farmer answered nights are starting to get longer and theyll be really long pretty soon ive got plenty of coal laid in for the winter but lamp oil now he spread his hands henry gibbon clicked his tongue between his teeth i can give you two gallons no problem anything more than that at one time or you buyin more than two gallons a month and you got to get permission from the americans in writing he reached down under the counter and pulled out a set of forms which he waved in mcgregors face i got to account for every drop i sell when and to who and how much at a time theyre fussy about checkin on it too you dont want to run foul of em it was warm inside the store as it had been in the post office again mcgregor had the sense of warmth betraying him two gallons a month thats not much its what i can sell you gibbon said arthur id do more if i could but i got a family you get in trouble with the americans you get in bad trouble he waved the copy of the register much as he had the us forms then he pointed to an item and read aloud the us military governor in the town of morden announces that ten hostages have been taken because of the shooting death of an american soldier if the perpetrator of this vile and dastardly act of cowardice does not surrender himself to the duly constituted authorities within seventytwo hours of this announcement the hostages will be executed by firing squad let me see that mcgregor said hed paid little attention to the town weekly since the american tide rolled over this part of manitoba now he got a good look at how things had changed since the occupation oh not everything was different from what it had been local stores still advertised on the front page of the register as they had for as long as malachi stubing had been publishing itand through the tenures of two other publishers before him he still announced local births and marriages farmers still plunked down money to tout the service of their stallions and jackasses with the invariable tendollar fee and the phrase colt to stand and walk if the foal was stillborn the fee was waived mcgregor had put a good many such notices in the paper over the years some of the death notices were as theyd always been mary lancaster age beloved mother grandmother georgi pasternak age months at home with the angels but a good many bore familiar names gone at un expected ages burton wheeler years old paul fletcher age joe teague none of those gave the least hint how the young men had died another story listed men known to be prisoners of war and gave their kin instructions on how to send them packages all parcels are subject to search it warned any found containing contraband of any description will result in the addressees forfeiting all rights to receive future parcels that blunt warning took mcgregor to the columns of small print that covered the broader world and there most of all that world might have turned upside down with the arrival of the americans suddenly germany became the trusted ally england and france the hated foes the german failure in front of paris was glossed over as a small setback and much made of the victory the kaisers forces had won over russians poking their noses into eastern prussia as far as the register was concerned the united states could do no wrong though each story did bear the disclaimer furnished by the american military information bureau if you believed what you read the yanks were in winnipeg in toronto and bombarding montreal and quebec city to say nothing of the triumphs theyd won against the confederacy and the victories their atlantic fleet and the german high seas fleet had gained over the royal navy and its french and confederate allies mcgregor set the register back on the counter what do you think of all this he asked henry gibbon the storekeeper paused before he spoke well the paper its on is pretty thin now he said at last that makes it better for wipin your ass than it used to be mcgregor stared at him then chuckled down deep in his throat i dont expect the american military information boardd like that answer henry give me a penny and ill care a cents worth gibbon answered this time both men laughed come on you damn nigger shake a leg the lieutenant shouted a silver bar gleaming on each shoulder strap you think weve got all day to unload this stuff get your lazy stinking black ass in gear or youll be sorry you were ever born and you can take that to the bank im comin sir fast as i can cincinnatus answered he walked onto the barge threw a hundredpound sack of corn onto his shoulder and carried it to the waiting motor truck the truck rocked on its springs as he tossed the sack on top of the others already in the cargo bed faster dammit the lieutenant screamed setting a hand on the grip of his pistol he clapped the other hand to his forehead and almost knocked the greengray cap off his head jesus christ no wonder the stinking rebs go on about niggers the way they do cincinnatus would have liked to see the lieutenant haul as much as he was hauling or even half as much the noisy little peckerwood ofayd fall over dead but he had the gun and he had the rest of the us army behind him and so cincinnatus didnt see that he had much choice about doing what he was told he had no great love for the whites for whom hed laboured here in covington theyd told the truth about one thing though he didnt get better treatment now that the united states was running the town than he had when the stars and bars flew here some ways things were worse the whites who lived in covingtontom kennedy came to minddealt with negroes every day and were used to them a lot of the soldiers from the united states this buckra lieutenant surely among themhad never set eyes on a black man before they invaded the confederacy they treated negroes like mules or maybe like steam engines another grunt another sack of grain on his shoulder another walk to the truck the lieutenant shouted at him every inch of the way no you didnt cuss a steam engine the way that fellow cussed cincinnatus the negro couldnt figure out whether the us soldier blamed him for being black or for being the reason the south had broken away from the united states he didnt think the lieutenant knew or cared the man could abuse him with impunity and he did once we win here well ship all you nigger bastards back to africa he said sounding ready willing and able to pilot the boat himself sensibly cincinnatus kept his mouth shut even if he hadnt had a lot of schooling though he could do arithmetic better than that damnfool lieutenant there were something like ten million negroes in the confederate states that made for a lot of boat trips back and forth across the ocean for that matter the usa hadnt shipped its own negroes back to africa if they werent there any more whom would the white folks have left to despise at last the back of the truck was full cincinnatus picked up a galvanized bucket drank some water and poured the rest over his head the lieutenant glowered at him but let him do it maybe hed convinced the fellow he really was working a white man a us soldier drove away in the truck i could do that suh cincinnatus told the lieutenant you could use your boys for nothin but fightin then no the lieutenant barked and cincinnatus shut up again if the damnyankee wanted to be stupid that was his lookout but the damnyankees werent stupid not in everything and you were in trouble if you didnt remember that the railroad bridge and the highway bridge over the ohio had crashed into the water as soon as the war started blown up by confederate sappers to keep us troops from using them the yankee bombardment had done a lot of damage to the covington docks and when invasion looked imminent the confederates had done a lot more again to keep the united states from gaining a military advantage when cincinnatus came out of the storm cellar of his house after the confederate army retreated southward and the artillery fire tapered off he was horrified at the devastation all around things still looked like hell the fires were out yes but every third build ing or so it seemed was either wrecked or had a hole bitten out of it you didnt want to walk down the street without shoes youd slice your feet to ribbons on the knifesharp shards of glass that sparkled like diamonds in the sun and were sometimes drifted inches deep none of that had kept us forces from exploiting covington once theyd seized it not one but two railroad bridges and one for wagons and trucks came down from ohio now they were pontoon bridges that blocked the river to water traffic but the damnyankees didnt seem to care about that and the docks had got back in working order faster than cincinnatus had imagined possible barges and ferriesanything that would floatworked alongside the bridges in moving men and materiel down toward the fighting the us army engineers knew what they were doing no two ways about that cincinnatus sighed if the damnyankees had done as well dealing with the people of covington as they had with transportation into and out of the place everybody would have been better off nobody though had taught them the first thing about how to engineer human beings and they werent good at it this damn lieutenant was a case in point he screamed at cincinnatus and the rest of the negroes doing stevedore work on the docks from the minute they got there to the minute they left and he didnt just hate negroes whenever he had to deal with the white southerner he was every bit as bad when the owner of a livery stable complained about having had some horses requisitioned without getting paid for them the lieutenant told him what you need isnt money or horses its the horsewhip nothing else but you damned traitor youre dealing with the united states of america now not your rebel government youd better walk small or youll be sorry were back now and were going to stay and if you dont like it you can jump in the river for all i care the livery stable man walked off if looks could have killed the lieutenant would have been the one in the ohio floating face down cincinnatus whispered to another black man working alongside him my mama always did say you catch mo flies with honey than with vinegar my mama say the same thing the other negro answered also in a low voice that buckra there though i bet he dont have no mama he dropped his voice even further an he sure dont know who his papa was cincinnatus laughed at that loud enough to make the lieutenant glare at him but he was working and working hard so the little man in the greengray uniform went off to shout at somebody else when sunset came the men on the docks lined up to get their pay armed guards stood around the paymaster to make sure nobody tried redistributing the wealth on his own name said the paymaster a middleaged white man with sergeants stripes on his sleeves agamemnon said the negro in front of cincinnatus the paymaster handed him a greengray us dollar bill covington was a border town so some of those bills along with us coins circulated here all the time now though the brown confederate banknotes were no longer legal tender in areas the united states controlled till that moment cincinnatus hadnt noticed how each sides paper money matched its army uniform name the paymaster asked him cincinnatus he answered no shaking his head the paymaster pointed across the ohio river cincinnati s over there he chuckled cincinnatus smiled back it wasnt the worst joke in the world even if he heard it at least once a week and the white sergeant didnt seem to have a chip on his shoulder the way most damnyankees did the fellow checked his name off on the list in front of him then handed him a dollar and a fiftycent piece lieutenant kennan says you get a hardwork bonus he does cincinnatus said amazed believe it or else buddy the paymaster said with an eyebrow raised in amusementmaybe he knew about lieutenant kennan instead of waving cincinnatus on he said ask you somethin yes sir go ahead cincinnatus said the fellow seemed friendly enoughand having a white man ask him permission for anything before going ahead and doing it was a novelty in and of itself all right the sergeant leaned back in his chair and put his hands behind his head fingers interlaced what i want to know is how come all you niggers down here carry such highfalutin names never hardly studied it cincinnatus said he did for a couple of seconds then answered reckon its on account of the law dont allow us no last namesmaybe they figure wed be good as white folks if we had em i dont know so we only have the one and we got to make the most of it makes as much sense as any other guess ive heard the paymaster allowed now he did wave cincinnatus on asking the next man in line name rehoboam the stevedore answered the paymaster chuckled and gave him his money with an extra four bits in his pocket cincinnatus spent a nickel of it for a ride home on the trolley which had been running for only a couple of days he went to the back of the car and stood there hanging onto a leather strap as it clattered along some seats in the forward white section were vacant but the us officials hadnt changed the rules and the us soldiers in the forward section were liable to beat up a black man who tried to sit among them hed heard that had already happened more than once the trolley rolled past the city hall the stars and stripes flew in front of it and on top of its dome to cincinnatus the us flag looked crowded and busy with too many stars and too many stripes the bleeding zebra southerners called it and he could see why plump prosperouslooking white gentlemen wearing homburgs and somber suits carrying fancy leather briefcases and smoking cigars strode in and out of the city hall as they had before the united states occupied covington some were us administrators some covington politicians licking the yankees boots and some maybe really did want to work with the usa kentucky was the only confederate state that hadnt left the union at the start of the war of secession braxton bragg had conquered it for richmond when lincoln pulled soldiers eastward to try to repair the disaster at camp hill up till the time of the second mexican war when us forces wrecked louisville a lot of kentuckians had had sympathy for the united states and sympathy or not kentucky had always done a hell of a lot of business with the usa along with the prosperous gentlemen a good many us soldiers held positions around the covington city hall machine guns protected by sandbags stood at either side of the entrance not everybody in covington sympathized with the damnyankees not by a long shot cincinnatus got out of the trolley not far from tom kennedys warehouse the lines did not run through the colored section of town standing still for the journey let him know how tired he was he walked south to his house with the stoopshouldered stiffjointed gait of an old man motion by the licking river caught his eye a bunch of yankee sailors in dark blue were swarming over the grounded burnedout hulk of the river monitor hed seen on the water that day just before the war broke out the monitor had taken a licking all right yankee shells had set it ablaze before it could do much damage now whatever bits of it that could be salvaged would be used against the confederacy the smell of fried chicken floating out through the windows made cincinnatus mouth water and straightened his back just thinking about biting into a hot juicy leg sent spit spurting into his mouth that better be done he called as he walked inside cause im gonna eat it whether it is or whether it aint smells as good as my mama makes be five ten minutes his wife elizabeth answered she waved to him from the kitchen then to his surprise his mother did too a heavyset woman of about fifty she beamed at him and elizabeth both my boy cincinnatus he has a good nose she declared that he does mother livia elizabeth said you were righthe could tell must be the spices what are you doin here mama cincinnatus asked not that i aint glad to see you but i came to help my daughterinlaw his mother said cincinnatus scratched his head his wife was as capable as she needed to be and then some and his mother had said as much ever since they were married elizabeth had got out of her blackandwhite housekeepers clothes and put on a shirtwaist too old and spotted to wear in public any more and a bright red cotton skirt that set off her light brown skinshe was two maybe three shades paler than cincinnatus youre home sooner than i reckoned on she said took the trolley he answered she frowned at the extravagance till he showed her not only the days usual greenback but the fortyfive cents he had left from his bonus that damnyankee strawboss lieutenant he sure hates niggers but he knows work when he sees it all right elizabeth said more grudgingly than hed expect i wish youd saved every penny butall right whats the matter he asked we aint broke one reason he loved elizabeth was that she was as dedicated to getting aheador as far ahead as negroes in the confederate states could getas he was even so worrying about a nickels worth of bonus seemed excessive then she set both hands on her belly about where the shirtwaist tucked into the skirt reckon we gonna have us a little one some time next spring a little one cincinnatus stared all at once he understood why his mother had come he hurried forward to embrace elizabeth thats wonderful and it was wonderful even if the timing could have been better but now he wished he hadnt spent that nickel the troop train rattled through lynchburg and west toward the blue ridge mountains if id known they were going to pack us into these cars like canned sardines reginald bartlett said feeling not just canned but cooked in his uniform and heavy kit i never would have volunteered ahh quit whinin said robert e mccorkle since mccorkle was a corporal his opinion carried considerable weight so did he his uniform could have held a couple of men of ordinary girth he went on you dont like it write your congressman i cant bartlett said cant raise my arms to write that put a smile on mccorkles face even noncommissioned officers responded to bartlett s charm a sure proof of its effectiveness the corporal said well you aint as bad as some here and thats the gospel truth some o these birds they even grouse in their sleep birds grouse reggie bartlett laughed but mccorkle failed to join him he didnt notice hed made a joke what were you supposed to do with such people burying them struck bartlett as a good idea but only for a moment a lot of young men were getting buried off in the direction they were going mccorkle said ahh what the hell anyway you turn out a bunch of soldiers who cant even complain when they feel like it they might as well come from the united states or germany somebody said from behind the corporal yeah or germany mccorkle allowed but its different with the huns if its got buttons on its coat they salute it the soldiers in the united states once upon a time they was americans same as you an me not any more its all the damn foreign riffraff they let in you ask me ahead the bulk of the blue ridge notched the skyline the sun was going down in fire above the mountains the troop train rolled over an iron bridge spanning the otter river less than half an hour later it went through bedford court house in the twilight bartlett saw street lamps going up into the hills at whose feet the town lay night fell the troop train kept on traveling its pace slowed as it climbed some of the peaks of the blue ridge rose well over four thousand feet not so much out west in the united states or the csa but more than respectable hereabouts the tracks went through the passes not over the peaks of course but still rose considerably in a short stretch of time reginald bartlett made himself as comfortable as he could considering all the gear with which he was festooned that wasnt very comfortable but at least he had a seat on a hard secondclass bench the aisles were full of men whod been standing since they left richmond and who were trying to squat or lie down so they could try to get a little sleep that didnt come easy for them or for him his pack dug into his spine if he let his head flop backwards it went over the back of the seat and made him feel his neck was breaking if he leaned forward he hit himself in the forehead with the rifle he held between his knees the men on either side of him kept poking him with their elbows and neither of them by all the evidence had ever heard of soap and wateror maybe bartlett was just smelling himself this whole business of war is a lot more entertaining to read about than to be a part of he complained all the writers who go on about the revolution and the secession and the second mexican war leave out the parts that have no glory in them and when they do talk about glory theyre talking about the fellows who lived corporal mccorkle added the poor bastards who died yeah they wave goodbye to them you might say but thats all bartlett didnt want to think about that and wished hed kept his mouth shut the confederacy was mowing down damnyankees the way a steampowered threshing machine mowed down wheat at harvest time all the papers said so and so did every military briefing bartlett had heard since hed showed up at the recruiting office but the papers also printed hideously long casualty lists every day and the maps showed that most of the fighting was on confederate soil things werent so easy as hed thought they would be when he joined up just when he finally managed to doze off the troop transport started down the grade on the western slope of the blue ridge mountains couplings bumped and joltedthe weight of the train had shifted from the back end to the front bartlett jerked bolt upright his start woke the soldier next to him who cursed foully hed heard more blasphemy and obscenity in a few weeks of soldiering than he had in all his civilian lifebut he remembered that from a few years before when his birth class had been conscripted iron wheels screamed on iron rails as the train slowed to a stop this here must be vinton mccorkle said this is where we get out bartlett peered through the window he couldnt see anything if they were at a station it was news to him the doors at either end of the railroad car opened though and his companions stumbled out into the night when his turn came he went too this way this way this way captain dudley wilcox shouted waving around an electric torch so his men could see which way this way was bartlett was glad to be reminded the company commander existed hed neither seen nor heard him since the troop train pulled out of richmond captain wilcox led them down a path full of pungent horse manure to a field where campfires were already burning well bivouac here tonight he declared bedrolls onlyno tents get what rest you cantomorrow we go into action as bartlett spread his blanket on the ground and wrapped himself in it a mutter of distant thunder came from the west he looked up into the sky the stars of early autumn twinkled down on him the trees would be changing color though he couldnt see that in the darkness the thunder came again only it wasnt thunder it was artillery somewhere over there gunners were launching shells into the darkand when those shells came down they probably killed people that didnt strike bartlett as glorious he was too tired to care he fell asleep almost at once corporal mccorkle woke him with a boot in the seat of the pants it was still dark he sat up stiff from lying on the ground and feeling he needed another two or three or six hours of sleep to turn himself into a properly functioning human being he rolled up the blanket and put it away no more sleep today listen here you birds captain wilcox sounded indecently alert and indecently cheerful for whatever the hour was the damnyankees want to take big lick away from us take away the mines take away the railroad junction theres so damn many of em theyve made it over the alleghenies and theyre coming down toward the city thats why were hereto keep em from taking it the companythe regimentthe divisionwe all go across the roanoke at ten this morning and we drive the yankees back into the mountains sooner or later we drive em out of virginia any questions i know youll fight hard well get us some breakfast and then well get us some damnyankees negro cooks passed out cornmeal muffins and bacon bartlett wolfed his down he filled the screwon cup that doubled as a canteen lid with chicorylaced coffee it made him feel more nearly alive he was gulping a second cup when the artillery barrage opened up the noise was brutal appalling overwhelming he loved every second of it more of that racket there is he shouted to anyone who would listen more damnyankees the devils dragging down to hell the fewer of em there are left up here to shoot at me amen to that said one of his squad mates a skinny bespectacled fellow named clarence randolph hed been a preacher before the war started and could have joined the army as a chaplain but he hadnt wanted to be a noncombatant if he wasnt the best shot in the company bartlett didnt know who was captain wilcox blew a whistle its shrill screech cut through the roar of the barrage and the occasional blasts from shells the us gunners threw back in reply lets go wilcox said waving his arm along with the rest of the regiment along with the rest of the division the company moved forward under cover of darkness confederate engineers and colored laborers had run pontoon bridges across the roanoke the planks theyd laid over the pontoons rumbled under bartlett s feet he wanted to get across before day broke enough to give the fellows who manned the yankees cannon a good shot at the improvised bridges horses snorted in a field as he marched past the shadows in that field were centaur like we punch the hole in the yankee lines corporal mccorkle said gladly then the cavalry rides through gets into their rear and chases em to hell and gone good place for em clarence randolph said i am a man brimming over with christian charity but i dont believe in wasting it on damnyankees as light gained on darkness bartlett saw how barrages by both sides had chewed the land to ruins the confederacy still held about half the valley between the alleghenies and the river the stars and bars floated over big lick a couple of miles to the south but nobody was working the mines these days a shell fell short and landed among a knot of soldiers off to bartlett s left some of the screams that rose from them were those of injured men others of sheer fury at wounds inflicted by friend rather than foe come on up a corporal in a grimy uniform waved captain wilcoxs company into the firing pits and connecting trenches that made up the confederate line come on up new fish come on up the soldiers already in line greeted the newcomers with nasty grins and even nastier questions does your mother know youre here ever see guts all over everywhere how loud can you scream new fish no dont bother answerinyoull find out their looks shocked bartlett it wasnt just that their uniforms and persons were filthy though that was what he noticed first the look in their eyes said more theyd seen things he hadnt some of themthe ones who took obvious delight in those questionsknew a malicious glee that he and his comrades were about to see those things too some gave good advice you go forward stay low zigzag a lotdont let em draw a bead on you get down on your belly and crawl like a snake bartlett wanted to see what the bombardment was doing to the yankee lines but when somebody stuck his head over the front edge of a firing pit he slumped down dead a moment later a bullet in his forehead just above the right eye the back of his head blown out one of the men whod been in the line for a while shoved the body out of the path the newcomers were taking as if it were an inconvenient log gulping bartlett stepped past the corpse he decided he wasnt curious any more here and there among the firing pits steps made of dirt and sandbags led up to the ground ahead the company halted by some of those steps when the barrage stops we go captain wilcox said maybe the barrage would go on forever maybe the artillery would kill all the damnyankees and leave nothing for the infantry to do maybe staying behind a pharmacy counter back in richmond hadnt been such a bad thing maybe bartlett should have waited for his old regiment to be called up instead of volunteering in a new one maybe as suddenly as it had begun the barrage stopped captain wilcox blew that damned whistle again bartlett wished hed lose it or better yet swallow it soldiers started surging up over the steps somebody gave bartlett a shove he stumbled forward his feet hit the first step and climbed all by themselves regardless of what his mind was telling them then he was up on level if battered ground he ran toward the even more battered firing pits and trenches ahead he could hardly see them because of all the smoke and dust the barrage had kicked up men in butternut trotted ahead of him alongside him behind him he was part of the thundering herd as long as he did what everyone else did hed be all right a little more than a quarter of a milesurely less than half a mileand what had been yankee lines would belong to the confederacy once more through the smoke of dust the fog of war he thought with the small part of his mind that was thinkingevil yellow lights began winking and flashing the bombardment hadnt killed all the us soldiers then men started falling some crawled ahead some thrashed and twisted and screamed some didnt move bartlett leaned forward as if into a gale he wasnt the only one lots of the soldiers still on their feet had that forward lean as if bracing against a bullets anticipated impact then rifles and machine guns he turned to tell clarence randolph that machine guns were satanic tools but clarence wasnt there wasnt anywhere nearbyhad in fact taken only a few steps before a bullet tore out his throat but bartlett didnt know that tearing at them they struggled through the yankee wire and screeching threw themselves at the men in greengray who had invaded their nation there were too many confederate soldiers and too few yankees and those too shaken by the barrage to fight as well as they might have bartlett leaped down into a firing pit and pointed his rifle at an enemy the man dropped his weapon and threw his hands in the air bartlett almost shot him anyhowhis blood was upbut checked himself gesturing brusquely with the bayoneted muzzle of his tredegar over that way the us soldier went a grin of doglike submission on his face come on captain wilcox shouted spread out and move forward theyll counterattack as soon as they can we want to take back as much ground as were able then hold it against anything they can do to us maybe the damnyankees had had trenches leading up into their forward positions as had been true in the confederate lines if they had the confederate bombardment had destroyed them going deeper into the usheld territory was a matter of scrambling from one shell hole to the next enemy fire picked up all the time there next to bartlett was corporal mccorkle wide as he was hed kept up with the assault and hadnt stopped a bullet turning to him bartlett said arent you glad weve won this land back for our dear country he waved cautiously so as not to expose his arm to a bulletat the shellpocked desolation all around mccorkle stared then started to laugh the postman came to the coffeehouse delivered a couple of advertising circulars and went on his way nellie semphroch glanced at the circulars she didnt throw them away as she might have before the war crumpled up the papers would make good kindling edna semphroch came to the doorway to stand beside her mother she looked after the postman who was going on down the street whistling some new ragtime tune nellie didnt recognize doesnt seem right to see old henry coming around every day same as he did before the rebs jumped on us edna said well he does only come once a day now instead of twice nellie said but yes i know what you mean hesnormaland everything else has gone straight to the devil hasnt it nellie had only to look at her own shop to see the truth of that the front window blown out in the earliest confederate bombardment of washington dc was covered over with boards and she was glad she had those you couldnt get glass for love nor money literally one glazier shed talked to had said i had a lady offer me an indecent proposal if id get her windows repaired the fellow had chuckled had to turn her downcouldnt find the goods for her any which way nellie didnt know whether to believe him or to think he was trying to trick her into making an indecent proposal in exchange for glass men were like that if he was it hadnt worked so many places were boarded up these days nellie didnt feel either embarrassed or at a competitive disadvantage for being without glass she looked up and down the block not a shop far as the eye could see still kept its original glazing some buildings were rubble theyd taken direct hits from shellfire some werent boarded up but looked out on the street with empty window frames like the eye sockets of a skull their owners had fled washington before the rebs crossed the potomac bumsand people who wouldnt have been bums had their homes and businesses not been wrecked sheltered in them and sometimes came out to beg or steal nellie thanked heaven she wasnt living like that rubble had been pounded down into the holes confederate shells had torn in the street us prisoners had done that under the eyes and guns of laughing rebel guards it had rained several times since the bombardment but some of the bloodstains brown and faded now were still all too plain to the eye the rebs are having themselves a fine old time here nellie said to edna in a low voice you had to use a low voice if you called them rebs theyd tolerate rebels but preferred confederates or eventravestyamericans her daughter nodded far as theyre concerned it might as well be their capital she bared her teeth in what someone who didnt know her might have taken for a friendly smile from behind the two women a southern voice called another cup here ifyalldbesokind nellie put a smile on her own face as she walked back into her coffeehouse it was akin but not identical to the grimace edna had worn a moment before the smile any business person gives a customer a smile aimed at the billfold rather than the person who was carrying it yes sir she said you were drinking the blend from the dutch east indies werent you thats right the confederate major nodded he wore the tight high boots and yellow uniform trim of a cavalry officer mighty fine it is too maamsmooth as ive ever drunk im glad you like it nellie refilled the cup from one of the pots behind the counter not all the cups matched any moreshed foraged from here and there and everywhere to replace the ones broken in the fighting enjoy it while you canwhen its gone heaven knows how ill be able to get more lifes going to be hard for a while i reckon the major agreed he took the cup then added cream and sugar and a splash from a little tin flask he wore on his belt right smooth he said with a smile as he drank he looked from nellie to edna and back again would you let me buy either of you charming ladies or the two of you together a cup while you still have it to enjoy edna looked as if she might have said yes to that the cavalry major was personable enough even handsome in a florid way but nellie answered before her daughter could no thank you wed best save it for the customers cant afford to drink up our own stock in trade however you like the officer said with a shrug there were a lot of confederate cavalrymen in washington when they went closer to the front they had a way of getting killed in a hurry their own comrades in the infantry and artillery ragged them about it the coffeehouse had seen a couple of fights confederate military police swung billy clubs with the same reckless abandon washington city constables had used after draining his augmented cup of coffee the cavalry major got up took a wallet out of a hip pocket and pulled out a dollar of confederate scrip i dont need any change he said and walked out the door of course you dont nellie muttered when he was gone its like play money to you the scrip the confederates had instituted for washington and for the chunks of maryland and pennsylvania theyd taken from the united states the dollar note the major had set down bore the picture of john c calhounwas nominally at par with the us and confederate dollars but confederate soldiers could buy occupation scrip for twenty cents of real money on the dollar they spent freelywho wouldnt with a deal like thatwhich drove down the value of the scrip prices were going up anyway so much scrip in circulation just made them go up faster nellie walked out to the doorway across the street mr jacobs cobblers shop had a sign tacked to the boards covering what had been his window discount for silver if the rebs didnt make him take that sign down it struck nellie as a good idea if you fixed the discount as you should youd make money whether you got scrip or cash and jacobs was doing a terrific business you could get leather locally it wasnt like coffee marching wore down boots too so confederate soldiers were always going into the shop hed even had a general make use of his services said worthy having arrived in a motorcar driven by a colored chauffeur with a face of such perfect insolence it seemed to be aching for a slap quietlyfor there were still a couple of confederate cavalry lieutenants in the coffeehouse hashing out on the table the breakthrough that hadnt yet come and god willing never wouldedna said ma i wish there was something we could do to give the johnny rebs a hard time im not going to put rat poison in the coffee though ive thought about it a couple of times nellie answered maybe we ought to send them to the sporting house around the corner edna said if they get a dose of the clap they cant very well fight can they her smile was wide and unpleasant nellies ears got hot what is the younger generation coming to she exclaimed the cry of the older generation throughout recorded history radicalism and rebellion and free love shed been seduced at the age of fifteen and knew more than she wanted of sporting houses but conveniently chose not to remember that smiling still edna said if they go to the sporting house ma love wouldnt be free they dont take scrip there neither i hear tell where do you hear tell such things nellie demanded edna was with her almost all day almost every day but you couldnt keep an eye on somebody all the time not unless you were a jailer you couldnt before her daughter answered mr jacobs came out of his shop along with a confederate soldier carrying a pair of cavalry boots the cavalryman went on his way jacobs called lovely day isnt it widow semphroch miss semphroch yes it is edna said in lieu of replying to her mothers question no it isnt nellie declared the cobbler laughed at their confusion dowling as usual george custer made too much noise the shout would have drawn his adjutant from the next county not just the next room coming sir abner dowling said also loudly the better to overcome the commanding generals deafnesswhich of course the commanding general denied he had custer stabbed a nicotinestained forefinger down at the map on the table before which he stood major i am not satisfied with our progress not satisfied at all im sorry to hear that general dowling said taking a discreet half step backwards custers breath alone was plenty to get you lit up i think weve made excellent progress sir he wasnt lying there not even a little bit the crossing of the ohio had gone better than hed expectedmuch better than hed expected considering that custer was in charge of it facing simultaneous thrusts aimed at louisville and covington the confederates hadnt been able to put enough men into kentucky to defend all of it that first army headquarters was in marion these days proved the point well i dont dammit custer bellowed which made dowling draw back another half a pace both from volume and from fumes look at the map you overfed twit second and third armies are going to break into the bluegrass country long before we do our advance has hurt the rebs a lot already dowling said stoutly refusing to take offense at the generals gibe why weve deprived them of all the fluorspar mines here around marion and fluorspar custer sneered fluorstinkingspar teddy roosevelt will be thrilled to get a telegram telling him weve captured a whole great pile of fluorgoddamnspar now wont he hell send me to command in canada because of fluorspar wont he oh yes hell be delightedno doubt about it even by custers standards the sarcasm was venomous the greatest horse country in the world just ahead of us and youre babbling about fluorfuckingspar god preserve me from idiots but dowling gave up if you were going to make steel by any modern process you needed fluorspar and you needed it in multiton lots but custer had been a cavalry general back in the days when cavalry was good for something more than getting mowed down by machine guns and so horses were all he thought about that hes a horses ass doesnt hurt either dowling thought he usually tried to keep from thinking disloyal thoughts but that wasnt easy when custer rode him on account of his size the general said i want to put paid to the confederate cavalry once and for all yes sir i understand that dowling said doing his best to get across the idea that custer might better use his men in another way without coming right out and screaming in the famous generals wrinkled sagging face he also understood that custer wanted to accomplish something so spectacular teddy roosevelt would have no choice but to give him the command he truly craved if custer held his breath waiting for that hed be even redder in the face than he was already i should hope you do custer declared cavalrys done a lot of good work in this war especially on the far side of the mississippi yes sir dowling said again now in resignation try as you would sometimes you couldnt win custer was going to go after cavalry horses and that was all there was to it never mind that the rebs west of the mississippi drew their mounts from local stock never mind that the reason cavalry could be dashing and bold out west was that there were miles and miles of miles and miles out there and not enough soldiers yankee or confederate to keep raiders from breaking through every so often never mind that two other armies were already advancing on the bluegrass country never mind any of that custer wanted his glory and by jingo he was going to get it he said well push east past madisonville and break through there the confederates cant keep throwing up lines against us indefinitely sooner or later the losses theyre suffering will force them to recognize theyve met their match and then some in me he struck a triumphal pose that put his adjutant in mind of a plasterofparis statue made by a bad artist having a worse day our own losses have also been heavy sir said dowling whose job after all involved keeping some tenuous connection between custer and military reality defending prepared lines is cheaper than storming them that was especially true because custer didntwouldntallow enough time for proper artillery bombardment before he sent the poor damned infantry forward kentucky wasnt like the country west of the mississippi here the confederacy had plenty of negroes to build works and plenty of white men in butternut to man them that was one of the reasons cavalry here didnt count for much also sir if we concentrate our main thrust along an eastwest line we cant take proper precautions against the confederate buildup weve been watching between hopkinsville and cadiz southeast of here if they take us in flank well be as embarrassed as our german friends were on the marne a few weeks ago fiddlesticks custer retorted i dont believe the rebs can muster the sort of force theyd need to shift us nor anything close to it theyre too heavily committed here and on too many other fronts we have the initiative major and we shall retain it but sir dowling had to protest he went through the papers in custers inbasket sure enough there were the reconnaissance reports hed stamped urgent in crimson ink and sure enough custer hadnt looked at any of them these scouting reports from our aeroplane pilots clearly show that those pilots are a pack of nervous nellies general custer broke in he seemed pleased with the phrase so he repeated it a pack of nervous nellies yes indeed you ask me major what they call reconnaissance is greatly overrated anyhow but sir dowling repeated himself too before continuing back in st louis you were complaining you werent getting the reconnaissance you needed from kentucky a foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds custer quoted grandly now let me tell you what reconnaissance can be worth back more than forty years ago now this damned ragged indian scout looked at the ground and told me all the indians in the worldor in kansas anyhow were camped along the ninnescah down near the border with sequoyah indian territory it was then do you know what i ordered major do you know the whole country knows sir dowling answered unhappily yes but do you custer glowered at him i ordered the charge major thats what i did we sent a raft of redskins to the happy hunting grounds by suppertime and hardly let a one get back to the confederate side of the border he struck his splendid pose once more and no one has missed them from that day to this now i am going to order the charge again if the enemy is there you must strike him the confederates are better soldiers than those red savages were im afraid sir dowling said theyre not good enough to withstand a stroke from the brave soldiers of the united states of america custer declared and i aim to give them one theyll never forget besides which as ive told you before aeroplanes are nothing but newfangled claptrap abner dowling had the feeling hed wandered into quicksand the more he tried to flail his way toward common sense the more deeply he got mired in custers prejudices which were as entrenched as any of the confederate works against which the general insisted on banging his head you couldnt just ignore a building flank attack could you then without warning bombs started falling on marion four or five sharp explosions one of them blew in custers office window dowling yelped when a flying shard cut his hand he couldnt hear the buzz of the aeroplane that had dropped the bomb it must have been flying as high as it could outside soldiers opened up on the aeroplane with their springfields and with a couple of machine guns their chances of bringing it down were about the same as those of taking on the steel trust in court and winning you see custer said triumphantly theyre only a nuisance and couldnt hurt a fly clutching his injured hand dowling reflected that he was obviously worth less than a fly to his commander well that wasnt anything he hadnt already known later he found out one of the bombs had fallen in the midst of a knot of soldiers killing five of them as well as an unfortunate local negro who was cooking for them and maiming another three but that was later at the moment he said we do have an urgent request for reinforcements on the southeastern part of our line wouldnt it be prudent to no and quit pestering me about it custer shouted his pouchy sagging features turned quite red we didnt start to fight this war to stand on the defensive major god damn it to hell we came to do to the rebs what they did to us fifty years ago to knock em down and to kick em in the balls when they are down we attack yes sir dowling said miserably flora hamburger stepped out onto the fire escape to get away she wasnt trying to escape the heat trapped inside the flat she shared with her parents an older sister a younger sister and two younger brothers escaping the heat was what you did in summer and here with october heading toward november you were likelier to throw on a sweater or a coat although she hadnt bothered doing that she wasnt going out to escape the noise either her father and mother seldom spoke to each other or to their children at anything less than a shout and her brothers and sisters werent the quietest people god ever made flora wasnt one of those people either and she knew it but going out onto the iron floor of the fire escape didnt make the noise disappear what her family lost in volume the rest of new york gained it was getting dark outside but boys still played and screeched in the street below i got you you lousy reb one of them yelled in yiddish in a high piercing voice youre dead so fall over you missed me by a mile another boy called back this one in english even more shrilly nyahnyahnyah couldnt hit a barn the first boy imitated a machine gun which set floras teeth on edge however many imaginary bullets he spat though he couldnt kill one real child in the real war unfortunately it didnt work like that every day the front page of the new york times screamed of battles won and battles lost every day bordered in black ran long lists of names men and boys who would never come home because of those battles won and lost more than anything else the blackbordered casualty lists were what had driven flora outside away from her family if the rest of new york cared it didnt let on along with the children playing babies howled from every second flat floras parents werent the only ones shouting folk of their generation yelled in yiddish or russian or polish or magyar or romanian folk of floras generation answered back when they answered back in all those languages and sometimes in english too sometimes getting an answer in english made parents yell even more because it seemed to mean their children were slipping away from them becoming american and sure enough their children were when flora didnt come back into the flat after a few minutes her older sister sophie stepped out onto the fire escape with her sophie was calm and steady and accepting all the things flora wasnt instead of being a socialist party agitator she sat in front of a sewing machine twelve hours a day six days a week turning linen and cotton into shirtwaists and lately into uniform tunics come back she urged now youre making mama upset you do this so often now its not normal im upset flora said does anyone care about that thousands of people are getting blown to bits every day does anyone care about that she pointed down to the street and across it to another crowded brownstone just like the one in which she and her family lived it doesnt look like it to me people dont want our soldiers to get killed in the war nobody wants that sophie said reasonably but we cant do anything about it life has to go on the way its supposed to this isnt the way its supposed to and it wont be the way its supposed to until we find a way to make the fighting stop flora insisted and all the capitalists are making money from the fighting so it can go on forever as far as theyre concerned if anyone goes against it it will have to be the members of the working classlike you for instance she stared defiantly at sophie sophie sighed she wasnot surprisingly given the hours she worked exhausted when she came home and every bit of that weariness showed in her voice flora i dont need you to agitate for me here she said had she been more like her sister she would have grown furious i hear plenty from the socialist recruiters every day at the shop you hear but you dont listen flora exclaimed however you like sophie answered but ill tell you this much the agitation sounds a lot more foolish than it would if the socialists hadnt voted for the war credits it takes a lot of chutzpah she had been speaking english but let the yiddish word find a placeto say yes to something out of one side of your mouth and no from the other flora bit her lip youre right about that and i wish we hadnt but i think all the congressmen thought this would be a sharp short war doesnt look that way any more does it she stamped her foot as much to listen to and to feel the clatter of the cast iron as for any other reason and once weve voted yes once how can we vote no after that without looking like without beingeven worse hypocrites before sophie could reply her mother stuck her head out onto the fire escape and said yossel is here to see you oh good sophie said and smiling went back inside sarah hamburger glanced over to her middle daughter flora youll say hello to your sisters fiance i hope all right flora said resignedly she did not dislike yossel reisen even if he was a reactionaryor maybe just an anachronism here in new york in the twentieth century as progressive an era and as progressive a city as had existed in the history of the world he could find nothing better to do with his life than to study torah and talmud he might make a rabbi one day but even if he did sophie would likelier end up supporting him than the other way round but sophie was happy so flora for the sake of family peace kept her opinions there to herself when she stepped back into the flat sophie and yossel were sitting side by side on the divan couch against the far wall of the front room yossel a tall pale thin fellow whose rusty beard obscured half the high collar on his shirt was saying i have some news i should tell you he spoke yiddish with a hissing litvak accent every sh sound turned into an s what is it sophie asked a beat ahead of her younger sister esther and her brothers david and isaac her mother and father didnt blurt out the question but they plainly wanted to know too yossel took a deep breath his fingers plucked at the green tufted plush upholstery of the divan he knew such furniture well he must have slept on a dozen lounges and couches and davenports boarding now with this family now with that one while he pursued his studies he never had much money to pay anyone which was why he moved frequently he needed a second deep breath before he could come out with his news i have volunteered for the army of the united states i am going into the service in one weeks time why did you do that sophie exclaimed her placid face suddenly full of harsh lines of pain why yossel why when they didnt call you up as soon as the war started i thought she didnt go on what she meant to say was probably something like i thought we could be married and go on with our lives as if the world werent coming to pieces around us but the world was always there no matter how much you tried to pretend it wasnt if you didnt look at things from an economic perspective good luck said david hamburger who was seventeen and was raising a downy mustache that made him look younger rather than older get lots of rebs or canuckswherever they send you said isaac who was two years younger neither of them was yet eligible for conscription as with a lot of young men too they still thought of war as adventure the blackbordered casualty lists meant nothing to them yossel answered sophie not them i volunteered to help the united states get back what they lost what they had taken away from them i volunteered because the confederates and the english and the french deserve to be put down for what they have done to usand because they are all allies of the russians no lithuanian jew was likely to think kind thoughts of czar nicholas and his regime youve fallen victim to the capitalists propaganda flora exclaimed everyone turned to look at her dont you see she said workers get nothing from this war nothing but suffering and death the ones who make the money are the factory owners and the munitions merchants dont listen to their lies yossel i am in the united states yossel said stiffly now i can be of the united states too this is my country i will fight for it and now even if i wanted to i could not withdraw my enlistment but i do not want to sophie started to cry so did her mother after a moment so did esther isaac and david both shouted angrily at flora her father benjamin hamburger stood silent puffing on his pipe he didnt usually vote socialist but he came closer than the rest of the family to sympathizing with the partys goals yossel went back to explaining why hed enlisted but no one save possibly floras father was listening to him flora desperate to get away wished shed stayed out on the fire escape no one heeded her warnings no one wouldtill too late she feared vi a long with the rest of captain lincolns command corporal stephen ramsay rode out of jennings sequoyah on horseback to repel us raiders wouldnt think the damnyankeesd get the idea so quick he said mournfully it had rained the night before and the horses were kicking up a lot of mud everybody would be filthy by the time the company got back into jennings everybody who was alive lincoln said theyre moneygrubbing bastards the yankees a chance to grab the oil south of the cimarron d look good to em then they can ship it over to the huns to burn belgian babies with good luck to anybody shippin anything on the atlantic ramsay said best i can tell its like a cavalry campaign a whole ocean wide lincoln chuckled at that though ramsay had meant it seriously warships and liners and freighters and submarines from the csa and the usa and england and france and germany were scurrying all over the ocean and shooting at one another whenever they knocked heads ramsay added this here is better country for fightin than the regular prairie or the ocean if we cant hold the yanks the far side of the river we aint gonna hold em anywheres im not going to tell you youre wrong corporal captain lincoln said the territory between the cimarron and the arkansas which came together about twenty miles east of jennings was rough and rugged wooded hills and gullies took over for prairie there were caves in the hills if you knew where to find them outlaws and robbers had infested the area for years because just about all the people who could find them after theyd fled from their crimes were either friends or relations one other thing ramsay said they aint gonna get one o those armored automobiles through here you try and run a motorcar in this kind of landscape and itll fall to pieces before youve gone ten miles damn good thing too the company commander said to which ram say could only nod a lot of the men with them in the company were new recruits confederate raids into kansas hadnt lasted long the damnyankees had the initiative now pushing down into sequoyah and threatening the oil fields that gave the confederacy so much of its petroleum the us troopers were not better soldiers than their confederate counterparts anyone who claimed they were would have got himself pounded by any cavalryman in butternut who happened to hear but what ramsay and lincoln had feared from the time of their first encounter was a reality the us cavalry usually advanced with armored cars bolstering the horsemen confederate armored automobiles by contrast were often promised seldom seen in open country protected mobile machine guns were deadly all out of proportion to their numbers ramsay chuckled reminiscently as an exception to that rule came to mind remember when we had that battery of field artillery with us up near the border with the yankees we made em pay that day by jesus sure did captain lincoln agreed sure do pretty damn fine to have guns to outrange those damn carsand to blow one of em to hell and gone when you hit it yes sir ramsay said enthusiastically the quickfiring threeinch field guns had hit two armored cars setting them ablaze and making their fellows scuttle on back toward kansas theyd also started a grass fire that had slowed up the advance of the us horsemen who werent nearly so eager to go forward without their mechanical buddies anyhow but there werent enough batteries of field artillery to go around and the yankees kept coming even if they werent very good at what they did enough mediocre soldiers were eventually liable to wear down a smaller force of good ones and now parts of sequoyah lay in us hands ramsays horse stumbled what passed for roads here in these badlands were pretty miserable even when they were dry when they were wet puddles disguised potholes deep enough to break an animals legsometimes it seemed deep enough to drown an animal he sharply jerked the horses head up the beast let out an indignant squeal of complaint but it didnt fall ramsay knew everything there was to know about complaininghe was a soldier after all hed heard better from men and horses the damp muddy road wound round the edge of some barebranched scrub oaks and opened out into a valley wider than most a couple of farms took up most of the horizontal land and some that wasnt the sheep grazing on a hillside would have done better if their right legs had been shorter than their left smoke curled up from the chimneys of both wooden farmhouses cabins might have been a better word for them a woman wearing a kerchief a mans flannel shirt and a long calico dress was tossing corn to some scrawny chickens between one farmhouse and the barn as the cavalry company drew nearer ramsay saw she was a halfbreed or maybe a fullblooded indian sequoyah held more indians than the rest of the confederacy put together and had even elected a couple of indian congressmen and a senator seeing soldiers approaching the woman grabbed a shotgun that was leaning up against a stump it wouldnt have done her much good not against a cavalry company but ramsay admired her spirit after a moment the woman lowered the barrel of the shotgun though she didnt let go of it youre confederates aint you she said her words not just uneducated but also flavored with an odd accent she was indian sure enough yes were confederates captain lincoln answered gravely brushing the brim of his hat with a forefinger he pointed to the flag the standard bearer carried see for yourself maam the woman peered at it peered at him and then nodded she turned the barrel of the shotgun away from the troopers using it to point north and west yankees in them woods leastways they was there last night seen their fires dont know how manylessn you reckon go over there and kill em her vehemence made little chills run up ramsays back one thing you could rely on the indians in the state of sequoyah were loyal to richmond the government of the united states had made them pack up and leave their original homelands back east for this country since the war of secession though the confederacy had treated them with forbearance and that was paying off now whereabouts exactly were they captain lincoln asked getting down off his horse and standing beside the woman a chicken walked over and pecked at the brass buckle of his bootmaybe the stupid bird thought it was a grain of corn the woman pointed again halfway up this here side of that hillyou see it aint seen em move out since maybe they still there ramsay doubted that but you never could tell maybe theyd decided to wait out the bad weathereven though it wasnt raining nowor maybe they were waiting for reinforcements to come up before they started pushing south again any which way the company would have to ride on up there and find out what was going on captain lincoln touched his hat again thank you maam dont want to ride into trouble blind you know you just keep them damnyankees from tramplin our garden and stealin our critters the woman said as if such petty thievery were the only reason us soldiers were in sequoyah now she probably thought that ramsay wondered if shed been off this farm since she was married as if the thought had gone straight from his head to captain lincolns the company commanders voice suddenly got hard and suspicious as he demanded wheres your husband at the farm woman spat right between his feet where the hell you think hes at she snapped he got drug into the army and i jus hope to jesus he come home again sorry maam lincoln said colour rising in his face a couple of the troopers snickered one of them was in ramsays squad hed rake parker over the coals later on couldnt let discipline go to pot the captain was saying hope he comes home too hope we all do when this war is over he swung back up into the saddle and waved to the company lets go find those damnyankees they rode in loose order with plenty of scouts forward and more out on either flank this whole country was made for bushwhacking and then up ahead they heard a brisk crackle of gunfire somebody else done found em for us ramsay yelled now we go in there and clean em out as the confederates rode toward the shooting a machine gun started hammering away thats yankees all right lincoln said god knows the outlaws have plenty of rifles but they dont have any of those a winding little track led through the scrub oaks toward the fighting lincoln dismounted his men and sent them through the woods on foot using them like dragoons rather than true cavalry ramsay heartily approved galloping up that path was asking to be massacred before long the dismounted troopers ran into yankee pickets whoever was commanding the us forces was doing the same thing with them as lincoln was with the confederates they might have ridden to get to the fight but they were making it on foot they also seemed to be outnumbered and had to give ground again and again to keep from being outflanked and cut off what with the thick undergrowth you couldnt see much if anything moved you took a shot at it and when you moved people you couldnt spot shot at you getting a taste of what infantry did for a living ramsay discovered he didnt much care for it eventually the crew for the company machine gun managed to lug both it and its mount through the woods and started spraying the yankee positions with damn near as many bullets as the rest of the company put out all together ramsay waited for the us troopers to move their own maxim gun away from wherever theyd had it before and try to neutralize the confederate weapon but they didnt instead here and there among the oaks white flags started going up ease off you rebs somebody yelled you got us firing slowly died away all right yanks come out captain lincoln called the us troopers obeyed hands high over their heads nobody shot them down this wasnt like the skirmish up in kansas the one by the railroad track this one had been fair all the wayno armored automobiles to mess up the odds there were all told maybe twentyfive us soldiers their leader a fellow with a kaiser bill mustache that had lost a good deal of its waxed perfection wore the single silver bars of a first lieutenant we have some wounded back there he said pointing in the direction from which hed come well take care of them captain lincoln promised and told off a detachment to lead the yankee prisoners back toward the road a good haul stephen ramsay said standing up and emerging from cover well pick up that machine gun and as much ammunition as they have left for it and then somebodyll shoot it back at em till all the cartridges are gone captain lincoln gathered him up by eye come on corporal he said lets go see who we rescued there ramsay followed him through what had been the us position he was curious about that himself he hadnt known any other confederate cavalry was operating in this neck of the woods he didnt know everything there was to know though he would have been the firstwell maybe the secondto admit as much from out of some woods that looked impenetrable a voice called a sharp warning dont come no further we got you covered six different ways captain lincoln stopped so did ramsay right behind him who are you lincoln asked it hadnt sounded like a yankee holdout a hoarse laugh answered him aint none of your damn business who we are and who we aint the unseen man said you jus go on home captain we aint got a quarrel with you now even if mebbe we used to whats that supposed to mean ramsay muttered he hadnt meant anyone even lincoln to hear him but his ears were ringing from the fire fight and he spoke louder than hed intended means we wouldntve mixed it up with them damnyankees if we hadnt thought they was you outlaws captain lincoln exclaimed yeah and now we got a nice new maxim gun to play with too you want to come in after us you want to fight the usa fine leave us the hell alone what do we do sir ramsay asked i think we leave them the hell alone corporal lincoln said loudly were not the police and were not the sheriffs we owe these people one too they let us know where the yankees were and a machine guns too heavy to lug around to robberies he turned his back and started away nobody shot at him or at ramsay hell of a thing ramsay said when they were back among their comrades and then we could take em oh no doubt lincoln agreed but thats not our mission were having enough trouble with what is ramsay thought that over and decided the captain was right sam carsten wished he were someplace else hed had that feeling before but never so bad if he got noticed this is what i get for volunteering he muttered under his breath as the ugly freighter pulled away from kapalama basin around sand island and west over keehi lagoon toward the entrance to pearl harbor capn kidde could have told him as much hell kidde had told him as muchafter it was too late for him to do anything about it but the gunners mate hadnt been standing next to him when the captain of the dakota asked for volunteers for a dangerous mission and so his hand had shot up along with everybody elses he hadnt particularly expected to be picked but here he was off to the west the sound of big and mediumsized guns never let up all of oahu belonged to the united states navy and marinesall of it except one lump of rock and cement that made the us hold on everything else a hell of a lot less secure than it should have been smoke wreathed fort william rufus the fort everybody limey and yank alike called the concrete battleship why the devil did the damned english have to go and build a fort right there carsten said drive us crazy somebody next to him suggested it was as good an answer as any and better than most anybody in his right mind would have thought batteries on the mainland were plenty to keep pearl harbor safe the royal navy had to have been hearing voices when it built an artificial island to go with those mainland forts but since the mainland forts had fallen to the marines and the concrete battleship was still very much a going concern maybe the english hadnt been so stupid after all the twelveinch guns in the forts two turrets had sunk a cruiser and a couple of destroyers and damaged two battleships to boot until it was reduced the pacific fleet couldnt use pearl harbor for an anchorage if the british sortied from singapore either alone or with the japs from manila there was liable to be hell to pay but how were you supposed to take a fort you couldnt wreck pounding by naval guns had chipped and pitted the steelreinforced concrete that made up so much of the superstructure but no shells had been lucky enough to land right on top of a turret admiral dewey had offered the forts garrison full military honors if they surrendered scuttlebutt was hed even offered them safe passage to anywhere they wanted to go in british or confederate territory whatever hed offered theyd said no and so brute force and sweet reason having failed the navy was trying something new sneakiness carsten didnt know which bright boy in glasses had come up with this scheme what he did know was that if it went wrong nobody would ever find enough pieces of him to bury the freighter rounded the headland and sped toward the stern of the concrete battleship the only gun it had ever had that could be brought to bear in that direction was a threeinch antiaircraft cannon which wasnt turret mounted the limeys werent going to use that one now the bombardment had long since wrecked it it was the only one in the plans anyhow what was hidden away in the depths of the fort was anybodys guess and one that made carsten want to run to the head but to keep the garrison too busy even to worry about what was sneaking up on them the navy was plastering the place again shells burst on it sending up smoke with a core of fire and all around it sending up great columns of water watching all that made carsten want to pucker too if one of those shells was badly aimed most of the navy ships were at extreme long range for good and cogent reasons the concrete battleship could still return fireand did with a salvo from one of its biggun turrets the noise of those two twelveinchers going off was like the end of the world closer and closer the freighter came carsten moved up to the bow with the rest of the navy files and marines carrying rifles at the bow was a boarding tower that looked like something out of sir walter scott or other tales of medieval adventure but considering that the roof of fort william rufus was forty feet above the waterline the boarding party was going to need help getting up there all at once the navy guns fell silent carsten approved of that a couple of shells had come closer to the freighter than to the concrete battleship the ship slid up to the stern or rear or whatever you wanted to call it of the fort making contact with a decided thump well if those bastards didnt know we were here they do now somebody close to carsten said that was undoubtedly true and did nothing to make him feel better about the world a couple of marines at the top of the boarding tower secured it to the broken concrete atop the fort they waved sailors and marines swarmed up the ladder fast as they could sam was somewhere near the middle of the rush his feet seemed to touch only every third rung then he was up on top himself running through rubble to make sure no limeys came out of their starboard sally port to interfere with what the americans were doing he got down behind a broken chunk of concrete and pointed his springfield in the direction from which the british would come if they were trying something he hoped to jesus they wouldntafter all what harm could a few american sailors with rifles do on top of a fortress that had defied every big gun the us navy owned here come the guys with the hoses a marine corporal yelled and sure enough here they came up over the boarding tower with hoses just like the ones the vulcan had used to fuel the dakota the concrete battleship had no fueling ports of course but it did have air vents and the combat engineers knew where they were they werent badly covered with broken concrete either the englishmen would have made sure of that somebody fired up through one of the vents an engineer howled and reeled backwards clutching his shoulder carsten seeing that plenty of people were covering the sally port ran over to the vent and shot down into it a couple of times he didnt know how much good he did he heard the bullets ricocheting off the metal of the air ducts hell with that sailor an uninjured combat engineer barked at him take clems place on the hose and hang on tight all right sam said agreeably at the rear edge of the concrete battleship somebody yelled let er rip down to the freighter the hose jerked in carstens arms like a live thing he did have to hang on tight to keep it from getting away a stream of thick black liquid gushed from the nozzle and poured down the vent twenty feet away another hose crew sent more of the stuff into the opening to a second ventilator shaft petroleum odors filled the air what the hell is this stuff carsten asked doing his best to breathe through his mouth two parts heavy diesel oil one part gasoline the combat engineer answered he let out a wry chuckle you dont want to go lookin for a match for a cigar right about now do you buddy now that you mention it no sam said the engineer laughed again good thinking real good thinking we got ten thousand gallons of this stinking shit on that freighter take us maybe ten minutes to pour it all down on the limeys heads good pumps sam observed damn good pumps its not like weve got time to waste up here the combat engineer said he and carsten held onto the hose till it suddenly went limp then he took a surprisingly small square box out of his pack and set it by the vent in spite of his warning to sam he did light a match and touch it to the fuse he looked up and grinned now we get the hell out of here is what we do yes sir carsten grabbed his rifle and ran for the boarding tower most of the boarding party was already off the concrete battleship a couple of engineers were still busy lighting more demolition charges here and there on the roof sam went down the boarding tower even faster than hed gone up it he wanted to get away from fort william rufus far away as fast as he could everybody off somebody yelled when no one denied it that same voice shouted all astern full the freighter backed away from the concrete battleship how long a delay did you put on those fuses carsten asked the combat engineer whod come down right behind him ten minutes the fellow answered cheerfully jesus carsten said and wished the freighter would go faster when theyd backed a few hundred yards shore batteries opened up on the concrete battleship to discourage the englishmen from heading up onto the roof if one of their shells fouls up our charges ill kill those sons of bitches with my own hands the engineer promised sam wasnt worrying about that he was still hoping the freighter could make something better than its current slow progress away from the concrete battleship how long had he taken to run across the battered but unpierced concrete roof how long had he needed to get down the boarding tower how much time had gone by since then and what would happen when that last thought had just gone through his mind when it happened fort william rufus went up in a titanic blast of fire and smoke that obscured the whole artificial island the shock wave from the explosion slapped the freighter like a barmaids hand across your face when you got fresh and she didnt like it heat hit sam as if hed stuck his head in front of an oven he hardly noticed he was watching an enormous slab of reinforced concrete fly high high high into the airhundreds of feet up there flung like the lid of a pot by a playful kid but this lid weighed tons uncounted beside him the combat engineer clapped his hands with glee we did know where the main powder magazine was he said happily i guess you did carsten agreed the ruined roof fell into the pacific with a splash bigger than a hundred twelveinch shells all hitting the same place at the same time i guess you did sam repeated fresh explosions tore at the concrete battleship we arent going to have any trouble getting in and out of pearl harbor not any more were not lucien galtier chased bits of rabbitandprune stew around his plate with knife and fork he ate some potato too then reached for a little glass of applejack that sat nearby hard times coming he said in a mournful voice it will be all right his wife marie said would you like more when he nodded she picked up his plate and handed it to nicole their oldest daughter get your father some more stew please yes mama certainly nicole said rising from the table and heading back into the kitchen lucien smiled to watch her go she reminded him of marie when theyd been courting small and dark and brisk and resolutely cheerful no wonder half the young men in the neighbourhood would come around on errands that didnt really need doing but he would not let nicole distract him from his worries hard times coming he said again and then went on before marie could answer wives now wives they look at things and they say it will be all right no matter what it is no matter how unlikely things are to be right ever again we face starvation nothing lessstarvation i tell you yes lucien of course marie said full of calm acceptance as nicole brought back his plate piled high with steaming stew and potatoes the plums that made the prunes had come from his own little orchard the potatoes were from his farm too so were the rabbits who had paid the penalty for being uninvited guests he knew how to make applejack but old marcel two farms away had a still going and did not charge outrageous prices so what was the point in cooking up his own he finished the glass savoring the warmth it put in his middle after hed methodically plowed through the second helping he said with the air of a man granting a great concession of course here on the farm it could be that times are not so hard as they are in the town i do not say it is mind you but it could be this i think is so marie replied in riviereduloup in st antonin in st modeste people cannot get along with what they are able to make so easily as can we who raise our own food and who can even make our own clothes at need she glanced from nicole to her other younger daughters susanne denise and jeanne in the attic stored away are a spinning wheel and the parts for a loom i have not brought them down and shown you what to do with them because till now there has been no need we have sewn with cloth bought from the store but my mother taught me as her mother taught her and i can teach you if we are able to get no more cloth as may happen the girls who ranged in age from jeannes seven to nicoles twenty all clamoured for marie to bring down the old tools and teach them how to make cloth marie sent lucien an amused glance he returned it saying see how bravely they take on new work i remember my mother making cloth too i do not recall her being so eager to do it though he hid pride in his daughters behind gruffness they want to find out something new lucien or something so old it seems new to them marie said that is not bad when it is no longer new to them it will no longer be exciting either no doubt you are right about that lucien looked at his two sons charles sixteen compact like marie and georges a couple of years younger but already bigger than his brother some people he said pointedly have no interest in work even when it is of a new sort that was unfair and he knew it both boys worked on the farm like draft horses predictably charles got angry about it most times lucien would have been glad to see him turn eighteen for the sake of the discipline with which he would have returned after two years conscription most times yes with a war on even more predictably georges turned it into a joke asking eh bien papathis laziness do you think we get it from you or from mama you get it from the devil you little wretch lucien exclaimed but then he had to cough a couple of times in lieu of laughing out loud the next thing georges took seriouslysave perhaps a leather strap well applied to his backside but he was getting too big for thatwould be the first outside the dogs began to bark a moment later came the sound of several men approaching the house some of them mounted others afoot the galtiers exchanged sudden glances of alarm so many neighbors would never come together not unannounced that meant americans and americans meant trouble sure enough in english rough as sandpaper one of the men out there said those hounds try and bite you stick em or shoot em the major he aint gonna give you no purple heart for a dog bite boys lucien realized he was the only one in the family who understood what the newcomers were saying his sons would have learned their english in the army when their time came his wife and daughters would have had few occasions ever even to hear it shall we fight papa charles demanded he wanted to at sixteen you knew you could do the impossible at fortythree you knew damn well you couldnt we have one rifle lucien said it is better for rabbits than for men they have many guns out there and can bring many soldiers here no we do not fight we do as they tell us when charles and even georges looked mutinous he added then we see what we can do afterwards to his relief that satisfied his sons they were too young to be killed in a hopeless fight it also had an element of truth that salved his own pride one of the americans rapped on the door the whole farmhouse shook he had to be using his rifle butt not a fist galtier opened the door the american a sergeant almost a head taller than he was checked a piece of paper and said galtier lucien it was not a question though the fellow mangled the pronunciation so badly that lucien needed a moment to understand his own name yes i am lucien galtier he said when he did he hated standing here with the door open he could feel cold air sliding past him into the house it wasnt as cold as it was going to be but it was a lot colder than it had been cold enough so you were glad of stove and fireplace good you speak english the us sergeant said then his eyes hard and pale narrowed round here that means you been in the army aint that right frenchy i have been in the army yes galtier said shrugging he paused to think of english words you find few men as old as i who are not in the army if they are not sick orhow do you say he mimed limping about crippled the american said yeah thats so i guess all right he looked down at luciens stocking feet get your shoes on frenchy were gonna have a look round your barn and your storehouses you dont wanna waste time he turned to a couple of his men and shouted gosse hendrick you go and start frenchy herell be along what is it you do here galtier asked as he pulled on first one boot then the other he was glad they stood by the door so he did not have to go away and let the sergeantand maybe his followerscome in to his family he called in french stay here i am attending to this the sergeant nodded thats smart pal dont want trouble he under stood french then even if he didnt deign to speak it he went on in ugly english requisition of supplies by order of the brigadier general commanding requisition lucien got on his other boot and stepped out into the night closing the door after him this means what he meant the question seriously he was trying to remember what the word meant before the sergeant could answer he did remember and stopped in his tracks this meansyou take you got it in one buddy the us soldier said you do not pay galtier went on well yes and no the sergeant said youll see how it goes a couple of soldierspresumably gosse and hendrickwere pawing over what lucien had spent a lifetime maintaining and adding to the farm having been in his family for generations one of them said sarge hes got enough here to keep the battalion in food all winter long yeah the sergeant said he turned around and shouted toward one of the mounted men whod come up to the farm blocksage ride back and tell the qm to send a truck out here no better make it two trucks plenty of goodies yes indeed the horse went trotting away galtier did not like the sound of any of that how is it you have the right to he began before he could finish the sergeant pointed his rifle at him this gives me the right pal he said were the ones who won the war remember now were supposed to treat you frenchies nice so youll get some compensation dont you worry about that but dont you go telling us what we can do and what we cant either youll be real sorry real fast if you understand what im saying you understand oh yes monsieur galtier said i understand wherever the quartermaster had set up his headquarters it wasnt far away within a few minutes a couple of trucks came wheezing and rattling up the dirt road before turning and approaching the farmhouse the looting began immediately thereafter they left lucien his horse they left him a cow and a few sheep and a pig they left him a handful of hens and his rooster they left him enough fodder to feed the animals he had left through the winterif it wasnt too long or too hard and he didnt feed them too much by the time they were done hauling away glass jars they left his family in the same shape as the livestock most of the food marie had laboriously preserved was gone along with lovingly smoked hams and flitches of bacon as food and fodder moved into the trucks the sergeant kept meticulous notes on everything that was taken when the sacking of the farm was complete he handed lucien a carbon copy of the list you want to take this in to riviereduloupfrom his mouth it came out rivyairdooloop to the commandants office theyll pay you off there they will pay me off galtier echoed dully he wished he had grabbed the little charles had wanted to get that way he could have died defending what was his instead of having to watch as he went from a prosperous farmer to a poor one in a couple of hours time he nodded to the sergeant you are sure this generosity will not cause them difficulties hed intended that for irony the sergeant took it literally which would have been funny in an absurd kind of way if he hadnt answered dont worry about that frenchy you aint gonna get more than twenty cents on the dollar and youll have to yell and scream and cuss to get that much galtier didnt yell or scream or swear no matter how much he wanted to he stood silent holding the copy of the list of supplies requisitioned from him as the big american soldiers finished their job started the trucks engines and left the infantry and horsemen went on to the next farm down the road they were noisily arguing about whether it would yield more or less than theyd got from him when they were all gone he went back into the house his family crowded round him thank god you are well marie said taking his hand in a public display of affection unlike any shed given him since they were newlyweds what have the boches americains done he told her and the children what theyd done hard times are here as i told you before he said even in dismay he recognized that he hadnt intended to be taken seriously before but now he did hard times marie echoed somberly he might have been wrong before he might have been joking before but no longer a string of the curses he hadnt aimed at the us soldiers burst from him cest chrisse maudit calisse de tabernac like any quebecois he cursed by reviling the symbols of his church englishspeakers ways of blowing off steam by talking about excrement and sex struck him as peculiar his family stared at him he hardly ever said such things where even his sons let alone his wife and daughters could hear him its all right marie said god will surely forgive you so we must as well lucien nodded gratefully to her she always found a way to make things right he said one thing more je me souviens i will remember without hesitation everyone nodded the train rolled westward toward new orleans as far as anne colleton could tell she was the only unattached white female under the age of sixty on the whole traincertainly in her car not many women were traveling at all soldiers in butternut and sailors in white took up most of the seats not all her money not all her influence had been able to get her a pullman berth for herself and her colored maidservant julia when she boarded the train she found out why the pullmans were full of military men too some of them with cots adding to their carrying capacity when set against the needs of war luxury was no longer practical luxury no longer seemed fashionable either that distressed anne what point to living if you couldnt live graciously with a cynicism older than her years but not older than her sex she suspected the powers that be would soon grow bored with their egalitarian pose these werent the united states after all class mattered in the confederacy especially looking down from the top pretending that wasnt so struck at the heart of the nations raison detre not that she wasnt the center of attention all the same she coolly took that for granted as much as she did julias presence beside her had the train been almost all women and only a handful of men instead of the other way round she would have been as confident of drawing those men to her looks told even president wilson responded to her smile so did breeding and she thought smoothing a pleat on the skirt of the cranberryred silk dress she was wearing so did money she toyed with the lace at her throat affecting not to notice that she was being watched ordinary soldiers and sailors eyed her without approaching they knew she was beyond them yes breeding and money told a couple of soldiers who stank of cheap whiskey tried to approach julia looking for nothing more than female flesh with which to slake their lusts anne colleton sent them on their way with a few lowvoiced words that left their ears red and tingling officers though officers were drawn to anne as moths were drawn to fires and like moths they drew back with their wings singed attracting men was great sport but most of the officers especially those from the navy and the cavalry and artillery were aristocrats with all the virtues of their class they were brave and loyal and randyand also its vicesthey were crashing bores or so anne found them when the porter announced that supper was being served she and julia went back to the dining car together a couple of tables at the rear were reserved for negroes commonly servants just as anne had not been able to get a pullman berth so she was not able to get a table for herself either the train was too full for that something like a football scrim developed among the officers in white and butternut to see who would get the other two seats at the corner table where she was sitting when the elbowing died away a couple of navy officers not far from her own age smiled down at her mind if we join you maam one of them asked he might have been an officer but he was no aristocrat not with that rough accent anne shrugged and nodded permission they sat down the crowd behind them thinned regretfully the one whod asked her leave was a lieutenant senior grade with wreathed stars on his shoulder straps and a stripe and a half of gold on each sleeve he was growing a sandy beard at the moment he looked as if hed forgotten to shave his companion a lieutenant junior grade with plain stars and single sleeve stripes was so blond and perfect he might have stepped off a recruiting poster anne dismissed him at once the other one though backwoods accent or not was interesting the colored waiter resplendent in tailcoat livery like that which scipio usually wore poised pencil above notepad what can i bring you tonight maam gentlemen how are the ham and yams anne asked very fine maam the waiter assured her ill have that then and a glass of rose to go with it pencil poised again the waiter looked a question to the two officers steak and potatoes here and a bottle of bourbon for the two of us the senior lieutenant said steak and potatoes for me too the junior lieutenant agreed of course the waiter said how would you care to have those done medium the lieutenant junior grade said the other officer laughed how many times have i got to tell you ralph you want to be able to taste the meat he looked up at the waiter i want that slab of meat just barelyand i mean just barelydead you tell the cook that if it doesnt go ouch when i stick a fork in it im going to tell his grandpappys ghost to haunt him till the end of time he made a curious gesture with one hand had the waiter been white he would have turned pale his eyes got big he nodded and beat a hasty retreat what was that the handsome junior lieutenantralphasked anne surprised herself by speaking that was a hex sign it meansits supposed to mean anyhowyour friend really can do things with or to the cooks grandfathers ghost the lieutenant senior grade raised a gingery eyebrow youre right maam not many white folksespecially not many white womenknow that one i make it a point to know what goes on with my negroes anne said smugly she used a different sign she was surprised again because both naval officers recognized it and shed never yet run across a white man who did how did you know what that meant she asked quietly we use that one for luck maam when we fire a torpedo the senior lieutenant answered i didnt know anybodyanybody white anyhow outside of submarines knew about it submarines now anne looked at both of them with respect they might not be gentlemen but they had courage and to spare you had to have courageor be a little touched in the headto go down under the ocean in what was basically a metal cigar submarines the senior lieutenant repeated im roger kimball off the whelk and this lug here is ralph briggs off the scallop heading for new orleans both of us for reassignment im on my way to new orleans too anne said and gave her name neither of them knew who she was even so ralph briggs started slavering as if he were a dog and she that steak hed ordered not cooked medium but raw kimball on the other hand just shrugged and nodded their meals did arrive then if roger kimballs steak had been over the flames at all you could hardly tell by looking the waiter hovered anxiously all the same when kimball cut the meat he let out a long mooo without moving his lips which made the negro jump only after he nodded did the fellow smile in relief and go on about the rest of his business since shed broken the ice herself anne expected the submariners to try whatever approach they thought would work briggs started to a couple of times but kimball wanted to talk shop and being senior to briggs got his way it was almost as if the two men had started speaking some foreign tongue one where words sounded as if they were english but meant obscure indecipherable things anne listened fascinated to grumbles about fish that wouldnt swim straight twelvepounder and threeinch bricks and eggs that would blow you to kingdom come if you couldnt keep away from them weve laid ours the damnyankees have laid theirs and by the time both sides are done wont be any room for boats left in the whole ocean and i mean our boats and theirs bothships too kimball said dont know what to do about it briggs said pouring whiskey from the bottle into his glass he drank then laughed and said if we were still in those gasolineengine boats id be drunkern this just off the fumes diesels the way to go there kimball agreed gasjag hangover is worse than anything you get from rotgut amen briggs said with what sounded like the voice of experience though anne wasnt quite sure what sort of experience the lieutenant junior grade went on theyre building heads in the new boats too thank god thank god is right kimball said even if they arent everything they ought to be you cant discharge em down deeper than about thirty feet and you dont want to do it where the enemy can spot you and when you do do it you want to do it right briggs said thats a fact kimball laughed out loud a laugh that invited everyone who could to share the joke ensign on my boat opened the wrong valve at the wrong time and got his own backright between the eyes he laughed again and so did ralph briggs kimball finished after that the poor miserable devil wouldnt even try unless he was crouched down in front of the pan when anne colleton discussed modern art she and her fellow cognoscenti used terms that shut the uninitiated out of the conversation now she found herself shut out the same way she didnt care for it what are you talking about she asked with some asperity briggs and kimball looked at each other briggs turned almost as red as the juice from kimballs rare steak roger kimball though laughed yet again what are we talking about he said you cant just flush the toilet when youre under the water in a submarine you have to use compressed air and a complicated set of valves and levers you have to use them in the right order too or else what youre trying to get rid of doesnt leave the boat instead it comes back up and hits you in the face if briggs had been red before he was incandescent now kimball leaned back in his chair and waited to see how shed take his blunt answer she nodded to him thank you this happened to someone in your crew thats right we were laughing about it for days afterwards kimball answered everyone but him of course anne said kimball shook his head jim too after he got hold of a washrag briggs poured his glass of bourbon full and gulped it down maybe in an effort to drown his own embarrassment perhaps not surprisingly he fell asleep in his chair about ten minutes later kimball leaned him against the wall of the dining car there he said in satisfaction now he wont fall down and hurt himself he got to his feet thanks for sharing the table with us miss colleton not even a pleasure to have met you or hope to see you again sometime anne noted more than a little annoyed she glanced back toward the table where julia was eating and laughing and joking with other servants and some of the colored train crew her maid would be there for a while she might stay there all night if she got the chance anne rose from her seat im going up to my car i think kimball made no effort to take up the unspoken invitation to walk with her he didnt move so fast though as to leave her behind they went through a couple of cars not quite together not quite apart then he stopped in the hallway to a pullman and said this is my compartment ralphs too matter of fact but he found himself that berth in the diner not the one id take but what can you do his eyes twinkled when he slid open the compartment door anne stepped in after him she was a modern woman after all and did as she pleased in such things what he said both reddish eyebrows rising then she kissed him and after that matters took their own course the lower berth was cramped for one let alone for two or so anne found it but kimball acted as if it had all the room in the world maybe compared to arrangements aboard a submarine it did he didnt bang his head on the bottom of the upper berth or the front wall he didnt bump his feet against the back wall what he did do with precision and dispatch was satisfy both him and her he even used his hand to help her along a little when her pace didnt quite match his afterwards just as efficient he helped her dress again those clever hands doing up hooks and buttons with accurate unhurried haste he stuck his head out into the hallway to make sure she could leave the compartment unnoticed now he did say with a knowing smile a pleasure to have met you as soon as she was on her way he shut the door behind her she was almost back to her own seat when ignoring her bodys happy glow she stopped so suddenly that the old man behind her stepped on the heel of her shoe she listened to his apologies without really hearing them that sneaky devil she exclaimed he planned the whole thing and kimball had done it so smoothly she hadnt even noticed till now she didnt know whether to be furious or to salute him she whod manipulated so many people so successfully over the past few years had been manipulated herself tonight then she shook her head no she hadnt just been manipulated shed been in the most literal sense of the word had sergeant chester martin looked down at the three stripes on the sleeve of his greengray tunic he didnt delude himself that hed done anything particularly heroic to deserve the promotion what hed done and what a lot of peoplean awful lot of peoplehadnt was stay alive he looked back toward catawba mountain coming down it had been almost as bad as righting his way up it the rebs moved back from one line to another and made you pay the butchers bill every time you attacked dumb fool luck he muttered thats the only reason im here let alone a threestriper you bet sarge said paul andersen who was using a wirecutter to snip his way into a can of corned beef that let out an embalmed smell when he got it open he wore a corporals chevrons now himself for the same reason that chester was a sergeant a machine gun it doesnt care how smart you are or how brave you are you get in front of it either you go down or you dont all depends on how the dice roll yeah martin tore his eyes away from the scarred slopes of catawba mountain and looked east toward the roanoke river and big lick he didnt stand up for a better look you were asking for a sniper to blow your lamp out for good if you did anything that stupid the lines were quiet right this minute but what did that mean only that the rebel snipers who were used to shooting for the pot and reckoned men deliciously large targets had plenty of time to get ready to take advantage of any chance you gave em he knew what hed see anyhow big lick or what was left of it after end less shelling still lay in confederate hands though a lot of the iron mines nearby had the stars and stripes flying over them now but the last big us push had bogged down right on the outskirts of town and after that the rebs had counterattacked and regained a mile or two of ground one of these days he expected the army would try another push toward the river he was willing to waitforever with luck he dug in his own mess kit and chose a hardtack biscuit hard was the word for it it might have been baked during the war of secession and at that troops were better supplied than they had been at the start of the campaign railroads were snaking out of west virginia to the front to bring in food and ammunition faster and in bigger lots than horses and mules and men could manage now if we could only put the rebel trains out of action he said that was a big part of the reason the brass had attacked big lick in the first place but the tracks remained in confederate hands though repeated bombardment meant the rebs tried running trains through only at night good luck sarge andersen said now he pointed east stead of earthworks they got their niggers runnin up new lines out of range of our guns anyhow dont seem fair chester martin nodded gloomily captain wyatt had been grousing about those lines too but the captains grousing wasnt what worried martin about the confederate tracklaying sure as hell the brass would want to push guns up close enough to pound the new lines and whod have to do the dirty work to make that happen nobody he could see but the infantry as if thinking of him had been enough to make him appear captain orville wyatt stepped into the firing pit martin and andersen were sharing he tossed each of them a chocolate bar courtesy of the cooks he said they had so many they didnt know what to do with em so liberated as many as i could theyll probably eat the rest themselves yeah who ever saw a skinny cook martin said peeling silver paper off the bar before he crammed it into his mouth mmthank you sir beats the hell out of biscuits and corned beef wyatt was a damned good officer he looked out for his men if your captain took care of things like that odds were good hed also be an effective combat leader and wyatt was he was also up for promotion to major for most of the same reasons martin and andersen had seen their ranks go up wyatt dug a muchfolded newspaper out of his pocket this came up to the front on the last trainonly four days old he said he believed in keeping minds full along with bellies he gave the sergeant and corporal the gist of what was in the news big fight out in the atlantic we torpedoed a french armored cruiser and it went down we sank some confederate and argentine freighters heading for england too good martin said hope the limeys starve wyatt read on the rebs torpedoed one of our cruisers too the cowardly sons of bitches but we rescued almost the whole crew and tr made a bully speech in new york city that got martins attention and andersens too nobody could make a speech like teddy roosevelt what does he say martin asked eagerly captain wyatt knew nobody could make a speech like tr too he skimmed and summarized saying he wants the world to know were at war to support our allies and to restore whats ours by rights what the english and the french and the rebs took away from our grandfathers wait heres the best bit he stood very straight and drew back his lips so you could see all his teeth a pretty good tr imitation a great free people owes to itself and to all mankind not to sink into helplessness before the powers of evil i ask that this people rise to the greatness of its opportunities i do not ask that it seek the easiest path that is good andersen said with a connoisseurs approval chester martin nodded too roosevelt knew about the harder path along with custer though on a slightly smaller scale because hed been just a colonel of volunteers hed come out of the second mexican war a hero and his stock had been rising ever since no nation could have hoped for a better leader in time of war all the same sitting in a firing pit that had started life as a shell hole surrounded by the stench of death the rattle of machine guns the occasional roar of us and rebel artillery lice in his hair martin couldnt help wondering whether teddy roosevelt had ever walked a path as hard as this one scipio bowed and said in tones of grave regret i am sorry to have to inform you sir that we have no more champagne no more champagne merde marcel duchamp clapped a dramatic hand to his forehead everything the modern artist did as far as scipio could tell was deliberately dramatic duchamp was tall and thin and pale and in the habit of dressing in black which made him look like a preacheruntil you saw his eyes he didnt behave like a preacher either not if halfnot if a quarterof the stories scipio heard from the maids and kitchen girls were true now he went on how shall i endure this rural desolation without champagne to console me whiskey was the first thought that came to scipios mind if it worked for him if it worked for the negroes who picked marshlands cotton it ought to do the job for a dandified frenchman but hed been trained to give the best service he could and so he said the war has made importing difficult sir as it has disturbed outbound travel but perhaps my mistress miss colleton would be able to procure some champagne in new orleans and order it sent here for you if you like i will send her a telegram with your request disturbed outbound travel yes i should say so duchamp replied no one will put out to sea from charleston it seems for fear of being torpedoed or cannonaded or otherwise discommoded he rolled those disconcerting eyes would you not agree the risk of going to the bottom of the sea is only slightly less than the risk of staying here by now scipio knew better than to try to match wits with duchamp the artists conversation was as confusing as his paintings he used words to reflect back on one another till common sense vanished from them stolidly the butler repeated would you like me to wire my mistress about the champagne sir i give you the advice of rabelais do as you please duchamp said which helped not at all the frenchman cocked his head to one side your mistress you say in what sense is she yours im afraid i dont follow you sir scipio said marcel duchamp stabbed out a long pale forefinger you are her servant you were at one time her slave is it not so he waved a hand to encompass not just the dining room of the marshlands mansion but the entire estate i was a slave of the colleton family yes sir although i was manumitted not long before miss anne was born scipio said nothing at all in his voice now he didnt like being reminded of his former status even if his present one represented no great advance upon it duchamp sensed that he didnt let it deter him if anything it spurred him on very well you are her servant she may dismiss you punish you give you onerous duties do as she likes with you is it not so it may be so in theory scipio said warily but miss colleton would never duchamp waggled that forefinger to interrupt him never mind it is in this sense of the word that you are her servant now you say she is your mistress how may you in your turn punish her if she fails of the requirements of a mistress what even scipios politeness to a guest at marshlands and to a white man at that not that the marshlands estate was likely to entertain a colored guest proved to have limits you ought to know i cant do that sir oh i do know it i know it full well many have accused me of being mad but few of being stupid the artist winked as if to say even here he did not expect to be taken altogether seriously but he was or at least he sounded serious as he went on so how is the charming and wealthy miss colleton yours eh scipio you cannot punish her you cannot control her you cannot possess her either in economic terms or in the perfumed privacy of her boudoir you scipio abruptly turned on his heel and walked out of the dining room out of the mansion altogether that frenchman was crazy and the people whod told him so knew what they were talking about in the confederate states of america you had to be crazy if you talked about a negro servant possessing a white woman in her bedroomeven if you called it a boudoir oh such things happened now and again scipio knew that they always ended badly too when they were discovered he knew that too but whether they happened or not you didnt go around talking about them you sure as the devil didnt go around suggesting them to a negro words scipio said in his educated voice then he repeated it in the slurred dialect of the congaree words marcel duchamp played games with them nobody had any business playing the hell of it was this time he did make a corrosive kind of sense anne colleton wasnt his mistress in the same way he was her butler the two sides of the relationship werent heads and tails of the same coin the way they looked to be if you didnt think about them few negroes did think about them instead taking them for granted which was precisely what the white aristocracy of the confederate states wanted them to do scipio looked out toward the cotton fields from which marshlands drew its wealthfrom which anne colleton drew her wealth the negroes out in those fields were her workers almost as they had been before manumission but was she theirs hardly in his own way duchamp was an influence as corrupting as the communist manifesto and anne colleton hadnt a clue that was so there were a lot of things the mistress his mistresshed have to think about that didnt have a clue about when it came to what really went on at marshlands scipio hadnt had a clue about them either not until he discovered the forbidden book in cassius cottage he still wished hed never seen it but to protect his own hide hed been reading a lot of marx and engels and lincoln and then talking things over with cassius the more you looked at things from an angle that wasnt the one white folks wanted you to use the uglier the whole structure of the confederacy looked and as if deliberately sent by a malicious god to make his misgivings worse here came cassius a shotgun over one shoulder a stick with four possums tied by the tail to it on the other the possums presumably were for his own larder scipio tried to imagine what marcel duchamp would say if presented with baked possum and greens hed learned a little about swearing in french he figured that would teach him a good deal more cassius couldnt wave but did nod how you is he asked i been better scipio answered as usual in the dialect in which he was addressed nobody else was in earshot and it was normal for the hunter and the butler to stand around talking with a sly grin on his face cassius said come de revolution all of we be better you gwine get youself killed is all you talk like that scipio said the white folks they shoot we they hang we the poor buckra they look fo the chance every day you want to give it to they the poor buckra in the army fight the rich white folks war cassius said not enough leff to stop we come de day theyd gone round and round on that one pummeling each other like a couple of prizefighters scipio tried a new argument awright suppose we beat the white folks cass what happen then aint just we the white folks is fightin like you say we rise up we give the usa the fight the usa they don love niggers hardly no bettern our own white folks hed hoped he would at least rock cassius back on his mental heels but the hunterthe revolutionary the redonly shook his head and smiled al most pityingly kip the revolution aint jus here the usa they gwine have they own revolution right along with we scipio stared at cassius whatever else you could say about him he didnt think small at last cautiously scipio said they aint got enough niggers in the usa to rise up against they govment they got plenty white folks up noth whats pressed cassius answered you get worked sunup to sundown dont matter you is black or you is white you pressed the same either which way you rise up the same either which way the damnyankees they shoot they strikers same as they shoot niggers here when the broom of revolution come out it gwine sweep away the pressors in the usa the same as here he sounded like a preacher stirring up the congregation that was what he was though he would have been furious had scipio said so but a lot of workers on the plantation took the communist manifesto as gospel gloomily scipio said you gwine get a lot o niggers killed they rise up in the usa lots o they poor buckra get killed we don rise up together they white we black things is like that an thats how things is come the revolution black an white be all the same cassius said for once scipio got the last word yeah all be dead the same vii c aptain irving morrell lay between starched white sheets in an airy tucson hospital that smelled of carbolic acid and below that of pus he was sick of hospitals the words sick to death of hospitals ran through his mind but he rejected them hed come too close to dying to make jokes or even feeble plays on words about it his leg still throbbed like a rotten tooth and here it was december when hed been hit in august more than once the sawbones had wanted to take it off at the hip for fear infection would kill him hed managed to talk them out of it every time and having a toothache down there was heaven compared to what hed gone through for a while he could even walk on the leg now and with aspirin he hardly noticed the painon good days a doctor with captains bars on the shoulders of his white coat approached the bed morrell had never seen him before he didnt know whether hed see him again the doctors herethe doctors at every military hospital these days were like factory workers dealing with wounded men as if they were faulty mechanisms to be reassembled often moving from one to the next without the slightest acknowledgment of their common humanity maybe that kept them from dwelling on what they had to do maybe they were just too swamped to invest the time maybe bothmorrell had learned things were seldom simple the doctor pulled back the top sheet he peered down at the valley in the flesh of morrells thigh not too red he said scribbling a note the skin of his hands was red too and raw cracked from the harsh disinfectant in which he scrubbed many times a day its the best ive ever seen morrell agreed he didnt know whether that was true or not but he did know how much he wanted to get out of here and return to the war that was passing him by the doctor prodded at the wound with a shortnailed forefinger down at the bottom of the valley where a river would have run had it been a product of geology rather than mere war does that hurt no the lie came easily morrells conscience unlike his leg hurt not at all compared to what hed been through the pain the doctor inflicted was nothing maybe less i really am healing he thought in some amazement for a long time hed thought he never would another note another prod how about that no sir not that either another lie if i can convince everyone else it doesnt hurt i can convince myself too if i can convince the quack maybe hell let me out of here worth trying for the judgment was as cool and precise as if morrell were picking the weak spot in an enemy position that was how hed got shot in the first place but he chose not to dwell on such inconvenient details two orderlies came into the warm airy room one pushing a wheeled gurney the other walking beside it bandages covered most of the head of the still figure lying on the gurney yellow serum stained the white cotton at a spot behind the left temple between them the orderlies gently transferred what had been a man from the gurney to a bed the axles creaked slightly as they turned the gurney in a tight circle and rolled it away in his time on his back morrell had seen a lot of wounds like that poor bastard he muttered the doctor nodded next to that breathing husk morrell was a human being to him the worst of it is the doctor said hes liable to stay alive for a long time if you put food in his mouth hell swallow it if you give him water hell drink but hell never get up out of that bed again and hell never know hes in it either morrell shivered better to be shot dead quick and clean then its over youre not justlingering thats a good word the doctor said head wounds are the dreadful ones either they do kill the man receiving themand so many do far out of proportion to the number receivedor they leave him a vegetable like that unfortunate soldier he clicked his tongue between his teeth its a problem where i wish we could do more whats to be done morrell said a service cap wont stop a bullet any more than your tunic or your trousers would of course not the doctor said some of the elite regiments wear leather helmets like the ones the german army uses dont they the pickelhaube morrell agreed that might help if you fell off a bicycle but it wont stop a bullet either a steel helmet might if it wasnt too heavy to wear you probably couldnt make one that would keep everything out but he and the doctor looked at each other then at the same moment their eyes went to the bandaged soldier with half his brains blown out the doctor said that might be an excellent notion certainly in terms of wound reduction i may take it up with my superiors and upon your discharge i suggest you do the same with yours knowing how slowly the army does everything we could hardly hope for immediate action even if we get approval but the sooner we start seeking it the sooner something will get done morrell finished for him he hated the way army wheels got mired in bureaucratic mud maybe with the war on things would move faster he hadnt had a chance to find out hed been flat on his back almost since fighting broke out but the doctor had spoken a magic word discharge youre not one hundred per cent sound the doctor said glancing down at the notes hed written odds are youll never be a hundred per cent sound not with that wound but you have function in the leg the infection is controlled if not suppressed and we may hope exercise will improve your overall condition now rather than setting it back if not of course you will return to the hospital wherever you happen to be reassigned of course morrell said piously not meaning a word of it inactivity had been a pain as bad as any from his wound once he got back in the field he wouldnt report himself unfit for duty not unless he got shot againand not then either if he could get away with it hed buy a walking stick hed detail a sergeant to haul him around as necessarybut hed stay in action there had been times when he thought hed go crazy just from being cooped up in one place for weeks at a time i am serious about that the doctor said morrell had had better luck fooling some of the other quacks theyd sicced on him if the infection flares up again or if it should reach the bone amputation will offer the only hope of saving your life i understand morrell said which didnt mean he took the medical man seriously if they hadnt chopped the leg off when it was swollen to twice its proper size and leaking pus the way an armored car with a punctured radiator leaked water they werent going to haul out the meat axe for it now very well the doctor jotted one more note my orders are to put any men especially experienced officers who are at all capable of serving back on activeduty status as soon as possible therapeutically this is less than ideal but therapeutic needs must be weighed against those of the nation and so you will be sent east for reassignment i will be glad to get out of here morrell said but isnt there any chance of sending me back down to the campaign for guaymas last i heard wed bogged down less than a hundred miles from the town thats my understanding too the doctor said the reassignment center however has been established in st louis youll get your orders there whatever they turn out to be morrell nodded accepting his fate that sounded like the army set up one central center somewhere and process everyone through it if you went a thousand miles then came back to somewhere only a hundred miles from where youd started that was just your tough luck you chalked it up to the way the system worked and went on about your assigned business and of course there were no guarantees hed get sent back to sonora he could as easily end up in pennsylvania or kansas or quebec or british columbia war flamed all over the continent he started to ask the doctor when he could expect to head out of tucson but the fellow had moved on to the next bed and was examining a sergeant whod taken a shell fragment that had shattered his arm he had suffered an amputation and was bitter about it now that the doctor was looking at him morrell might as well have ceased to exist knowing he would soon be allowed to escape the confines of the military hospital to see more of tucsons notched mountainous skyline than the window showed him should have given him the patience to bear his remaining time in enforced captivity with good grace so he told himself instead he felt more trapped in his bed than ever he fussed and fidgeted and made himself so unpleasant that the nurses with whom he had for the most part got on well started snapping back at him three days later though an orderly brought him a new captains uniform to replace the hospital robe hed worn so long in size the new uniform was a perfect match for the blooddrenched tattered one in which hed been wounded it hung on him like a tent he could have concealed a football under his tunic without unduly stretching it and he had to use the point of a knife to cut a new hole in his belt so his trousers would stay up they flapped around his skinny legs like the baggy cotton bloomers women wore when they exercised he didnt care even with the stick walking down the corridor to the buggy that would take him to the train station left him dizzy and lightheaded he didnt care about that either the driver was a grayhaired civilian who by his bearing had spent a good many years in the army glad to be getting back into it sir he asked as morrell struggled up into the seat behind him after he spoke he coughed several times morrell wondered if hed come here to new mexico in hopes of healing consumptive lungs that was however it was the question had only one possible answer hell yes morrell said the driver chuckled and flicked the reins the twohorse team started forward morrell leaned back in his seat he could relax now he was heading back toward the world where he belonged by the time jonathan moss pulled on woolen long johns trousers boots tunic heavy wool sweater even heavier sheepskin coat and leather flying helmet and goggles he felt as if hed doubled in weight hed certainly doubled in width and with so many layers of clothing swaddling him he could hardly move he waddled through the doorway of the battered barn by the airfield forcing each leg forward took a separate and distinct effort one of the mechanics looked up from a poker game in the corner and said think youll be warm enough lieutenant he laughed and without waiting for an answer turned his attention back to the dealer gimme two byron and make em good ones for a change why dont you nettled moss snapped its cold enough down here lefty go up five thousand feet and its a hell of a lot colder yeah i know sir the mechanic said unabashed he studied the cards byron had dealt him by his revolted expression they hadnt even come out of the same deck as the other three in his hand you took that expression seriously at your own peril if lefty wasnt a rich man by the time the war endedif the war ever endedit would only be because hed invested his winnings in lousy stocks one thing about flying going up in the air meant moss wouldnt lose any money to the mechanic for a while bad weather had grounded the reconnaissance squadron the past few days it wasnt exactly choice out there now but they might be able to get up look around and come back in one piece moss chuckled wryly to himself as he walked out into watery sunshine when the fighting startedwhich seemed like a devil of a long time ago now a lot of officers hadnt wanted to pay any attention to the reports the aeroplane pilots brought back now people were screaming blue murder because theyd been deprived of those reports for a few days go on and fly the attitude seemed to be so what if you crash as long as we get the information nice to be wanted moss said and chuckled again he climbed up into his super hudson the first thing he did was check the action of the machine gun mounted in front of him the next thing he did was check the belt of ammunition that fed the machine gun he found a couple of cartridges he didnt like he took off his mittens extracted the bad rounds from the belt and yelled for an armorer he soon had new cartridges more to his satisfaction if your machine gun jammed in an aerial duel all you could do was run away since the avros the canadians flew were faster than the curtiss machines you didnt want to have to try to do that one by one the other pilots of the fouraeroplane flight came out of the barn and got up into their aircraft baum and nelson and mcclintock were as heavily wrapped as he was and distinguishable one from another mostly because mcclintock was half a head taller than nelson who overtopped baum by a like amount they too started checking their machine guns and ammunition after what seemed like forever but couldnt have been more than a couple of minutes the mechanics deigned to put down their cards long enough to help send the airmen on their way lefty sauntered out to moss aeroplane he had an unlighted cigar clamped between his teeth he wouldnt strike a match till he got back to the barn around that cigar he said you come back safe now sir you hear you got money i aint won yet for which vote of confidence i thank you moss said and lefty laughed the mechanic grabbed hold of one blade of the twobladed wooden prop and spun it hard the engine sputtered but didnt catch lefty muttered something so hot it should have lighted the cigar all by itself he spun the prop again the engine sputtered stuttered and began to roar moss glanced over to his flightmates baums engine was going and so was mcclintocks lefty trotted toward nelsons aeroplane as did a couple of other mechanics nelson spread his hands in frustration you hated to break down but what were you supposed to do sometimes moss pounded a fist down onto his leg he could hardly feel the blow through all the clothes he had on but that didnt matter the flight would be short a man no help for it if they got jumped the canucks and limeys would have an edge he shook his head lone wolves of the air didnt last long these days the british and canadians had started formation flying and us pilots had to match them or else come out on the short end whenever a single plane met up with a flight the kind of scout mission hed flown in september would have been suicidally risky nowadays the air was a nastier place than it had been down below a couple of us soldiers took shots at him he spied the upwardpointing muzzle flashes god damn you stop that he shouted uselessly of course for they could not hear him but he knew he was nowhere near the enemy lines only fool luck would let a rifleman down an aeroplane but the troopers down there were surely fools for shooting at machines on their own side and they might have got lucky he flew as leader with baum on his right and mcclintock off to his left he wished nelson had been able to get his engine to turn over then shrugged hed made a lot of wishes that hadnt come true what was one more the flight buzzed along inland from the northern shore of lake erie after untold exertions and untold casualties the us army had finally dislodged the limeys and canucks from their grip on port dover it did them a lot less good than it would have a couple of months before for one thing the canadians had had plenty of time to build up new defensive lines behind the one that had fallenthe exhilarating hope of a charge to take the defenses at london in the rear remained just that a hope and for another the weather made movement so hard that the canadians and british could probably have pulled half their men out of line without the armys being able to do much about it the closest big us town to the fighting was buffalo and buffalo was notorious for frightful winters moving up into canada didnt do a thing to make the wind blow less or the snow not fall the war was supposed to be over by now moss muttered troops werent supposed to have to try to advancehell aeroplanes werent sup posed to have to try to flyin weather like this canada was supposed to have fallen like a ripe fruit at which point the united states could turn the whole weight of their military muscle against the confederates oh parts of the plan had gone well farther east the army hadnt had any great trouble reaching the st lawrence crossing it though was turning out to be another question altogether and the land on the other side was fortified to a faretheewell theyd come ever so close to winnipeg too though they probably wouldnt get there till spring which in those parts meant may at the earliest but not quite reaching winnipeg meant trains full of wheat and oats and barley kept heading east from the canadian prairieand there was talk that the canucks weather be damned were pushing another railroad line through north of the city the grains getting through in turn meant the canadian heartland the country between toronto and quebec city wouldnt starve of course it hadnt been intended to starve canada into submission not at firstoutandout conquest was the goal but both the first plan and the alternative had failed which leftwhat which leaves a whole lot of poor bastards down there dead in the mud moss said when things didnt go the way the generals thought they would soldiers were the ones who had to try to straighten them outand who paid the price for doing it the only thanks they got were mentions in trs speeches it didnt seem enough clouds floated ahead dark gray and lumpy more of them were gathering back toward the horizon advance scouts for more bad weather ahead moss took his super hudson down below the bottom of the nearest clouds wanting a good look at whatever the enemy had in the area his busy pencil traced trench lines artillery positions new railroad spurs some of the aeroplane squadrons were starting to get cameras to let photographs take the place of sketches moss wasnt enthusiastic about the idea of wrestling with photographic plates in the cockpit of an aeroplane but if he got orders to do that he knew he would he and his wingmen were only a couple of thousand feet above the ground the canucks and englishmen down there opened up on them with everything they had thrum thrum the noise of bullets tearing through tightstretched fabric was not one moss wanted to hear one of those accidental roundsor maybe not so accidental not flying this lowcould just as easily tear through him climbing a little helped for it put ragged streamers of clouds between the aeroplanes and the men on the ground but those ragged streamers also meant moss couldnt see as much as he liked after playing hide and seek for a minute or so he came back down into plain sight so he could do his own job as it needed doing by then he baum and mcclintock were past the front line the fire from the ground was lighter here and he descended another few hundred feet men down there swelled from ants to beetles and here came what looked like a procession of toy trucks and wagons bringing supplies up from the railhead to the front jonathan moss let out a whoop the slipstream blew away he waved to catch his wingmens attention and pointed first down to the supply column and then to the machine gun mounted in front of him the limeys and canucksand even the americans had been taking potshots at them the whole flight long now they could get some of their own back he swooped down on the column like a redtailed hawk on a pullet in a farmyard safely back of the lines the wagons and trucks had no armed escort whatever he squeezed the triggers to the machine gun and sprayed bullets up and down the length of it as he pulled up and went around he yelled with glee at the chaos he baum and mcclintock had created some horses were down so were some drivers two trucks were burning two more had run into each other when their drivers jumped out and dove into a ditch rather than staying to be machinegunned a cloud of steam in the chilly air said one of them had a broken radiator the three pilots shot up the column twice more starting fresh fires and knocking over more horses and then at moss wave flew eastward again back toward the aerodrome when he neared the front line this time moss was not ashamed to use the cover of clouds to avert antiaircraft fire getting information was important but so was bringing it back to the people who could use it the bottom of the cloud deck was only a few hundred feet off the ground when the three curtiss super hudsons landed moss had breathed a long sigh of relief on spotting the aerodrome hed worried that the clouds would turn into fog and force his comrades and him to set down wherever they could when his biplane bounced to a stop he jumped out of it an enormous grin on his face baum a little skinny guy with a black beard and mcclintock who for reasons known only to himself affected the waxed mustache and spikily pointed imperial of a balkans nobleman were also all teeth and excitement wasnt that bully they shouted wasnt it grand just like the ducks in a shooting gallery moss agreed and then quite suddenly he sobered not long before hed been sick because he had to shoot down a canadian aeroplane to save his own life now here he was celebrating the deaths of a whole raft of men who unlike the aeroplane pilot and observer hadnt even been able to shoot back hed always been glad he wasnt an infantryman if you were a mudfoot war and the death and maiming that went with war were random and impersonal what had he just been doing but dealing out random impersonal death hed thought of himself as a knight in shining armor what sorts of filthy things had knights done that never got into the pages of malory and ivanhoe he didnt know he didnt want to find out not really he looked down at himself his imaginary suit of armor seemed to have a patch or two of rust on it no matter who you were or what you did you couldnt stay immaculate not in this war close to quitting time jefferson pinkard grunted as he and bedford cunningham secured a mold that would shape the steel just poured from the crucible into a metal pig a freight car could carry to whatever factory would turn it into weapons of war before his friend could even begin to agree with him that granddaddy of a steam whistle proclaimed to the whole sloss foundry that hed been right lived through another monday cunningham said not altogether facetiously accidents were way up since the start of the war everybody was working flat out with no slack time from the start of a shift to the end a lot of the men were new because so many had gone into the army and the new fellows made more mistakes than the old hands they replaced and what with working like dogs every minute of every shift new hands and old got drunk more often to ease the strain which didnt helpespecially on mondays no sooner had that thought crossed pinkards mind than a horrible shriek rang out on the casting floor oh christ he said breaking into a run that damn fool up there poured when they werent paying attention probably talking about going off shift just like we was there by the mold next to his lay sid williamson he wasnt quiet now as he usually was he writhed and shrieked the stink of hot iron was everywhere so was the stink of burnt meat jeff looked at him and turned away doing his best not to be sick to his stomach hed been burned plenty of times himself but never like thisoh god never like this he shook his fist up at the kid handling the crucible who was staring whitefaced at what hed done such things happened even with experienced men in that place but that didnt keep him from blaming the son of a bitch whod made this one happen it couldve been me he thought jesus god it couldve been me burn ointment bedford cunningham began another steelworker was already slathering it on williamson it wouldnt do any good jeff knew damn well it wouldnt do any good so did everybody else on the floor including no doubt the burned man a couple of his pals got a stretcher under him which brought out fresh cries and hustled him away he might livehe was young and strong pinkard wouldnt have bet on it though hed never be back at the foundry again jeff would have bet anything he owned on that he wiped his sweaty grimy face with a sweaty grimy forearm it was chilly and wet outside but not in here in here it was always somewhere between august and hell not that in birmingham there was a whole lot of difference between one and the other even so some of the sweat on his face was cold still shaking he and cunningham turned together to let the fellows on the evening shift take over the work which had to get done no matter what no matter who they both stopped with the turns a little more than half made pinkard watched cunninghams jaw drop he felt his own doing the same thing he needed a couple of tries before he could say wheres henry wheres silas the two negroes in collarless shirts looked nervous they were big strong bucksthey looked plenty strong enough to be steelworkers but that didnt have anything to do with anything and they knew it so did pinkard and cunningham one of the negroes said theys in the army suh we is their replacements and who the hell are you bedford cunningham set his hands on his hips both black men were bigger than he was and younger too but that didnt have anything to do with anything either a black man who fought back against a whitehis goose was cooked anywhere in the csa im lorenzo said the negro who had answered before my names justinian the other one said i dont care if youre jesus christ and the holy ghost jeff pinkard exploded which won him a startled chuckle from cunningham what the hell they doin puttin negroes on the evenin shift nights was bad enough but this here suh we been on nights since they let us lorenzo said which was true pinkard had seen him around for a while when these white folks you was expectin when they goed into the army the bosses they look around but they dont find no other whites kin do the jobno sperienced whites i should oughta say and so here we is worlds goin to hell in a handbasket jeff no two ways about it bed cunningham said mournfully we seen it comin an we was right next thing you know a couple of coonsll be doin our jobs too yeah well if thats so its on account of they put a rifle in my hands in stead pinkard answered and ill tell you somethin else too when i get out o the army im still gonna have that rifle in my hands any nigger who tries to keep my job when i want it back hes gonna be sorry and any boss who tries to help him keep it hes gonna be sorrier yet amen cunningham said as if hed been preaching in the baptist church of a sunday morning we had ourselves two revolutions in this here country to make it like we want it reckon we can have us a third one to keep it that way he spat on the floor shit how do we even know these boys can do the work maybe we better watch and find out he folded his arms across his chest ought to find out if theyve got the balls to do it too jeff said he pointed over to the other mold you boys know what happened to sid just now yes suh lorenzo answered quietly we seen that before workin nights hope he come through all right it was a soft answer not one pinkard particularly wanted to hear just then he was edgy looking for trouble since he couldnt find any he scowled and said all right get on with it then if they couldnt do the job complaining to the foreman and maybe to the foundry manager would be worthwhile pinkard stepped aside were gonna watch you and for the next half hour he and cunningham did nothing but watch to his dismay the negroes had no troubles they werent so smooth together as the two white men they were replacing but they hadnt worked together for years either they did know enough of what they were doing to do just about all of it right at last jeff stuck an elbow in cunninghams ribs lets go home he said wivesll be worryin thinkin we got hurt or somethin he shivered wasnt us but it might have been yeah his friend said with a strange kind of sigh not quite defeat but a long way from acceptance as one they turned their backs on the negroes and left the sloss foundry building walking home felt strange because theyd stayed past shift changeover they were almost alone a few men coming in late for evening shift rushed past them worried expressions on their faces theyd catch hell from the foremen and theyd see their pay docked would they get fired an hour earlier pinkard would have thought nowhod replace them with so many white men in the army now that question had a possible new answer one he didnt like sure enough when they got back to their sidebyside yellow cottagesthough they looked gray in the fastfading evening twilightemily pinkard and fanny cunningham were standing together on the grass of their front lawns grass that was going brown from the cold december nights where have you been the two women demanded as one stayed a little late at the foundry is all jefferson pinkard said emily came up and stood close to him after a moment he realized she was smelling his breath to see if hed been off somewhere drinking up some illegal whiskey fanny cunningham was doing the same thing with bedford when bedford figured out what was going on he angrily shoved his wife away pinkard just shrugged if hed been emily he would have guessed the same thing what were you doing at the foundry emily asked evidently satisfied he was telling the truth then the tale came out jefferson and bedford splitting it their breath steaming as they spoke their wives exclaimed in indignation and fear both because of what had happened to sid williamson and because of the news about the black men pinkard understood that plenty well henry and silas had been replaced by negroes after they went into the army would pinkard and cunningham be replaced so they could go into the army or would they be replaced for no better reason than that the foundry bosses could save some money come on inside bedford cunningham said to his wife we got some things we better talk about you an me pinkard had a pretty good notion what those things might be bedford had teased him when hed let emily go to work in the munitions factory but all of a sudden he was pretty damn glad he had even if they did throw him out of work he and emily wouldnt go hungry if his friend wasnt thinking about having fanny look for some kind of work he would have been surprised i waited supper on you emily said i put that roast and the potatoes in the covered crock fore i left this mornin and theyll still be fine now all right pinkard let her lead him up the walk to their house he hung his cap on the tree inside the door right beside the flowered hat emily had worn to her job today now that she was going out in public every day shed bought several new hats each one cost a days pay for her but shed earned the money herself so pinkard didnt see how he had any business complaining in spite of her promises the cottage wasnt so clean and tidy as it had been before emily went to work hed said things once or twice the first few weeks after all she had promised to keep up the housework before long though hed stopped complaining when you got right down to it what difference did a little dust make she was helping the csa win the war didnt that count for more and supper as shed promised was fine she made a lot of meals like that these days things she could fix up in a hurry put over a low fire before she went out the door and then just serve as soon as she and jefferson were both home thats mighty good he said patting his belly and since i wasnt off gettin lit up like you thought i was why dont you get me a bottle of beer even by the ruddy light of the kerosene lamp he could see her face go red you knew too she said over her shoulder as she went back into the kitchen you didnt let on like bedford did i think fanny nags bedford moren you do me he answered makes him feel like he got to get his own back every so often ah thanks he took the illicit bottle she handed him swigged and made a sour face hes done a lot bettern thattastes like he had a horse stand over the bottle he swigged again a sick horse you ask me emily giggled deliciously scandalized she also drank its not that bad she said faint praise and as usual she was right the beer was drinkable or if it wasnt jefferson s bottle emptied by magic he went into the kitchen with her and worked the pump at the sink while she washed the supper dishes howd it go with you today he asked hed discovered to his surprise that he liked sharing work gossip with her you already heard my news for the day mine aint much better emily said scrubbing a greasy plate with harsh lye soap clara fuller she hurt her hand on a drill press they say shes liable to lose her little finger thats no good pinkard said accident like that the whole shift is looking over its shoulder the next two days only after hed said it did he realize how strange the idea of a woman at a machine would have struck him before the war started about as strange as the idea of a negro doing his job on the evening shift as a matter of fact when the dishes were done and dried and put away they went out to the living room and talked and read for a little while till they were both yawning more than they were talking after a few minutes of that they gave up with sleepy laughs they went out to the outhouse first emily then jeff she was in bed by the time he came back to put on his pajamas he slid under the cover and blew out the lamp her back was to him he reached over and closed a hand around her right breast she didnt stir she didnt say anything she was already deep asleep a moment later so was he somewhere up ahead along the muddy miserable road lay the town of morton s gap kentucky somewhere beyond and maybe a little north of mortons gap lay madisonville somewhere beyond madisonville in a mythical land far far away as best as paul mantarakis could telllay the muchpromised seldomseen glittering thing called breakthrough just at sunrise mantarakis walked slowly down the trench line you couldnt walk any way but slowly with every step you took the mud grabbed your boot and made you fight to pull it out again if you lay down in the mud you were liable to drown hed heard of its happening more than once as the us line congealed in the face of confederate resistance and winter there stood gordon mcsweeney his canvas shelter half wrapped around his shoulders as a cloak to hold the rain at bay water dripping off the brim of his greengray now greengraybrown forage cap his long angular face was muddy too and set in its usual disapproving lines mcsweeney disapproved of everything on general principles and of mantarakis not just on general principles but alsoand particularlybecause he wasnt presbyterian and then to mantarakis amazement those gloomy features rearranged themselves into a smile so bright it was almost sweet merry christmas paul mcsweeney said god bless you on the day christmas mantarakis stared blankly before nodding and smiling back merry christmas to you too gordon doesnt seem like much of a spot for doing anything about it though does it if christ is in your heart where your body rests does not matter mcsweeney said when he talked like that he usually sounded angry today though the words came out as if he meant them no more he really must have had the christmas spirit deep in his heart merry christmas mantarakis repeated he kept walking it was christmas for mcsweeney it was christmas for everybody in his unitand for the rebs in their wet trenches a couplethree hundred yards awaybut it wasnt christmas for him it wouldnt be christmas for him till january the orthodox church had never cottoned to the gregorian calendar maybe i should tell mcsweeney its papist mantarakis thought with a wry smile that would give the biblethumper something new to get in a sweat about not that you could sweat in this miserable weather he shook his head for one thing having mcsweeney act like a human being for a change was too good to fool with and for another he was too used to having the whole world celebrate christmas almost two weeks ahead of him to try and change anybodys mind about it now hey paul sergeant peterquist called from a little way down the trench we got us a sheep hereben brought it up with the regular supplies dont know where he came by it but im not asking questions neither you wanna see what you can turn it into sure will sarge mantarakis said he wasnt officially company cook but he was better at the job than ben carlton who was supposed to have it and everybody knew as much and what a greek couldnt do with mutton couldnt be done he added merry christmas as he came up to the sergeant same to you paul dick peterquist answered he wasnt much bigger than mantarakis but towheaded instead of swarthy because he was so fair he looked younger than the forty years mantarakis knew he had he might have carried a few gray hairs but who could tell in amongst the gold he pointed down to the carcass at his feet doesnt that look good paul whistled softly it wasnt really a sheep it was an almostyearling lamb from this past springs birth ben outdid himself this time he said carlton might not have been much of a cook but he was a hell of a scrounger you said sheep sarge and i figured something old and tough and gamy this here though his mouth watered just thinking about it make stew with some and roast the rest i guess you cant beat roast lamb you do it up the best way you know how thats all peterquist said make us a hell of a christmas dinner mantarakis nodded he figured hed save the tongue and the brains and the kidneys and sweetbreads for himself nobody else was likely to want them anyhow to most soldiers they were guts and not worth having he wished he could get his hands on a little wine so he could saute the kidneys in it of course he wished he were back in philadelphia too so what were wishes worth he unsheathed the bayonet he wore on his left hip twenty inches of sharp steel it wasnt a proper butcher knife but it would do the job hed just squatted down over the lamb when a southern voice thin in the distance called hey you yanks wave a hankie an stick a head up we wont shoot yallits christmas what do we do mantarakis asked peterquist shit they aint gonna lie to us like that the sergeant answered he dug in his pocket and pulled out a handkerchief then gave it a dubious look it was more nearly brown than white he waved it anyway and stuck his head up above the front lip of the trench now he whistled ill be damned that made mantarakis look too the calls kept coming from up and down the confederate line some men in butternut were walking about in front of their trench line any other day of the year they would have been asking to be shot dead on christmas no us troops were coming up out of the trenches too and heading on over toward the drifts of barbed wire that separated one line from the other without waiting on anybodys permission paul scrambled up onto the ground between the trench lines and headed toward the confederate positions too he waited for peterquist to yell at him or try to drag him back but a moment later the sergeant was right up there beside him ill be damned he said again and mantarakis nodded realizing he was still holding the bayonet hed intended to use to cut up the lamb he stuck it back in its leather sheath he wasnt going to need it not today rebs and us soldiers were snipping through barbed wire not to kill one another but to get together say merry christmas and shake hands for a day or at least a moment fifty years and more of hatred vanished as if theyd never been some of the confederates had rifles slung on their shoulders but they like he seemed to have forgotten about them hey you yank one of them called and pointed at him want some seegars got anything you can swap me for em this was tobacco country but the fields had been fought over not harvested and cigars with any luck were going to be habanas anyhow kentucky tobacco couldnt come close to what they grew in cuba ive got some garlic powder and some mint mantarakis answered make your stews taste better if you want em dont like garlic the rebel said and made a face stinks ifn you ask me but mints right nice what other kind o tasty things yall got got some cinnamon a little bit paul said he hid the scorn he held for the confederate how could you dislike garlic but the fellows eyes lit up when he mentioned cinnamon so maybe they had some hope of a deal after all mantarakis dug in his pack and displayed the little tins of spice whereupon the rebel held up four cigars after some dickering they settled on six by then a couple of paths through the wire had been cleared paul went through one of them toward the confederate lines he had the feeling of being partly in a dream as if nothing could happen to him no matter what he did it was the exact opposite of what he usually felt on a battlefield that he was liable to end up dead or mangled in spite of everything he could do to prevent it he handed the tins over to his confederate counterpart and received the cigars in return the bands printed on shiny metallic paper bore the picture of a fellow with a bushy gray beard who the gold letters underneath his face declared was confederate president longstreet whod licked the united states in the second mexican war maybe the cigars were habanas then he sniffed them wherever they came from they smelled pretty good merry christmas yankee the confederate said he was a mediumsized stocky fellow with muttonchops and light brown hair that stuck out from under his cap in all directions as he stowed away the spices he laughed a little dont think i hardly ever said nothin to a damnyankee before cept maybe somethin like hands up fore i shoot you yeah im the same way with you birds pretty much mantarakis said oh maybe a confederate sailor or two had come into one of the philadelphia greasy spoons where hed worked but taking an order for a sandwich or a steak was damn near as impersonal as talking from one side of a rifle to the other he gave his name then said who are you what do you do im colby gilbert paul the rebel answered he stuck out his hand mantarakis shook it the reb grinned right glad to meet you paul long as you dont ask me to say your last name what do i do i got me a farm forty maybe fifty miles outside o little rock arkansas how about your own self cook in philadelphia paul answered no wonder you got them nice spices then you got a family gilbert asked before mantarakis could answer the reb pulled a photograph out of his breast pocket himself a plain blond woman a little boy and a baby of indeterminate sex all in what had to be sunday best this heres me and betsy and colby jr and lucy the baby was a girl then im not married yet mantarakis said a couple of my brothers have children so im an uncle he trotted out a family joke one of my sisters is expecting so ill be an aunt pretty soon too colby gilbert scratched his head then laughed didnt know you damnyankees could be funny never even thought you might aint that queer yeah pretty much paul looked ahead to mortons gap or what was left of it what struck him as funny was being here in a foreign country talking like an old friend with a real live enemy somebody from one trench or another had thrown out a football soldiers from both the usa and the csa wanted a game but before they could play they argued over the rulesthe united states version let you advance the ball by throwing it forward if you did it from five yards back of the scrim line while by the confederacys rules no forward passes could be thrown only laterals the disagreement stayed goodnatured though and when the rebs whooped and cheered to see how far one of the us soldiers could heave the ball and how nimbly another one ran under it and caught it they agreed to try the damnyankee style of play themselves men in greengray and men in butternut stood shoulder to shoulder and cheered the two teams of gladiators wrestling in the mud several flasks went through the crowd paul had a nip of brandy and another of raw searing corn liquor probably because they understood the passing game better the us team won everybody cheered both sides anyway shitfire a loud southern voice declared if id knowed damnyankees was people just like us damn me to hell if idve been so allfired eager to grab me a gun an shoot em you rebels i think you may be christians too that was gordon mcsweeney sounding surprised for once paul didnt blame him if you lived in the usa you figured everybody in the csa grew horns and a pointy tail from the way the confederates talked they seemed to think the same thing about americans what the hell we fightin for then somebody asked mantarakis didnt know whether the question had come from a soldier of the usa or the csa he decided it didnt matter anyhow and nobody tried to answer it the crowd from the football match dispersed slowly reluctantly a few us soldiers followed newmade friends into the confederate lines for supper a few rebs colby gilbert among them came back with the us troops ill show you what garlic is good for mantarakis said going to work on the lamb carcass hed been about to cut up before the impromptu christmas truce broke out gilbert showed his family photo again and admired those of the us soldiers who were married he traded cigars for this and that and did admit the meat paul was cooking smelled mighty good mantarakis had just put a big chunk of roast leg on gilberts mess tin shaped a little different from those the us soldiers carried when lieutenant norman hinshaw the platoon commander came up to the fire no doubt drawn by the rich cooking odors hinshaw stared in dismay at colby gilbert theyre raising hell about this back at regimental headquarters he said if he doesnt get his ass back to his own side weve got to take him prisoner aw have a heart lieutenant mantarakis said at least let him finish eating its christmas right even if it wasnt christmas for him he used the argument without qualm of conscience lieutenant hinshaw looked at the rest of his men when he saw all of them even sergeant peterquist nodding he threw up his hands all right he can stay he said but tomorrow if we see him we kill him same to you lieutenant colby gilbert said nothin personal of course he ate slowly enjoying every bit garlic or no mantarakis gave him another chunk of meat to take back to his own lines a chorus of goodbyes followed him when he left the us trenches as the sun set a couple of hours later a new chorus rang out christmas carols sung first by the us soldiers then by the confederates and at last by both armies together not a shot disturbed the night paul rolled himself in his blanket confident for once hed wake up to see the dawn and when dawn came a savage us artillery bombardment tore at the confederates frontline positions mantarakis huddled in a little ball in the mud for the rebs were shelling the us trenches too maybe the brass on both sides was making sure the truce wouldnt last more than a day if so they got their wish rifles began to bark and machine guns to hammer the war had come back and come back strong later that day it started to snow church bells chimed in as if the new year were something worth celebrating sylvia enos lay alone in her bed listening to the bells to the firecrackers to the occasional gunshots to the sound of happy or at least drunk people in the streets tomorrow was saturday a half day of work and she knew she had to be up before six but she could not relax her mind enough to sleep in the next room george jr whimpered most nights when he did that sylvia prayed hed go right back to sleep now she wouldnt have minded his waking too much she whimpered a little herself and bit her lip to make herself stop not knowing was the hardest part the ripple hadnt come back from georges bank and hadnt come back and hadnt come backand now two months and more after it put out no one not even sylvia thought it would come back but what had happened to it the weather had been goodnot perfect but good so a storm couldnt have sunk the trawler had it collided with another vessel had a confederate commerce raider sunk it and if a raider had sunk it had the crew had a chance to get off first please god do whatever you want with me but let george be safe sylvia said quietly in the darkness she hadnt been much given to prayer before the ripple disappeared but shed found it made her feel she was doing something however small a something for her husband past prayer she had nothing to do at last she fell asleep only to be wakened a few minutes later by a drunken brawl out in the hallway in front of her flat the racket woke mary jane too she was wet so sylvia groggily changed her diaper and put her back to bed the toddler sighed and went to sleep right away sylvia wished shed be so lucky but wasnt when the alarm clock went off beside her head she thought at first it was the bells from the midnight just past the clattering went on and on though under her breath she muttered something george had brought home from t wharf his hair would have curled to hear her say it but there was no one to hear her say it and so she did she struck a match and lighted the gas lamp by the bed then quickly put on her corset shirtwaist and long dark blue wool skirt over her winter underwear she let out a silent thankyou to whatever gods of fashion had decreed bustles no longer mandatory that saved time she stoked up the fire in the stove and set water to boil for oatmeal and for coffee breathing a sigh of relief that shed managed to get through the month with a little coal left in the scuttle she went into the other bedroom to get the children up and moving i dont want to get up george jr moaned i dont want to get up either but i have to and so do you sylvia said he grumbled some more but got out of bed if hed dawdled the flat of her hand on his backside would have got him moving in a hurry and he knew it mary jane on the other hand woke up sweetly as she did most mornings she made the oatmeal put on butter and salt and fed alternate mouthfuls to herself and mary jane while george jr ate the children drank water there had been a tainted milk scare the week before and shed been leery of buying it she wished she had some for her coffee too but if her large wishes werent being granted she didnt expect to get her small ones come on time to go to mrs conevals she said its saturday today so ill be back in the afternoon not at nighttime george jr nodded at that mary jane was still too little to have it mean anything to her brigid coneval lived down at the end of the hall near the bathroom her husband was off at the front in new mexico if sylvias memory was straight instead of going off to work in a factory herself mrs coneval kept body and soul together by using the money he sent home and by caring for the children of other women who had to go out to work and who had no family to mind their own sylvia knocked on her door she had to knock loudly the racket inside the flat was already frightful and when brigid coneval opened the door sylvia saw that only about half her usual mob had arrived good mornin to you mrs enos mrs coneval said in a musical brogue have you had any word of that man o yours now no sylvia said bleakly just nothing she urged her children into the flat saying as she did every day do as mrs coneval tells you and play nicely with the other children george jr kissed her goodbye mary jane nibbled the end of her nose which amounted to the same thing inside the flat somebody sneezed sylvia sighed cooping her children up with so many others was asking for them to come down with colds or worse diphtheria and measles whooping cough and chicken pox though george jr had already had most of those ran riot in wintertime when people stayed tightly packed together so much of the time but what else could she do unlike brigid coneval she had no husband sending home even a little money for all she knew she had no husband at all shaking her head she went downstairs and out into the street it was still dark outside the sun wouldnt be up for most of another hour breath making a foggy cloud around her she walked down to the corner and waited for the trolley up it came a few minutes later she climbed in and dropped her nickel in the fare box a fellow in a rain slicker who looked like a fisherman stood up to give her his seat she took it with a murmur of thanks she changed trolleys then got off and walked over to the canning plant a square brick building that looked ancient though it wasnt and that smelled of fish even more powerfully than t wharf the workers coming in with her were a mixed lot some white men who hadnt yet been called into the army some colored men who werent likely to be called into the army unless things got even worse than they were already and a lot of women like her who needed to keep body and soul together and families running while their men were gone a couple of women were wearing black theyd lost their husbands in the fighting that sprawled across north america sylvia wondered if she should be doing the same stubbornly she refused to give up hope she wouldnt don widows weeds till she knew for a fact she was a widow before shed had to look for work shed never operated anything more complicated than a sewing machine the machine that put labels on cans of mackerel as they came sliding along a conveyor belt wasnt much more complicated you pulled a lever to shunt the can off the belt another one to route it through the machine and a third to send it on its way now adorned with a fish that looked more like a tuna than a mackerelbut since the housewife in ohio or the bachelor in nebraska had probably never seen either in the flopping flesh what harm was done you did have to watch out that the labelling machine didnt run out of paste and every once in a while the endless strip of labels would jam when that happened you had to shut down the line till you could clear and fix the feed mechanism most days though it was just pull this one pull that one pull the other one then pull this one again from the start of the shift right through to the end sometimes time crawled by sometimes it sped sylvia had found herself almost mesmerized by what she was doing and had an hour or two slip by al most without conscious thought you could talk through the clatter of thousands of cans and of the machinery that moved them on their way but often there wasnt a whole lot to say saturday halfshift often passed more slowly at least in mental terms than a full days work sylvia had expected that especially after being off for the new years holiday but it didnt happen she came out into the bright winter sun with the feeling that she had a lot of time to do the rest of the days chores she went to the grocers and the butchers and the yardgoods store for cloth and patterns for the clothes her children would be wearing come spring good to see you mrs enos the clerk there said as he took her money business has been slow a lot of people are buying readytowear goods these days making them myself is cheaperif i can find the time sylvia shook her head she didnt have much money since george had disappeared but she didnt have much time either how could you win when she got back to her apartment building she checked the rank of mailboxes in the front hall she found a couple of advertising circulars a christmas card from her cousin in new york she muttered rude things about the post office and an envelope with a stamp she did not recognize and a rubberstamped notice saying it had been forwarded through the international society of red cross organizations the rubber stamp nearly obscured the address when she got a look at that she shivered and felt so lightheaded she had to lean against the iron bank of mailboxes for a moment before she could open the envelope it was in her husbands handwriting dear sylvia the note inside read i want you to know i am all right and not hurt the ripple was caught and sunk by the here someone had rendered a word or two illegible with black ink they took us to north carolina where i am now they treat us well the food is all right you can write me in care of the red cross and it will get to me sooner or later they may end up letting me go in a while because i wasnt in the navy and they exchange civilians with the united states i hope so i love you give my love to the children to i hope i see you before to long love again from your george sylvia leaned against the mailboxes again tears ran down her cheeks oh dear henrietta collingwood a neighbor said as she came downstairs she pointed to the letter sylvia was still holding i hope it is not bad news by her voice she sounded certain it was but sylvia shook her head no henrietta she said the best news of all he is alive come on niggerlovers get movin the confederate guard said he gestured with the bayonet of his rifle as if he would have liked to use it on the crew of the ripple george enos and the rest of the captured fishermen obediently got up and headed across the barbedwire enclosure of fort johnston for their daily louse inspection anybody discovered with the little pests got his hair washed with kerosene and his clothes and bedding baked in an oven that killed the lice for a while but in a week or two theyd be back again enos shivered the wind off the atlantic here at the outlet of the cape fear river was bitingly cold though he still had on the gear hed been wearing when the commerce raider swamp fox captured the ripple i thought north carolina was supposed to be hot and sticky all the time he said shut up niggerlover the guard said his voice flat and harsh enos would have been surprised if he was eighteen his face was full of angry red blotches but he had a gun and he had the rest of the confederate army behind him so enos shut up the crew of the ripple had that unlovely handle hung on them because theyd insisted on treating charlie white like a human being even after the swamp fox plucked them off the steam trawler and then sank it technically they were detainees not prisoners of war us commerce raiders had scooped up confederate merchant seamen too they were being exchanged one for one in the order of capture using the good offices of the kingdom of spain one of the few nations neutral in the fight that roiled across the world enos figured hed probably get back to boston about a week before the war ended if it ever did he hadnt said that in his letter to sylvia but it remained at the back of his mind no matter what anybody called him though george felt like a prisoner of war the worst of it was he hadnt even been at war when the confederates nabbed him all hed been doing was trying to make a living the rebels didnt give a damn about that to them capturing a fishing boat counted as a blow against the united states it struck him as dreadfully unfair war was about soldiers and sailors it wasnt about fishermen not as far as he was concerned but nobody cared what he thought nobody cared how much he missed his wife either that was something else war was about not caring off to one side chips flew as charlie white chopped firewood the cook worked with grim intensity slamming the axe down again and again it was his turn for the job enos had done it a couple of days before and yesterday a sailor off a freighter the swamp fox had sent to the bottom the rebs didnt work charlie any differently from the way they worked their other detainees that would have been against international law and they would have caught hell for it when word got back to the united states but they didnt treat him as they would have treated a white man either always jeering at himand to a lesser degree at the crewmen of the ripple for insisting he was their friend not a servant or a pet they had negro servants here at fort johnston men who acted like dogs around southern whites enos wondered what they used for selfrespect he didnt have much left himself the medical orderlythe rebs didnt waste a doctor on damnyankees not unless they were dyingsnapped bend over niggerlover when enos obeyed the fellow ran fingers through his hair examining the nape of his neck and the short hairs behind his ears reluctantly the orderly said all right youre cleango on enos went he suspected the rebs of claiming the men from the ripple were lousy even when they werent just so they could put them through the process of getting rid of the vermin afterwards your head smelled for days as if youd been soaking it in the well of a kerosene lantern to give him his due the medical officer did try to keep from spreading lice from one man to another between inspections he dipped his hands into a bowl from which rose the antiseptic smell of dilute carbolic acid then dried them on a towel he looked over patrick odonnell and let the captain of the ripple pass inspection in the same grudging manner he had enos odonnell went over to the barbed wire and stood around looking bored enos walked up and stood beside him another exciting day isnt it skipper he said you might say that odonnell allowed both men laughed about the only excitement in these parts was finding out whether your days ration of cornbread had mold or not and whether the chunk of boiled sowbelly the rebs gave you with it was all fat or whether it had a tiny bit of real meat attached thinking of that made george enos laugh again remember that time when fred got a whole strip of meat in his sowbelly i bet they fired the cook who gave it to him the day after because it sure hasnt happened again bet youre right the skipper said sure sounded like they were giving somebody holy hell that night too mightve been the cook ever so casually he turned and glanced toward the disappearing turrets that held fort johnston s three twelveinch guns any ships that tried to ascend the cape fear river and bombard or mine wilmington north carolina would have to pass the guns here and in other forts farther up the river enos wouldnt have liked to try it in their endless practices the rebs seemed very alert hed never asked odonnell why he spent so much time by the wire it wasnt really his concern and confirming his suspicions wouldnt have done him or the captain of the ripple any good but he was pretty sure that when they finally did get exchanged odonnell would give the us navy a set of drawings for the interior grounds of fort johnston better than anything they had now enos had other things on his mind you think theyll give us our jobs back when we get out of here he asked god only knows what sylvias doing to make ends meet i hope you get your job back george odonnell answered with me it doesnt matter so much a skipper who lost his ship even if it wasnt his fault had trouble getting another one but that wasnt what odonnell meant if and when the confederates shipped him back to the united states he was going straight into the navy theyd be glad to have him again what with his experience theyd probably be glad to have george enos too hed never served on a warship but he was a sailor hed have an easier time figuring out what was going on than some landlubber from dakota he didnt want to go into the navy the way odonnell did being kept away from sylvia and his children had forcibly reminded him how much he missed them you went aboard a cruiser you were there for months at a time and even when you got back to port who could say where that port would be if you were in san diego say and got fortyeight hours liberty so what you couldnt get back to boston let alone make the round trip in that length of time he laughed whats funny odonnell asked thinking about getting liberty and what id do with it if im too far from home to go back and if i join the navy and if i ever get out of here too damn many ifs enos laughed again hell liberty from the navy is one thing liberty from here is a whole different one to that patrick odonnell could only nod and liberty from fort johnston was a different thing for the two white men from what it was for charlie white a confederate soldier walked up and stood watching the ripples cook chop wood hey nigger he said in an assumed tone of casual interest you think maybe back fore we manumitted you coons my pa or granddad fucked your mother charlie stopped chopping for a horrible second george was afraid hed try to use his hatchet against a rifle but he just paused then shook his head nah if that had happened id be a whole lot uglier every detainee who heard the answer howled and jeered at charlies comeback the reb whod walked into it turned red as brick he started to bring his rifle to bear on the cook now the detainees yelled even louder for a confederate officer before anybody with bars or stars on his collar got to the barbedwire enclosure the soldier lowered the rifle snarling nigger gets uppity he gets his sooner or later wait an see if he dont you havent got the balls to do that to anybody who could shoot back lucas phelps told him fuck you too palfuck you special the guard said phelps slowly and deliberately turned his back and walked away the guard raised his voice where you think youre goin niggerlover to the shithouse the fisherman answered over his shoulder im gonna pretend the hole is your face watch it lucas george enos said softly then he and all the other fishermen cried out in alarm and horror for the guard brought the rifle up to his shoulder took aimhe could hardly have missed not from a range of twenty feet at the mostand fired at the back of lucas phelps head phelps took another half step and then crumpled surely dead before he knew what hit him george got a good look at the blasted ruin the bullet had made of his face as it exited all the detainees screamed murder at the top of their lungs at the sound of the shot an officer did come he led the soldier away two days later the fellow was back at his post looking meaner than ever nobody said a word to him not if he could help it enos had another reason to hope exchange came soon it was already too late for his comrade viii d ashing in spats and a doublebreasted herringbone overcoat with a breast pocket slanted at the latest angleor so he saidherman bruck came into the socialist party headquarters with a copy of the new york times in one hand he quickly hung his homburg on a tree and got out of the overcoat it was icy outside but very much the reverse with a couple of coal stoves and a steam radiator heating the office he went over to flora hamburger and set the newspaper on the desk in front of her bully speech by senator debs he said pointing the newsprint had smudged on the gray calfskin of his gloves flora bent over it let me see she said debs had been the first socialist elected to the senate coming out of indiana when the republicans broke up in disarray in the aftermath of the second mexican war hed been there ever since and twice run unsuccessfully for president our losses in a few brief months have exceeded all those in the war of secession till now our bloodiest conflict flora read aloud soon they will exceed those in all our previous wars combined and for what for what i ask mr president when we fought to keep the confederate states from abandoning our union we fought for a principle that the covenant of the united states once made was indissoluble here on what great principle do we stand that the european alliances with which we have entangled ourselves be honoured when even to be in them is to hold no honour how splendid how noble what a fine principle for which to crucify mankind on a cross of blood and iron she looked up in admiration several people whod been listening to her broke into applause that is strong stuff she said bruck nodded as proud as if hed made the speech himself when debs crosses swords with tr sparks always fly flora nodded she read on down the column to the reply by senator lodge who often spoke as roosevelt s surrogate in the senate halfway through the summary of his remarks she winced and softly quoted one sentence the distinguished gentlemans remarks on the power of principle would seem more forceful had he not in this very chamber recently voted to support and finance the war he now so eloquently professes to despise her chin went up in defiance i knew that was a mistake and i said so at the time so you did bruck admitted he saw the smudges on his gloves and took them off his hands were winter pale he spread them but what could we do if wed voted against the credits we wouldnt have had five socialists left in congress after the november elections as things are we picked up half a dozen seats what good does it do us to pick them up if we dont act like socialists once we have them flora said a secretary an italian woman named maria tresca who along with her sister angelina was one of the few gentiles in the tenth ward office quoted from the new testament what is a man profited if he shall gain the whole world and lose his own soul it was not language commonly heard in the socialist party office but no less effective for that herman bruck spread his hands again weve been talking about that ever since the party decided to run for office and accept seats if we won does working within the government advance the cause of the proletariat or delay the revolution the argument that spawned kept the office lively the rest of the day while bruck was putting on his hat and overcoat to leave for the evening he asked flora would you like to go to the moving pictures with me the orpheum is showing the new play with sarah bernhardt in it i cant herman she answered also buttoning her coat were having cousins over for supper and i promised my mother i wouldnt be late herman bruck made a sour face maybe he suspected the cousins were fictitious as in fact they were that though wasnt the sort of thing it was politic to say another time maybe he mumbled and hurried out the door angelina tresca sent flora an amused look she returned one of resolute innocence the less you admitted to anyone the less you had to worry about getting to the wrong ears flora waited a few moments so she wasnt likely to run into bruck on the street then went downstairs and walked home to her flat cooking odors filled the hallway as she came up to her door when she opened it more came out sweetandsour stuffed cabbage tonight she thought along with that savory scent came smoke from her fathers pipe it was harsher than it had been hed smoked mail pouch for years but the virginia and kentucky tobaccos that went into the blend werent available any more now he fed the pipe with something called corn cake which smelled as far as flora was concerned like burning corn husks she kept quiet about that not wanting to hurt his feelings esther was in the kitchen helping their mother david and isaac bent over a chess board at the table from which they would soon be evicted so everyone could eat supper flora glanced at the game isaac was a couple of pawns up which was unusual his brother beat him more often than not the two mental warriors said hello without looking up from their battlefield and how are things with you today benjamin hamburger asked all right flora answered im tired the moment the words were out of her mouth she felt ashamed of them sophie was the one who had the right to complain about being tired she worked longer hours at a harder job for less pay than her younger sister especially since the start of the useless stupid war sophie had been dragging herself home exhausted every night as if thinking about her were enough to bring her home sophie came in just then worn out as usual she sank down onto the divan couch with a soft sigh and a posture so limp it said she didnt want to have to get up again for anything in the world esther stuck her head out of the kitchen and said oh good that was you i thought i heard the door ready in a minute sophie nodded wearily shed even been too tired to eat lately which alarmed her mother esthers eyes flicked to her brothers pointedly she repeated ready in a minute when that didnt shift them she started setting the table they had to move the chess set in a hurry to keep from having a plate land on top of it supper almost made flora wish shed gone out with herman bruck her family didnt really want to hear about socialist party doings not even her father all any of them seemed to care about was ways to rise into the bourgeoisie not how to aid and radicalize the vast masses of the proletariat she sadly shook her head her own flesh and blood class enemies they didnt even try to understand the goals toward which she worked after supper she and esther washed and dried dishes esther wanted to talk about how the war was going flora didnt that it was going at all was bitter as wormwood to her as soon as shed put the last fork in its drawer she got her coat and went out onto the fire escape her mothers voice pursued her were not good enough for you but that wasnt it even if her family thought it was it was just that she didnt fit in among them and the harder they tried to drive her back into what had been her place the less it suited her it was chilly out there but not intolerable the nip of january air on her cheeks made her feel as if she were in a sleigh gliding down some quiet country road not in the middle of the most crowded part of the biggest city in the united states though she had to ignore the racket from her building and all the others to make the illusion complete a couple of minutes later sophie stepped out to join her fresh air her older sister said gratefully its so stuffy in there flora sent her a sympathetic look and you were cooped up in front of your sewing machine all day before that she said no wonder you want to get all the air you can she wouldnt have called new york city s air full of smoke and soot and fumes fresh but if her sister wanted to she wouldnt argue either sophie stepped down to the edge of the landing and looked over the iron rail it was dark down there with nothing worth mentioning to see not really to flora not really to anyone sophie said i should throw myself off alarmed flora hurried over to her and put an arm around her shoulder dragging her away from the rail whats wrong she demanded is it something at work i know theyve been exploiting you without mercy giving you much too much to try to do the way you come home every night sophie shook her head its nothing to do with work she said and they arent working me any harder than they were before exploiting she laughed softly though not in a way that said she thought anything was truly funny its not anything political then what is it flora asked people dont talk about jumping off a building for nothing you know her sisters shiver had nothing to do with cold no more than her laugh had had anything to do with mirth what is it flora do you really want to know of course i do flora answered indignant now im your sister that counts for more than politics even if we dont agree all the time yes but it was politics you thought of first sophie sighed i suppose i may as well tell you i have to tell someoneand if i dont itll be plain enough before long anyway what are you talking about flora said just come out and say it if youre going to all right then but sophie needed to gather herself before she brought the words out all in one lowvoiced rush flora im going to have a baby her sister stared she felt as if shed walked in front of a train without seeing or hearing it coming how did it happen she whispered dimly lit by the lamps from the front room sophies face twisted how did it happen theres only one way i know of yossel was going into the army and i didnt know when id see him again or if id see him again and i wanted to give him something special before he left and so i and so we she didnt go on and then after a moment she did i gave him something special didnt i all at once without warning she started to cry does mother know youre expecting flora asked she put her arm around her sister who clung to her like a survivor from a torpedoed liner sophie shook her head violently against floras shoulder i couldnt tell her she exclaimed i told you because she gulped and stopped flora didnt have any trouble figuring out what her sister hadnt said be cause youre the radical one the one who believes in socialism and free love something like that anyhow flora had had men approach her on that basis some of them men in the socialist party but being free to love didnt mean you had to and didnt mean loving was free from consequences either well sophie surely knew that now even if she hadnt thought it through before and sophie wasnt some man trying to entice her into something sordid she was her sister youre going to have to tell her sooner or later flora said gently at which sophie cried harder flora found another question does yossel know sophie shook her head again every time i write him i mean to tell him but i just cant hes going to be your husband flora said if he lives she fought that thought down that makes it a little better if he werent in the army im sure hed marry you right now sophie nodded but if yossel hadnt been going into the army sophie probably wouldnt have given herself to him till they were married in which case they wouldnt have had this problem what am i going to do sophie wailed but softly not wanting anyone inside to hear her the obvious answer was youre going to have this baby what sprang from that flora thought at last as if shed just come up with a good campaign plank for a congressional candidate she clapped her hands together also softly we wont tell mother she said mother is too perfectly conventional for words all shell do is throw a fit and we dont need that not now sophie nodded again looking at her with a mixture of hope and dread we cant keep from telling her forever though she warned of itself one hand went to her belly pretty soon shell know regardless of what we say i wasnt finished flora said she has to know before she finds out that way no we wont tell her well tell papa he wont get excited the way mother would he has some common sense and then after he and we figure out what to say he can tell mother for us he can be awhats the word i wanta buffer thats it i dont know again sophies shiver had nothing to do with the cold it has to be done it will be better afterwards flora insisted as if to someone with a toothache whom she was trying to get to go to the dentist dread drove hope from her sisters face once more it wont be better sophie said quietly it will never be better not any more flora feared she was right even so she opened the window that gave access to the fire escape and said papa can you come out here for a moment please benjamin hamburger had been standing over the kitchen table kibitzing that game of chessor maybe a new one by nowbetween david and isaac a puff of smoke rose from his pipe when he exhaled in surprise all the plots hatched out there and this is the first time ive been invited he remarked as he walked over and stepped out onto the landing that mild irony encouraged flora she closed the window isaac david esther and her mother all peered out toward the fire escape they were used to her going out there they were used to sophies going out there every so often but when the two of them invited their father out that was new so it had to be suspect flora hadnt thought of that keeping the secret wouldnt be easy but having started she couldnt very well draw back her father was looking from her to sophie and back again if he wasnt the picture of curiosity hed do till a better one came along flora hoped sophie would say what needed saying when she didnt flora sighed and said papa we have to tell you something then she stopped it wasnt easy not when you got down to it her father looked back and forth again what you have to tell me it isnt good news he said after a moment flora nodded that was true while she was trying to find the best way to break the news sophie blurted oh papa im going to have a baby and burst into tears all over again flora waited for the sky to fall sophie looked as if she wanted to sink through the iron floor their father stood quiet for a moment then slowly he said i wondered theres a look women have in that condition and you have it and youre tired all the time the way your mother was when she carried you so yes i wondered he sighed i hoped not but will you tell mother flora asked breathing more easily on finding his reaction was what shed hoped it would be she already knows or wonders too her father said which made flora and sophie both stare he coughed a couple of times before he went on remember sophie she does your laundry and he stopped most abruptly and coughed some more after a moment flora understood why her face heated of all the things her father had never expected to do discussing intimate bodily functions with his daughters had to rank high on the list again though without some other intimate bodily functions the discussion would not have arisen and if their mother had known or at least suspected and kept quiet about it that said there was more to her than flora had suspected what am i going to do sophie wailed what are we going to do benjamin hamburger stood silent again the best we can he answered i dont know what else to say to you right now the best we can flora had been worried a few minutes before but now she began to hope that best might be good enough abner dowling escaped first army headquarters with the air of a man leaving the scene of a crime that was how he felt providence kentucky was less than ten miles away from the front lines the pounding of us guns and answering fire from confederate artillerywas a neverending rumble from the east irksome like a lowgrade headache dowling pulled his cap lower over his face so the brim would keep the rain and occasional spatters of snow out of his eyes general custer liked being up as close to the front as he could get in the stables the grooms kept his saddle ready to be slapped onto his horse at a moments notice so he could lead the charge that would tear the rebel position wide open he doesnt understand dowling muttered half to himself half to the god who had so far paid remarkably little attention to any of his petitions the major went on still half prayerfully even a blind man should be able to see that slamming forward in the middle of winter isnt going to get you anywhere one of the things serving under custer had taught him was the difference between should be able to and can the general kept feeding men and shells into the fight every furlong of bloody advance was hailed as the beginning of a breakthrough every time the confederates held seen as their last gasp theyve had more gasps than a brothel dowling said his belly shook as he laughed at his own wit custer didnt laugh at anything no that wasnt true when he heard about a squad of rebs machinegunned as they foolishly broke cover hed chortled till his upper plate fell out of his mouth a train chugged into providence out of the west another reason the little town was currently first army headquarters was that the railroad tracks came under confederate artillery fire when you got a little closer to the front line doors opened soldiers in greengray their uniforms clean and neat their faces open and naive spilled out of the cars and formed up into columns under the profane instructions of their noncoms mud spattered their boots and puttees and breeches the main streets of providence had been paved with bricks but the confederates had fought for the town before finally retreating from it the us bombardment and later confederate shellfire from the east had torn great gaps in the paving the soldiers stared down anxiously at the dirt they were picking up as if expecting the corporals and sergeants to start screaming about that unblooded troops dowling thought with a sigh they conscientiously marched in step as they tramped toward the front they wouldnt worry about dirt there not even a little bit theyd be blooded and bloodied all too soon meat for the meat grinder custers adjutant said sadly another engine got up steam and moved slowly along a side track till it switched onto the one down which the troop train had come then it backed up and coupled to the rear of that train meanwhile as soon as the troops the train had disgorged marched off toward the front other soldiers began refilling the long chain of cars they were meat on which the grinder had already done its work some of them the ones with arms in slings or with bandages on their faces climbed aboard under their own power and some of those seemed pretty cheerful why not theyd been wounded yes but they were probably going to get better and they were going back to hospitals well away from the front nobody would be shooting at them not for a while but after the ambulatory patients came the great many who had to be carried onto the train in litters some of them moaned as their bearers moved them some didnt but lay very still none of themnone of the walking wounded either wore fresh uniforms theirs were tattered and dirty and their faces even those of the men who seemed chipper were a study in contrast to the way the raw troops looked theyd seen the elephant and hed stepped on them dowling wished custer would come and take a look at what soldiers who had been through the grinder were like but that didnt interest the general he saw the glory hed win with victory not the price he was paying for advances that looked not the least bit victorious to anyone but him down the street about a block and a half from first army headquarters stood a nondescript brick building that hadnt been too badly shelled providence was supposed to be a dry town but if you needed a drink you could find one dowling needed one now the negro behind the bar poured whiskey over ice and pushed the glass across to him here yare suh he said thanks uhwhats your name anyhow havent seen you here before no suh im new hereabouts names aurelius suh you could do worse youre named after a great man dowling said by the bartenders smile polite but meaningless he didnt know anything about marcus aurelius dowling gulped down the whiskey and shoved the glass back for a refill he didnt know why hed expected a southern negro to know anything about the roman empire from everything hed seen the rebs did everything they could to keep their negroes ignorant he asked how do you like it in the united states the bartender gave him a hooded look of the sort he was used to getting from soldiers whod been caught with dirty rifles dont seem too bad so far suh the fellow answered aint easy nowheres though you dont mind me sayin so and that was probably no certainly nothing but the truth dowling thanked his rather deaf god hed been born with a nice pink skin niggers had it tough usa csa any old place maybe you should go to haiti he remarked thats nigger heaven if ever there was one no suh the bartender sounded very sure of himself only difference tween haiti and anywhere else is in haiti its black folks doin it to black folks stead o whites like it is here you may be right dowling said and sipped his drink what he knew about haiti was what a soldier of the united states needed to know that the confederates hated and despised the place because the negroes there no matter what they did to one another were free and independent and that teddy roosevelt had reaffirmed loudly reaffirmed president reeds pledge to protect that independence one of the things he didnt know was how tr would go about making good on that pledge if the confederates invaded haiti with confederate cuba so close by with the long stretch of southern coastline past which the us navy would have to steam it wouldnt be easy or had tr intended to invade the csa if the rebs attacked haiti he shrugged trying to read teddys mind was always risky anyway the usa had invaded the csa without a confederate attack on haiti as he raised the whiskey glass to his lips the rumble of artillery fire outside got louder dowlings head came up like a hunting dogs at a scent the new roar of the big guns wasnt coming from the east but from the south he slammed the glass down onto the bar whiskey sloshed over the side he slammed down a couple of coins to pay for his drinks and then as an afterthought an extra dime as well here buy yourself a drink he told aurelius its the one i would have had in a minute he rushed out of the bar and back toward first army headquarters the rebel counterattack the one between hopkinsville and cadiz and the one custer had insisted all along was impossiblehad finally started dowling wondered how far the us forces would have to retreat and how fast a lieutenant clad in butternut spun on his heel and stomped away from the field telephone muttering unsweet nothings under his breath that meant it was jake featherstons turn to confront the marvel of the electrified age to the corporal in charge of the care and feeding of the mechanical beast he said put me through to the main artillery dump back toward red lion ill give it a shot the corporal said showing less than perfect faith in the gadget with which hed been entrusted he turned the crank and shouted into the mouthpiece hello central when nobody shouted back at him he muttered something that made what the lieutenant had said sound like an endearment he cranked again hello central goddammit waiting for the connectionwaiting to see if the corporal could make the connection featherston wished hed sent a runner back to red lion it was only a few miles southwest of martinsville the runner wouldnt have needed more than two hours three at the outside to make it there and back again but captain stuart was hellbent for leather about using the very latest thing sometimes featherston admitted to himself that was because the very latest thing was better than what had gone before his battery of frenchinspired threeinch guns certainly fell into that class but sometimes the very latest thing was just newfangled confusion replacing oldfashioned stupidity or worse replacing something that worked well even if it had been around for a long time hello central the corporal screamed featherston was about to give it up as a bad job and walk off he could tell the captain hed tried to use the phone but it hadnt wanted to work when the operator said in reverent tones ill be a son of a bitch he turned to jake whod you say you wanted to talk to again been so long i plumb forgot the main artillery dump jake answered and the corporal relayed his words to the central switchboard now if the wire between there and the ammunition dump wasnt broken he might be able to save some time after all but even when as they sometimes did negro labourers buried phone lines as they laid them shell hits would dig them up and break them and water soaked through insulation and but to his amazement after a couple of minutes the corporal handed him the earpiece and said go ahead main ammo dump he bawled into the mouthpiece hed had botched connections before too even when everything was supposed to be working perfectly sometimes you were better off sending morse over the line but now a thin scratchy voice sounded in the earpiece thats right whore you and what dyou need jake featherston first richmond howitzers jake didnt say he was just a lowly sergeant if the fellow on the other end of the line wanted to assume he was the battery commander that was all right with him it was better than all right in fact because he was more likely to be taken seriously that way were giving the damnyankees on the other side of the susquehanna tarnation or we would be cept were mighty low on shells whole armys mighty low on shells that disembodied voice answered we can maybe get you a few up there but not a whole lot sorry the soldier back in safe comfortable red lion didnt sound sorry as best jake could make out over this infernal apparatus he sounded bored saying no was a lot easier over a wire than face to face the yankees get time to consolidate theyre gonna hit us back hard featherston said these past few weeks every mile forward had been gained only by wading through blood the confederates stood on the susquehanna featherston wondered if theyd ever stand on the delaware the telephone reproduced a sigh featherstitch or whatever your name is i cant give you what i aint got some of the shells we were supposed to be gettin they went to kentucky instead for the big push there we dont got enough to do two things both at once jake demanded jesus christ is this an army or a man whos too stupid to fart while he walks that got him a chuckle as tinny as the sigh had been makes you feel any better first richmond the yanks are as bad off as we uns you can shoot off shells fastern you can make em and thats a fact yeah but if the yanks are short in kentucky and fullup here stead o the other way round that doesnt do us a hell of a lot of good featherston said send you all i can promise the fellow back at the dump said you better you expect us to keep fightin the war featherston told him he hung the earpiece back on its hook with a crash muttering son of a bitch acts like theyre his goddamn shells the corporal in charge of the telephone whod undoubtedly heard language a lot worse than that snickered still fuming jake headed off toward the guns if the dump didnt send enough shells forward as seemed highly likely captain stuart would have to do the calling next time what was the point of carrying a famous name if you couldnt exploit it every now and then when featherston got back to his battery he discovered his men gathered around a major hed never seen before a major of infantry for the single stars showing his rank were mounted on bluefaced collar tabs whats up jake asked which really meant what the devil is the infantry doing sniffing around an artillery unit the major turned to him the fellow wasnt very big and his face wasnt very tough but featherston wouldnt have wanted any damnyankee with those hard gray eyes staring at him over the sights of a springfield almost without realizing hed done it he stiffened to attention and saluted crisply the major returned the salute clarence potter army of northern virginia intelligence he said his voice was harsh and clipped and had a trace of a yankee accent featherston wondered if hed gone to college in the united states potter went on i am here to investigate a conspiracy threatening the security not only of this army but of the confederate states of america jesus christ jake exclaimed and then said excuse me sir but i dont know anything about anything like that and id be right surprisedid be more than right surprisedif anybody here does thats what we were tellin him sarge jethro bixler said the loader went on all we want to do all any of us want to do is tie a can to the damnyankees tails and then get back to what we was doin fore the damn war started sergeant if your men are as good with their gunnery as they are at flapping their gums the confederate states are in good hands major potter said if youll listen ill tell you exactly why im here what i want to know is how far do you trust the niggers in this battery the niggers featherston scratched his head havent hardly thought about the niggers they do what we tell em and thats that you want to know the truth of it most of the time i worry about the horses more somethings wrong with a nigger he can tell you what it is and where it hurts with horses you got to guess thats how it is all right bixler said and the rest of the gun crew nodded agreement featherston relaxed his best guess was that the intelligence unit had too much time on its hands and was running around making work for itself so it would look busy and important but clarence potter shook his head as if reading jakes mind thats what they want you to think he said in a low voice if hed had long mustaches and twirled them he would have looked as well as sounded like a stage villain he went on weve broken up four cells of red rebellion in the niggers of this army in the past two weeks one of them was in another artillery battery i wont name names but we found out the niggers there were sabotaging shells so they wouldnt go off when they came down on the yankees heads i be go to hell jake said softly the rest of his men gaped at the major from intelligence it is a fact potter declared we shot four buck niggers yesterday gave them blindfolds and cigars and tied them to posts and shot them dead one thing this war has brought out is how deeply the rot has spread through the confederate states half the niggers in government service and half the niggers back home it seems have been plotting against the white race and the confederate government and likely plotting against them for years we will crush those plots if it means giving half our niggers blindfolds and cigarsif that is what we require gentlemen that is what we shall do for the sake of our race and for the sake of our country i have trouble imagining anything like that in this battery sir featherston said by the look in his eye major clarence potter had no trouble imagining almost any sort of trouble anywhere featherston continued havent had reports from the aeroplane pilots or the ground spotters that were shootin too many duds anything like that and besideshe laughed ruefullyit aint like we got that many shells any which way live or dud he explained where hed been and why were investigating that particular scandal too potter said in a tone of voice that did not bode well for whoever he and his cohorts decided was to blame featherston didnt know whether it was a scandal or not the fellow back at the ammunition dump had a point though jake wouldnt have admitted it to him not in a million years you could shoot off shells a hell of a lot easier than you could make them red revolutionaries in the army jethro bixler sounded incredulous those are the crazy people who throw bombs at senators things like that not all of them are crazy not even close potter said life would be simpler if they were a lot of them are as hard to spot as a rattler in dry leaves and every bit as deadly so gentlemen have you seen any negroes acting in any way suspicious any way at all jake glanced over toward the labourers and teamsters who were standing around watching the artillerymen chew the fat with this stranger you couldnt tell anything from their faces but then you never could jakes father had taught him that almost before he was out of short pants overseers lore even though there werent any overseers left not in the old sense of the word since manumission went through he wouldnt have given long odds against the negroes knowing who potter was jungle telegraph white men called it he wondered what the blacks thought well the major snapped for close to half a minute nobody said anything featherston understood that even if the labourers and teamsters were imperfectly loyal how was the battery supposed to function without them if major potter arrested them who if anybody would replace them the saying about the devil you knew and the devil you didnt held true here or it mostly held true jake said captain stuarts nigger pompey hes not uppity but he thinks a good deal of himself if you know what i mean i do indeed know exactly what you mean sergeant potter said his voice grim and predatory jake would not have liked to get in his way but then even the ironeyed intelligence officer hesitated captain stuart you say that would be captain jeb stuart iii wouldnt it yes sir sure would featherston agreed damnation major potter muttered under his breath well well see what we can do about finding out what this buck pompey knows if he knows anything he walked off looking unhappy jethro bixler laughed softly every time theres an election everybody starts brayin about how one white man hes just as good as the next sounds mighty fine dont it look what its worth when you bump up against one of the big ones though the crew of featherstons gun nodded all together but then an ammunition wagon came doggedly forward over the muddy road this here first richmond howitzers called the driver a white man when the gun crew nodded again the fellow said why the devil didnt you say this here was jeb stuarts battery jeb stuart iii needs ammunition by jesus he gets it featherston started to laugh the rest of the gun crew joined in uproariously the driver first gaped and then started to get mad for some reason that only made jake laugh harder every coin had two sides if pompey was plotting revolution hed be hard to get rid of because captain stuart liked him and trusted him but if the battery needed shells shells the battery would have because captain stuart commanded it with a little luck jake said the good outweighs the bad winter blew through manitoba so that when spring finally came you wondered to find anything standing arthur mcgregor thanked god that the americans didnt come out to any of the farms very often they were from everything hed seen and heard holed up in towns and along railroad tracks not many of them had been ready for a winter like this one he hoped they were a lot colder and more uncomfortable than he was serves em right he said over supper one long early february night salt pork from pigs hed raised himself and bread baked from his own wheat they wanted to come up here and take away whats ours did they i wish theyd take our winter and ship it back to the usa with em to some place that could use a hard one maryland maybe or what was the name of that state of theirs geography had never been his favourite subject in school and he hadnt cracked a school book in more than half a lifetime his son alexander was no great scholar either but his memory was fresher than arthurs california he suggested thats the one i meant arthur mcgregor agreed they say there are parts of that state where it doesnt snow for years and years at a time alexander said i cant hardly believe that well alexander when did they tell you that you knew everything there was to know his mother asked with just enough chuckle in her voice to take away the sting the way medicine was sweetened to fight its bitter taste now maude arthur mcgregor said i have trouble believing that too hed lived in manitoba since he was about ten years old and in ontario before that neither province went without snow for years at a time from october through april you counted yourself lucky if you went without snow for a week but from the way the us soldiers had trouble with the cold here he thought it likely they were used to a much milder climate if you started thinking the whole world was like the part of it where you lived you were going to be wrong a lot of the time maude got up and carried dishes to the kitchen she was coming back for a second load when somebody knocked on the door maude froze arthur admired her for not dropping any of the dishes ice that had nothing to do with the weather ran up his back the best he could hope for was that it was a neighbor in some kind of trouble the worst sometimes when the americans ran short of supplies they made up the lack by plundering the people whose land theyd invaded alexander mcgregor pointed to the cabinet where theyd hidden the rifle arthur mcgregor shook his head one gun against however many us soldiers might have been out there wasnt betting odds the knock came again louder more insistent now arthur thought about getting the gun none of his neighbors would have knocked like that which left american troops as the next best bet but one against however many still looked grim slowly he walked to the door whos there he called without putting his hand on the latch two words came through the timbers a friend mcgregor scratched his head any neighbor would have said who he was and probably would have been angry at him for not opening up right away too and the americans would also have said who they were loudly and rudely whom did that leave nobody likely to come to his door he could think of what kind of friend he demanded the answer came back at once a cold one dammit he scowled but threw the door wide when he saw the uniformed rifleman outside in the snow he thought the fellow was an american then he realized the greatcoat wasnt greengray but the khaki hed once worn himself along with the greatcoat the canadian soldier wore a fur cap on his head and long narrow boards on his feet mcgregor had snowshoes in his own closet of course but he wasnt good on skis come in he said now youre a friend indeed and among friends the soldier bent down and undid the straps holding the skis to his feet he set down the poles that had helped him travel over the snow and hurried into the house so mcgregor could close the door behind him thanks he said with a theatrical shiver have you got any tea or coffee ive been going for a long time maude mcgregor called his wife hurried into the kitchen again her face bore an expression half proud half worried the american authorities had issued regulations against harbouring canadian or british all of whom they described as enemy soldiers with draconian punishments for disobedience spelled out in minute loving detail the americans seemed very good at spelling things out in minute detail without much caring what they were defining alexander mcgregor on the other hand looked as if he was going to bow down before the scruffy canadian soldier the way the israelites bowed down to the golden calf arthurs son was at the age where he was prone to hero worship and anyone who could hit back at the united sates was a hero in his eyes now a couple of minutes after the kettle started whistling maude came out with a steaming cup of tea obliged maam the soldier said and sipped his eyebrows went up you even sugared it for me im in your debt maude glanced toward arthur almost imperceptibly he nodded back he would have expected nothing less from her than giving a guest the best they had yes sugar was in short supply in these days of occupation but they wouldnt waste away and die for want of a couple of teaspoonsful the soldier drank the cup down while it was still steaming the better to get all the warmth he could inside him when it was empty he sighed deeply god bless you he said i may live i may even want to long cold trip down here i tell you that he blinked his eyes were a startling blue havent given you my name have i im sergeant malcolm lockerby th rifles the little black devils alexander breathed his father nodded too the th battalion had always had a good reputation and a fierce name alexander went on what are you down here for sir arthur mcgregor knew better than to call a sergeant sir but didnt correct his son malcolm lockerby grinned a lopsided grin for all the mischief i can bring our american cousins he answered shrugging out of his heavy pack and setting it and his rifle on the floor he said nothing more than that which made arthur nod again this time in somber approval what you didnt know american questioners couldnt sweat out of you if something went wrong can i help sir alexander exclaimed sure enough if he thought he saw a way to give a yank to the yank eagles tail feathers hed grab it much to arthurs relief lockerby shook his head this operation was set up with one man in mind and more would only complicate things he said letting alexander down easy maude disappeared into the kitchen yet again and came back with a plate of salt pork and bread and butter she set it on the table then said eat like a field marshal ordering an army corps to go over to the attack lockerby obeyed the command with as much elan as any field marshal could have wanted mcgregors wife refilled his teacup and then filled it again she brought a second helping of pork and more bread only when the sergeant leaned back in his chair with a sigh of contentment did she desist now i dont want to leave lockerby remarked which brought a proud smile to maudes face the soldier went on but i have to i know now am i right in thinking the railroad is east of here no its to the west mcgregor said pointing ill be lockerby didnt say what hed be probably in deference to maudes presence he shook his head i must have skied right over the tracks without even knowing id done it a lot of snow on the ground right now so there is mcgregor agreed tell us the news or more of it than we get from the lying papers the americans make people print is winnipeg still holding out that it is lockerby said and likely to keep doing it too with the lines weve made south of the city nobodys moved much since the snows started but weve done a lot of digging his face clouded we havent the men to dig like that along the whole length of railroad though when spring comes were liable to have the country cut in half arent they building a new line north of the one that runs through winnipeg alexander asked then we could keep shipping things east and west even if he didnt go on when you were still a youth looking defeat in the face came hard theyre building it lockerby agreed they cant run it too far north though because of the lakes and even if they did the americans might keep on pushing well have to see have to see if england can spare us any more troops too he looked bleak and tired and older than his years after sitting for a few more minutes he got up donned pack and rifle once more and went outside to put on his skis as far as mcgregor was concerned they were outlandish contraptions but when lockerby went on his way he glided across the surface of the snow amazingly fast amazingly smooth the farmer stared after him till he vanished into the night mcgregor also watched the endless wind blowing away his trail he looked north already you could not tell lockerby had come to the farm that suited mcgregor finebetter than fine if mischief befell the americans he didnt want it traced back to him unless hed had a part in it no not even then he decided especially not then lockerbys sudden appearance gave the family something to talk about till they went to bed when arthur mcgregor got up the next morning he hurried out to use the outhouse and feed the livestock he had left the day was bright and clear he peered west toward the railroad tracks he could see a train and it wasnt moving wagons and men were gathered around it he could make out no more because of the distance whenever he went out for chores he looked toward the stalledsabotaged bombedtrain toward evening it got moving again it went up the track for about half a mile then all at once it stopped the engine and several of the cars left the tracks or so mcgregor thought anyhow with the sun in his face it was hard to be sure some seconds after he saw the train stop a harsh flat bang reached his earswithout a doubt the sound of an explosive going off he wondered if another of those had come in the night to stop the train the first time if one had hed slept right through it that lockerby he did good work there mcgregor said to no one in particular breathe puffing out of his mouth in a frosty cloud as he spoke he wondered how many other explosives the sergeant had planted along the track the americans would have to be wondering the same thing how long would the line be out of service while they checked it how many of them would get frostbite or pneumonia checking it normally dour he smiled from ear to ear as he went back inside captain wilcox stabbed a finger out at reginald bartlett howd you like to lay some barbed wire tonight he said sir if its all the same to you id rather lay one of those pretty little red cross nurses back at the aid station bartlett answered deadpan the confederate soldiers who heard him laughed and snorted and cheered one or two of them sent up rebel yells to show they agreed with the sentiment expressed captain wilcox grinned by now hed got used to the idea that expecting bartlett to take anything war included seriously was asking too much only trouble is reggie they wouldnt want to lay you he said your uniform is filthy your face is grubby youve got lice in your hair and nits in every seam of your clothes and you smell like a polecat would if he didnt take a bath for about a year barbed wire now barbed wire doesnt care about any of that thats all true sir bartlett agreed but barbed wire cant foxtrot either honestly sir it was a losing fight and he knew it it wasnt really even a fight at all just a way to grumble about orders that was different from the profane complaints most men gave when evening came he would crawl out of the trench with a roll of barbed wire on his back and he knew that too so did captain wilcox who waved at him and went along the line to pick some more volunteers down in the trenches you were fairly safe unless you did something stupid like showing yourself to the damnyankees on the other side of the wire or unless a shell landed right by you or unless the us soldiers decided to make another probe toward the roanoke river and happened to pick your stretch of the line to raid once you came out of the earthworks that protected you though once you came out of them machine guns werent nuisances any more they were menaces only too likely to make your family get a the government of the confederate states of america deeply regrets to inform you telegram rifle bullets ran around loose up there too and you were liable to run into damnyankees out between the lines doing the same sorts of things you were sometimes youd work and theyd work and youd pretend not to notice one another and sometimes youd go after them or theyd go after you with guns and bayonets and the shorthandled shovels you used to dig holes in the ground and then the rifles in both trench lines would open up and the machine guns would start to hammer and then oh lord how you wished you were back of the lines in bed with a nurseor even down safe in your trenchinstead of where you really were captain wilcox had called reggies face grubby before he climbed up out of the trench he rubbed mud on himself till he looked like the end man in a minstrel show the blacker you were the harder it was for the yankees to spot you we ought to send niggers up to do this for us he said theyre already black i hear tell theyve tried that in kentucky captain wilcox said didnt work the yankees shot at them like they were us and they didnt have any guns to shoot back with the ones who lived you couldnt make em go up again too bad reggie said better them than me better them than me for just about any job i dont want to do matter of fact but when the captain said go you went bartlett nodded to his companions lets get rolling the other halfdozen men nodded hed been fighting along the roanoke longer than any of them so they took his word as gospel even if he had no more rank than they did he was that mystical magical thing a veteran a lot of the men whod come to the fight with him were dead now that he wasnt was partly luck and partly being able to remember what hed learned in his first few fights well enough not to repeat any of the stupid parts stay low and go slow he said now the less racket we make spreading the wire the less chance the damnyankees have of starting to shoot at us some kind and thoughtful soul had made a stairway out of sandbags to help the heavily burdened wire men get out of the trench bartlett was grateful and angry at the same time if he hadnt been able to get up onto the battered ground between the lines he wouldnt have had to crawl forward toward the wireand toward the enemy it was a dark and cloudy night for once reggie wouldnt have minded rain or even snow nothing better to keep the us forces from knowing he and his chums were out there but if a storm hid in those clouds it refused to come out he set down his hands with great care every time he moved forward behind him somebody let out a soft disgusted oath probably because hed crawled over a soft disgusting corpse or piece of corpse the line had swung back and forth several times a lot of the dead from both sides had gone without proper burial and even those who had been thrown into hasty graves or holes in the ground might well have been disinterred by the endless senseless plowing of the artillery the smell was that of a meat market that had been out of ice for a month in the middle of a hot summer up above his head something went fwoomp freeze he hissed frantically as the parachute flare spread harsh white light over the field if you didnt move sometimes they wouldnt spot you even when you were out there in plain sight some of the men in his company spoke of walking right past deer that had bounded away once theyd gone by bartlett was no deer but he knew he could be in some hunters sights right now his nose itched his hand itched his scalp and the hair under his arms always itched he directed a few unkind thoughts to the cooties he carried around with him but he didnt scratch he didnt move he did his best not to blink some yankee with a rifle started shooting somewhere too close for com fort bartlett froze even colder but whatever the us soldier thought he saw it wasnt the confederate wiring party hissing and sputtering the parachute flare sank ever so slowly going from white toward red as it did at last it died plunging the debatable ground into darkness once more come on bartlett whispered come on but come quiet like most things that was easier said than done when at last they got to the wire barrier they were to strengthen the men couldnt just unroll the wire and scoot for home to make it a proper obstruction they had to mount it on poles and shove the poles in the ground in some places the ground was damp things were easy there in some places though the ground was frozen you had a choice then either stab the supports into the dirt knowing they wouldnt stay well or hammer at them with a shovel or whatever you had knowing the noise was liable to draw fire bartlett opted for quiet hell he muttered to himself it aint like theres not enough wire out here already somebody though somebody had to get intrepid tap tap tap in the middle of a quiet night the noise might as well have been a shell going off along with everybody else in the wiring party bartlett made frantic shushing noises the damnyankees would start tapping too the twoinch tap an experienced machine gunner used on the barrel of his weapon to traverse it through its deadly arc of fire and sure enough the us soldiers did open up first rifles then machine guns when a bullet clipped the barbed wire it sparked blue there were a lot of blue sparks as if lightning bugs had suddenly come to roost between the lines of the two armies out of here bartlett said urgently hed just about finished unreeling his wire he unhooked the roll from his back and suddenly lighter hurried back toward the confederate front line never had a muddy stinking hole in the ground seemed so welcome so wonderful bullets zipping all around him he dove into a shell hole there was a puddle at the bottom of it a horrible stink rose when he roiled the water something or more likely someonehad died in this hole too long ago a series of twoinch taps sent the yankees stream of machinegun bullets past him he thought he could make it to the trench before the stream came back leaping up out of the shell hole he ran for all he was worth somebody else panting like a dog sprinted stride for stride with him slap his comrade whoever he was went down even with the machine gun busy elsewhere plenty of rifle bullets were still in the air swearing bartlett grabbed the other man slung him over his back in place of the roll of wire and stumbled on he almost went into the trench headfirst soldiers caught him steadied him who have i got here he asked easing the man on his back to the ground somebody struck a match its jordan he said and then a moment later quite unnecessarily hes dead good job you picked him up even so captain wilcox said out of the darkness you cant know not for sure how did the wiring go bartlett took a minute or so to stop gasping for breath and to let his heart slow as terror began to recede routine sir he answered then just routine routine sam carsten said just routine hiram kidde laughed out loud aint one damn thing about it thats routine the gunners mate said wearin summer whites in february sweatin in summer whites in february bein in the sandwich islands at all his grin was broad and delighted still cant believe we caught the limeys with their drawers down might as well believe it carsten answered its true he waved to show what he meant the two offduty sailors strolled along the grounds on the eastern side of the entranceway to pearl harbor when the british ruled the sandwich islands theyd built a parade ground there so their marines could get in the drill they needed the parade ground was somewhat the worse for wear after the american invasion of the islands but marines still paraded on it us marines in uniforms of forest green several shades darker than army men wore eyesright the marine drill sergeant shouted marching along with his men sing outlet me hear it you birds one two three four the men sounded off miss maggies why well win the war not even a marine drill sergeant as fearsome a creature as any ever born could make the young men ignore the spectacular woman who came out to the parade grounds several days a week to watch them marchand to be watched the sergeant a man of sense didnt even try he stared at maggie stevenson too and so did sam carsten and capn kidde maggie stevenson had been in business for herself when the union jack flew over honolulu and the recent change of ownership hadnt fazed her a bit indeed because there were more american sailors soldiers and marines here now than there had been englishmen before her business was better than ever theres one limey id like to catch with her drawers down carsten said reverently limey kidde said i hear tell shes from nebraska capn with maggie its not what you hear its what you see kidde nodded reverently there was a lot of maggie to see she was within an inch of carstens height and was probably even fairer but on her it looked good she shielded her face from the sun with a broadbrimmed straw hat like a lot of women in honolulu she wore a holoku a baggy nativestyle dress that covered her from neck to ankles hers though wasnt cotton or linen it was green silk somewhere between translucent and transparent when she stood between men and the sun as she made a point of doing you could see there was a hell of a lot of woman under there after thorough and judicious study hiram kidde said sam i dont think shes wearin drawers he shook his head and you can get right there too just for the asking he sighed amazing not quite just for the asking carsten said for the paying if shes not the richest gal in these islands it aint for lack of effort effort kidde laughed theres coalheavers down in the black gang dont work as hard as she does i hear tell you know about the setup dear maggies got tell me carsten said beats hell out of thinking about cleaning out a fiveinch gun thats for damn sure he winked course you only got a fiveinch gun miss maggie aint gonna want anything to do with you kidde had been inhaling to say something which meant he choked when he started to laugh sam carsten pounded him on the back you got to watch that he wheezed when he could talk again i was watching that sam said watching maggie stevenson who was watching the marines watch her shut up kidde said what the hell was i talkin about oh yeah her place they say shes got this big room with four maybe five pullmansized compartments in there nothin in any of em cept a red couch and a horny guy on it and she just goes from couch to couch to couch long as she can walk no wonder shes rich carsten said with the genuine respect a professional in one field gives a professional in another yup kidde agreed and shes got em lined up for every damn compartment too even if she does charge thirty bucks a throw his hard blunt face grew dreamy for a moment she must be a piece of ass and a half yeah reckon so carsten said but most of a months pay hell more than a months pay if youre just an ordinary seaman for five minutes ten tops thats a lot to spend just to get your ashes hauled shes got a lot the gunners mate started of satisfied customers sam said beating him to the punch line yeah they both laughed carsten scratched the angle of his jaw i dunno you can take yourself to just an ordinary everyday crib and lay one o them jap girls or a filipino for a couplethree bucks maggie cant be that much better can she but he was still watching the undisputed queen of honolulu s ladies of the evening you can get drunk on that olikau popskull the natives cook up here too hiram kidde observed if gettin drunk is the only reason youre drinkin fine but every now and then dont you hanker after some real sippin whiskey carsten scratched his jaw without answering whiskers rasped under his fingers he needed a shave he had a razor back on the dakota but you could give a dime to one of the chinese barbers in the little shops all around pearl harbor and hed shave you closer and smoother than you could do it for yourself he got shaved a lot these days his meals and his hammock were taken care of so he didnt have a hell of a lot to spend his money on the drill sergeant led the marching marines back toward the british barracks they were occupying they were too well disciplined to go with really laggard step but their footwork showed less mechanical precision than usual a few sailors werent enough of an audience for maggie stevenson to keep herself on display she retreated to her carriage the driver a little dark oriental sweating in top hat and cutaway flicked the reins two perfectly matched black horses bore her away carsten and kidde both watched till the carriage was out of sight sam went and bathed then headed to one of the barbershops and paid a couple of cents extra for a splash of bay rum the british had set up an electric trolley between pearl harbor and honolulu though the motormen who took your nickel were uniformly japs carsten wasnt the only military man who got out at the kapalama stop east of downtown some of the men in white or green acted as if they knew exactly where they were going he followed them the halftimbered house might have been transplanted from london though it wouldnt have had palm trees around it there from what capn kidde had said carsten had expected to see a line around the block he didnt then the oriental driver waved him and the rest of the newcomers around to the back the line was there discreet he thought in the navy you got used to lines what was waiting at the end of this one was better than any of the other things for which hed lined up he shot the breeze with some of the other guys there a couple of them seemed too embarrassed about being where they were to say much most though like him took it for granted when he got up to the back door another slanteye in formal wear took his money the fellow wore a pistol concealed not quite well enough in a shoulder holster carsten didnt blame him not a bit if maggie stevensons place didnt keep as much cash around as your average bank hed eat his hat still another oriental also armed stood at the doorway to the big room kidde had talked about you go number three he said pointing sure enough the little compartments had brass numbers on the doors as if they were hotel rooms carsten went into number inside were a mirror on one wall a red couch a pitcher and basin and a cake of soap on a stool and some hooks on which to hang his clothes sam used the hooks then lay back on the couch to wait the noises coming from one of the other cubicles were highly entertaining maggie stevenson worked her way through the other threethere were four in all not fiveand then opened a door on the far side of his compartment she came in wearing nothing but a smile and a light sheen of sweat carsten stared and stared hell of a woman he muttered what you could see through even the most diaphanous holoku barely gave you a clue hello sailor she said her voice english sure enough she lathered up the soap and washed sams privates all part of the service she said smiling then she bent down and kissed him there right on the tip as if it were the end of his nose nowwhat would you like you get on top he said i want to see you too all right and she did those perfect pinktipped breasts hung like ripe fruit inches from his face he squeezed them and kissed them and licked them his hands clenched her meaty backside tight he wanted to make it last as long as he could but he hadnt had any in a while and maggie made her money by having lots of customers on any one day so she tried hard to hurry him along she knew just what she was doing too try as he would to hold back he bucked and jerked and came hard enough to leave him dizzy for a moment hope i see you again sailor maggie said she leaned over him for a second just far enough that her nipples brushed against the hair and skin of his chest then she got off him and off the couch and headed for the next little cubicle sam got dressed and left too one more oriental in fancy dress showed him the way out he was whistling as he walked back to the trolley stop it had been a hell of a good time was it worth thirty bucks worth coming back again he didnt think so not really but he wasnt sorry hed done it once three or four guys in uniform were walking up the other side of the street toward maggie stevensons place one of them he saw with amusement was a sprucedup hiram kidde he started to wave then stopped later on maybe hed find out if the capn thought hed got his moneys worth ix c incinnatus and his wife elizabeth were getting ready for bed when some one knocked on the back door it wasnt that late but ever since elizabeth had found out she was going to have a baby shed been tired a lot of the time even more tired than her domestics work usually made her who is that she said in some irritation i dont want visitors youd think visitors would come to the front of the house cincinnatus said as he headed out of the bedroom toward the kitchen from the hall he added over his shoulder one thingit aint us soldiers they dont just come to the front of the house they go and break down the door you dont let em in fast enough the knock came again it wasnt very loud as if whoever was out there didnt want the neighbors to notice cincinnatus frowned wondering if it was a strongarm man trying to trick him into opening the door crooks were having a field day the yankees didnt seem to care what people in covington did to one another so long as they left us troops alone if it was a strongarm man cincinnatus vowed to give him a hell of a surprise he plucked a heavy iron spider out of the draining rack by the sink clout somebody upside the head with that and hed forget about everything for a good long while spider in his right hand he opened the back door with his left when he did he almost dropped the frying pan mistuh kennedy he exclaimed what the devil you doin here even in the dim light of the lamp from the kitchen tom kennedy looked as if the devil had indeed brought him to his present state he was haggard and skinny and dirty and his eyes tried to move every which way at once the way a foxs did when hounds were chasing it can i come in cincinnatus former boss asked i think maybe you better cincinnatus said what you doin out anyways curfews eight oclock and i know its past that sure is kennedy said and said no more that made cincinnatus ask the next question what are you doin here mr kennedy you dont mind me sayin so this aint your part of town if that wasnt the understatement of it would do till a better one came along why the devil would a white man come into the colored part of covington after curfew the only thing cincinnatus was sure about was that it wasnt any simple ordinary innocent reason who is it elizabeth called from the bedroom its mr tom kennedy sweetheart cincinnatus answered trying to sound as ordinary and innocent as he could and knowing he wasnt having much luck kennedys hunted look got even worse dont say my name so loud he hissed urgently the fewer people who know im here the better off everybody will be elizabeth came into the kitchen shed put on a quilted cotton housecoat over her nightgown her eyes got wide it is mr kennedy she said and then determined to be a good hostess no matter what the irregular circumstances in which she found herself shall i put on some coffee for you kennedy shook his head a quick jerky motion no nothing thanks ive been running on nerves for so long coffee would just make things worse mr kennedy cincinnatus said with a mixture of deference and annoyance that struck him odd even at the time what are you doing here after curfew can you hide me for a couple of days kennedy asked i wont tell you any liesim on the dodge from the damnyankees they catch up with me its a rope around my neck or a blindfold and a cigaretteexcept i dont think theyd bother with the cigarette youre in real trouble cincinnatus said quietly a moment later he realized that meant he was in real trouble too the us authorities didnt take kindly to people who harboured fugitives from what they called justice elizabeth s eyes widened again she must have figured out the same thing at the same time cincinnatus clicked his tongue between his teeth whyd you come here he asked directing the question as much to the world at large as to tom kennedy yes im in real trouble kennedy said my life is in your hands you want to holler for the patrols im a goner theyll put money in your pocket too up to you cincinnatus all depends on how you like living under the usa because im doing everything i can to throw the damnyankees out of kentucky thats why theyre after me in case you havent worked it out oh i worked it out mr kennedy cincinnatus said softly still im studying what i should oughta do about it is all he had no reason to love the csa what black man did but the men from the united states hadnt shown him his lot was better with them in charge not even close he glanced over to elizabeth her belly hadnt started to swell certainly not to the point where anyone could notice it when she was wearing clothes he was acutely aware of her pregnancy all the same it made him less willing to take chances than he would have been a few months before and far less willing to take chances than he would have been before he got married and so he said what did you do mr kennedy how come the damnyankees are after you so bad i dont want to tell you kennedy answered the more things you know the more they can squeeze out of you if they ever take a mind to that made a certain amount of sense most times cincinnatus would have accepted it without argument now he felt a curious sense of reversal for what might well have been the first time in his life he had the upper hand in a conversation with a white man even though he did he used it cautiously deferentially i dont know why they want you suh i dont know whether i should oughta help you or help them get you you understand what im sayin you wont buy a pig in a poke not even from me kennedy said cincinnatus noddedthat was it in a nutshell tom kennedy sighed he recognized the reversal too all right have it your way i havent broken any little old ladies legs with a crowbar or stolen from the church poor box or anything like that but im in the hauling and moving business cincinnatus right some of the things ive hauled into covington arent the ones the us armys real happy to have here he meant guns he had to mean guns and maybe explosives too under us military law the penalty for that kind of thing was death soldiers had nailed up placards saying as much all over covington warnings appeared in the newspapers about twice a week and if you harboured a gun runner you got the same thing he did those warnings were in the papers too you dont make it easy mr kennedy cincinnatus said he came close to hating his former boss for putting him in a spot like thisnot just his neck on the line now but elizabeths and the coming babys too if he turned him out into the street without saying anything to the authorities but kennedy got caught later hed be in just as much trouble as if hed concealed him the only way not to be in trouble with the us authorities was to hand kennedy over to them now he didnt have the stomach for that as white men went kennedy had been pretty decent to himfar better than that screaming us lieutenant who bossed him nowadays he had just reached that conclusion when elizabeth said here come on with me mistuh kennedy i got a good place to put you that relieved cincinnatus because he hadnt come up with any good place to hide kennedy he didnt want him under the bed and the yankees would be sure to look behind the couch and down in the storm cellar hed been wondering if he could take kennedy over to his mothers or some other relatives but he wasnt enthusiastic about involving them in the danger the white man had brought to him elizabeth opened the door to the pantry by the stove it was full of sacks of potatoes and beans and blackeyed peas cincinnatus didnt feel the least bit guilty about hoarding no matter how bad things got he and his wouldnt starve when elizabeth started taking out the sacks he quickly moved her aside and did it himself that wasnt something he wanted his wife doing not when she was in a family way the sacks took up a surprising lot of room all spread out on the kitchen floor once he had them all out he saw that several boards at the back of the pantry were rotten at the bottom he hadnt noticed that before but elizabeth had he stepped into the little cramped space and pulled at the boards they came out with squeaks and squeals of nails revealing a black opening behind them god bless you both tom kennedy said and squeezed into the opening cincinnatus replaced the boards as well as he could by hand he hoped kennedy would be able to breathe with them back one thing seemed pretty clear though if us soldiers caught up with kennedy his former boss wouldnt be breathing much longer still muttering to himself cincinnatus put back the produce sacks elizabeth swept up a few beans that had escaped from one of them when she was done she and cincinnatus looked at each other they both shook their heads lets go to bed cincinnatus said though he didnt think he was going to sleep much no matter how tired hed been all right by her tone elizabeth was thinking the same thing if they didnt sleep like the dead tonight theyd shamble like the living dead tomorrow nothing to be done about that not now after hed blown out the lamp in the bedroom cincinnatus said we cant keep him in there long he go crazy cooped up like that an we didnt even think to give him a thundermug or nothin ill take care of that in the morning elizabeth answered around an enormous yawn cincinnatus felt himself fading too now that he was horizontal he suspected sleep might sneak up on him after all sure enough the wham wham wham in the middle of the night woke him out of deep sound slumber at first groggy and confused he thought it was hail pounding on the roof then he realized that while it certainly was pounding it was all coming from one direction that of the front door soldiers he whispered to elizabeth she nodded he felt the motion rather than seeing it wham wham wham he groped for a match found the box struck a light and lighted the lamp hed blown out carrying it he went out and opened the front door an electric torch blazed into his face blinding him you just saved your door nigger a northern voice said we were gonna break it down what you want cincinnatus asked he didnt have to struggle very hard to sound stupid not as tired as he was fright came easy too the yankee officer hard to see past that powerful torch said you know a white man name of tom kennedy boy yes suh cincinnatus admitted if theyd come here they already knew he knew kennedy a lie would have got him in deeper trouble than the truth you seen him any time lately the officer demanded cincinnatus shook his head no suh sure aint not since jus a little while after de war start he run out o town i hear tell fore you yankees come he laid the negro accent on with a trowel it would help make the us soldiers think he was stupid hed have done that for confederates too wish to jesus he had the officer said so feelingly that cincinnatus blinked he hadnt thought any damnyankees took jesus christ seriously the fellow went on hes been seen in covington and hes been seen not far from right here so what were gonna do is were gonna search this shack he waved to the soldiers with him in they came cincinnatus got out of the way in a hurry if he hadnt they would have trampled him or maybe bayoneted him the us troops turned his tidy little househe bristled at hearing it called a shackupside down and inside out looking for tom kennedy they stabbed those bayonets into the sofa and into his mattress through the sheets had kennedy been in there he would have regretted it as things were cincinnatus did the regretting for his bed linen and the upholstery elizabeth watching with round eyes made distressed noises the yankees ignored her one of the soldiers got down on hands and knees to peer under the stove though a midget would have had trouble hiding there another one flung open the pantry door the officershort skinny with goldrimmed spectacles and a mean lookshone that torch in there cincinnatus heart thumped had he got those boards back well enough he did his best not to show what he was thinking nothin but a pile of beans the officer said disgustedly and slammed the pantry door he turned to cincinnatus all right boy looks like you were tellin the truth he dug into his pocket pulled out a silver dollar and tossed it to the negro for the damage he raised his voice come on men we got other places to search cincinnatus stared down at the coin hed automatically caught it wasnt enough but it was a dollar more than hed expected to get he set it on the counter when the us soldiers were gone he opened the pantry door and asked quietly you all right mr kennedy the disembodied voice floated back from behind the wall yes thanks god bless you we take better care of you come mornin cincinnatus promised and went off to see if he could get some rest he sighed he wasnt even close to sure hed done the right thing in hiding kennedy but that didnt matter now right or wrong he was committed hed have to see what came of that nellie semphroch sighed wearily as she carried the big cloth grocery bag back toward the coffeehouse the bag itself was lighter than shed wished it would be the grocers had trouble keeping things in stock but she was tireder than she thought she should have been and felt old beyond her years winter always wore at her and this year it wasnt just winter it was rebel occupation too she slipped and had to flail her arms wildly to keep from falling the sidewalk was icy in spots across the street mr jacobs came out of his shop with a confederate soldier wearing one pair of boots and carrying another the reb strutted up the street as if he owned it which in effect he did as far as he was concerned nellie wasnt worth noticing mr jacobs being occupied rather than occupier could seeand admit seeinghis fellow us citizens you are all right widow semphroch he called yes i think so thank you nellie answered one more thing on top of everything else she bit her lip what she wanted to say was ive been through so much why cant life be easy for a change the answer to that one was depressingly obvious though her life had never been easy so why should it start now i hope it will be better soon the shoemaker said so do i mr jacobs so do i nellie said a good christian she knew would not resent anothers honestly earned success but she was jealous of jacobs his business flourished while hers withered on the vine why not leather was easy to come by coffee wasnt the confederate soldiers in washington went through a lot of shoes and boots theyd gone through a lot of coffee too but now only a tiny bit was left widow semphroch is there anything i can do to help you mr jacobs asked nellie shook her head things had come to a pretty pass hadnt they when even the shoemaker knew she was failing and pitied her with stubborn pride she picked up the grocery bag and went into the coffeehouse the little bell above the door didnt tinkle as she went in after surviving the confederate bombardment at the start of the war it had fallen off its mounting a few weeks before and shed never bothered replacing it not much point to that not when she or edna was almost always thereand not when customers were few and far between too but edna wasnt behind the counter now frowning nellie set down the grocery bag no customers were being slightedall the tables in the front part of the shop were empty but her daughter hadnt told her she was going anywhereand if edna had decided to go out she should have locked the front door nellie started down the hall turned the cornerand there stood edna kissing a cavalryman in butternut her arms tight around him his big hairy hands clutching at her posterior nellie gaspednot in dismay but in fury stop that this instant she snapped intent on each other and nothing more her daughter and the cavalry officer hadnt noticed her till she spoke when she did they sprang apart from each other as if they were a couple of the clever magnetic toys that had been all the go a couple of years before mother its all right edna began nellie ignored her young man what is your name she demanded of the confederate soldier nicholas henry kincaid maam he answered polite even though nellie could still see the bulge in his trousers the bulge hed got from rubbing up against edna well mr nicholas henry kincaidnellie freighted the name with all the scorn it would bearyour commanding officer will hear of thisthis this she couldnt find the word she wanted but edna wouldnt go the way she had gone edna wouldnt nellie shouted get out and pointed to the front door kincaid was more than a head taller than she was he carried a knife and a large revolver on his belt none of that mattered face red expression mortified he retreated nellie had accomplished more than the entire us garrison of washington dc she tried to kick him in the shins as he went but he was too fast for her so she missed still steaming she rounded on edna as for you young lady oh ma leave it alone will you please her daughter said in a weary voice hows a girl supposed to have any fun these days with the whole town turned into one big morgue not like that nellie semphroch said grimly not like that because because you let some boy pull your knickers down a long time ago and now youve decided i shouldnt edna tossed her head in disdain im grown up now and you cant keep me from being alive myself no matter how much you want to nellie stared in dismay her cheeks got hot the worst was her daughters shot was an understatement edna didnt know that thank god as parents will though nellie rallied as long as you are living under my roof you will but edna interrupted again some roof she tossed her head once more i could do better than this by lifting my little finger by lifting your skirt you mean nellie retorted no daughter of mine is going to make her way through the world by selling herself on street corners i tell you that i wont just report that cavalrymans name to the rebel commandant ednaill give him yours too they glared at each other two sides of the same coin though neither realized it with what looked like a distinct effort edna made herself stop snarling its not like that ma ive never once prostituted myself and i never will neither but im not going to sit cooped up in this damned shop all day long either watching the dust on the counter getting thicker and thicker and thicker im going to be twentyone in a couple months dont i deserve a life not that kind nellie said breathing hard she wished she could say everything edna had you want that kind find yourself a man youre going to marry then you can have it only after she was done speaking did she realize how little ednas language which would have been shocking before the war began shocked her now everything was coarsened cheapened turned to trash and vileness and how am i supposed to meet anybody i might want to marry if i stay here all the time edna shot back about the only people who come in are confederate soldiers and if you dont want me to have anything to do with them that man was not going to marry you nellie said positively all he wanted was to have his way with you edna did not have a snappy comeback to that by which nellie concluded shed won a point trying to sound earnest rather than furious nellie went on you just cant trust men edna theyll say whatever they have to to get what they want and afterwards theyll leave you flat go off whistling and never care whether theyve left you in a family way how do you know so much about it edna said ask any woman shell tell you the same if you can get her to let her hair down automatically nellies hand straightened the curls on her own head she felt dizzy with anger at her daughter memories that hadnt come back to her in yearsmemories shed thought shed hoped long forgottencame bubbling back up to the surface of her mind memories of the harsh taste of rotgut whiskey and the deceptively sweet clink of silver dollars and the occasional quartereagle on the top of a pine nightstand im not going to die an old maid ma edna insisted i didnt ask you to nellie said but i sure sounded to me like you did her daughter interrupted dont go out dont meet nobody if you do meet somebody dont have any fun with him on account of all he wants to do is lay you anyways you maybe caught me this time ma but you cant watch me every hour of every day im not gonna wear your ball and chain and you cant make me edna stormed past nellie and out of the coffeehouse as nellie had with nicholas kincaid she tried to kick her daughter as she had then she missed the door slammed nellie burst into tears at last she dug in her handbag for a cheap cotton handkerchief she wiped her eyes and blew her nose then slowly her steps dragging she went to the door too she opened it stepped outside and looked up and down the street she didnt see edna she started to cry again a negro in fancy livery driving a highranking confederate officer with a white mustache came down the street in a gleaming motorcar nellie wanted to scream the filthiest things she knew at him after the automobilea procession in and of itselfhad passed she crossed the street and went into mr jacobs cobblers shop the little bell above his door worked he looked up from the marching boot he was repairing behind magnifying lenses his eyes looked enormous the wrinkles on his round little face rearranged themselves into an expression of concern widow semphroch he exclaimed whatever can be wrong nellie found herself telling him what was wrong everybody needed someone with whom to talk and shed known him for as long as shed been in business across the street from his shop he wasnt one to spread gossip around he wouldnt blab of her troubles with edna either or of how much she hated the rebel soldiers and officers who kept sniffing round her daughter when she was finished he pulled a handkerchiefa bright green silk out of his trouser pocket took off his spectacles made a production out of polishing the lenses and then set the glasses on the counter by his last he studied nellie for close to a minute without saying anything then in a thoughtful tone of voice he remarked you know widow semphroch i am sorry for you and for your poor daughter i wish there were some way you could take revenge on these confederates who have caused you so much grief oh good lord so do i nellie said fervently the shoemaker continued to study her when the rebs came into your coffeehouse they must have had all sorts of interesting stories to tell wouldnt you say thats so widow semphroch it is here that i can tell you the ones who come in to get their shoes repaired they do run on at the mouth and me i just listen listen very carefully you never can tell what you might hear nellie started to answer mr jacobs then suddenly stopped before shed said anything now she looked sharply at him hed just told her something without ever once coming right out and saying it if she hadnt been paying attention she wouldnt have noticedwhich no doubt was what hed intended she said if i hear anything like that mr jacobs maybe youd like me to let you know about it if you think that would be interesting of course it might he answered yes it might they nodded having made a bargain neither of them had mentioned when she was in new orleans anne colleton had thought she would be glad to get home to south carolina now that she was back in her beloved marshlands she often wished shed stayed in louisiana even the trendsetting exhibition of modern art shed arranged the trendsetting artists whod crossed the atlantic to exhibit their works now seemed more albatross than triumph she set hands on hips and spoke to marcel duchamp in irritable almost accentfree french monsieur you are not the only one who regrets that the outbreak of war has left you here rather than in paris where you would rather be i agree it is a great pity but it is not something over which i have any say do you understand this before replying duchamp took a long drag at the skinny cigarillo in his hand he used smoking as a sort of punctuation to his speech he made everything he did no matter how trivial as dramatic as he could exhaling a long thin plume of smoke the february sunlighttolerably warm here illuminated he spoke in mournful tones i am confined here is that what you do not understand mademoiselle colleton this is the only word i can use trapped like a beast in jaws of steel soon i shall have to gnaw off a limb to escape he made as if to bite at his own wrist i havent got the time to deal with this now anne thought aloud she said you did not sound this way when you accepted my invitationand my moneyto come to the confederate states last summer i had not thought i would be here an eternity duchamp burst out what is bearableforgive me what is pleasantfor a time in the end becomes unpleasant imprisoning ships sail for england and france from charleston every week monsieur duchamp anne said in frigid tones you are not held here without bond as if you were a negro criminal you have but to use the return fare i gave you when you came here i would not have you stay where you feel unwelcome duchamp paced back and forth so swiftly that he almost appeared to be many places at once as if he were the inspiration for his own nude descending a staircase anne colleton judged that much of his agitation was real yes he said ships do sail you have reason there but it is also true that they reach their intended ports far less often than a prudent man would wish even prudence is not always prudent anne replied what did danton say before the legislative assembly laudace encore iaudace toujours iaudace if you wish so much to be gone you will find the audacity to go the artist looked most unhappy anne smiled without moving her lips he hadnt expected her to throw a quotation from the french revolution in his face instead of answering her he bowed and walked off thin and dark and straight as his cigarillo anne did smile then but only for a moment duchamp would start being difficult again in another few daysunless of course he seduced a new serv ing wench in which case he would imagine himself in love but even if he did that it wouldnt last long either the one constant about marcel duchamp was mutability in the confederate states of america mutability was not well thought of the csa tried to hold change to a minimum if you shut your eyes just a little the thought went you could believe everything was as it had been before the war of secession we need to be reminded that isnt so anne murmured it just isnt that was one of the reasons shed arranged her exhibition to make more peo ple see what the twentieth century really meant it was also one of the reasons the exhibition had been so deliciously scandalous but change had come to marshlands in other ways too ways she didnt like so well how was she supposed to raise a decent crop of cotton if her col ored hands kept leaving the plantation to work in factories in columbia and spartanburg and even down in charleston its the war shed heard that ex cuse so many times she was sick of it and not even all her power all her wealth all her connections had let her pull all her hands back to the fields shed had to raise what she paid to keep the drain from being worse than it was that cut into her profits and pay in the factories was going up too she scowled she wasnt used to being in the position of wanting the good old days back again the front door opened and closed anne glanced at a clock half past eleven time for the postman to come she hurried toward the front hallway and almost bumped into the butler who was bringing the mail on a silver tray thank you scipio she said more warmly than she was in the habit of speaking to servants my pleasure madam he replied deep voice grave as usual she took the tray from him his sober features were as familiar to her as anything else at marshlands and more comfortable than a lot of the furniture she wondered for the briefest moment how she would run the plantation if scipio took a position elsewhere but no it was inconceivable born and bred here a fixture since the days when negro slavery remained the law of the land scipio was as much a part of marshlands as she was herself nice to have something on which i can rely she thought after setting the tray on a stained mahogany table she sorted rapidly through the mail she discarded advertising circulars unread as not deserving anything better invoices and correspondence pertaining to the business side of marshlands she set aside for later consideration that left half a dozen per sonal letters do you require anything else of me madam scipio asked he had already started to turn to go when anne said wait as a matter of fact i should like to discuss something with you in a few minutes obediently the butler froze into immobility he would stay frozen till she let him know he could move however long that took to her disappointment none of the letters was from her brothers they were both in combat neither so far had been hurt but she knew that was only by the grace of the god in whom she believed so sporadically notes from friends and distant cousins were welcome but could not take the place of news of her own flesh and blood and whom did she know in guaymas the grimy port and railroad town wasnt anyplace youd want to go on holiday especially not when the united states were still liable to cut the railroad line that linked it to the rest of the confederacy making it back to civilization through the banditridden hinterlands of the empire of mexico struck her as adventurous without being enjoyable curious she used a letter opener shaped like a miniature cavalry saber to slit the envelope the letter inside was in the same firm clear unfamiliar hand as the outer address dear anne it read hope this finds you as well as i found you on the train to new orleans and in the town as you will see i remain there no longer that not being a primary center for one of my training not enough beasts to hunt i cant say that here having shot at several big ones and hit a few well theres hunting and theres hunting as the saying goes i find i enjoy both kinds and hope to pursue the other if i am ever out your way by contrast with the rest of the letter the signature below was al most a scrawl roger kimball anne colleton folded the letter again the submariner had discretion she gave him that much no spy would be able to infer what he did from that let ter she could see why new orleans was not a chief submarine base the gulf of mexico being a confederate lake enemy ships were probably few and far between not so at guaymas the usa had a much longer pacific coastline than the csa no spy would be sure theyd been lovers either she worried about that less than most women might have but it remained in her mind she wondered whether to answer the letter or pretend shed never got it the latter choice was surely safer but anne had not got where she was by always playing safe either way she didnt have to decide right now and in fact she didnt want to decide now scipio she said and the butler began to move seemingly began to breathe for the first time since shed started going through her mail scipio she repeated gathering her thoughts and then do you know of anything special thats driving so many niggers out of the fields and into the factories besides money i meani know what money does i had not really thought about it past endeavoring to see that we always have enough hands to perform the required labor scipio replied after a momentary hesitation perhaps for thought perhaps not could she believe that she did some fast thinking of her own and decided she could scipios duties centered on the mansion and on keeping it and its staff in smooth working order the field hands werent his main concern let me ask that another way she said have you noticed unusual unrest among any of the hands im especially concerned about the new ones you under stand im sure the bucks and wenches whove grown up on this plantation are contented with their lot again except possibly over money scipios dark handsome features reflected nothing but meticulous attention to her words so he had been trained and no one could deny the training was a success not even anne who had caused that perfect mask to be made could hope to lift up one edge so to speak and see what lay behind it and his beautifully modulated voice revealed only a polite lack of curiosity as he replied madam i assure you i make every effort to weed out any undesir able influences before they find positions here and as you say the loyalty of your longtime staff is of course unquestioning thank you scipio you do relieve my mind anne said with a gracious nod she released him to pursue the rest of his duties hed told her exactly what she wanted to hear the confederates had the us soldiers exactly where they wanted them or so they thought captain irving morrell wondered how wondered ifhe was going to prove them wrong the war to which hed returned two and a half months before bore only a faint resemblance to the one from which hed been carried in sonora back in august for that matter the heavily forested kentucky hill country in which he was operating now wasnt anything like the dusty desert where hed been wounded his leg throbbed he ignored it as hed been ignoring it ever since he hiked out of shelbiana somewhere ahead a good many miles ahead lay jenkins right by the virginia border in between seemed to be nothing but mountains and valleys and tiny coalmining towns and even tinier farming hamlets and enough rebels with guns to make advancing slow hard pain ful work atop the hill ahead and in the trenches at its base were enough confederates not just to slow the us advance but to bring it to a halt with the lieutenants and sergeants under him morrell slipped from one tree to another drawing as close to the rebel line as he could the sergeants would have been doing that job anyhow but both lieutenants their names were craddock and buhllooked notably unhappy see for yourself morrell said as they sheltered behind a gnarled oak he spoke as if he were in the pulpit expounding on holy writ see for yourself without good reconnaissance your force is only half as useful as it would be otherwisesometimes less than half as useful they couldnt argue with himhe outranked them but they didnt look convinced either it wasnt that they were cowards hed already seen them fighting with all the courage any superior officer could want from his men what they lacked was imagination the way the war was chewing up the offi cer corps theyd make captain if they lived he supposed they might even end up majors he was damned though if he saw them going any further not if the war lasted till they were ninety bill craddock pointed out to the cleared ground in front of the confeder ate line how are we supposed to cross that sir he said clearly with the expectation that morrell would have no answer rebel machine gunsll chew us up like termites gnawing on an old house well have to bring our own machine guns forward before we move morrell said we can bring them up within a hundred yards of their trenches and concentrate our fire on the places where we want to break in and lieutenant have you ever gone down to the empire of mexico and watched a bullfight uh no sir craddock answered his broad stolid face showed he hadnt the faintest idea what morrell was driving at either with a mental sigh the captain explained the fellow in the bull ring has a sword that doesnt sound like enough against an angry bull with sharp horns does it but he also has a cape the cape cant hurt the bull not in a million years but its bright and its showy and so the bull runs right at it and the bullfighter sticks the sword in before the bull even notices karl buhl was marginally quicker than craddock you want us to feint from one direction and hit them from the other is that what youre saying sir morrell glanced at his noncoms they all understood what he was talking about without his having to draw them any pictures some of them were liable to end up with higher ranks than either of their present platoon commanders but buhl and craddock were doing their best so he answered thats right well try going around the right flank and then as soon as theyre all hot and bothered the main force will come straight at em with the machine guns de livering suppressive fire we can assemble back therehe pointedon the little reverse slope theyve been kind enough to leave us had he been commanding the confederate defenders he would have moved his line east from the base of the hill to the top of that reverse slope so hed have had men covering the ground rebel bullets could not now reach if the rebs were going to be generous enough to give him a present like that though he wouldnt turn it down flanking party will attack at tomorrow morning he said buhl youll lead that one well give you a couple of extra machine guns too if things go well you wont be only a feint your attack will turn into the real mccoy you understand what youre to do yes sir the lieutenant answered crisply as long as you dotted all the is and crossed all the ts for him he did well enough ill lead the main force myself starting at morrell said that left craddock with no job but support morrell didnt care for that matter sup port mattered here and could easily turn into something more crossing the open space toward the confederate trenches was liable to get expensive in a hurry and craddock however imperfectly qualified for company command was liable to have it thrust upon him the reconnaissance party slid along the front for a while then drifted back through the forest to where the rest of the company waited an over eager sentry almost took a potshot at them before they would call out the password when the soldier started to apologize morrell praised him for his alertness after darkness fell morrell guided the machinegun crews forward to the positions he wanted them to take that was nervewracking work confeder ate patrols were prowling the woods too and he had to freeze in place more than once to keep from giving away his preparations for the assault it was well past midnight when everything was arranged to his satisfaction he returned to his soldiers huddled without fire on that chilly reverse slope and wrapped himself in his green wool blanket try as he would sleep refused to come moving pictures kept running behind his eyes all the differ ent ways the attack might go all the different things that could go wrong at his orderly a scarfaced laconic fellow named hanley came to tap him on the shoulder im already awake he whispered and hanley nod ded and slipped away just then somebody fired a shot a tredegar by the sound of it not a us springfield the rebel trenches came alive with more gunfire ringing out morrell tensed willing his men not to reply they knew they shouldnt but after a couple of minutes the confederates stopped shooting somebody had seen a shadow hed misliked that was all lieutenant buhl got his half of the attack going at on the dot he was if uninspired at least reliable and with a couple of machine guns yam mering away for fire support he sounded as if he had a hell of a lot more than a platoons worth of men with him morrell passed the word to the rest of his company all right we move up now no shooting unless the rebs discover us or until the time whichever comes first ill skin the man who opens up too soon and gives us away morning twilight was just beginning to seep through the branches of the trees you could see a trunk a couple of paces before youd walk into it but not much farther than that the flank attack sounded as if it was going well not only making progress but also by the counterfire morrell heard drawing rebels to their left his right he held his pocket watch up to his face another two minutes another minute he blew his whistle a piercing blast easily audible through the racket of rifles and machine guns at the signal the maxims hed sneaked up close to the confederate lines started hammering at them morrell wouldnt have cared to be under machine gun fire at what was as close to pointblank range as made little difference screams and cries of dismay said the rebs didnt care for it either narrow arc morrell yelled narrow arc the gunners were supposed to know that already hed told them their jobs the night before if they made the confederates stay under cover in the areas covered by those narrow arcs of fire his men would have stretches of trench they could storm with minimal risk if that didnt happen his men would get slaughtered and so would he he blew the whistle again this time twice burst from the cover of the woods and ran bad leg aching under him toward the confederate trenches if you led like that your soldiers had no excuse not to follow follow they did yelling like so many madmen firing their springfields from the hip as they came you werent likely to hit anybody that way but you made the fellows on the other team keep their heads down that meant they couldnt do as much shooting at you a few bullets did crack past morrell he fired a couple of shots himself but made sure he kept a round in the chamber for when hed really need it faster than he imagined possible he jumped down into the enemy trench nobody waited there to bayonet him or fire at him while he was leaping a rebel with the top of his head neatly clipped off sprawled dead another writhed and moaned clutching a bleeding arm but the only healthy confed erates were trying to get away not fighting back one of his men hurled a grenade at the fleeing rebs a halfpound block of triton explosive with sixteenpenny nails taped all around it and with five seconds worth of fuse hooked up to a blasting cap unlike guns grenades could be used around corners and without showing yourself which made them wonderfully handy for fighting in trenches talk was the munitions factories would start making standardized models any day now till they did improvised versions served well enough more grenades more gunfire a few confederates kept fighting more threw down their rifles and threw up their hands and still more fled through the gulleys that ran east and south from their trench line shall we pursue sir lieutenant craddock asked panting he had the look of a man whod seen a rabbit pulled out of a hat he thought assuredly empty sounding happy but dazed he went on we havent lost but a man or two wounded i dont think and nobody killed good morrell said it was in fact far better than hed dared hope af ter thinking for a moment he shook his head no lieutenant no pursuit not in that terrain the rebs would rally and bushwhack us he pointed ahead where i want to be is the top of that hill we control that we control the countryside around it too and we can start flushing the rebels out at our leisure some of his men were already out of the confederate trench lines and heading up the steep rocky slopes around here the elevation which might have reached fifteen hundred feet was reckoned a mountain morrell didnt like dignifying it with a name he didnt think it deserved whatever you called it though it was the high ground and he intended to seize it he scrambled out of the trench himself he got to the top of the hill bare moments after the sun came out and let him see for miles he pulled his watch out of his pocket and looked at it in some surprise a few minutes past six his part of the fight had taken only a bit more than twenty minutes he put the watch back hed seen a couple of officers carrying pocket watches on leather straps round their wrists that was more convenient than having to dig it out whenever you wanted to know the time maybe hed do it himself one day soon king of the mountain sir one of his soldiers said with a big grin king of the mountain such as it is morrell echoed liking the sound of it he would have liked it even better had the elevation been a more important conquest but every little bit helped enough victories and you won the war he rubbed his chin now that were up here lets see what else we can do when jefferson pinkard and bedford cunningham came back to their sidebyside cottages after another day at the foundry their wives were standing out in front talking the grass was still brown but would be going green soon spring wasnt that far away that wasnt so unusual fanny and emily were good friends if not so tight together as their husbands and emily pinkard had helped fanny get a job at the munitions plant where she was already working what was unusual was the buffcolored envelope fanny held in her left hand only one outfit used paper that color the confederate conscription bu reau jeff recognized the envelope for what it was before his friend did but kept his mouth shut you didnt want to be the one who gave your buddy news like that then bed cunningham spotted the ccb envelope he stopped in his tracks pinkard walked on a couple of steps before he stopped too oh hell cunningham said he shook his head in profound disgust they went and called me up the sons of bitches itll be me next pinkard said offering what consolation he could its not that im afraid to go or anything like that cunningham said you know me jeff i aint yellow jefferson pinkard nodded for that was true his friend went on hell and damnation though aint i worth more to the country here in birmingham than i am somewhere on the front line totin a rifle any damn fool can do that but how many folks can make steel not enough pinkard said like a lot of men hed picked up almost an attorneys knowledge of the way wartime conscription worked you could appeal it bed if the local bureau board wont listen to you i bet the governor would but cunningham gloomily shook his head hed kept his ear to the ground when it came to conscription too heard tell the other day how often the governor overrules the ccb when it comes to suckin people into the army three and a half percent of the time thats it hell three and a half per cent dont even make good beer i missed that one jeff pinkard admitted three and a half percent cunningham repeated with morose satisfac tion states rights aint like what it was in the war of secession when a governor could stand up and spit in jeff davis eye and hed have to take it dont dare do that no more not with everybody so beholden to richmond sorry damn world we live in when a governor aint any bettern the presidents nigger but thats how it goes slowly they went on to cunninghams walk and headed up it together the expressions on their wives faces took away any doubt about what might have been in the ccb envelope bedford cunningham took it out of fannys hand removed the paper inside and read the typewritten note before crumpling it up and throwing it on the ground when do you have to report pinkard asked that seeming the only question still open day after tomorrow cunningham answered they give a man a lot of time to get ready now dont they its not right fanny cunningham said its not fair not even a little bit fair is for when youre rich her husband answered all i could do is the best i could well get by all right now that youre workin honey i didnt like the notion i tell you that much but its turned out pretty good he set a hand on jefferson pinkards shoulder youre the one i feel sorry for jeff me pinkard scratched his head im just goin on doin what i always did they aint messed with me way they have with you not yet they aint but theyre gonna an quickern you think cunningham sounded very certain and proceeded to explain why all right i take off my overalls an they deck me out in butternut foundry works got to go on though we all know that who they gonna get to take my place emily pinkard saw what that meant before her husband did oh lordy she said softly the light went on in jeffs head a moment later they aint gonna put no nigger on day shift he exclaimed but he didnt sound certain even to himself hope youre right cunningham said i wont be around here to see it one way or the other you drop me a line though once i find out where my mail should head to and you tell me whether im right or whether im wrong bet you a stonewall im right the confederate fivedollar goldpiece bore jackson s fierce bearded image they shook hands on the bet solemnly pinkard thought he was likelier to lose it than win but made it anyhow five dollars wouldnt break him and theyd come in handy to a private bringing in less than a dollar a day muttering under his breath cunningham led fanny into their house the evening breeze picked up the conscription notice and skirled it away emily and jeff walked across the lawn to their own cottage up the steps and inside they were both very quiet over the chicken stew emily served up for supper afterwards when jefferson got a pipe going emily said hesitantly jeff they wouldnt really put a nigger alongside you would they pinkard savored a mouthful of honeyed tobacco before he answered you ask me that last year before the war started idve laughed till i ripped a seam in my britches either that or idve grabbed me a shotgun and loaded it with doubleaught buck nowadays though the war goin like it is suckin up white men like a sponge sucks up water who the devil knows what theyll do if they do whatll you do gotta make the steel gotta win the war he said after some thought dont win the damn war nothin else matters nigger dont get uppity reckon i have to work with him for now come the day the wars over though comes the day of payin back debts i got me a vote an i know what to do with it gets bad enough i got me a gun too an i know what to do with that slowly emily nodded i like the way you got o lookin at things honey wish there were some things i didnt have to look at pinkard said maybe were all wrong maybe ill win that stonewall from bed after all never can tell word of cunninghams call to the colors spread fast all the next day people came by the foundry floor with flasks and bottles and jars of home cooked whiskey the foremen looked the other way except when they swung by to grab a nip themselves if any of them knew who was going to replace cunningham they kept their mouths shut the day after that pinkard walked to sloss foundry by himself which seemed strange his head pounded as if someone were pouring molten metal in there then rolling and triphammering it into shape hed done more drinking after he and bed got home hangovers made some men mean he didnt feel mean just drained empty as if part of his world had been taken away he got to the foundry on time hangover or no hangover there waiting for him stood agrippa and vespasian the two negroes who were his and bed ford cunninghams nightshift counterparts however wrong having them around had seemed at first hed grown used to it most days hed nod when he came on and even stand around shooting the breeze with them before they went home to get some sleep almost as if theyd been white men he didnt nod this morning his face went hard and tight as if he were in a saloon and getting ready for a fight three black men stood waiting for him today not just two mornin mistuh pinkard vespasian said agrippa echoed him a moment later they knew what he had to be thinking mornin pinkard said curtly the moment had really come he hadnt believed it no he hadnt wanted to believe it it was here anyhow what was he supposed to do about it before it turned true telling your wife youd stay was easy now should he stand up on his hind legs and go home if he didnt do that hed have to stay here and if he stayed here hed have to work side by side with this negro mistuh pinkard this heres pericles vespasian said nodding at the black man jeff hadnt seen before mornin mistuh pinkard pericles offered like all the negroes sloss foundry had hired since the war began he was a big strapping buck with muscles hard and thick from years in the cotton fields he couldnt have been more than twentyone or twentytwo he had open friendly features and a thin little mustache you could hardly see against his dark skin years in the cotton fields pinkard almost demanded to see his pass book odds were pericles had no legal right to be anywhere but on a plantation but the same probably held true for agrippa and vespasian and for most of the other newly hired negroes at the foundry if the inspectors ever started checking hard theyd shut the sloss works down and the steel had to be made he kin do the work mr pinkard vespasian said we been learnin him on nights so he be ready if the time come he hesitated then added he be my wifes cousin i vouch for him i surely do fish or cut bait jeff thought damn it to hell how could you walk out on your job when your country was in the middle of a war you had to win first then you figured out what was supposed to happen next hed had that much right talking with emily the night before lets get to work he said thank you mr pinkard vespasian breathed pinkard didnt answer vespasian and agrippa didnt push him even if things were changing they knew better than that they nodded to pericles and headed off the floor for the first couple of hours after his shift started pinkard didnt say word one to pericles when he wanted the negro to go somewhere or do something he pointed pericles did as he was directed not with any great skilla few nights watching and pitching in couldnt give you thatbut with willing enthusiasm when pinkard finally did speak it wasnt aimed at pericles but at the world at large the same useless complaint fanny cunningham had made the night before it aint fair mistuh pinkard pericles didnt know how to talk under the foundry floor racket he bellowed to get permission to speak himself when jeff nodded the negro said still loudly fair is for when youre white folks i can only do the best job i know how pinkard chewed on that for a while it sounded a hell of a lot like what his friend had said a couple of nights before when you were down everybody above you looked to have it easy when you were a negro you were always down and everybody was above you hed never really thought of it in those terms before after a bit he shoved the idea aside it made him uncomfortable but he did start talking with pericles after that some things you couldnt explain with just your hands and some things bedford cunningham would have done without thinking were just the sort of things pericles didnt know any more than any other new hire would have the negro caught on fast enough to keep pinkard from snarling at him a couple of times pericles tried to talk about things that werent directly tied to the job pinkard stonily ignored those overtures answering back he thought would have been like a woman cooperating with her ravisher after a while pericles gave up but then when the closing whistle blew he said gnight mr pinkard see you in the mornin yeah pinkard said his mouth out in front of his brain what the hell he thought as he walked home alone didnt do any real harm maybe ill even say mornin tomorrow but nothin after that mind chester martin knew the roanoke river lay only a few hundred yards ahead though he also knew bettermuch betterthan to stick his head up and see just how close the river was the latest us push had moved the battle line in western virginia forward into the suburbs of big lick again a couple of more pushes and theyd be over the river at last so they could clean out the eastern side of the roanoke valley thats what captain wyatt says anyhow martin remarked to paul andersen summarizing the latest army bulletins you believe it any more than i do hell no sarge the corporal answered whats gonna happen next is the rebsll put on a push of their own knock us halfway back to catawba mountain again you wait and see im not gonna argue with you martin said we push them they push us we push them some more these lines arent going to move more than a couple of miles either way from now till doomsday doesnt look like he wished he hadnt said doomsday too many men with whom hed started the war too many replacements toohad already found their doom here i can see it in the fancy history some fool will write after the war an dersen said you know some educated fool the kind who wears those spectacles that stick on your nose but dont have any side pieces to hook em to your ears hell talk about the thirtyseventh battle of the roanoke and thatll be us pushin the rebs back a ways and then hell talk about the thirtyeighth battle of the roanoke two weeks later and thatll be the rebs kickin us back to where we started from and maybe another half a mile besides that all sounds pretty likely martin agreed i just hope to jesus we aint any of the ones who get buried before that thirtyeighth battle most of the time you didnt like to think about such things not when the whole battlefield stank of death to the point where if you werent used to it and just fell here from say philadelphia youd puke your guts up for a week it wasnt cold enough to fight the stink as it had been a few weeks before heads up andersen pointed down the trench visiting fireman com ing this way sure enough here came captain wyatt with a fellow martin hadnt seen before an older man wearing a majors uniform cleaner than those of most soldiers who actually made their living in the front lines some sort of inspector snooping around to see what he thinks weve done all wrong martin thought he hated people like that hated them with the cold contempt a practical man gives a theoreticians highflown useless notions he started to laugh and turned his face away so the new major whoever he was wouldnt see the fellow had spectacles just like the ones to which paul andersen had slightingly referred and a sandy mustache heavily streaked with gray and a mouth full of big square teeth chester martins head whipped around it couldnt be but it was ander sen was staring and staring captain wyatt said boys heres the president of the united states come to see the war for himself martin hadnt come to attention in the frontline trenches in months now he stiffened to straightness so suddenly his backbone cracked like knuckles beside him andersen also came to a stiff brace at ease teddy roosevelt said as you were i came here to see soldiers not marionettes yes sir martin relaxed though not all the way if the battlefield stench bothered tr he didnt let on he acted like a soldier though he hadnt led troops into battle in thirty years or so but he really could have been an elderly major not just some politician posturing for the newspapers as if picking that thought out of martins mind roosevelt said reporters dont know im here far as they know which isnt far believe me not with most of themim still in philadelphia if the papers dont know maybe the rebs dont know you think they wouldnt like to put one between my eyes yes sir they sure would martin said if the confederates did know the president was here theyd do everything they could to keep him from getting away again this isnt what war was like out on the plains back before you were born roosevelt said there was glory in that the sweep of horses rushing forward movement adventure this the most i can say for this gentle men is that its necessary and what we gain from it will make certain that the united states of america take their proud and rightful place among the nations of the world once more when you listened to the president talking you forgot the reek of unburied bodies the mud the lice the barbed wire the machine guns you saw farther than your length of trench you got a glimpse of the country that would come out the other side of this war it was a place where you wanted to be too yeah and what are the odds of that asked the part of martin that had been under fire for months do you really think youre going to come through alive or with all your arms and legs if you do live captain wyatt said we hope sir that the next offensive will bring us up to the river and from there well proceed toward the blue ridge mountains bully tr said our german allies have offensives in the works too with gods help theyll strike the french and the english a heavy blow on the continent he shook his head i dont know what we would have done without germany boys with england and france backing up the rebels we were fighting out of our weight when we tried to scrap with them not now though by jingo not now yes sir martin said we have friends in high places eh the allhighest place tr answered with his famous chuckle still boy ish though he was in his midfifties kaiser wilhelms done everything he could for us and weve paid him back thanks to soldiers like you men martin didnt stand straighter now roosevelt had ordered him to be at his ease but he felt tall and proud just the same again tr made him believe the war had a point a goal beyond the miseries of the front he wondered how long hed go on believing that once the president left a few hundred yards off a couple of us machine guns started hammer ing away at some confederate target or other rifle fire answered from the rebel lines and then their machine guns after a few minutes us field guns started pounding the enemys forward trenches captain wyatt frowned they shouldnt be doing that not now its going to bring down captain i didnt come here to watch a sundayschool debating society president roosevelt said this is war i know what war is i before he could finish the confederates quickfiring threeinch guns started raining shells down on and near the us front lines the rebs seldom wasted time replying to an artillery bombardment paul andersen threw himself flat captain wyatt threw himself flat to martins horror he saw tr start to stand up on a firing step so he could get a better look at what was going on without thinking he knocked the president down with a block from behind that would have been illegal in a football match then flopped over trs squirming body stay flat dammit he shouted hed never expected to have the presidents ear now that he did this was what he got to tell him it would have been funny if he hadnt worried about getting killed shrapnel balls and jagged bits of shell casing whined through the air bigger us guns started firing trying to silence the confederate field pieces bigger rebel guns struck back at the bigger us guns both sides forgot about the men at the front for a while warily chester martin sat up that let tr get up too martin gulped wondering what the penalty was for levelling the president but all roosevelt said was thank you sergeant you know conditions here better than i uh thank you sir martin looked at roosevelt whose greengray uniform was now as muddy as his own you look like a real modern soldier now sir the president of the united states laughed like a man possessed x l ucien galtier muttered unhappily to himself as he loaded the jug of kerosene into the back of his wagon the ration the american soldiers allowed people was ridiculously small thank god nights were shorter now than they had been in the middle of winter but he still had to leave a lot of his lamps dry the world he was convinced held no justice no it certainly is not fair he told his horse which for once forbore to argue with him when a man comes into a town he cannot even buy for himself a drink of a sort he cannot get at home strictly speaking that wasnt true none of the taverns in riviereduloup had signs up orderingor even advisingtownsmen and local farmers to stay out nor were the taverns out of liquor a lot of their stock these days was shipped up from the united states but that did not mean it would not burn in your boiler drinks in fact were actually cheaper these days than they had been before the war started because the occupying authority taxed liquor at a lower rate than the provincial government had all of which was silver lining on a large dark cloud if you went into a tavern you were almost certain to find it full of american soldiers which was the reason the occupying authority held down liquor prices and american soldiers especially american soldiers with drink in them did not take kindly to sharing what they thought of as their taverns with the locals oh you might go in have a whiskey and get out again lucien said his horses ears twitched perhaps in sympathy but more likely knowing the beast in mockery but if there should be a fight what is one to do there are always many soldiers they are always all against you and even if your country men come to your aid it leads merely to riot and then to punishment of the entire unfortunate town all this for one little drink it is not worth it the horse snorted maybe that meant it agreed maybe that meant it thought galtier was complaining too much too if it did too bad he could complain to the horse without worrying his wife and without making her angry too for she was less than delighted when he went into a tavern even for one whiskey her fixed view of the matter being that no one ever went into a tavern for only one whiskey galtier was just climbing up into the wagon when from behind him a cheery voice said god bless you lucien he turned oh good day to you father pascal pardon me if you please i did not hear you come up i am desolate there is no need to apologize my son father pascal said with an ami able wave of his hand you are full of your own concerns as any busy man would of course be he studied galtier his black eyes though set rather close together were clever and keen i pray your affairs march well they march well enough thank you father lucien would complain to his horse he would complain to his wife he would not complain to father pascal these past months he had even taken to editing his confessions which he knew imperilled his soul but which helped keep his mortal flesh secure fa ther pascal was too friendly to the americans to suit him i am glad to hear that the priest salted his words with the lightest sprinkling of irony lucien sometimes thought he talked like a lawyer father pascal went on i am glad to see you have survived a winter difficult in so many ways yes i have survived galtier agreed i would have done better than that had the americans whom you love so well not stolen everything that would have let me get through with something more than bare survival and your family they are all thriving father pascal asked we are well thank you yes no one had starved no one had come down with tuberculosis or rheumatic fever was that thriving lucien didnt know not for certain whatever doubts he had though he would not admit to the priest father pascal raised his hands in a gesture of benediction his palms were pink and plump and soft with none of the calluses ridging galtiers hands his nails were clean and not a one of them broken truly he lived a different life from that of a farmer god be praised they are well he said turning his clever eyes toward heaven for a moment and how do your prospects seem for the coming year who can guess lucien said with a shrug the course of our health the course of the weather the course of the war all these things are in gods hands not mine there now i have been pious for him maybe he will go away but father pascal did not go away in gods hands yes we are all in gods hands the course of the warwho can guess the course of the war but then who would have guessed a year ago the americans would be here you are right in that regard father galtier said some priests might have compared the coming of the americans to the ten plagues god had vis ited upon the egyptians father pascal didnt every line on his chubby wellfed face said he was content with the military government maybe lucien let some of that thought show on his own face a mistake father pascal said i am but a humble religious a priest of god who the secular ruler over my parish may be is not my concern father pascal was a great many things but humble was none of them was he lying or did he think of himself so galtier couldnt tell certainly father i understand he said still seeking a polite way out of this meeting i am so glad you do the priest said heartily laying one of those smooth wellmanicured hands on luciens arm for too many people impartiality is often mistaken for its opposite do you believe it i am often accused of favouring the americans yes i believe that i have good reason to believe that what a pity galtier said but he could not bring himself to shake off father pascals hand climb into the wagon and get away as fast as he could that might arouse sus picion too if you should hear this vicious lie i beg of you give it no credit father pascal said with such earnestness in his voice that for a moment lucien won dered whether what everyone said was wrong but then the priest continued should you hear such calumnies my son i would be in your debt if you would be generous enough to inform me who has spoken them that i may pray for the salvation of his soul of course father lucien said clocks in the church towers began chiming eleven which gave him the excuse he needed father forgive me but i have a long ride back to my farm and the hour is later than i thought i would not keep you go with god smiling sleek doing ever so well under the new regime father pascal went on down the street with the determined strides of a man who has important places to go important things to do he nodded to two american soldiers and then to an old woman in mourning black does he think me a simpleton a cretin lucien asked his horse when they were well out of riviereduloup and the animals ears were the only ones that could hear tell me who is saying bad things about me and i will pray for him he says he will pray by god pray that the americans catch the poor fellow and he will tell the american commandant to help make his prayers come true what do you think of that my old the horse did not answer the lord had not chosen to do for it as he had once for balaams ass to luciens silent patient audience of one he went on a simpleton a cretin no he thinks me worse than that he thinks me a collaborator as he is himself and this this is what i think of him he leaned over the side of the wagon and spat in the dirt the very idea offended him why would anyone collaborate with the americans whenever scipio went to cassius cottage he went with fear and trembling in his heart the fear was not a simple one which only made it tougher to deal with half the time he was afraid the mistress had found out what he was doing and that white patrollers or maybe white soldierswith rifles and bayonets and dogs with long sharp teeth were on his trail the other half he was afraid cassius and his fellow wouldbe revolutionaries had somehow divined he was not heart and soul with them in their red fervour and that they were going to get rid of him because of that sometimes too he carried both fears at once in odd moments he tried to figure out which was deeper more compelling it was like trying to decide whether youd rather be hanged or shot just like that he thought uncomfortably when all your choices were bad did worse matter here was the cottage he felt conspicuous coming out to the huts in his fancy butlers livery though hed been doing it for years hed been passing a good deal of time in cassius cottage for years too he kept telling himself no one should notice anything amiss making himself believe it was harder never till the previous fall had he done the kinds of things in this cottage he was doing now he knocked that you kip came the question from within cassius voice this me scipio agreed swallowing the misery he dared not show the door opened there stood cassius come in wid we he said smiling slim strong dangerous as a water moccasin in the swamps set a spell we talk about things you n me we do dat scipio said and stepped into the cabin he never saw any one there but the people who had been reading the communist manifesto together the night hed found out they werent just labourers but reds that made sense the less he knew the less he could betray wet yo whistle cassius asked and pointed to a jug of corn whiskey sitting up on the mantel scipio started to shake his head but found himself nodding instead cassius handed him the jug he took a long pull the raw illegal whiskey ran down his throat like a river of fire and exploded in his belly the woman named cherry said you hep we learn dese prayers kip she handed him a paperbound book with an orange cover the printing on that cover did indeed proclaim it a tract just as the bluecovered book that had got him into this mess had said it was a hymnbook you couldnt tell a book by its cover though not in cassius cottage you couldnt island and a couple of other people did start to sing hymns in case any body was snooping around outside under cover of their racket cassius sat down by scipio at the rickety table in his cottage and bent over the book with the orange cover with him the hunters finger pointed out a passage read dat he said obediently scipios eyes went back and forth labor is prior to and independent of capital he read capital is only the fruit of labour and could never have existed if labour had not first existed labor is the superior of capital and deserves much the higher consideration what you think o that there cassius asked all fit in wid everything else scipio answered sound like de trut he almost slipped out of the dialect of the congaree the words hed just read did not fit in with that ignorant speech cassius finger scarred callusedfound another place now you read dat we all declare for liberty but in using the same word we do not all mean the same thing scipio read with some the word means for each man to do as he pleases with himself and with the product of his labour with others the same word means for some men to do as they please with other men and the product of other mens labour the fullness of time i am convinced will prove to the world which is the true definition of the word and my earnest hope remains that the united states of america shall yet lead the way in the proving who write this scipio asked a lot of what hed read here had the taste of being translated from a foreign language not this it was simple and direct and powerful english as it was meant to be written one of the things hed acquired serving anne colleton and which he discovered he could not simply abandon was a sense of style cassius eyes gleamed with amusement same fellow write the other scipio gave the hunter a dirty look cassius enjoyed leading him around by the nose the same way he enjoyed all reversals and practical jokes cassius also enjoyed having an intellectual advantage on him scipio had never be lieved cassius did much thinking at all he hadnt even known the hunter could read hed turned out to be wrong cassius thought was anything but wideranging but in its track it ran deep patiently scipio asked the next question and who that is not them marx and engels fellers i bet everybody looked at him when your thought ran in a narrow track and ran deep in that track climbing up and peering over the edge became suspicious these reds despised the way all the white folks in the confederate states thought alike but if any of their own number presumed to deviate from their doctrine he got in just as much trouble maybe more why for you say dat cherry demanded she looked as if she wanted to drop scipio in the congaree swamp right then and there he wished hed kept his mouth shut hed wished that a lot of times around these people but since he hadnt he had to answer the question it aint wrote like tother stuff i read cassius laughed got we a perfesser here but is he dat smart he shook his head no or he know who do dat work unlike a lot of jokers he knew when to cut a joke short as he did now these words wrote by abraham lincoln lincoln do jesus scipio thumped his forehead with the heel of his hand should cipher that out my own self he see the truth early on cassius said he say that first one while he president of the usa an de second one years after in montana territory do jesus scipio said again impressed lincoln had served only one term as president of the united states hed been unceremoniously booted out of office after the confederacy broke away from the usa but he hadnt left politics even then hed led most of the republicans into union with the socialist party after the second mexican war no wonder he sound like one o we cassius nodded strong agreement dat man be alive today he wid we he want evbody equal only way to do dat make de revolution caint do it no ways else git de pressors off we we do swell whole country do swell he and his revolutionary cohorts all nodded like the preacher and the congregation in church on sunday morning scipio made sure he nodded too if you didnt pay attention to the preacher he gave you a hard time later if you didnt pay attention to cassius he gave you a funeral now he said miss anne she talk wid any new strange white folks they after our scent like hounds we got to watch sharp nobody new i see scipio answered truthfully then he asked how they after we from the moment hed first set eyes on the deadly words of the communist manifesto hed known what sort of game he was playing and what its likely outcome would be but he didnt like cassius reminding him of it the hunter the redsaid they done cotched a few o we army niggers get careless talk too much where de white folks hear sometimes you catch one he know de name o nudder one and he know two more names that picture was clearer than any marcel duchamp had ever painted sci pio wanted to get up and run somewhere far away from marshlands as anne colletons butler he had a passbook that gave him more legal freedom of movement than any other negro on the plantation he wasnt very much afraid of the patrollers catching up to him but if he tried to disappear it was all too likely cassius revolutionaries would hunt him down and dispose of him he imagined red cells in every group of blacks in the confederacy what one knew all would know whom one wanted dead all would work to kill cassius said de day don wait much longer de revolution happen an de revolution happen soon we rise up we get what dey hoi back from we fo so long de white folks want de cotton let de white folks grow de cotton an grub it out o de groun dey dont sploit us no mo never again scipio did keep his mouth shut though that meant biting down on the inside of his lip till he tasted blood the white folks werent going to sit around peaceable and quiet when the rebellion started hed tried saying that a few times but nobody wanted to listen to him he wondered if he could get into the empire of mexico some kind of way and never ever come back marching with a hangover was not paul mantarakis idea of fun it did however beat the stuffing out of going into a frontline trench to be shot at and shelled hed be doing that soon enough much too soon to suit him any time between the current moment and forever would have been much too soon to suit him a couple of men away from mantarakis gordon mcsweeney tramped along singing a mighty fortress is our god mcsweeney had a big bass voice and couldnt have carried a tune in a washtub his booming false notes made mantarakis headache worse you couldnt just tell him to put a sock in it though however much you wanted to if you did youd find yourself facing a couple of hundred pounds of angry fanatical scotsman guile was called for even hung over guile mantarakis had that was a good leave wasnt it gordon he said addressed directly mcsweeney felt obliged to answer which meant he stopped singing the point to the exercise in guile indeed a good leave he said seriouslyhe was always serious except when he was furious i prayed harder i think than i ever have before dice werent going your way eh mantarakis knew that was a mistake but couldnt resist the idea of praying in a town like dixon kentucky after it had become a us army leave center tickled his sense of the absurd i do not gamble mcsweeney said indignantly i do not poison my body and my spirit with spirituous liquors and i do not consort with loose vile immoral women sergeant peterquist was marching along a couple of men over on mcsweeneys other side grinning he said sort of takes a lot of the point out of going on leave doesnt it i will not be mocked mcsweeney said about as close as he dared come to telling his sergeant to go to hell he was bigger than peterquist and meaner too but mantarakis would have bet on the noncom if they ever tangled peterquist was a sneaky bastard he would have made a pretty fair greek paul thought meaning it as a compliment ignoring mcsweeney the sergeant asked mantarakis you go to a house with white girls or colored colored mantarakis answered it was cheaper and you go to any place like that white or colored you aint lookin for anything special just to get the lead out of your pencil had a little more money to drink with mcsweeney started singing his hymn again louder than ever so he wouldnt have to listen to his comrades lewd conversation peterquist looked at mantarakis they both grinned ruefully maybe neither of them made a good greek they should have been able to figure out what the effect of talking about going to a whorehouse would have on the pious mcsweeney but when you were coming out of dixon what was on your mind unless you were pious was all the different ways youd had a good time the countryside looked as if hell had been there but had gone away on vacation like every inch of kentucky in us hands it had been fought over but that had been the fall and winter before new grass was beginning to spring up hiding the worst scars of the fighting even the town of beulah kentucky eight or nine miles north of the front didnt look too bad it had also been in us hands and out of confederate artillery range most of that time though the rebel offensive coming up out of the south meant longrange guns bore on it again still it seemed resigned to the prospect of flying the stars and stripes for the first time in a couple of generations and a good many buildings damaged when it was captured had been repaired since south of beulah though you were back in the war no two ways about it mantarakis trudged past wagon parks city blocks on a side and horse corrals alongside them full of animals chewing on hay and oats every so often his regiment had to get off the dirt road onto the verge to let a convoy of trucks rumble past carrying supplies up to the line or to make way for an ambulance red cross prominently displayed on a white background transporting wounded men back toward beulah there were munitions dumps scattered here and there across the landscape too shells standing on the ground as if they were the dragons teeth cadmus had sown to raise a crop of soldiers but they didnt raise men they razed them when the pun occurred to mantarakis he tried to explain it to the men marching with him and got only blank looks for his trouble the rebel offensive had been halted just south of dawson springs there hell hadnt gone on vacation the confederates might not have managed to take the town but theyd shelled it into ruin so many of the buildings were either burnt or wrecked so many craters pocked the ground it was hard to tell where exactly the roads had run before dawson springs made wars acquaintance just past dawson springs mantarakis heard a buzzing in the air his head swivelled rapidly till he spotted the aeroplane coming north it skimmed along low to the ground paralleling the road down which he was marching for a moment that made him think it was an american aeroplane returning from the front then he spied the confederate battle flags painted on the fabric under each wing the pilot must have seen the regiment before paul noticed him he brought the aeroplane down even lower right down to treetop height that gave the observer a perfect chance to rake the column of us soldiers with his machine gun men screamed and fell and ran every which way a few coolerheaded than the rest stood in place and fired back at the rebel aeroplane with their springfields mantarakis admired their sangfroid without trying to imitate it he was utterly unashamed to dive into a muddy ditch by the side of the road bullets kicked up dirt not far away ignoring the rifle fire the aeroplane wheeled through a turn and came back south down the other side of the road raking the regiment all over again then pilot and observer no doubt laughing to each other about shooting fish in a barrel it streaked away for home going flat out now mantarakis got out of the ditch he was filthy and wet as if hed been in the trenches for a month instead of away from them muddy water dripped from the brim of his cap his nose his chin his elbows his belt buckle gordon mcsweeney stood like a rock in the middle of the roadway still firing after the confederate aeroplane although by now his chances of hitting it were slim indeed officers and noncoms shouted and blew whistles trying to get the regiment back into marching order a familiar voice was missing there lay sergeant peterquist not moving blood soaked the damp hardpacked dirt of the roadway a bullet had torn through his neck and almost torn off his head kyrie eleison mantarakis murmured and made the sign of the cross popery damned popery mcsweeney said above him oh shut up gordon mantarakis said as if to a pushy fiveyearold the really funny thing was that the orthodox church reckoned the pope every bit as much a heretic as any scotch presbyterian did youll do his soul no good with your mummeries mcsweeney insisted paul paid no attention to him if peterquist was dead somebody would have to do his job mantarakis looked around for corporal stankiewicz and didnt see him maybe hed been wounded and dragged off maybe he was still hiding maybe maybe none of that mattered what did matter was that he wasnt here even if he wasnt the job again needed doing mantarakis shouted for his section to form up around him and then as an afterthought to get the dead and wounded off to the side of the road a lot of people were shouting but not many of the shouts were as purposeful as his because he sounded like someone who knew what he was doing men listened to him lieutenant hinshaw had his whole scattered platoon to reassemble by the time he got around to the section sergeant peterquist had led it was ready to get moving again which was more than a lot of the column could say good work hinshaw said looking over the assembled men and the casualties moved out of the line of march stankiewicz was among them shot in the arm on the rebel aeroplanes second pass then he noticed the absence of noncoms who pulled you people together like this nobody said anything for half a minute or so mantarakis shuffled his feet and looked down at the bloodstained dirt he didnt want to get a name for blowing his own horn then gordon mcsweeney said it was the little greek sir mantarakis most of the time paul was in trouble when the lieutenant called his name but hinshaw nodded and said if you do the work you should have the rank to go with it youre a corporal starting now mantarakis saluted thank you sir that meant more pay not that you were ever going to get rich not in this mans army it also meant more duties but that was how things went you got a little you gave a little or in the army you got a little and odds were you gave a lot the pillar of black greasy smoke rose high into the sky northwest of okmulgee sequoyah maybe higher for all stephen ramsay knew than an aeroplane could fly the fires at the base of that pillar didnt crackle didnt hiss didnt roar they bellowed like a herd of oxen in eternal agony even from miles away as he was now it was the biggest noise around it was the biggest sight around too an ugly red carbuncle lighting up a whole corner of the horizon captain lincoln looked at the vast leaping hellish flames with sombre satisfaction weve denied that oil field to the enemy he said yes sir ramsay said anybody tries to put out those fires hes gonna be a long time doin it less than youd think sergeant less than youd think lincoln said put a charge of dynamite in the right place and whumpl out it goes but even if the damnyankees do that they wont be drawing any crude oil or gas from those wells for a long time which was the point of the exercise they sure wont sir ramsay sighed and patted his horses neck with a gloved hand who wouldve thought the damnyankees could push us back like this we dont do some fightin back theyre gonna run us out of se quoyah altogether push us into texas an arkansas too damn many of em lincoln spat down into the dirt were liable to have to fall back through okmulgee and the chief of the creek nation will pitch a fit if we do yeah well if he doesnt like it hes just going to have to go peddle his papers ramsay said either that or pull some men out from under his war bonnet lincoln sighed the war had worn on himnot just the fighting but the dickering too ramsay hadnt figured dickering would be a part of warif you had a gun you could tell the other guy what to do couldnt youbut it was the captain said we arent like the usa one of the reasons we fought the war of secession was to keep the national government from telling the states what they had to do makes us a hell of a lot freer than the damnyankees ramsay said it being an article of faith in the csa that living in the usa was at most a short step better than living under the tyranny of the czars these days of course russia was an ally so nobody said much about the czars but the principle remained the same yeah it does lincoln said with another sigh but it means sometimes we have to go through a whole lot of arguing to get through something the yanks could deal with by giving a couple of orders and here in sequoyah you may have noticed its even more complicated than it is anyplace else nov that you mention it sir i have noticed that ramsay admitted drawing a wan smile from the captain sequoyah by itself was a confederate state but within its borders lay five separate nations those of the creeks cherokees choctaws chickasaws and seminoles the five civilized tribes they kept their local autonomy and guarded it with zeal the governor of sequoyah sometimes had more trouble getting their chiefs to cooperate with him than president wilson did with the governors of the confederate states and since a lot of the states petroleum and oil lay under land that belonged to the indian nations they had enough money on their own to keep the state government coming to them hat in hand they were enthusiastic about the government in richmond not resigned like most people in the confederacy they had reason to be because it kept the state government off their backs but they expected the national government which now meant the armyto come through for them too and justify faith by works lincoln said if i have to tell charlie fixico im pulling out of okmulgee without even trying to defend the town you know what hes going to do hes going to write his congressman back in richmond and since his congress man just happens to be named ben fixico that makes me toast without any marmalade but what am i supposed to do he wasnt really looking for an answer captains didnt get answers from sergeants lieutenants frequently did but not captains captains had to come up with their own answers no matter how unpleasant a prospect that was and come up with an answer lincoln did he got help from a yankee field gun which started landing shells in front of the cavalry company the foun tains of smoke and dirt were several hundred yards short but the confeder ates had no field guns of their own with which to reply before long the us forces would move that gun forward and bring up others alongside it back to okmulgee lincoln shouted at his order the company bugler sounded the retreat with the rest of the company ramsay rode southeast toward the capital of the creek nation okmulgee lay in a low broad valley with treecovered hills on either side as the confederates came into the valley ramsay saw that the town was seething like an anthill to which somebody had just delivered a good swift kick a train was pulling out heading south it had nothing but freight cars but ramsay would have bet those were packed with people hed even seen some with signs painted on their sides men or horses the road south out of okmulgee was certainly packed with people wagons buggies barrows horses and other livestock captain lincoln might have intended retreating through okmulgee rather than into it but getting out the other side wouldnt be easy the creek nation council house was a twostory brown stone building in the center of town with the cupola rising above it it was easily the most impressive structure in okmulgee and would have made a good fort till can non started blowing it to bits outside the council house waited a delegation of redskinned men in sombre black suits they had gathered together a bunch of younger indians who wore much more nondescript clothesexcept for red bandannas tied to their left sleeves as armbandsand who carried a motley assortment of weapons shotguns squirrel guns and what looked to be a cou ple of singleshot muzzleloaders that went all the way back to the days of the war of secession one of the creek bigshots stepped out into the middle of the road as the cavalry drew near he held up his right hand captain lincoln had the choice of reining in or pretending he wasnt there swearing under his breath the captain reined in save our city the indian cried save our nation do not abandon us to the merciless united states whose soldiers we fought a hundred years ago long before the south saw it had to escape the brutal oppression that came from washington as chief of the nation i beg you the delegations from the house of kings and the house of warriors beg you as well charlie fixico gestured to the indians in fancy dress they added their voices to his it was when you got down to it a hell of an impressive performance he moved his hand and the delegationlocal senators and congressmen ramsay supposed they werefell silent so he could talk some more we do not ask you to perform any duty we would not share he said now pointing to the young indians with armbands we will help you defend our homes and our lands we will fight whether you stay or go but we beg you to stand by us now as we stood by you in the war of secession and the second mexican war captain lincoln looked mad at first and then helpless stephen ramsay understood that it was a hell of a speech he wondered how many times charlie fixico had practiced it in front of a mirror so he could bring it out pat like that if captain lincoln led the cavalry out of okmulgee now hed feel like a skunk for the rest of his daysand a lot of the troopers who heard the speech would think he was a skunk too ramsay glanced over to the young creek men were they really ready to do or die for the creek nation even if they were would it make any difference you ran amateur soldiers up against veterans odds were the amateurs would come out looking as if theyd just been through a grinding mill he was glad the decision was not his to make captain lincoln looked back toward the northwest toward the burning oil wells his troopers had had to abandon there were more oil wells in and around okmulgee and still more south of town if he could save any of them for the confederacy that would be worth doing if on the other hand he was just throwing his command away charlie fixico went down on his knees and held his hands up high in the air at that so did the men from the house of kings and the house of warriors ramsay had never seen anybody just get down and beg like that god damn it captain lincoln muttered under his breath with luck not so loud the creeks could hear it then realizing he had to give an answer he raised his voice all right chief well make a stand in okmulgee lets get some firing pits dug and well see what we can do charlie fixico scrambled to his feet spry for a fellow a long way from young he clutched lincoln s hand god bless you captain you wont be sorry for this he exclaimed by the look in his eye captain lincoln was sorry already in town here the company would have to fight as infantry sending their horses south with the retreating creeks ramsay took charge of the young men am i supposed to call em braves he wonderedwith armbands on their sleeves they were ready as all getout to shoot at the damnyankees but when he sent them into a hardware store to commandeer shovelsso they could start digging foxholes and trenches they almost balked look he said more patiently than hed expected the idea is to kill the other guy not to get killed yourself shells start falling here bullets start flying around youre going to be damn glad to have a hole in the ground to hide in they werent soldiers it wasnt so much that they didnt believe him they didnt have a clue as to what he was talking about they worked like sulking negroes till charlie fixico yelled something at them in their own language after that they sped upa little captain lincoln sited one of the company machine guns so it fired up sixth street and the other so it fired up fourth when the yankees came into town those would give them something to think about wait till you have a good target ramsay told the crew at sixth and morton in front of the creek council house we want to make the bastards pay for everything they get us troops were not long in coming field guns started landing three inch shells on the town the redarmbanded creeks dove for the holes they hadnt wanted to dig to ramsays amazement one of them shouted an apology to him he waved back he wondered how much ammunition each indian had for his gun with all those different calibers no hope in hell the cavalry could resupply them when they ran dry he also wondered what the yankees would do with any creeks they captured was a red armband uniform enough to let them count as prisoners of war or would the yanks call them francstireurs and shoot them out of hand the way the huns had done in france and were doing in belgium for the creeks sake ramsay hoped they didnt find out he had his own foxhole nicely dug sited under a tree that would give him cover if and when he had to pull back as he probably would sooner or later he peered north up fifth street looking to see how close the yanks were as hed expected here they came greengray waves of infantry trudging toward okmulgee leaning forward a little under the weight of their packs hold fire till theyre good and close captain lincoln yelled we want the machine guns to be able to chew up a whole bunch of em when we open up his own men understood the reasoning behind the order but the creeks had never been in combat before as soon as they saw us soldiers they started shooting at them sure as hell one of them not far from ramsay did have a rifle musket from his grandfathers day a great cloud of blackpowder smoke rose above the kids firing pit the yankees went to earth the minute they started taking fire ramsay swore under his breath now theyd advance in small groups instead of the one great wave the machine guns might have broken well the game didnt always go the way you wished it would fire at will captain lincoln shouted sounding as disgusted as ramsay felt the machine guns started chattering us soldiers fell ramsay found a target and fired the yankee hed aimed at went down but more us soldiers kept coming the confederates fired steadily taking a good toll and the creeks surprised ramsay they stayed in their places and kept shooting you couldnt hope for anything more not from raw troops they might not have had discipline but they were brave when their entry into okmulgee stalled the damnyankees gave the town another bigger dose of artillery to make the defenders keep their heads down under cover of the bombardment they got men into the northern fringes of the builtup area the forward most confederate troopers came running back toward the center of town ramsay didnt notice any creeks coming back he whistled softly they were brave he felt cramped fighting in amongst buildings rather than out on the plains unhorsed he felt slow too could he get away if trouble got bad he began to think hed have to find out the hard way thenand he laughed as the comparison occurred to himlike cavalry riding to the rescue artillery fire began falling on the advancing yankees just outside of okmulgee if that wasnt a whole battery of those quickfiring threeinchers hed go off and eat worms caught out in the open the us soldiers toppled as if scythed ramsay whooped like an indianjust like an indian because several creeks not far away were letting out the same kind of happy yells they probably figured the fight was as good as won ramsay wished he could believe the same thing unfortunately he knew better whatever else you said about the yankees they were stubborn bastards still if there was artillery in the neighbourhood maybe there was infantry around too put a regiment in here instead of a cavalry company and some ragtag civilians and okmulgee would hold against damn near anything the usa could throw at it he looked back over his shoulder then started laughing all over again hell of a war he muttered when the cavalrys got to look to the infantry to come to the rescue jonathan moss looked with something less than joy untrammelled toward the new aeroplanes the squadron was receiving the wright s usually nicknamed wilburs were very different machines from the curtiss super hudsons they were replacing hed grown used to the super hudsons he knew everything they could do and he wasnt so stupid as to try to make them do things they couldnt that was how you ended up dead captain elijah franklin expounded on the wilburs virtues now we have aeroplanes than can climb and dive with the avros the damned canucks and limeys are flying we wont have to scurry for home if we get in trouble moss caught lyman baums eye both men shook their heads just a little they hadnt run for home when they faced avrosvery much the reverse a curtiss machine could turn inside the circle of which the britishmade aeroplanes were capable but the wilbur was a bus as big as a bus itself and sir moss stuck up a hand what is it franklin asked a bit testy at being interrupted before his spiel was done he had a pinched narrow face and looked as if his stomach pained him all the time it probably did that didnt keep him from drinking like a fish when he wasnt flying sir one of the biggest advantages we had in the curtiss was a forwardfacing machine gun moss said this is a tractor machine with the prop in front now were going to be limited to observer fire just like the canucks if i see a target i want to be able to aim at it and shoot it straight on not wiggle around so the observer gets to fire off at an angle everybody in the squadron spoke up loudly agreeing with him franklin stood quiet perhaps waiting to see if the hubbub would die away when it didnt he held up a hand little by little he got quiet into it he said theyre working on that and then clammed up again the terse announcement produced more hubbub through it jonathan moss called you mean somebody has finally made a working interrupter gear sir if you could synchronize the speed at which your machine gun fired with that at which your prop revolved you could mount a forwardfacing gun on a tractor aeroplane and not shoot yourself down faster than the enemy moss had heard of a couple of people whod shod their wooden propellor blades with steel to deflect illtimed bullets but sooner or later a ricochet was going to come straight back at you so that wasnt the ideal solution an interrupter gear though then captain franklin said no they dont have one yet and dashed his hopes but the squadron commander went on they are getting close though or at least they think they are and when they do get one they promise the frontline squadrons will have it first thing they promise santa claus brings you toys too and the easter bunny hides eggs stanley mcclintock said they promised wed be in toronto before the snow fell and winnipeg and richmond and guaymasthough i dont know that it ever snows down there but i believe that kind of story when it comes true and not a minute before then if youre a defeatist franklin said coldly you can take off your wings right now ill give you a white feather instead the way the limey girls do when their boyfriends dont want to go off and fight mcclintock stomped toward the squadron commander of whom he made close to two franklin moved not an inch it wasnt his rank armouring him jonathan moss knew just a stubborn determination not to back down to anybody mcclintock shouted god damn it captain you know im no coward but when i switch buses i want to have a pretty good idea that im doing it for a reason that the new bushe jerked a thumb toward a wilburis likelier to keep me in one piece than the old one was youve flown it franklin said weve all flown it it performs a damn sight better than a curtiss is that so or isnt it it doesnt turn as well moss said thats true franklin admitted but it climbs better and it dives better and it accelerates better one of the reasons the super hudson turned so tight was that it couldnt go fast enough to take up a lot of space in a turn is that so or isnt it moss kept quiet it was so you didnt want the canadians or british chasing you because theyd damn well catch you but hed got comfortable with his old machine it was he supposed like a marriage you knew what your partner was going to do now he was going to a partner he didnt know nearly so well franklin said enough of this nonsense weve got them and were damn well going to use them till we get something better theyve shipped the super hudsons off to colorado i think they said or maybe utah someplace where they can do reconnaissance and not have to go up against anybodys varsity anyway we do thats another reason we get the wilbursyou men can do your job as pilots and the observers youll have with you can observe lifes getting too complicated for one man to do both jobs up there at the same time but for a sigh moss remained quiet again the squadron commander was probably right again moss found the truth unpalatable lyman baum said other thing is sir i dont like trusting my neck to the observer id rather have my own gun now instead of waiting to get one in the great byandby observers he let that hang there most observers who were just observers and not pilotobservers like the members of the squadron were guys who had been through flight school and hadnt made it as pilots that made everybody suspect there was something secondrate about them if you knew darn well you were firstrate and youd got used to being your own gunner how were you going to shout hurrah at the idea of turning over the shooting to somebody you didnt figure could match you as if baums question had been a cue a truck chugged up to the aerodrome and started disgorging men in khaki with overladen duffel bags and with flight badges that had only one wing not a pilots two captain franklin nodded hed expected them gentlemen your observers he said while the newcomers were still getting out does anyone care to express any further illfounded opinions no good moss kicked at the dirt the captain had a point you couldnt condemn out of hand a man youd never met but baum had a point too if a fellow was liable to be a lemon did you really want to meet him whether you did or not you were going to from a breast pocket franklin pulled out a sheet of stationery folded in quarters before he unfolded it he waved the observers over to him they came some with their bags slung over a shoulder some carrying them in front some dragging them along the ground we have the following pairings franklin announced unfolding the paper pilot baum and observer van zandt pilot henderson and observer mattigan on and on he went till he said pilot moss and observer stone oh for christs sake moss burst out amid laughter you did that on purpose captain and dont try to tell me different well that tells me who you are the newly teamed observer said stepping forward im percy stone he let his duffel bag fall from his shoulder to the ground and stuck out his right hand jonathan moss moss said shaking it and studied captain franklins idea of a joke stone was a couple of years younger than he he guessed with a long ruddy face a brown kaiser bill mustache and a disarming grin underneath it he didnt look like a loser or a washout what did you do before the war started moss asked him i had a little photography studio in ohio stone answered you i was studying the law moss said he waved that aside as he would have any question both irrelevant and immaterial and stared at percy stone maybe captain franklins idea of a joke had given him something a good deal better than your average onewing wonder a photographer were you no wonder they turned you into an observer no wonder at all stone agreed i wanted to be a pilot they told me if i kept squawking about it theyd stick me in the infantry and i could see how i liked that you know what lieutenant moss i believed em good thing you did moss said i dont have any doubt the powers that be meant every bit of it he kicked stones duffel bag then picked it up himself come on lets get you settled in tomorrow if the weathers decent well get up there and you can take some pretty pictures of the enemy line how does that sound better than a poke in the eye with a carrot stone said and both young men grinned the observer waved toward the tents lead on macduff it was a misquotation but moss wasnt about to ruffle any feathers by saying so as if the arrival of the observers had changed the squadrons luck the weather which had been cold and foggy and drizzly turned something close to springlike the next morning of course by the calendar spring was only a week and a half away but up till now ontario had shown no signs of paying attention to the calendar as far as moss could see blizzards were liable to keep coming all the way through july the next morning percy stone exclaimed with pleasure when he saw the camera he was to use ah one of the new models he said theyre the next thing to foolproof in fact theyre the next thing to moron proof he exclaimed again when he discovered the wright in which he was to fly had a conical recess in which the camera would fit built into the fuselage floor in the observers cockpit someone was awake during the design work here moss shrugged as he climbed into the forward cockpit a ground crew man spun the prop the engine started to roar seemingly right in his lap he didnt like that the slipstream blew the noise to him now not away from him as it had in a curtiss pusher no help for it though this was the bus he had so this was the bus hed fly fly he did north and west every so often percy stone would shout some thing at him he caught perhaps one word in five one of these days somebody would have to figure out how to let pilot and observer talk back and forth and understand each other that could be as important as perfecting the interrupter gear endless hammering had finally let the americans break out of the niagara peninsula threatened from west and east at the same time the foe had evacuated the town of london which had held so long and cost so many american lives one fairly short push along the northern shore of lake ontario and toronto would fall that would bring the war in the north a long step closer to being won under his flying goggles moss made a sour face the limeys and canucks damn them hadnt been idle while the us soldiers pounded at their front door theyd built a whole new series of lines behind the ones theyd had to abandon smash one and you found the next just as tough moss was supposed to get percy over the town of berlin south and west of guelph so the observer could photograph canadian railheads and other targets for the us artillery berlin was the name the town bore on his map anyhow the canadians were calling it empire these days the region had been settled by germans a lot of whom after the war broke out had been resettled to baffin island and other such tropic climes lest they prove gladder to see germany s american allies than the forces of the british empire both the usa and germany had trumpeted the canadians inhumanity to the skies the canadians and the british defended themselves on the grounds of the exigencies of war moss suspected the argument sold newspapers down in south america past that he didnt see much point to it because the weather was so clear and fine the canadian landscapewhat had been farming country now chewed to pieces by the war torn and gouged and tied down with barbed wirelay neatly spread out below the wright and because it was so clear and fine the biplane and its flightmates were all too easily visible to the enemy troops down below black puffs of smoke started appearing in the sky all around moss and stone moss started stunting the aeroplane changing course and speed at random intervals to confuse the antiaircraft gunners and throw off their aim the gunnerythe hate everybody on the receiving end called itwas more a nuisance than anything else but you didnt want to think youd stay lucky all the time a shell burst a scant handful of yards below the wilbur which bounced in the air percy stone picked that moment to shout now over and over till moss waved to show he understood for the photographic run the aeroplane had to fly level and straight back there the observer would be yanking the loading handle to bring the first photographic plate into position then pulling a string every few seconds every time he did the camera would expose the plate then behind the lens sliding the loading handle forward and back again brought the exposed plate down into an empty changing box below and to the side of the camera body and slid a fresh one into place ready for the next pull of the string the camera held eighteen plates altogether stone yelled something else moss couldnt make out the words but he thought it was about time to go around and return to the aerodrome on a track parallel to the course theyd flown so far when he did that the observer stopped screaming so he supposed hed been right done stone shouted at last and moss gave the wright all the juice it had to get out of the antiaircraft fire and head for home the aeroplane rolled to a stop on the landing strip moss killed the engine for a moment silence seemed louder than the roar had he needed a distinct effort of will not to shout as he said that wasnt so bad after a reflective pause he added any run where they dont send their aeroplanes up after you is a pretty good one as a matter of fact oh i dont know percy stone said i was sort of looking forward to the chance of shooting the tail right off my own bus his grin was so disarming it almost let moss forget that that was one of the things that could happen when an observer got overeager moss climbed out of the cockpit and jumped down to solid ground stone followed more slowly and more carefully he had to remove the camera and the precious exposed plates from their mounting moss liked the precise way he did things this may work out pretty well he said percy stones grin got wider and more wicked oh darling he breathed i didnt know you cared laughing the two men headed off toward the photographic laboratory together sylvia enos stared at the new form the coal board clerk handed her fill this out and bring it to window c over there when youve finished it the clerk droned almost as mechanically as a gramophone record sylvia wondered how many times a day he said the exact same thing she wished brigid coneval werent down with the grippe but mrs coneval was which meant sylvia had had to bring george jr and mary jane with her to the coal board office of a saturday afternoon she was just glad the office stayed open on saturday afternoons if it hadnt she would have had to try to get time off from work to fill out this new and hideous form she sat down in one of the hard chairs that filled the open area in front of the coal board office windows george jr sat down next to her she plopped mary jane into the chair on the other side be good both of you while i answer these questions she said every time she had to fill anything out it was a race against the clock the children would get into mischief it was only a question of when to delay the inevitable she gave her son a lollipop and her daughter a bottle then took out a fountain pen and bent over the sheet full of tiny type to find out what sort of information they wanted from her now coal ration allotment reassessment evaluation survey report the form said at the top sylvia sighed it seemed to be a law or perhaps a coal board policythat every form had to be more complicated than the one it replaced this one certainly lived up to the requirement she had no trouble filling out her own name or the address of the flat in which she and the children lived then the form asked for the names of all individuals residing at that address that was all fine but next it asked for the present status of each individual and gave checkoff boxes for military civilian gainfully employed civilian unemployed other than student student and child below age ii none of those boxes fit her husband and there was no other line on which to explain painful experience had taught her nothing caused more trouble than filling out a coal board form the wrong way she glanced at her children they both seemed occupied wait here she told them i have to go ask that man a question when she got to the front of the line again the clerk whod given her the form looked as delighted to see her as she was to see the landlord on the first of every month what seems to be your trouble he asked in a voice that said he knew she was bothering him on purpose she pointed to the checkoff boxes what do i do about my husband here she asked hes a confederate prisoner at prisoners of war go under the military heading the clerk said more exasperated than ever but hes not a prisoner of war hes a detainee sylvia said a commerce raider captured him when he was out on georges bank then hes a civilian gainfully the coal board clerk stopped you couldnt say george enos was gainfully employed not when he was at a camp or wherever the rebs kept their detainees down in north carolina but he wasnt unemployed either the clerk looked as if he hated sylvia he probably did for breaking up the smooth monotony of his day he turned and called mr colfax can you please come here for a moment being his superior mr colfax rated politeness sylvia barely rated the time of day she turned to look back at her children george jr was teasing mary jane with the lollipop she could have told him that was a mistake mary jane grabbed the lollipop and stuffed it into her own mouth george jr started to scream excuse me sylvia said hastily she took the lollipop away from mary jane returned it to its rightful owner swatted every available backside and warned of measures yet more dire if the two of them didnt behave themselves that done she went back to the clerk the next woman in line had come up to the window in the meanwhile giving him an excuse to pretend she didnt exist he seized on the excuse with alacrity but then mr colfax who wore not only pincenez but a red vest to show he was someone above the common run of clerk came out of whatever office hed been given to prove he was above the common run of clerk the window clerk proved willing to ignore the other woman at the window instead of sylvia as long as he was ignoring someone he was happy upon hearing of the ambiguity mr colfax chewed on his lower lip which was red and meaty and made for such mastications at last he said properly speaking this man should not be included in the calculations for no coal need be expended on cooking and heating water for him its not his fault hes not here sylvia protested hes a prisoner no he is a detainee as you yourself specified the window clerk said relishing his moment of petty triumph fill out the form accordingly and take it to window c thank you mr coifax mr colfax nodded and disappeared sylvia wished he were gone for good when she looked to her children again mary jane was toddling over to take a good look at the brass cuspidor in one corner of the room its polished gleaming surface was stained here and thereas was the floor around itby the tobaccobrown spittle of men whose intentions were better than their aim sylvia let out a small shriek and skirts flapping around her managed to intercept mary jane just before her daughter got feet and hands in the disgusting stuff gripping mary jane in one hand and the precious if annoying form in the other she returned to the seat where george jr waited placidly why didnt you keep your sister from wandering off and getting into mischief she said you have to be my big boy till papa gets home you know im sorry mama he said his face serious his eyes big looking so much like his father sylvia thought her heart would break i didnt see her go i really didnt i was looking at this bug i caught he opened his hand he was holding a cockroach it jumped down and started to scurry across the floor toward any shelter it could find sylvia lashed out with a foot the cockroach crunched under the sole of her shoe george jr started to cry but then discovered the remains of the cockroach were about as interesting as it had been alive look at its guts sticking out he exclaimed loudly and enthusiastically heads turned all through the coal board office sylvia felt herself flushing and wished she could sink through the floor dont play with them any more do you hear me she told george jr theyre dirty and nasty at last she got the chance to finish filling out the form it asked for things she didnt know like the quality of the insulation in her flat and for things she had a devil of a time figuring out like the number of cubic feet the flat contained her education had stopped in the middle of the seventh grade when it became obvious she needed a job more than schooling she hadnt had to figure out the volume of anything since then and hadnt expected to need to do it now at last the dreadful task was done by the time it was mary jane was get ting cranky sylvia carried her over to the line in front of window c you stay here she told george jr and no more bugs not if you want to be able to sit down when we ride the trolley home if we ever get a chance to go home she thought wearily but shed got through to her son who sat on both hands as if to protect the area shed threatened the line moved about as slowly as us troops advancing on big lick virginiabig licking the papers had taken to calling it some of the people must have made mistakes on their forms because faces set and angry they had to go back to the previous window and get new copies to fill out they had to stand in line again there too when she finally reached him the clerk who reigned supreme over window c proved to be a freshfaced young fellow who for a miracle seemed friendly and anxious to help he smiled at mary jane who stared back at him over the thumb she had in her mouth then he glanced down at the coal ration form i dont see your husband listed here maam he said to sylvia youre a widow he actually sounded sympathetic which from sylvias previous experience with coal board clerks should have been more than enough to get him fired no she said and explained what had happened to george that doesnt matter the clerk said if hes a captive of the confederate states youre entitled to the coal for him back there sylvia pointed to the window from which shed come mister uh colfax said i wasnt because george is a detainee not a prisoner of war doesnt matter the clerk repeated his voice firm mr colfax doesnt know everything there is to know sylvia shot a venomous look back at that window but when she started to cross lines out and make changes on the form the clerk said im sorry maam but these forms must be perfect the first time to eliminate any suspicion that the changes originated in this office im afraid you do have to go back and get a fresh copy to fill out she stared at him at mary jane at george jr would he catch a mouse instead of forbidden bugs and at the line to the window from which shed thought shed escaped she needed the coal coal board rations were stingy even with what shed get for george shed have none too much but standing in line againin two lines againand then having to fill out the requisition form once more even if this time she could copy from what shed done before another half hour another hour was it worth the time when could she shop come on lady a gruff voice said behind her i aint got all day sylvia didnt have all day either but she did need the coal sighing ignoring george jrs stricken look she walked across the room and got back into the line in which shed stood before xi s ometimes you dished it out sometimes you had to take it jake featherston knew that was true even if he didnt like it for beans he was taking it now and his whole battery with him fire he yelled and the field gun blasted a shell back at the damnyankees on the far side of the susquehanna the whole battery was pounding the us positions as far back as it could reach trouble was the battery couldnt reach far enough the confederacys threeinch field guns had been the most wonderful thing in the world when the war was new and positions changed not just from day to day but from hour to hour they moved with the advancing columns of men in butternut and slaughtered the us soldiers who opposed them slaughtered by tens by hundreds by thousands because they did that job so well the csa had a lot of them what the con federates didnt have and what they were needing more and more now that the front wasnt going anywhere fast was a lot of big guns guns that could reach well behind the enemy line and do some damage when they did reach nobody had thought the confederacy would need so many guns like that only goes to show featherston muttered people aint as smart as they wish they was the usa had the big guns or more of them than the csa did now that the front had stabilized along the susquehanna the united states had brought up their heavy artillery and their gunners were using the big longrange shells to raise hell deep among the confederates secondary positions if the yankees decided to try to force the susquehanna line they could beat down the opposition with their artillery till the confederate forces would have a tough time fighting back wish we could do more to those damned six and eightinch guns jethro bixler said as he set another shell in the breech of the field piece yeah featherston adjusted the elevation screw for maximum range then pulled the lanyard the field gun bucked and roared but the muzzle brake kept the recoil short if they hadnt worn the rifling out of the barrel of the gun it wasnt because they hadnt tried as bixler slammed yet another shell into the breech jake went on what i wish is we werent so damned far forward we got to be i know but if they do start dropping stuff on us theyll be awful damn accurate on account of it wont be way out at the end of their range like we are when we try to reach where theyre at another shell screamed off featherston wondered if hed have any hearing left by the time the war was done no sooner had the thought crossed his mind than he realized it contained two possibly false assumptions that his hearing was the most important thing he risked and that the war would ever end pompey came up to featherston and waited to be noticed when the sergeant gave him a curt nod he said capn stuarts compliments suh and we gonna shift our fire to a new yankee position range yards bearing range bearing featherston repeated he had to work to keep from imitating pompeys mincing accent captain stuarts servant nodded and went off to give the word to the next howitzer in the battery featherston sighed he didnt know whether major potter had investigated pompey or not if the major had nothing had come of it pompey remained jeb stuart ills trusted servant too trusted as far as jake was concerned he knew captain stuart had given the command all the same getting it from pompey was too close to taking orders from a negro to suit him he glanced over at nero and perseus who were combing down the horses they were all right they knew white men gave the orders and they took them pompey just because he worked for somebody important thought his own station improved too thinks his shit dont stink is what he does jake thought and then he stopped worrying about things as trivial as the right status of the negro in the confederate states of america at any other time that would have been important not now not when yankee shells came whistling in straight toward where he was standing big ones he thought with a chill as the freighttrain noises in the sky grew to a roar a scream the damnyankees threeinchers fired more slowly than the confederacys guns but their shells gave the same scant warning coming in a little whizz before the bang that was all you got not these through the growing shriek of torn air jethro bixler screamed something if it wasnt get down it should have been a split second before the shells went off featherston threw himself flat back home outside of richmond hed gone to church a lot of times to hear a preacher work himself up into a good sweat over hellfire and damnation and brimstone you listened to a preacher who was good enough who threw off his jacket and waved his whiteshirtsleeved arms at the congregation you could get the feeling hell wasnt more than half a mile off thats what hed thought then since the war started hed begun to get the notion he had a more intimate personal acquaintance with hellfire than any preacher ever spawnedunless the preacher served a gun too but now with the war that had started in summer and should have ended before winter still going strong at the start of spring and heading into its second summer of what looked like a great many yet to come he discovered he didnt know so much after all the battery had been under fire before plenty of times that was why he wasnt working with all the same guncrew men whod started out with him bombarding washington dc you shot at the damnyankees they shot at you that was fair they werent just shooting at the battery this time though they wanted to wipe it off the face of the earth he frantically hugged the dirt as the big shells burst all around him black puffs of smoke with red flame at their hearts sprang into being everywhere shrapnel balls and fragments of shell casing hissed through the air the ground jerked and bucked featherston had never felt an earthquake and after this bombardment was convinced he didnt need to if you were in a house when an earthquake hit the worst that would happen was things falling on you things werent just falling here they were accelerated viciously accelerated by high explosive worst was knowing that whether he lived or died was altogether out of his hands if a shell came down so near the blast ripped his lungs to bits from the inside out if an explosion blew him to smithereens if a tiny steel splinter awled through his skull and into his brain then that was what happened he had no say and whether he was a good soldier or a bad didnt matter luck that was it shells kept raining down on the battery he heard someone screaming and realized it was himself he felt not the least bit ashamed you had to let some of the terror loose or it would eat you from the inside out besides in the many times worse than thunderstorm all around who could hear him he wondered what else the yankees were bombarding frontline trenches ammunition dumps it mattered in theory but not in practice not right now he couldnt do anything about it any which way all he could do was lie flat and scrabble at the ground with the knife he wore on his belt trying to dig a shallow hole in which he could shelter from the storm of steel the storm of hate the infantry called itraging all around blast from a near miss picked him up and slammed him back down to the ground the way you might throw a kitten you didnt want against a brick wall to get rid of it oof he said and then as he got more air back into his lungs several less printable remarks how long the bombardment went on he never knew exactly when at last it lifted it went down into the trenches even nearer the river than the battery was dazedly jake featherston sat up his hands shook he tried to make them steady and discovered he couldnt his gun for a miracle was still upright nobody else from the crew was sitting up though a couple of people were down and moaning a couple of others down and not moving the rest of the batterys howitzers had been tossed every which way as if they were jackstraws he looked toward the smoke and dirt rising from the frontline trenches through that haze he saw yankees coming out of their own trenches and rushing toward the susquehanna they were going to try to force a crossing right now he ran to the howitzer his head swivelled wildly he had a target artillerymen dreamed ofbut if he had to handle the threeincher by himself he couldnt possibly fire often enough to do the csa any good he spied motion somehow nero and perseus had come through the bombardment with as little damage as he had you niggers he shouted get your black asses up here on the double the labourers obeyed if they hadnt he would have drawn his pistol and shot them both as things were he barked youve seen the crew serve this gun often enough reckon you know how to do it your own selves the two negroes looked at each other mebbe we do marse jake perseus said at last but no time for buts featherston pointed toward the susquehanna every damnyankee in the world is headin straight this way they get this far theyre gonna kill you the same as me only way to keep em from gettin this far i can think of is to blow em up first nowyou gonna serve the gun he didnt know whether his logic or his hand on the butt of his pistol was the more convincing but the negroes after glancing at each other again both nodded i kin load i reckon nero said an perseus he kin tote the shells you got to do the rest marse jake we dont know nothin bout how to aim ill handle that featherston promised he looked around for jethro bixler then wished he hadnt the loader was spread out over the ground like an anatomy lesson he hoped nero wasnt lying to him the way blacks did sometimes when they wanted to impress a white man nero wasnt he waited while jake frantically worked the elevation screw to lower the muzzle of the gun and shorten range then opened the breech slammed in a shell and dogged it shut almost as fast as poor dead jethro could have done with a whoop featherston yanked the firing lanyard the howitzer bellowed a couple of seconds later the shell burst among the swarming yankees they were close enough for jake to watch the ones near the burst going down like ninepins he whooped again and traversed the piece a little to the left nero worked the breech out came the old shell casing in went the new round jake jerked the lanyard more us soldiers fell methodically he kept pumping shells into them despite the yankee bombardment not all the confederate machine gunners were blasted out of their positions they too began scything the us attackers with bullets some of the yankees did manage to ford the river and get into the confederate trenches the only ones who went any farther than that came to the rear as prisoners seeing the glum bloodied men in greengray nero howled like a wolf we done it he shouted jesus god almighty we done it they hadnt done it all by themselvessome guns from other batteries had spread death through the yankee ranks toobut they had done it the eastern bank of the susquehanna was littered with corpses tossed at every possible angle and at too many impossible ones a few last us soldiers were scuttling back to their own trenches like dogs fleeing with tails between their legs we really did do it featherston knew he sounded stunned and shaky he didnt feel bad about it he was stunned and shaky he slapped nero on the back and then perseus you boys can serve my gun any time you please and thats a fact for a while there i figured wed be fightin off the damnyankees with pistols aint got no pistol marse jake nero pointed out he looked in the direction of a dead artilleryman them yankees break through an come this way though reckon i woulda had me one yeah jake said abstractedly except when negroes were doing things like hunting for the pot they werent supposed to have firearms you let black men get their hands on guns and you were sitting on a keg of powder with the fuse lighted and heading your way and nero and perseus hadnt just got their hands on a pistol or even a tredegar theyd served an artillery piece and theyd done a hell of a job at it too you couldnt make them forget how to do it or that theyd done it if there ever was a black rebellion they could do it again provided they got themselves a field piece but if featherston hadnt put them on the gun he almost certainly wouldnt have been alive to worry about things like that if major potter ever found out hed turned them into impromptu artillerymen he was liable to order them dragged off somewhere and shot part of jake said that was a good idea hell part of him wanted to yank out his pistol and use it now so nobody would know what hed done he couldnt theyd saved his neck along with their own he would never have yelled for their help if he could have yelled for white men instead but there hadnt been any white men to yell for hed done what hed had to do and hed got away with it now he said what he said to say its over boys you got to go back to bein niggers again you know what im tellin you he wondered if they could obey even if they wanted to theyd just been soldiers after all one of the reasons you didnt let a negro get a gun in his hands was that if he did some fighting with it hed start feeling like a man not like a servant a negro who felt like a man was liable to be a dangerous negro but nero and perseus understood what jake meant perseus said yes suh marse jake we be your niggers again till the next time yall need us to be somethin different he sounded almost as if he was inviting featherston to share a joke all right jake answered not knowing what else he could say eventually the battery would get replacements young white men eageror at least willingto serve the guns and eventually theyd get slaughtered too so would jake like as not he carried on about his business with a grim fatalism the yanks could throw more metal at him than he could easily throw back and who would serve the guns in or or or however long the war lasted negroes he shook his head it couldnt happen not really he glanced over at perseus and nero could it breakthrough george armstrong custer pounded the desk thats what i want nothing less in an oldfashioned dark blue uniform the fringe on his epaulets would have shaken back and forth modern us uniforms didnt have epaulets he had to make do with shaking jowls instead i want to run riot through the rebels and by god thats what im going to do sir major abner dowling took a deep breath every time custer started bellowing about breakthroughs men died by thousands for gains best measured in yards sir with the machine gun and barbed wire and artillery breakthroughs dont come easy these days that was not only true it was the understatement of the year but custer shook his head he didnt want to see it so he wouldnt if you imagined a dumpy halfsenile ostrich with its head in the sand that was custer at least in dowlings uncharitable imagination but though he wore no epaulets he did have stars on his shoulders the rebs have worn themselves out he declared holding us off has been hard enough on them and then they tried an offensive of their own what can they possibly have left dowling didnt answer not right away the confederate counterthrust from the south had been easier to stop than hed expected maybe that meant the rebs couldnt force a breakthrough either maybe it just meant their generals were as bad as custer the great mans adjutant wasnt sure which of those was the more depressing conclusion direct argument having failed again and again he tried analogy sir when coronado came into the usa from mexico he was looking for the seven cities of cibola all of them stuffed with gold what did he find nothing but a bunch of damn redskins living in mud huts what the hell are you talking about major custer demanded so much for analogy i just meant sir that we keep looking for breakthroughs and keep thinking the rebs are back to their last ditch but it never seems to be true maybe we ought to try some different way of going at em dowling said shall we settle the war with a game of football the way some idiots tried doing christmas day custer suggested with sardonic glee uh no sir dowling said hastily from what hed heard first army and the confederate army of kentucky hadnt been the only forces that made impromptu christmas truces with one another from what hed heard the war had damn near fallen apart on christmas day from the gulf of california all the way to the susquehanna but it hadnt it ground on and would for who could guess how long in a way the generality of the truce was too bad if it had happened here and nowhere else tr would have had all the justification he needed for sacking custer and replacing him with someone who had some notion of how the world had changed since but no no such luck what do you propose then major custer sarcastically courteous was worse than custer almost any other way his ruling assumption seemed to be that since he had no brains no one else could possibly have any either the trouble was dowling had no good answer for him here that embarrassed the adjutant but not as much as it might have nobody on the us general staffor the confederate general staff either come to thathad any good answer on how to force a breakthrough west of the mississippi the war was still mobile but that was because there were a lot fewer men and a lot more miles west of the mississippi wherever there were enough soldiers to man a solid trench line offence literally stopped dead but if dowling didnt know what the answer was he had a pretty clear notion of what it wasnt sending men out by the division to charge into machinegun fire wastes lives sir he said wed be better off pounding the rebs with artillery using soldiers to create positions from which we could pound them from three sides at once things like that we have the advantage in manpower major custer said what good is it if we dont use it if we keep using it your way we wont have it much longer dowling thought saying that aloud was probably fatal to a career he braced himself to speak up anyway maybe theyd give him an actual combat battalion as punishment for his crime before he could make himself say anything though someone knocked on the door to custers office the commanding general snarled something profane then barked at dowling see who the devil that is yes sir dowling said resignedly you interrupted custers meetings at your own risk dowling opened the door standing there was a scaredlooking lieutenant from cryptography holding an enciphered telegram and a sheet of typewritten paper that was presumably the same message decoded the lieutenant handed dowling the paperactually thrust it into his handand then retreated at a clip not far short of flight as soon as dowling had read the first two lines of the decryption he understood why but he was the one whod have to break the news to custer compared to that the prospect of leading a combat battalion straight at the rebel trenches looked downright delightful well the general commanding first army snapped dont just stand there like an upright piano tell me what in tarnation this is all about dowling stiffened to rigid attention doing his best to keep vengeful glee from his voice he said yes sir sir you are ordered to detach two divisions from your front for immediate transfer to another theatre that had about the same effect on custer as hitting him between the eyes with a twobyfour would have done he went white and then a red that rapidly deepened to a dusky purple whos stealing my men he whispered hoarsely if its pershing ill kill the son of a bitch with my own hands if its the last thing i ever do that upstart whippersnapper wants to steal all the glory for the kentucky campaign and damn me to hell if i aim to let him ill defy the order thats what ill do and ill fight it out in the paper if tr sacks me for it first roosevelt keeps me from the northern command he knows i wantand he knows why i want it tooand now just when im beginning to make decent progress here he robs me of my forces they arent being transferred to general pershing sir now dowling concealed regret pershing had made far more progress against the rebels than custer had hed also had the sense to save lives by pinching off louisville from the flanks instead of going straight into the city as the us army had tried to do during the second mexican war the order comes directly from general wood at general staff headquarters in philadelphia custer expressed an opinion of the relationship between wood and roosevelt that reflected poorly on the heterosexuality of either man like any underling with an ounce of sense dowling knew when to feign deafness why the devil is wood stealing my men then custer said rather more pungently than that sir a major mormon uprising has broken out in utah dowling said waving the decipherment of the telegram to show the source of his news theyre right on one of our crosscountry rail lines we have to bring them back under the flag as fast as we can god damn them to hell and may the us army send them there custer exclaimed we should have done it before the war of secession and we really should have done it during the second mexican war when they tried to sneak out of our beloved union if anyone had listened to me then he shook his head but no we had to clasp the viper to our bosom i was there by god i wanted them to hang all the mormons leaders not just a handful of them i wanted them to hang abe lincoln too while they had the chance but would anybody hear a word i said no are we better off because no one would no again sir i wouldnt call what we did in utah during the second mexican war clasping the mormons to our bosom or afterwards either dowling said custer had a selective memory for facts john pope and later military governors in utah had jumped on the mormons with both feet then to make sure they didnt try giving the usa any more hard times he supposed he could see why theyd outlawed polygamy but suppressing public worship along with all other public meetings had always struck him as far too heavyhanded even after utah joined the union public worship by groups larger than ten remained illegal since the second mexican war the supreme court hadnt been much inclined to interfere with claims of military necessity and so the mormon temple in salt lake city remained empty to this day no wonder the mormons didnt love the us government custer coughed rheumily still glowering at his adjutant he asked are the damned mormons in bed with the rebs or the canucks or both at once thatsnot immediately clear from the reports i have here sir dowling answered studying his boss with an emotion he wasnt used to feeling respect the sole piece of the military art with which custer was familiar was the headlong smash but his redveined nose had a genuine gift for intrigue there are some foreign agitators in the state but no details as to who they are could be either one custer judged the mormons dont like niggers much better than the rebels do but the canadians could be seducing them with lies about freedom of religion he laughed unpleasantly if they were up in canada theyd have gotten the same short shrift the germans who settled that town called berlin did and you can bet your bottom dollar on it thats probably true sir dowling said and for once simple agreement was just that nothing more he went on shall i draft orders implementing this command for your signature sir yes go ahead custer said with a melodramatic sigh they must have timed their damned uprising with a view to spoiling my offensive and robbing me of the breakthrough i surely would have earned theyll pay the scum dowling sighed as he bent over the situation map to figure out how hed pull thirty thousand men or so out of the line that let him turn away from custer which in turn let him snigger wickedly if the confederates and canadians didnt have worse threats than first army to worry about the war was going better than hed figured a sharp explosion close by made reggie bartlett jump and look around for the nearest hole in the ground in which to dive people in civilian clothes on the streets of richmond gave him odd looks why on earth would a soldier be frightened of a backfiring motorcar the duryea plainly having engine trouble backfired a couple of more times before finally beginning to run a little better another soldier coming his way though nodded in complete understanding just back from the front are you he said bartlett nodded sure am his laugh was selfdeprecating you can take the soldier out of the trenches but its not so easy taking the trenches out of the soldier this is my hometown and i feel like im a stranger here know what you mean pal the other soldier said you get away for a while and it doesnt seem like the real worlds real if you know what i mean he stuck out a hand names alexander gribbinalec they call me he had swarthy handsome features and a neat little chin beard that made him look like a frenchman giving his own name reggie shook hands with him he said alec shall we find someplace where the only pops were likely to hear come from corks going out of bottles friend i like the way you think gribbin said enthusiastically if this is your town you ought to know about places like that eh you just want a drink we can do that anywhere bartlett said ive seen that gribbin agreed thank your lucky stars reggie my friend the drys havent gotten their way here in virginia down in mississippi where i come from its a desert nothin else but thats hard thats cruel hard bartlett said and his newfound companion nodded his mournful expression showing just how hard it was bartlett went on what we could do though if you want the chance of something livelier is to go to the saloon over at fords hotel right across the street from capitol square its only a couple blocks from here never know whos liable to show up therecongressmen foreigners admirals who can say but they dont turn common soldiers away theyd better not gribbin said indignantly im a white man by jesus and im as good as any other white man god ever made not only that reggie bartlett said but ive got money in my pocket some anyhow and it spends as good as any other money the mint ever made alec gribbin grinned widely im the same way and so is my money lets go fords hotel on the corner of broad and eleventh streets was a fourstory building of white marble with a fancy colonnaded entrance the negro doorman who wore a uniform with more gold buttons and ribbons and medals than a french field marshal could have displayed tipped his hat in salute as the two confederate soldiers in their plain butternut walked past him hell of a place gribbin said with a low whistle gazing around at the rococo splendour of the lobby he winked and lowered his voice wouldnt it make the bulliest damn sporting house in the whole wide world matter of fact it would bartlett said but i wouldnt have the money to go into a sporting house tricked out this fancy he walked down the hall his boots sank into the thick pile of the turkish carpets underfoot that wasnt so bad the rugs didnt try to pull the boots off his feet the way the trench mud had in the roanoke river valley the saloon was a saloon long bar brass rail mirror behind it so the bottles of whiskey and gin and rum looked to be twice as many as they really were freelunch counter with a painting of a nude above it but the place catered to a prosperous crowd not only was the free lunch more appetizing than the usual run of sardines and sausage and limp cheese but the nude a voluptuous redhead was a lot more appetizing than the common saloon daub makes me wish i was an artist gribbin said eyeing her with genuine respect get to see girls like that and in the altogetheri tell you for a fact reggie it just beats the stuffing out of freezing your feet in a trench in pennsylvania that countrys so cold in the wintertime the yanks are welcome to it far as i can see they strode off to the bar squeezing in alongside of a couple of portly middleaged men in expensive suits beer bartlett said gribbin ordered a whiskey reggie put a quarter on the bar it disappeared no change came back not your fivecentsashot place gribbin observed then he knocked back the whiskey his eyes got big i see why too thats the straight goods there those cheap joints they put in red peppers and stuff make you think youre getting bettern raw rotgut you know real whiskeys good he watched bartlett drink half his schooner of beer then said come on finish that so as i can buy you another one we can hit the free lunch too we drink enough they wont care how much we dent the profits with what we eat bartlett drained the schooner ahh he said his new friend slapped down a quarter the barkeep a negro in a boiled shirt fixed refills the two portly fellows were talking about pension plans for soldiers after the war was over congressmen or else lobbyists important people yes but bartlett wasnt much interested in pension law he wished he had more money now sure but he wasnt going to worry about fifty years down the line especially not when his life expectancy once he got back to the front was more likely to be measured in weeks than in years gribbin returned with salami and radishes on rye bread a couple of devilled eggs fried oysters pickles and pretzels reggie went and got some food for himself the spread the ford hotel set out was another reason to come here and the congressmen or lobbyists or whatever they were didnt have too much pride to keep them from raiding it either a toughlooking fellow in a foreign naval uniform came up and stood at the bar next to bartlett he ordered scotch which with his accent gave a pretty clear notion of his nationality nodding affably to bartlett he said confusion to the yankees what and lifted his glass ill drink to that reggie proceeded to prove it the englishman made his drink disappear so fast he might have done it by magic or inhalation he got another then raised his glass again and proceeded to elaborate on his earlier toast to the empire and the confederacy and to keeping the united states in their place and out of ours bartlett added which made alec gribbin laugh and the naval officer smile wide enough to show a pair of front teeth a rabbit would have been proud to claim he drank his second shot of scotch as fast as he had the first emboldened by his friendly manner reggie asked hows it going out on the ocean before replying the royal navy man ordered a third scotch then he said damned if i know how it will all turn out damned if anyone knows how it will all turn out honours about even thus far in the atlantic argentina s coming in on our side id say outweighs chile s joining the americans and germans though none of the south american navies is important enough to swing the balance in any decisive way then seeming to contradict himself he went on i do wish the empire of brazil would come to a decision of one sort or the other they damn well better come in on our side when they come reggie said angrily to which alec gribbin gave an emphatic assent bartlett went on hell they held on to their slaves longer than we did he had thought that a convincing argument he kept on thinking it a convincing argument the royal navy man called for yet another drink and gulped it with the same alacrity hed shown with the ones before allies he muttered but it didnt sound like a toast mostly to himself he went on the south and the czars god have mercy on a free country and what the devil is that supposed to mean alexander gribbin demanded he sounded a lot hotter with whiskey in him than he had without you saying we arent free is that what youre saying go up to the usa and see how you like it there the confederacy is the freest country in the world and thats a fact is it the englishman had taken on whiskey too he pointed to the bartender would you agree with that statement sir the statement that this great nation is the freest country in the world i mean the bartender looked from the english officer to the two confederate privates and back again he didnt say anything though his eyes were wide in his dark face oh hell what are you asking him for anyway bartlett said with a dismissive wave of his hand hes just a nigger he doesnt know anything something more than one man in three of your populace falls into that category the royal navy man said in spite of that you still call yourself the freest country in the world of course we do reggie said we are he and the englishman stared at each other in mutual incomprehension enjoy it then the fellow said at last he called for one last drink drained it and left after adding a tip for the bartender bartlett shook his head cant figure out whats chewin on him id say lice but hes never seen the inside of a trench not the likes of him dont worry about it soldier one of the prominent men in dark suits said theres a certain kind of englishman who thinks that if youre not english youre sort of halfway to being a nigger yourself is that a fact well to hell with him then gribbin said and started after the naval officer anybody who thinks im halfway to a nigger hes halfway to the hospital reggie grabbed him by the arm ease off alec he said urgently you beat on an ally you get yourself in more trouble than you can shake a stick at that in essence is correct the man in the suit said it doesnt matter whether we love the limeys and they love us what matters is that no matter what else we do we dont do anything to make them like us less than they like the usa should that misfortune ever strike us boys you can buy a coffin on account of we are dead and buried i dont want to buy me a coffin reggie said all i want is another schooner he raised his voice to call to the negro tending bar boy another beer yes sir the bartender said and brought him one after he paid for it he turned to gribbin and said you know whats nice about niggers you dont have to waste time bein polite with em ill drink to that alec said and did the bartender picked up a rag and polished the gleaming surface of the bar over and over again he did not look up at the two soldiers sam carsten slept in the middle bunk on the dakota which made him feel like the meat in a sandwich you had a guy on top of you and a guy underneath to say nothing of a whole bunk room full of guys all around your skinny mattress creaked and groaned on the iron frame as did those of your two bunkmates everybody snored everybody farted nobody washed his feet often enough and half the time or more you didnt even notice not from lightsout to the klaxon that yanked you from your bunk as if it physically grabbed you and threw you down on the deck if you werent dead beat when you lay down youd figured out how to screw around so well it looked as if you were working to some chief petty officers whod long since seen every kind of screwing around known to man this particular morning sam really resented the klaxon in his dream maggie stevenson had just started doing something highly immoral and even more highly enjoyable if shed kept on for another few seconds his feet hit the iron deck before his eyes came open all the way when they did they saw not voluptuous maggie but skinny hairy snaggletoothed vic crosetti who had the top bunk you aint no beautiful blonde carsten said accusingly yeah and if i was i wouldnt want nothin to do with the likes of you crosetti said scrambling into his trousers sam got dressed too and staggered down the hall to the galley for break fast after oatmeal bacon stewed prunes and several mugs of scalding snarling coffee he decided he was going to live he went up on deck for roll call and sick call the sky was brilliantly blue the sea even bluer the sun blazed down he could feel his fair skin starting to sizzle the same way the bacon had on the griddles down below no help for it he thought ruefully hed smeared every ointment under the tropic sun on his hide and that tropic sun had defeated them all he thought longingly of san francisco of mist of fog of damp hed been happy there that was the country he was made for romantic he muttered under his breath as he started chipping paint stopping rust before it got started the south pacific is supposed to be romantic what the hells so romantic about looking like an easter ham all the goddamn time chip chip chip chip chip chip the dakota plowed through light chop several hundred miles south and west of honolulu the only way to find out what the limeys and the japs were up to if they were up to anything was to go out on patrol and look around with the dakota steamed the nebraska and the vermont as well as a pair of cruiser squadrons and a whole flotilla of speedy destroyers the fleet could handle any probe the english and the japanese tried and could damage a fullscale assault against the sandwich islands meanwhile warning honolulu of impending danger we caught the limeys napping carsten said chipping away so industriously no one could give him a hard time about it they wont give us the same treatment as if to underscore his words a highpitched buzzing as if from a gnat made suddenly bigger than any eagle rose from the bow of the dakota sam stopped what he was doing and looked that way the buzz rose in volume then steadied it was followed by an enormous hiss that might have come from an outsized snake alarmed at the outsized gnat a rattling and clattering unlike any found in nature accompanied the hiss the compressedair catapult threw the aeroplane off the deck of the dakota inside a space of fifty feet it had accelerated the flying machine up past forty miles an hour plenty fast enough for the aeroplane to keep on flying and not fall into the pacific carsten stood for a moment watching the aeroplane gain altitude he shook his head in bemusement it was such a flimsy thing wood and canvas and wire a mere nothing when measured against the armour plate and great guns of a battleship but if it spotted the enemy where the bulge of the earth still hid them from the dakota it made a formidable tool of war in its own right up at the bow the catapult crew were taking their toy apart and stowing it so it wouldnt be in the way if the guns of the dakota had to go into action that didnt take long they had an interesting job up there and people seemed to fuss more about aeroplanes with every passing month people can fuss all they want sam said lets see an aeroplane sink a ship then ill sit up and take notice in the meantime guns are plenty good enough for me he worked away for a while then horns blared and voices started shouting through megaphones sam sprinted toward the forward starboard sponson one running sailor among hundreds battle stations officers and senior ratings shouted over and over again battle stations when he was working out in the open carsten hadnt too much minded the warm muggy air he would have enjoyed it had the sun not pounded down on him down below in the sponson the sun wasnt baking him in that hot cramped place though he felt as if he were being steamed like a pot of beans in the galley this the real thing he asked hiram kidde the gunners mate shrugged damned if i know he answered could be though that new wireless theyve put on board the aeroplanes it lets em pass on the news before they come back to us yeah carsten said wish we would have had a set like that last year when we were steaming for the sandwich islands would have come in mighty handy spying out the harbour and everything kidde nodded sure would but the new aeroplanes got bigger engines so they can carry moren the ones we brought with us last year and the new wireless sets are lighter than the ones they had then too things keep changing all the damn time carsten could not have said for sure whether that was praise or complaint hell one of these days capn maybe even battleshipsll be obsolete not any time soon kidde set an affectionate hand on the breech of the fiveinch gun whose master he was but then he looked thoughtful or maybe youre right who the devil can say for sure youre just a pup the way it looks to you the navy hasnt changed a whole hell of a lot since youve been in me though i joined in an armored cruiser nowadaysd run rings around what they called battleships back then and blow em to hell and gone without breaking a sweat you look back on things they aint the same as they used to be nobody ever heard of aeroplanes when i joined up thats for damn sure so who really does know what thingsll look like twenty thirty years from now i was thinking about aeroplanes when we launched ours carsten said probably thinking when you should have been working kidde said with a laughhed been in the navy a long time all right who me sam answered drolly innocent kidde laughed again carsten went on i was thinking how good they were for spotting but that they couldnt really do anything to a ship what youre saying though makes me wonder if their engines keep getting bigger maybe theyll be able to haul big bombs or even torpedoes one of these days yeah maybe kidde frowned i wouldnt like to be on the receiving end of something like that i tell you torpedoes from submersibles they pack more punch than a twelveinch shell even if they dont have the range but you can outrun a submersible you cant outrun an aeroplane you can shoot an aeroplane down though a lot easier than you can get at a submersible when its under the water said luke hoskins sticking an oar into the conversation before either hiram kidde or sam could answer the other shellheaver the allclear sounded carsten let out a sigh of relief nothing but a drill he said got to treat it like the real thing though kidde replied you never can tell when its gonna be despite the allclear the gun crew stayed at their station till the starboard gunnery officer poked his head into the sponson and dismissed them carsten went back to the upper deck at about a quarter of the speed at which hed run to his gun when youd just wondered whether you were about to go into battle fighting rust didnt seem so important any more a couple of hours after the allclear was given the aeroplane splashed down into the water not far from the dakota before long the battleships crane hauled it out of the pacific only a few feet away from where sam was working he waved to the pilot as the fellow came level with the upper deck of the ship the pilot waved back a big grin on his face always good to come home he called gets lonesome out there when all you can see is ocean i believe it as far as carsten was concerned you had to be crazy to go up there in one of those contraptions in the first place if your engine quit when you were a hundred miles from anywhere what did you do oh maybe you could send a wireless message for help and maybe theyd find you if you did but did you want to count on that not so far as sam could see you didnt the ocean was a hell of a big place five years sailing on it had taught him that an aeroplane bobbing in the chop wasnt even a flyspeck on its immensity not long after the aeroplane was hauled out of the ocean one of the cruisers with the fleet the avenger sent up a kite balloon as always the hydrogenfilled canvas bag put sam in mind of an outsized frankfurter that had escaped its roll and floated up into the sky from his distance he couldnt see the cable that moored the balloon to its mother ship he had a hard time making out the wicker basket that held the observer below the balloon and the wind cups that stabilized the gasbag as an ordinary kites tail did for it fleet orders were to have either an aeroplane or a kite balloon aloft as nearly continuously as possible balloons of course couldnt fly away from the us ships the way aeroplanes could but floating four thousand feet above the fleet could see a lot farther than lookouts on even the tallest observation masts the fellow up there had a telephone link to the avenger if he spotted any thing hed pass on the news and theyd haul him down as fast as they could a kite balloon would stay up fine at cruising speed you couldnt keep it up though if you needed to go flat out the way you did when you had a battle to fight carsten was glad to watch the sausage floating up there it felt like a life insurance policy to him if the royal navy or the japanese spotted the americans before the us fleet saw them that meant trouble big trouble you wanted to be in position to do what you intended to do and do it first what had happened at pearl harbor would have taught that to anyone foolish enough to doubt it sam waved to the balloonist as he had to the aeroplane pilot unlike the pilot the balloonist didnt see him that was all right the balloonist had more important things to look for than one friendly sailor and you know what carsten muttered to himself i hope to god he doesnt see any of them george enos peered out over the rail of the mercy at the broad atlantic all around the mercy flew not only the confederate flag but also that of the red cross it also had the red cross prominently displayed on white squares to port and starboard any submarine that got a good look at it would with luck sheer off with luck those were the key words with luck the swamp fox never would have spotted the ripple in the first place and enos ordeal in confederate prison camps wouldnt have started he hoped his luck was better now than it had been then there in the eastnot a star but a plume of smoke he turned to fred butcher and said thats the spanish shipi hope yeah i hope so too the ripples mate answered if its not a spanish ship then it belongs to somebody else in these waters somebody else might be the usa or germany or england or france or the confederate states maybe whoever it was would let the mercy go on its way anyhow ships from other nations performed similar duties and wanted to keep reciprocal good treatmentbut maybe it wouldnt too they were saying before we set out that ships from argentina dont go into the open waters of the north atlantic any more enos said they scurry across to dakar in africa where the oceans narrowest and then hug the coast the rest of the way up to england england would starve without that argentine grain and beef butcher said i wish they would starve but we cant get at those ships not way the hell out there we cant charlie white came over and stood with his crewmates george leaned across fred butcher and slapped him on the shoulder bet that smoke looks even better to you than it does to me he said the negro nodded i dont care if thats the neutral ship to take us home to the usa or a cruiser thats going to sink us he said either way its better off than being a colored fellow down in the csa he was a lot skinnier than he had been when they were captured somehow his rations had never come out quite rightand the confederates had worked him harder than any white detainee all that was supposed to be against the rules which didnt keep it from happening in a musing voice white went on isnt a whole lot of fun being a negro in the usa either but now i know the difference between bad and worse i tell you that for a fact i believe it enos said he peered across the ocean again now he could see a ship out there not just smoke it looked slow and boxy not like a steampowered shark thats a freighterand i think that means its the spanish ship closer and closer came the ship to the mercy not only did it fly a huge spanish flag it also had spain s redandgold flag painted on its flanks the same way the mercy bore the red cross it looked gaudy but that was better than looking like a juicy target an officer in the dark gray of the confederate navy shouted detainees line up by the boats for exchange along with the other crewmen from the ripple and several dozen more us sailors captured by confederate submersibles commerce raiders and warships george enos hurried to take his place by a lifeboat the officer who had a list on a clipboard went down the line of men checking off names he had to ask george who he was but needed to put no such question to charlie white who stood behind enos all right nigger he said drawing a thick black line through whites name were rid of you got rid of your greatgranddaddy a while ago and now were rid of you what do you think of that sir charlie white said even angry he was polite since you ask sir i think that when my grandfatherthats who it wasran away from georgia he knew what he was doing the confederate officer stared at him george enos bit his lip half of him wanted to cheer charlie the other half feared the negros outspokenness would queer the exchange for everyone the officer took a deep breath as if to shout an order but then reluctantly he shook his head if we werent getting our own back for you nigger youd pay plenty for that he said and wrote something next to the name through which hed just lined and youd better get down on your black knees and pray we dont ever catch you again you understand me oh yes sir white answered i understand that real well the officer gave him one last glare before continuing down the line good for you charlie george whispered when the rebel was out of earshot sometimes your mouth is smarter than your brains thats all the cook said at the officers command the detainees boarded the boatsall except for poor lucas phelps who was buried down in north carolina and would never see boston again god damn the rebels george thought even as the sailors of the mercy lowered them to the waters of the atlantic swinging down ropes creaking as they ran through the pulley enos felt as if he were on a ferris wheel one thing he said as he and his fellow sailors started rowing toward the spanish ship we all know how to handle a boat a couple of men laughed most just kept on rowing a couple of confederates sat stolid and silent at the stern they would row back to the mercy the spanish shipher name was padre junipero serra loomed up like a gaudily painted steel cliff her sailors had hung nets over the side up which the detainees could scramble a spanish officer in a uniform fancy enough to have come out of a comic opera took the names of the sailors as they clambered up on deck and checked them off on a list he held on a clipboard exactly like the one his confederate counterpart had used when everyone was accounted for the spaniard blew a whistle a line of thin men in shabby clothes came up out of the hold and walked to the junipero serras lifeboats they look just like us george thought and then shook his headwhy should that surprise him only the sailors drawlsan accent he heartily hoped never to hear againsaid they came from the csa not the usa their names got checked off as meticulously as those of enos and his comrades had aboard the mercy once the spanish officer satisfied himself that the count was full complete and accurate the confederate sailors boarded the boats and were lowered to the sea a couple of spaniards sat in each boat as a couple of confederates had sat in the boat enos had helped row here no doubt the rebels on the mercy scrutinized their returning detainees as closely as they had the men they were releasing some little while went by before they ran up signal flags all proper thank you black smoke poured from the mercys funnels picking up speed she made a long slow turn and started back toward her home port we are going to take you to nueva iorque the spanish officer said in english that would have been very good if enos hadnt needed a couple of seconds to realize he meant new york that hesitation made him miss a few words have a pilot to take us through the minefields around the city the minefields of the usa i mean to say if we meet a confederate mine it is as god wills he made the sign of the cross several us sailors among them patrick odonnell the captain of the ripple imitated the gesture i bet theres mines outside of boston harbour too to keep the rebs and the limeys from getting too close fred butcher said world hasnt stood still while we were stuck in that camp george hadnt thought much about that past getting back to sylvia and his children now he said bet some poor damned fishermen got blown to hell and gone too when they hit a mine that wasnt supposed to be where it was everybody who heard him nodded somberly that was the way things worked fishermen always ended up with the shitty end of the stick a spanish sailor working with a few words of english and a lot of dumb show took the exchanged detainees below decks to their cabins enos would have been small and cramped with two men in it and it held four he didnt much care except for sleeping he didnt plan on spending much time there if charlie white had turned out chow anything like what the junipero senas cooks served up the ripples crew would have lynched him and hung his body on t wharf as a warning to others enos didnt care about that either he didnt think hed starve to death before they got to new york the cigar a spaniard gave him turned out to be nasty too he smoked it anyway and went up on deck to look around the atlantic what a surpriselooked the same from the junipero serra as it had from the mercy in the west the sun was going down toward the ocean most ships on most oceans these days showed no lights at night people who noticed them were too likely to be enemies but the junipero serra lit herself up like a christmas tree she wanted everyone on both sides of the war to know exactly what she was the more obvious she made it the less likely shed become a target enos looked around again he changed his mind the atlantic did seem different after all im going home he said irving morrell stared at the list lieutenant craddock had just handed him you know bill he said mildly i dont have time for this that made a pretty fair understatement hed been promoted to major after winkling the rebs in southeastern kentucky out of their tough hilltop position and was now heading up the battalion where hed commanded a company till a couple of weeks before sir i compiled this list on orders direct from the war department craddock could have spoken no more reverently of the book of genesis i understand that morrell said trying for patience i handed on the orders myself if youll remember but dont you think getting ready for our next move against the rebs is more important than a witch hunt craddock looked stubborn sticking out his chin it was firm as granite and about as hard the same unfortunately held for the rest of his cranium sir since you asked my opinion i think rooting out disloyal elements has a very high priority if our next move against the enemy should fail it might be on account ofhe lowered his voice to a dramatic whispersubversion oh for christs sake morrell exploded all right you hunted through the pay records we have in this battalionhe glanced down at the list craddock had given himfour count them four mormons has any one of them ever given the slightest sign of disloyalty no sir craddock said but you never can tell not with these people you cant they looked loyal to the usa too till this deseret rebellion kicked up they might be laying low lying morrell corrected absently yes sir they might be lying too craddock agreed with earnest ignorance morrell heaved a silent sigh the lieutenant said but the orders require that they be identified and interrogated as you see sir ive identified them he was trained in military subordination that meant he didnt yell now youve got to interrogate them but he couldnt have shouted it any louder than he didnt say it and he did have the orders if not common sense on his side morrell sighed again this time loud and long all right bill bring the mormons to me and ill have a talk with them he didnt think a kentucky forest the ideal spot for this sort of procedure but this was where he happened to be yes sir now craddock sounded happier things were going as they were supposed to on paper which warmed the cockles of his heart ill go get them one at a time of course so they cant overpower the two of us escape through the woods and warn the rebs of our plans beyond arguing by then morrell said however you want to do it craddock hurried away intent on his mission if hed used that much ingenuity figuring out the trouble real enemies could cause he would have been a better soldier for it he soon returned with a young towheaded private who looked confused and worried morrell would have looked the same way if hed suddenly been hauled up before his commanding officer the soldier came to stiff attention dinwiddie brigham he said rattling off his pay number at ease dinwiddie morrell said youre not in trouble lieutenant craddocks face set in stern disapproving lines morrell ignored him dinwiddie was from the company hed commanded hed always thought of the youngster as too good to be true dinwiddie didnt drink he didnt smoke he didnt gamble he wasnt out to lay every woman he set eyes on and he obeyed every order promptly cheerfully and bravely what little morrell knew about mormonism made him think it was a pretty silly religion but it had to have something going for it if it turned out people like dinwiddie picking his words with care morrell asked what do you think of whats going on in utah these days son hed never seen dinwiddies brightblue eyes anything but open and candid he did now shutters might have slammed down on the privates face he spoke like a machine sir i dont know much about it lieutenant craddock stirred morrell glared him into continued silence and tried again have you heard from your family are they all right i got one letter not long ago dinwiddie answered it was censored pretty bad but theyre well yes sir glad to hear it morrell said on the whole sincerely with things the way they are how do you feel about being a soldier in the united states army that hooded look stayed on dinwiddies face sir it doesnt have anything to do with me right now does it provo s a long way from here so it is morrell cocked his head to one side and studied the young mormon rebel lines though theyre only a few hundred yards off he waved southwest as if on cue a rifle shot rang out silencing the spring peepers for a moment dinwiddie looked horrified if he was an actor he belonged on the stage sir what the rebs do to latterday saints in the csa you hear stories about what the russians do to jews its like that sir they dont want any of us and they dont make any bones about it mof fell wondered what things were going to be like for mormons in the usa after the army finished crushing the deseret revolt they hadnt been easy before theyd get harder now it had been more suppression than persecution what it was going to be well if brigham dinwiddie hadnt thought of that for himself no point doing the job for him all right dinwiddiedismissed morrell said go on back to your unit the mormon saluted and left lieutenant craddock said sir forgive me but i didnt think that was a very thorough interrogation neither did i morrell said the way i see it is if i rake these people over the coals when they havent done anything ill give them a reason to be disloyal even if they didnt have one before now go fetch me corporalhe checked the listcorporal thomas corporal orson gregory thomaswho made a point of asking to be called gregoryechoed brigham dinwiddies comments almost word for word lieutenant craddock found that suspicious morrell found it natural put two men of the same beliefs in the same awkward situation and you could expect to get the same kind of answers out of them homer benson another private again gave almost the same set of responses lieutenant craddocks granite jaw stuck out like the rock of gibraltar as he listened his face even more disapproving than it had been at the start of the interrogations he didnt say anything when morrell dismissed benson back to his unit but his stiff posture and even stiffer manner spoke volumes dick francis still another private was the last man on the list craddock had so laboriously compiled he looked enough like dinwiddie to have been his first cousin and shared his diffident manner but when morrell asked him what he thought about the mormon uprising in utah he said i hope they kick the army out of there sir thats our land all the united states ever did was give us grief morrell pointed to the greengray uniform francis had on what are you doing wearing that then sir i was rendering unto caesar the private answered when the prophet and the elders said that since we were part of the united states we should take part in this war i obeyed it was a teaching inspired by god but now that they see things differently i wont lie and say im sorry i think deseret should be free so we can worship as we please want a whole houseful of wives do you lieutenant craddock said a nasty leer on his face that will be enough lieutenant morrell said sharply but the damage was done you see what i mean sir francis said why should i love a government that looks at us like that the way we get treated were the niggers of the usa from what morrell had heard the mormons didnt treat negroes as if they were their brothers that though was neither here nor there morrell rubbed his chin what the devil am i supposed to do with you francis he asked he hadnt expected this problem assuming all the mormons in the battalion would stay loyal craddock looked vindicated dick francis shrugged why are you asking me sir youre the united states army officer while sounding perfectly respectful he somehow man aged to turn morrells title into one of reproach morrell thought hard about doing nothing whatever to him when the rebs started shooting his way hed have to shoot back if he wanted to go on living but morrell couldnt take the chance not with somebody whod openly admitted he was hoping for the ruination of the usa im going to send you back to divisional headquarters he said i dont want any man on the front line whose first loyalty isnt to his country and to the men on either side of him he didnt know what division hq did with people like francis the mormon soldier did hed had more incentive to learn such things detention camp for me then he said sounding not a bit put out ill pray for you sir for a gentile youre a good man not knowing what to do with such faint praise morrell turned to craddock take him back to division he said tell them he doesnt feel in good conscience he can go on being a soldier he tried not to think about what lay in store for francis he hadnt made a point of learning about detention camps either but they bore an evil reputation yes sir craddock said enthusiastically he turned to francis lets go you watching them tramp away from the front morrell shook his head war would have been a much simpler easier business with politics out of the mix xii e mily pinkard looked at the alarm clock which as she did every morning shed carried out from the bedroom to the kitchen oh goodness im late she said and gulped down her coffee jefferson pinkard was still plowing his way through bacon and eggs he got up though when his wife set her cup in the tin sink and grabbed her give me a kiss before you go he said when she did he tightened his arms around her her lips and tongue were warm and sweet and promising mm he said still holding her i dont think i want you to leave she twisted away from him i got to jeff she said you can just walk on over to the foundry but i got to catch the trolley if im gonna get where im going they dock you every minute youre not there too ill see you tonight honey her eyes told what she meant by that it was everything he could have hoped for and then some reluctantly he nodded no matter how much he wanted to take her back to the bedroom now by the time they got home tonight theyd both be worn to nubs miserable war he growled and sat back down to finish his breakfast emily nodded from the front hall sure enough is she pointed to the stove i got supper goin in there dont forget to soak your dishes fore you leave makes em a lot easierand quickerto wash she blew him another kiss then hurried out the door closing it after herself jeff did soak his breakfast dishes the quicker emily got them clean the more time shed have for other things hed been doing more chores around the house than hed expected when she started working just to keep her from being too tired to feel like making love life got crazy sometimes no two ways about it he grabbed his dinner pail and headed out the door himself walking to work alone still felt unnatural but bedford cunningham was toting a gun these days not a sledgehammer or a crowbar or a longhandled slag rake the cunningham house looked sad and empty fanny was gone too on her way to work pinkard wondered if she and emily were riding the same trolley car he had his own job to worry about though and trudged off to sloss foundry you had to take care of your business first and worry about the rest later what he did didnt take a wagonload of brains but his life had got a lot more complicated these months since the shooting started hed got used to greeting vespasian and agrippa when he came down onto the casting floor every morning it wasnt the same as talking with the white men whod been there before but it wasnt so bad both of them were old enough to have been born before manumission and they both understood their place in the scheme of things you could work with a nigger like that pinkard thought when the time came for them to go back to stoking the furnaces or whatever theyd done before the war theyd do it and keep whatever complaint they had to themselves pericles now mornin pericles pinkard said he talked to the young black man now the same way he did with agrippa and vespasian hed decided life was too short to get yourself all in an uproar over little things and working the day through without gabbing with the guy alongside reminded him of nothing so much as a fellow whod had a fight with his wife trying to show her who was boss by clamming up it didnt work at home and it didnt work here either mornin mistuh pinkard pericles answered there wasnt anything wrong with the way he acted not so you could put your finger on it there wasnt but his manner was somehow different from those of the older negroes who worked the night shift pericles acted as deferential to jefferson pinkard as they did but maybe that was it pinkard thought as a huge crucible swung by over his head and positioned itself to pour a fresh load of molten steel into the big castiron mold that waited to receive it then he stopped thinking about such things for a while you had to watch the pouring like a hawk if anything went wrong you needed to be ready to jump and runeither that or you got yourself burned to a crisp dead or wishing you were sid williamson had lingered a week before he finally died poor bastard that was especially true since the new crucible operator still wasnt so smooth as herb whod gone into the army when the war was new and looked like being over in a hurry but herb wasnt coming back somewhere up in kentucky near a town nobody two towns over had ever heard of till the war started hed stopped a bullet or a shell his widow worked with emily too and wore sombre black all the time this pour though went well a great cloud of steam hissed out of the mold steam heavy with the bloody smell of hot iron jeff and pericles worked side by side going right up to the pour and making sure it didnt escape the mold before it started solidifying warm this mornin pericles said with a grin the heat of the foundry floor dried the sweat on his face as fast as it tried to spring forth pinkard knew the same thing happened with him but he turned fiercely red from working up by the pour pericles seemed unaffected as if he were made of coldforged iron himself he handled his tools with nonchalant confidence a little more experience and hed be as good a steel man as bedford cunningham ever was you are gettin to know what youre doin pinkard said acknowledging that thank you mistuh pinkard pericles answered that was fine so was his selfeffacing tone of voice but then he added aint so hard is it once you get the hang of it i mean neither agrippa nor vespasian would have said anything like that even if they thought it they wouldnt have said it every once in a while though pericles came out with something like that something that made the way he acted around jefferson pinkard seem just that an act you couldnt call him for being uppity he never showed disrespect nor anything close to it but even a negro with selfconfidence was something new on jeffs mental horizon after a while pericles said mistuh pinkard you knew herb didnt you sure did pinkard said thats funny i was thinking about him not so long ago when the kid up there was pouring what about him did you hear tell they gonna throw his widow and her children out o their company house on account o he don work here no mo an he aint never comin back agrippa he tol me that this mornin his wife she go over there with some catfish fo to give her las night an she all cryin an wailin to beat the band don hardly seem right the bosses do that it sure as hell dont pinkard agreed he thought about it for a little while that grates so much i dont know that i want to swallow it pericles held up his right hand the bottom of the pale patch on his palm showed below the edge of his leather glove i aint makin it up swear to god i aint he said now sounding completely serious emily will know jeff said ill ask her when she gets home tonight if it is so its a pretty lowdown piece of dealing thats all ive got to say fore i started workin here what i was thinkin was that everybody white in this whole country had it easy just on account o he was white pericles said more i look though more i see it aint like that the white folks in the suits an the collars an the tall hats they do things to the white factory hands aint so much different than happens to niggers every day that there is a naturalborn fact pinkard said slamming one gloved fist into the palm of the other hand to emphasize his words damn all we can do about it though they got the money they got the factories like you say all we got is our hands an theres always plenty more hands around you dead right mistuh pinkard pericles said same way in the fieldsplanter dont like what a nigger does he gets hisself another nigger don matter what the first one did don matter he did anything they don like him he gone didnt think it was like that fo white folks shouldnt ought to be having his position in life compared to a negros made pinkard sit up and take notice they shouldnt be able to throw us out like an asswipe with shit on it wasnt for the work we did what would they have nothin not one thing i tell you hard row everybody hoes these days pericles said shouldnt be hardern its got to the men who work in the factory they should have some kind o say in how the factory runs got more right to it than the fat cats with the bulgin money bags you ask me he paused as if wondering whether hed said too much but jefferson pinkard clapped his hands together damn straight he said thingsd run a hell of a lot smoother if somebody who knew what he was doinif somebody whod done the work himselfhad charge of things not a big wheel with a diamond ring on his pinky im talking politics with a nigger he realized and if that didnt beat all when pericles couldnt even vote but the young black man had touched pinkards own dissatisfaction with the way things were and had brought it out into the open so he could see all of it for himself after that pericles clammed up now it was jeff who wanted to talk more and the negro who went about his job without wasted words pinkard started to get angry but his temper cooled down after a bit pericles had walked dangerous ground saying even as much as hed said but pinkard was feeling damn near as trampled on as the black man that was just what the bosses were doing he thought trying to turn white men into niggers when the closing whistle wailed pinkard almost ran home he was so anxious to find out from emily whether pericles had the straight goods about herbs widow he got back to the yellow cottage before his wife did she was probably still on the trolley he busied himself by setting the table for the two of them as hed got into the habit of doing when he made it home first bedford cunningham had he known about that would have given him a hard time over it but bed was worried about machinegun bullets these days not china and cheap iron flatware the door opened in came emily youll never guess what theyve done to daisy wallace she said herbs widow thrown her out on the street like a dog on account of her husband got hisself shot savin the sloss familys greedy behinds jeff answered emily stared at him for heavens sake how did you know that he hadnt usually heard the gossip she brought home i got ways he answered a little smugly sure does stink dont it sure does she agreed hanging up her hat and taking off the apron that protected her skirt makes me want to spit is what it does she walked past jeff into the kitchen slowly shifting gears from work to home when she saw the table ready for supper she paused and said oh thank you honey in a voice suggesting his thoughtfulness had surprised her that made him feel better about helping than he would have if shed taken it for granted even over the stew of salt pork and hominy and green beans both of them kept on fuming about the way the crucible mans widow had been treated borrowing pericles idea jeff said wed all be better off i reckon if the workers had the say in how the factories got run hed expected emily to agree to that instead she paused with a bit of meat halfway to her mouth that sounds like somethin a red would say she told him her voice serious maybe even a little frightened they been warnin us about reds almost all the time lately maybe cause makin shells is such an important business never can tell whos a bombflingin revolutionary in disguise they say you aint talkin about me jefferson pinkard declared dont want no revolutionnothin like it just want whats right and whats fair lord knows we aint been gettin enough of that well thats so emily said nodding she ate the bite that had hung suspended neither one of them said much more about politics afterwards though jeff worked the pump while emily did the dishes afterwards he slid his arm around her waist he didnt need to do much talking about that to let her know what he had in mind by the way she smiled at him she was thinking the same thing they went into the bedroom he blew out the lamp in the darkness the iron frame of the bed creaked slow at first building to a rhythm almost frantic afterward emily spent and sweaty fell asleep almost at once jeff stayed awake a little longer his mind not on the feel of his wifes arms around him but on red revolutionaries as far as he could see these days people feared reds and anarchists the same way theyd feared slave uprisings back before manumission pericles a red the idea was ridiculous he was just a poor damned nigger sick of getting stuck with the short straw every draw in his shoes jefferson figured he would have felt the same way hell he did feel that way thanks to the dislocations the war was bringing hed thought having a white skin made him immune to such worry but hed turned out to be wrong maybe we need another revolution after all he muttered he was glad emily hadnt heard that it would have made her fret but saying it seemed to ease his mind he rolled over snuggled down into his pillow and fell asleep a voice with a southern twang maam an arm encased in a butternut sleeve holding up an empty coffee cup fill me up again if you please of course sir nellie semphroch said taking the cup from the rebel lieutenant colonel you were drinking the dutch east indian werent you thats right the officer answered sure is fine you have so many different kinds to choose from weve been lucky nellie said she carried the cup to the sink then took a clean one and filled it with the spicy brew the confederate evidently enjoyed she brought it back to him here you are sir he thanked her but absently he and the other rebs at the table were busy rehashing an engagement up along the susquehanna that had happened a couple of weeks before damnyankees would have crossed for sure an artillery captain said if one of my sergeants hadnt fought his gun with niggers toting shells and loading his own crew got knocked out in the bombardment heard tell about that the lieutenant colonel said damnedpardon me maam he added with a glance toward nellie i say damned if i know whether they ought to pin medals on those niggers or take em out somewhere quiet have em kneel down in front of a hole and then shoot em cover em up and try to make out the whole thing never happened all the rebs around the table nodded the lieutenant colonel nodded to the artillery captain youre closest to the matter jeb what do you think about it me the captainjebwas boyishly handsome with a little tuft of beard under his lower lip that should have looked absurd but somehow seemed dashing instead i think id like another cup of our hostess excellent coffee too he held out his cup to nellie as she hurried off to refill it he lowered his voicebut not quite enough to keep her from overhearingand said i wouldnt mind a go with our hostess excellent daughter either hoarse male laughter rose nellie stiffened if edna judged by looksif edna judged by anythingshe probably wouldnt have minded a go with this jeb either nellie thought hard about dosing his coffee with a potent purgative in the end she didnt all men were like that some at least were honest about it when she got back to the table the artillery captain was saying niggers dont seem to be putting on airs on account of it theyre back to driving and fetching same as they were before you ask me its worth knowing niggers can fight if their necks are on the block way were losing men we may need black bodies one of these days one of the other officersa majorgot out a silvered flask and poured a hefty shot of something into his coffee thats not the most cheerful notion ive ever heard he said taking a big swig of the augmented brew ahh dont like the idea of niggers getting their hands on guns dont like em getting their hands on military discipline either i dont like it myself the lieutenant colonel said weve got ourselves a white mans country thats how it ought to be and thats how it ought to stay well gentlemen you wont hear me disagreeing there jeb said but if it turns into a matter of winning the war with niggers or losing it without em what do we do then an uncomfortable silence followed that question the major with the flask poured another shot into his cup what he had in there was probably more hooch than coffee that didnt keep him from gulping it down as if it were water ahh he said again and then what we do is we pray to god to keep that cup from passing to us amen jeb said and the rest of the officers nodded but the artillery captain went on wars already gone on longer than we thought it would the middle of april now and no end in sight christ we ought to be ready in case it goes on longer yet not up to you and me to decide that kind of thing thank heaven the lieutenant colonel said which brought another round of nods the president and the secretary of war theyll do whatever they choose to do and well make the best of it thats what the armys for the major started telling a long complicated story about a mule that had tried to kick an aeroplane to death it would have been funnier if he hadnt had to go back and repeat and correct himself over and over again thats what the demon rum does to you nellie thought in her mind all liquor got lumped together as rum it calcifies the brain and serves you right she had other tables on which to wait the coffeehouse was jumping these days business better than it had been since before the war maybe better than it had ever been being able to get her hands on all the coffee she needed didnt hurt there a lot of places in washington had gone bellyup just as she had been at the point of doing not so long before shed wondered if anyone would ask how she managed to keep getting coffee beans in the middle of a tightly rationed town but that hadnt happened even edna hadnt been unduly curious she probably thinks im sleeping with someone nellie thought sadly it was she feared what her daughter would have done in her place or maybe edna only noticed the beans were there and truly did think no more about it the next morning nellie and edna were sweeping up the floor by the light of a couple of kerosene lampsneither gas nor electricity had yet come back to this part of washington outside black night brightened toward dawn a coffeehouses customers started showing up early as nellie emptied the dustpan into a wastebasket a light went on across the street a small pot of coffee was already on the coal stove to give her and edna an eyeopener before customers started coming in nellie poured a cup from the pot and set it in a saucer i see mr jacobs is up and about too she said ill take this over to him it will be better than anything hes likely to make for himself all right ma ednas laugh was not altogether kindly beyond me what you see in a little wrinkled old shoemaker though mr jacobs is a very nice man nellie said primly her daughter laughed again nellie took a haughty tone your mind may be in the gutter but that doesnt mean mine is now tell me another one ma edna said her mind was in the gutter sure enough to keep from heating up one of their all too frequent fights nellie let the door she closed behind her serve in place of an angry response no sooner had she crossed the street than a long line of trucks rolled past their acetylene lamps turning morning twilight to noon she looked back at the growling monsters almost all of the drivers were negroes she had to tap twice to get mr jacobs to hear her he peered through his magnifying glasses his wizened face wrinkled in a new way when he smiled widow semphroch come in he said and you have brought me coffee too oh this is wonderful i was afraid you would be a confederate soldier with boots that had to be repaired at once because he was going back to the front i am glad to be wrong he stood aside and bowed like an old world gentleman as he welcomed her she set the coffee on his work counter by the last closing the door after her he came over picked up the cup and sipped at his appreciative hum nellie said thank you so much for helping to arrange to get the beans delivered to my shop in the first place it is my pleasure he said and then sipping again it is my pleasure and it is so very kind of you to bring a cup to me every morning he cocked his head to one side you hear all sorts of interesting news in a coffeehouse what have you heard lately nellie told him what shed heard lately chief among the stories being the one about the negroes who had served as artillerymen after the men for whom they laboured went down wounded or killed she recounted the tale in as much detail as she could the commander of the battery was a captain named jeb though i dont know his last name she finished i do not know this either but i think i may have friends who will mr jacobs nodded thoughtfully yes thank you for bringing this to my notice widow semphroch i think my friends may be most interested to hear it i am very glad we were able to help you in your difficulty he finished the coffee and set cup back in saucer here you are your business grows busy before mine and i would not keep you from it edna will take care of things till i get back nellie said but she picked up the cup and saucer and hurried back to the coffeehouse even so leaving edna alone in there with all those lecherous confederates was asking for trouble and sure enough when she walked inside there sat the handsome artillery captain from the night before with edna pouring him a cup of coffee and looking to nellies jaundiced eye as if she was about to plop herself down in his lap but the scene was outwardly decorous so nellie in spite of what she was thinking kept her mouth shut edna didnt subscribing to the notion that the best defense was a good offence she said hello ma took you long enough to get back from the shoemakers shop what were you doing over there anyhow her tone was light jeb the confederate gunner would have noticed nothing amiss but nellie knew she meant something like you went over there and tore one off with mr jacobs didnt you and since you did what are you doing meddling in my life but nellie had gone across the street for patriotic reasons not vile ones she said we were just talkinghes a good friend why dont you go back and scrub out the sinks why dont you wash out your mouth with soap while youre doing it too edna went with a walk that nellie thought would have got her arrested for soliciting had she done it on the streetand had the confederates bothered arresting streetwalkers they mostly didnt their basic attitude seemed to be that all us women were whores so what point to worrying about a few in particular jeb followed edna with his eyes till she disappeared then he seemed to remember the coffee growing cold in front of him he gulped it down set a coin on the table and rose setting his redcorded artillerymans hat on his head touching the brim he nodded to nellie and said obliged maam nellie nodded back why not she thought she was obliged to him too for running off at the mouth so freely the night before and he hadnt got his hands on edna the moonstruck way he looked at her proved that she knew all about the ways men looked at women if hed had her his stare would have been more possessive more knowing he was still wondering what she was like and all the more twitchingly lustful for that keep right on wondering you stinking reb nellie thought plowing the land had an ancient timeless rhythm to it walking behind horses guiding the plow watching the rich dark earth of manitoba furrow up on either side of the blade made arthur mcgregor think of his grandfather who had done the same thing back in ontario of his severaltimesgreatgrandfather who had done his best to scratch a living from the stony soil of scotland and sometimes of an ancestor far more distant than that an ancestor who didnt speak english or scots gaelic either an ancestor who wore barely tanned skins and walked behind an ox scratching a furrow in the ground with a stick sharpened in the fire like his ancestors going back to that ancient halfimaginary one mcgregor eyed the sky worrying about the weather if he hadnt his son would have taken care of that for him here came alexander with a pitcher of cold water from the well think its safe getting the seed in the ground so soon pa alexander asked as he already had more than once a late frost and were in a lot of trouble alexander was a good boy arthur mcgregor thought but he was getting to the age where he thought everything his father did was wrong for no better reason than that it was the old man doing it this year son were in a lot of trouble no matter what we do i think mcgregor answered but i want to plow and plant as early as i can before the americans find a reason to come round and tell me i cant they cant do that alexander exclaimed wed starve and if the lot of us did do you think theyd shed a single tear arthur mcgregor shook his head not likely there for once his son had a hard time disagreeing with him but alexander found a different question to ask even if we do get our crop in will they let us keep enough of it to live on his father sighed i dont know but if we have no crop im certain sure well not be able to live on that arthur mcgregor looked north like all his ancestors save a couple of lucky ones he worried about war hardly less than weather the front lay a good way off nowbut who could guess where it would be when harvest time rolled around would the yanks have overrun winnipeg by then or would the canadians and british have rallied and pushed the thieves in greengray back south over the border where they belonged if you read the newspapers you figured canada was in a state of collapse but if you believed all the lies the americans made the papers tell winnipeg had already fallen twice montreal three times and toronto oncemaybe for luck alexander persisted how do you feel about raising a crop when the americans will end up eating most of it while theyre fighting canada mcgregor sighed how do i feel about that like the mother bird after the cuckoo laid the egg in her nest son but what am i supposed to do i ask you that what the americans dont take well eat ourselves his son kicked at the dirt when you were young you were sure every thing had answers either black or white alexander was getting his nose rubbed in the reality of gray and didnt much care for it trying to avoid it he said why not just plant enough for us and leave the rest of the fields he waved at the broad flat acreageto lie fallow for the year i could do that i suppose if i didnt need to make some cash to buy the things we cant raise on the farm arthur mcgregor said he eyed his son with genuine respect the boyno the young mancould have come up with many worse notions but if i try that too the other thing likely to happen to me is farming at the point of an american bayonet if every farmer in manitoba did the same thing they couldnt put bayonets to all of our backs alexanders face flamed with excitement in the course of a couple of sentences hed given himself a bold and patriotic movement to join a farmers strike thats what it would be the only drawback to the movement was that it didnt exist arthur mcgregor shook his head no it had more for one thing son with all the yanks in manitoba these days they likely do have enough men to put a bayonet at every farm and for another the way they shoot hostages they wouldnt wait more than a minute or two before they started shooting farmers and once they shot a few the rest would rise up and throw the yanks off our soil alexander broke in not that easy mcgregor said with a sigh i wish it was but its not they shoot a few most of the rest will do just what they say and nothing else but other thing is theres too many americans up here for us to throw em out even if we did rise up oh we could make nuisances of ourselves that i dont deny but no more the yanks are bastards sure enough but weve seen too much to have the notion that they are cowards and they are fools theyd beat us down and wed spend our blood for nothing alexander still looked mutinous it was in the nature of youths his age to look mutinous that is to have their looks accurately reflect their thoughts to quell the mutiny mcgregor didnt shout or bluster instead he pointed to the roadway small in the distance but growing steadily larger as they approached here came a battalion of us soldiers marching north toward the front in column of fours they made a greengray snake slithering across the land the snake was having heavy going the road still being muddy from melted winter snows after the troops came supply wagons topped with white canvas lineal descendants of the conestogas in which so many americansand not a few canadians toohad gone west to settle hooves and wagon wheels had even more trouble advancing through mud than did marching boots about half a mile behind that battalion came another barely visible in the distance as yet but all too soon to approach in turn do you see son mcgregor asked his voice halfway between gentle and rough there are just too many of them and us spread too thin on the ground to be much use fighting em either we find some other way to drive em mad or we do as much of what they tell us as we have to and trust to god itll all come out right in the end thats a bitter pill father alexander said i never told you it wasnt mcgregor agreed and trusting in god is hard because he does what he wants not what we want i dont know what else to say though we get along and we wait and we see what happens he couldnt have given his son much harder advice and he knew it the advice was hard for him too he wanted nothing so much as to strike back at the americans before the war began hed been starting to think about buying a gasolinepowered tractor now he counted himself lucky to have a team of horses he flicked the reins hed been standing idle long enough the horses snorted and strode forward as the sun sank toward the flat horizon that evening he and the team headed back toward the farmhouse and the barn hed curry the animals and get them fed and watered and then go in to see what maude had done up for supper the horses stopped snorting their ears twitching mcgregor stopped too for a moment he failed to sense anything out of the ordinary then he too caught the low rumble out of the north faroff thunder he would have thought the year before he knew better now an education he would willingly have done without that was artillery he hadnt heard it for a while the front was a long way off these days a bombardment had to be big to be noticed across so many miles and whose guns are they he wondered out loud spring was here summer coming fighting weather he had the feeling hed be hearing guns a lot in days to come he hoped theyd get louder not softer that would mean the front was drawing closer his countrymen and whatever soldiers the mother country could spare pushing back the invaders he and his family spoke of little else over supper rabbit stew all they could do though was guess and hope the artillery barrage went on through the night it was still roaring away when mcgregor visited the outhouse in the wee small hours and it was still roaring away when he took the horses out to the fields at sunrise a train no doubt full of troops roared up the track toward the front the road was full of marching men by afternoon ambulances and trains showing the red cross rolled south were their wounded the residue of advance or retreat the hell of it was arthur mcgregor had no way of knowing for remembrance day flora hamburger and the other socialists not only from the tenth ward and the rest of the lower east side but from all over new york came to broadway to watch the parade coming as it did just nine days before may day their own great holiday it was a rival focus for the energy and allegiance of the american working class as always the parade route was packed to commemorate the day of mourning flags fluttered from poles on top of every building every one of them flown upside down symbolizing the distress of the united states when they had had to yield to the forces of the confederacy england and france and to recognize the confederate states acquisition of chihuahua and sonora burly policemen cordoned the socialist party delegation away from the rest of the crowd brawls broke out every year after the remembrance day parade now with the war on who could say what might happen flora peered across broadway to the threestory brick building that housed slossons cafe and billiards men looked out through the plateglass window of the pool hall and men and women both watched from the clothawninged windows of the upper floors she wondered what sort of bosses squeezed profit from their labor beside her herman bruck said far more of the people are with us than the minions of the ruling classhe pointed to the policemenwould ever admit theyll let the veterans groups with their fat bellies and their minds full of blood and iron theyll let them know what they think he looked like a boss himself in his broadcloth suit and stovepipe hat a younger son maybe or one just taking over the business but whether flora cared for him or not she had to admit he was socialist to the core so many have lost husbands and brothers and sons she said nodding and for what how are we better what have we gained how many more young men will have to die on the altar of capitalism and nationalism before the war ends all that is true maria tresca put in but some will say we have come this far so how can we stop halfway this is the biggest stumbling block we have to overcoming the support of the masses for the war her sister angelina nodded it is a problem flora admitted i have run into it many times myself it should not be a problem bruck sounded angry we should be able to show clearly why this war is immoral unnatural and serves only the interests of the ruling class a few feet away a policeman with a red irish face heard that he turned to bruck and smiling nastily made motions as if of counting money then with theatrical scorn he turned his broad blueclad back do you see flora said triumphantly we voted to finance the war along with everyone else and now no one lets us forget it i said at the time that was a mistake so you did herman bruck muttered he was in a poor position to do anything but mutter as he had supported paying for the war he still did sometimes but not when policemen mocked him for it and so it was with some relief that he pointed down broadway and said here comes the parade leading it as had hardened into ritual over the past generation came an enormous soldier carrying the stars and stripes once more upside down a marine band at slow march followed him they played the starspangled banner with the tempo of a dirge as the flagbearer and the band went by men uncovered and held their hats over their hearts flora recognized the whitebearded bandmaster thats sousa she exclaimed with the respect one can give an effective foe the musicians stirring songs had done more to fire narrow national patriotism and make the proletariat forget its international ties than the work of most jingo politicians here and there in the crowd beyond the police lines men left their hats on oddson candidates to be socialists fights had started over such things in years past now beyond a couple of lowvoiced calls of shame no one did anything almost no one in the socialist party delegation uncovered the marine musicians did not turn their heads but sidelong glances said they took mental note behind the band rolled a limousine that carriedflora stiffened as she saw who the man standing in the back of the car wastheodore roosevelt the president only showed himself he did not wave to the crowd his suit was as black and somber as herman brucks and almost as well cut a few socialists shouted catcalls at him he ignored them then came the veterans after the limousine marched a contingent of men older than john philip sousa survivors of the war of secession some still strode straight and slim despite their years others shambled along as best they could helped along by a stick or a cane some had one sleeve flapping empty or pinned to the front of their jackets some had one trouser leg pinned up and propelled themselves with crutches at the rear attendants pushed a few legless men along in wheelchairs the old soldiers faces almost to a man bore a grim sadness the passage of half a century had not erased flora sympathized with them the usa had surely been more progressive than the feudalminded rebels but however sure the historical dialectic was it did not always move straight ahead the memory of failure still stung the veterans of the war of secession behind them marched another group of veterans these middleaged many of them plump and prosperous men who had fought in the second mexican war where their predecessors seemed proud of what they had done even in defeat these exsoldiers some of them had almost a hangdog air as if they felt they should have done better but didnt quite know how then came count von bernstorff the german ambassador fantastically bemedaled and riding in a limousine flanked by a color guard of german soldiers carrying the blackwhitered banners of the german empire those drew both cheers and jeers many of the jeers either in german or in yiddish close enough to german for the spikehelmeted soldiers in fieldgray to understand germany taught the usa to ignore the needs of the proletariat herman bruck shouted shaking his fist germany taught the usa to fool the proletariat into thinking its needs are met flora cried a moment later which gave her the double satisfaction of telling the truth and correcting the selfrighteous bruck the mixture of applause and catcalls went on after the german ambassador and his escort passed behind him came a troop of men hardly younger than the second mexican war veterans soldiers circle members of the first class men who had served their two years in the army after conscription was passed in the wake of two lost wars flora and bruck and maria and angelina tresca and all the socialist representatives joined with their party members in the crowd in shouting abuse at the marching men of the soldiers circle each successive troop from the conscription class a year later than its predecessor men who stayed in the soldiers circle after they served their time were apt to be of a reactionary cast of mind men who gladly served as strikebreakers scabs goons men to whom even teddy roosevelt was a dangerous radical for worrying about the untrammeled power of the bosses as the soldiers circle troops passed by as the men became of the age where their contemporaries were fighting other jeers rang out alongside those of the socialists chief among them was the swelling cry why arent you in the army while the youngish men who had done their time as conscripts but had not yet been dragged into the war ignored the mockery and marched stolidly down broadway mockery was all they got but then not far from the socialist delegation one of the men of the conscription class of lost his temper he turned his head and shouted at an abuser why aint i in the army now fuck you and fuck your mother too why aint you with a roar of rage the fellow hed cursed rushed at him pulled out a knife and plunged it into his side the soldiers circle man went down with a groan blood bright on his white shirt four of his comrades threw the man with the knife to the ground kicked the blade away and methodically began stomping the stabber a few people in the crowd cheered but others ran out to try to rescue the man whod used the knife more soldiers circle men set on them somebodyin the rapidly swelling chaos flora had no idea who or on which side fired a pistol an instant later several guns were popping away as if the war had decided to pay new york a visit jesus mary and joseph shouted the irish policeman whod made moneycounting motions at herman bruck along with his fellows he dashed toward what had gone in the space of half a minute from patriotic parade to riot flora hamburger turned her back on it to her fellow socialists she cried stay here dont join it dont let the reactionaries exploit us in the newspapers angelina and maria tresca loudly added their voices to floras flora looked around for support from herman bruck to her dismay she saw him along with several other hotblooded socialists running straight toward the men from the soldiers circle they had their own rallying cry direct action the socialist call to arms had rung out in mines and factories and lumber camps and fields across the usa for a generation but now flora shook her head in dismay the place and the timing could hardly have been worse riot spread up the parade toward the marine marching band at the front from that direction flora heard a couple of explosions louder and fiercer than pistol shots bombs she exclaimed theyre throwing bombs she didnt know who they were but she feared with sick horror the socialists would get the blame in the s and s direct action had often meant more than words the partys past had blood in it another bomb went off this one frighteningly close injured men and women screamed above their cries rose a great voice bellowing justice for utah absurdly relief flooded flora maybe the hard hand of the government would land on the mormons not on the party she was ashamed of herself a moment later do it to them not to us was not the answer the government no matter how tr thundered about swinging a big club had no right to oppress anyone analyzing that in fullness though would have to wait she grabbed maria and angelina wed better get out of here she said the secretaries nodded vehemently it was easier said than done a lot of the crowd was trying to flee the brawls and battles that roiled in the middle of broadway but almost as many people women as well as men were pressing forward trying to get into the fray yet another pistol shot rang out this one terribly close terribly loud angelina tresca shrieked blood vividly impossibly red stained the white front of her shirtwaist she stood staring in astonishment when she opened her mouth to say something only more blood came from itnot a word blood poured from her nose too she swayed toppled fell more poppoppops went off incongruously cheerful marias shriek was louder than her sisters she couldnt even run to angelina the crowd panicked by gunfire swept them apart when maria tried to go against it she was swept off her own feet flora dragged her up before she could get too badly trampled then dragged her away clinging to each other weeping the two of them struggled to get off broadway and onto twentythird street so they could escape the riot oof a portly man ran into flora he acted as if he were trying to fend her off but his hands slid up her body till they closed on her breasts the crowd and turmoil offering concealment for what he did shed had such unwelcome attentions before snatching a pin from the floral hat she wore she stuck him with it he howled and whirled away she stuck him again as he fled this time where he sat down he howled again almost seeming to levitate the pin was long and sharp and had blood on a good part of its length savagely pleased at that she stuck it back amidst the artificial greenery on her hat maria tresca didnt react staring numbly maybe she was too numb to think too much about angelina yet it would be better if they knew not to do such things flora said not wanting to think about angelina either but we have to educate them if they dont she wished her sister had stuck a hat pin in yossel reisen but no that wasnt fair he hadnt taken anything from sophie she hadnt wanted to give it was only what hed given her in return a man stepped on her foot he didnt try to feel her up he just went on his way as if she didnt exist that she didnt mind so much it could have happened at any time in the streets of new york city the biggest most indifferent city in the usa in a way in fact it almost comforted her showing the world wasnt devoid of normality even in the midst of riot off broadway things were quieter flora and maria walked quickly down twentythird street to put some distance between themselves and the insanity that had swallowed the soldiers circle parade trouble will come from this flora said grimly and then amended that more trouble i mean back behind them angelina was almost surely dead even as maria nodded tears streaming down her face a burly policeman grabbed a jewishlooking fellow in a shabby suit and demanded you wouldnt be a socialist would you now when the man nodded the policeman hit him in the head with his billy club blood streaming down his face the fellow turned to run the policeman kicked him in the seat of the pants shouting lucky i dont shoot you you blackhearted traitor shame flora cried and maria added her voice an instant later flora went on you have no business beating a man for what he believes only for what he does havent you heard of the constitution of the united states yes thinking of politics was easier than thinking of death unleashed on the streets of new york the policeman stamped toward her and maria nightstick still upraised to floras relief at the last moment he discovered he didnt quite have the crust to beat two women voice strangled with rage he said get out o here this minute or ill run the both of you in on what charge flora asked her chin jutting in defiance streetwalking the policeman stripped her and maria with his eyes were not the ones who sell ourselves to get our daily bread flora retorted get out the policeman screamed his face was crimson furious he spat on the sidewalk and that for the goddamned constitution of the united states theres a war on now and the gloves are off get out he would have hit them had they stayed an instant longer flora was willing to suffer a beating for the cause but now maria dragged her away we cant the secretary said enough blood spilled already please floranot after angelina later flora decided the secretary was right the socialists already had martyrs aplenty today maria trescas sister among them the policemans hatefilled words kept ringing in her ears the gloves are off she shivered if tr felt the same wayand he probably wouldwhat was the government going to do now a negro maid lifted her feather duster from the windowsillnot that shed been working hard anyhow but an excuse to stop was always welcomein one of the forwardfacing rooms at marshlands and said to scipio here come de man from de mercury wid a paper for we thank you very much griselda he answered gravely and heard her snicker by way of reply he ignored her amused scorn so long as he was on duty in the mansion he was obliged to sound like an educated white man not a negro of the congaree he checked for himself before going to the front hall to open the door the rest of the staff was not above playing small jokes but sure enough here came virgil hobson on a mule carrying with him a copy of the charleston mercury anne colleton got the daily courier too and the south carolinian and southern guardian from columbia marshlands was a good way out of the way for all of them but you declined to render its mistress a service at your peril virgil was just climbing down off the mule as scipio opened the door for him good afternoon sir he said hobson was a poor buckra who spent half his time drinking and the other half hung over but he was white folks and the white folks who didnt deserve respect raised the most hell if they didnt get it afternoon virgil said he walked straight but very gently as if touching the ground hurt that meant he was after a binge not in the middle of one he thrust the mercury at scipio here yare without waiting for a reply he turned and walked back toward his longeared mount thank you sir scipio said to his back he waited till the delivery man rode away before shutting the door as he set the newspaper on the tray to take it to anne colleton he glanced down at the front page big black headlines shouted up at him socialists and mormons ram page in new york city reds and fanatics riot force yanks to declare martial law unrest in us army reported he didnt know how the mercury had got the story or how much truth was in it but if it was even a quarter true the usa was in a peck of trouble on reading past the headlines the other thing he noted less happily was that the us army despite the claims of unrest in its ranks was going about the business of keeping a lid on new york city the people they were putting a lid on might be socialists but they were white folks if damnyankee soldiers would put down an uprising from white folks what would confederate troops do if when their negro labourers rose up under the red flag he was afraid he knew the answer to that question hed tried telling it to the reds among the field hands here they kept laughing at him he resolved to hang on to this newspaper and the others that came in over the next few days to let cassius and his fellow revolutionaries see what happened in the real world how could you expect a band of marxist fanatics to seize power in a country they didnt seem to understand how big a place a country was going on with that argument fortunately could wait he carried the charleston mercury upstairs to anne colletons office of an afternoon you could expect to find her there she was on the telephone he stood in the doorway waiting to be noticed no she said crisply into the mouthpiece i told you to buy not sell you shall carry out my instructions as i give them sir or i will find another broker and you will find a lawsuit what an oversight i have no more tolerance for oversights than i have for deliberate errors whatever it was this is your first last and only warning good day she hung up muttered something sulphurous under her breath and then anger expunged smiled at scipio i hope you have better news for me than that chucklehead did i believe so yes without another word scipio set the tray with the mercury on the desk in front of anne colleton turning it as he did so to make sure the headlines were right side up for her her eyes widened her mouth twisted into something halfway between a smile and the expression a tiger wears on spotting a juicy sheep scipio was heartily glad that expression bore on the newspaper not on him the mistress of marshlands rapidly read through the stories having to do with the troubles in the usa pursuing them into the inner pages when she finished she looked up at scipio and asked did you take any notice of these she paused you must have you told me the news was good i did look at the headlines yes maam scipio answered you didnt want to be in a position of having to lie to anne colleton she was sharp as the edge of a straight razor and even more dangerous her finger stabbed down at one of those headlines thats why well win the war scipio the united states are divided against themselves they havent the stomach for a fight to the finish we have no socialists here by god that predatory expression grew even fiercer we have no mormons here either but that doesnt keep us from using them against the usa our states are truly united even if the yankees have the name and because of that well dictate terms to them in the end as we did two generations ago and then again in my parents time yes maam scipio repeated some of the sweat springing out on his face came from having to wear tailcoat vest and boiled shirt on a muggy spring day that threatened summer part though came from his own fear sharp as anne colleton was she looked right at negroesat one person in three in the csa without even seeing them or maybe seeing them only as labourers not as people an awful lot of white folks sawor didnt see blacks the same way anne colleton was more clever than most of them though if she ever really looked instead of taking things for granted she looked toward a clock on the wall her expression faded to one of discontent probably too late for cassius to bring in a couple of turkeys before nightfall go tell him to hunt tomorrow i want to lay on a fancy supper then yes maam scipio slid the tray out from under the charleston mercury and took it back to the table in the front hall where it rested he was always delighted at escaping the mistress attentionexcept when she sent him out to cassius her eyes remained closed to the double game scipio was playing whatever else you said about him cassius had his eyes wide wide open he was sitting on the steps in front of his cottage running a cleaning patch through the barrels of his shotgun when scipio came up the hunters weathered face cracked into a leathery grin he jumped to his feet limber as a man half his age kip what fo you do me de favor o yo compny ignoring the irony scipio told him what anne colleton wanted cassius nodded vigorously i do that he waved scipio an invitation come inside you n me we talk normally scipio dreaded that invitation though he found it impossible to refuse today though he thought he would do more talking than usual as soon as cassius shut the door to give them privacy he began you know what de socialists do in new york city they rise up an do jesus they make the usa cassius waved him to silence kip dat ol news he said scornfully dat happen las week it over an done with now cep fo de pression de pression dat go on a long time always do he sounded very cynical very sure scipio stared but de newspaper jus say today white folks paper cassius laced his voice with even more scorn than before dey got to wait dey got to decide what they want they good little boys an girls to hear about de buckra you give bad news to they they get resless how you know fo de newspaper come scipio asked somebody not so far they got a wireless set cassius answered after a moments hesitation in lieu of staring scipio looked down at the weathered pine boards of the floor that somebodypresumably a negroamong the red wouldbe revolutionaries had the knowledge to run a wireless set that that somebody and unless scipio was wrong a lot of somebodies in the csa had acquired such knowledge under the nose of the confederate authorities put that together with the undoubted desperation of the rising that would come and maybe just maybe maybe jus maybe come de revolution we win scipio said softly do jesus hell yes we win cassius declared de dialectic say when de whole of de proletariat rise up de capitalists an de bourgeoisie they caint no way put we down again saying a thing didnt make it so scipio knew that hed even tried telling cassius and island and the other reds as much they didnt listen to him any more than the preacher would have if hed denied jesus if they had men on wireless setsmaybe just maybe they had reason not to listen chester martin ducked behind a stretch of brick wall that reached up to his belly button it was a hard landing more bricks lay all around what was left of the wall somewhere not far away were two whitewashed pieces of wood nailed together at right angles once upon a time this had been a church on the outskirts of big lick virginia now it offered him a different kind of salvation a confederate bullet smacked the other side of the bricks maybe it had been aimed at him maybe fired at random he had no way of knowing what he did know was that the bricks were good and solid and would keep rifle and machinegun fire from him as long as he stayed low anybody who hadnt learned to stay low by now was already dead or wounded martin took advantage of the momentary respite to put a fresh full clip on his springfield never could tell when youd have to try to kill somebody or several somebodiesin a hurry if one of the rebs had more bullets in his rifle than you did in yours youd be sorry martin muttered i dont want to be sorry i want the other son of a bitch to be sorry paul andersen crawled up beside him aint this fun he said also pausing to reload now that you mention it chester said no andersens grin was wry let me ask it a different way aint this fun next to leave back in white sulphur springs martin considered that fine philosophical point nobodys trying to kill you back there he said at last other than that though you got a point nobodys trying to kill you back there andersen exclaimed you mean you didnt think they were trying to bore you to death hmm martin said and then yeah maybe they were i mean if you dont like lemonade and you dont like hot water that stinks like somebody cut the cheese in it not a hell of a lot to do back there i hear they got saloonshell i hear they got whorehousesin leave towns on what used to be confederate territory andersen said the army has charge there and the army knows what soldiers want to do when they get away from the front for a while but white sulphur springs thats back in the usa and it aint the army in charge its the damn preachers no whiskey chester martin agreed no women except the red cross girls handing out the lemonade a couple of them were pretty but once im back there and cleaned up i want to do more than look at a woman you know what im saying you bet i do andersen answered me too hell looking is harder some ways than not being around em at all i think so too martin said i he shut up then and flattened him self out among the bricks because the rebs started throwing whizzbangs into the neighborhood the shells burst all around throwing deadly fragments every which way the barragemostly those damned threeinchers that seemed to fire almost as fast as machine guns but some bigger cannon toowent on for about half an hour stretcherbearers hauled groaning thrashing us soldiers back toward the doctors some men didnt need stretcherbearers if all that was left of you was your leg from the knee down your foot still in your boot doctors wouldnt do you any good as soon as the bombardment stopped martin and andersen popped up like a couple of jackintheboxes sure as hell here came the rebs dashing forward through the ruins of big lick they ran low and bent over not wanting to expose themselves any more than they had to veteran troops martin thought new fish had less sense he was a veteran too the more you let the other guys take advantage of a bombardment the worse off youd be the time to smash them was as soon as they jumped out of their holes if you could pot a couple then the rest lost enthusiasm for the work theyd been assigned he squeezed the trigger the springfield slammed against his shoulder a reb pitched over on his face martin worked the bolt and fired again another confederate soldier fell this one grabbing at his arm martin seemed to have all the time in the world to swing his rifle toward a third figure clad in butternut to squeeze the trigger to watch the fellow topple beside him paul andersen was also banging away somewhere not far off a machine gun started hammering a lot of rebels went down but a lot of them kept coming too they pitched improvised grenades at the us soldiers martin didnt like the idea of carrying those damn things aroundif a bullet hit one it would blow a hole in you they could throw a dog through but he didnt like being on the receiving end of grenades either it was as if the infantry started having its own artillery shouts of alarm from the left made him whip his head around the confederates were in among the us trenches and foxholes trying to drive the americans back to white sulphur springs without benefit of leave martin ran toward the battling cursing men in a fight like that you used anything you had rifle bayonet knife the sawedoff spade you carried to dig yourself in the question was brutally simple would enough rebs get past the us rifle and machinegun fire to overwhelm the defenders and make this wrecked stretch of suburb their own once more or would the men who were in place and whatever reinforcements who could get forward blunt the attack and throw it back butternut smeared with mud and grass stains didnt look much different from similarly dirty greengray being sure of who was who was anything but easy you didnt want to go after the wrong man by mistake but you didnt want to hesitate and get yourself killed either an unmistakable rebel leaped out from behind a pile of rubble and swung one of those shorthandled shovels at chester martins head he threw up his rifle just in time to fend off the blow the force of it staggered him even so the confederate intent on his work drew back the shovel for another blow before he could deliver it a bulletfrom a us soldier or a rebel martin never knewcaught him in the shoulder the spade spun from his hands ahh shit he said loudly you got me now yank martin dashed past him if hed stayed there an instant longer he would have shot the wounded rebel in the head accepting the surrender of a man whod been doing his best to kill you till he got hurt himself felt fiercely unnatural a lot of such attempted surrenders never got made machine gunners in particular had a way of dying heroically at their posts yells from the rear told of fresh us troops coming up the confederates still battling in among their foes werent getting reinforcements their barrage hadnt made the us defenders say uncle give up martin shouted to the rebs we got you outnumbered and you aint gonna make it back to your own lines you want to keep breathin throw down what you got for a few seconds he thought that call would do no good the rebs were stubborn bastards hed seen them die in place before but then a sergeant in butternut said hell with it and threw up his hands his example was enough for his comrades who dropped their rifles and whatever other lethal hardware they were holding the us soldiers stripped their prisoners of ammunition grenades and knives and of their pocket watches and cash too none of the confederates said a word about that several of them had us coins and bills in their pockets which argued theyd stripped a prisoner or two themselves hammerschmitt peterson take the rebs back to where they can deal with em martin said the rest of the us soldiers looked enviously at the two men their sergeant had chosen theyd get away from the front and the righting if only for a little while hear tell the food in yankee prisoner camps aint too bad the confederate sergeant whod been first to throw down his tredegar said hopefully as specs peterson and joe hammerschmitt gestured with their bayoneted rifles to get the prisoners of war moving chester martin answered listen rebs ill give you one warning whatever you do dont let em ship you to white sulphur springs the sergeant nodded grateful for the advice then looked puzzled when the us soldiers started laughing come on you lugs peterson said sounding as fierce as any man with glasses could hands still high the confederates shuffled off into captivity youre a regular devil sarge you are paul andersen said as the us soldiers shared out the weapons and other loot theyd got from the rebels four men all wanted a knife with a brass handle made as a knuckleduster they had to go down on their knees and roll dice to decide who got to keep it who me martin said listen how much difference is there really between a prisoner camp and where they sent us you cant do what you want either place now can you hadnt looked at it like that the corporal admitted after a little thought and ill tell you another thing martin said warming to his theme we can joke however goddamn much we want but theyre both better than being at the front this time paul andersen nodded at once xiii u sually scipio or one of the lesser servants looked out from the front windows to see who was coming this time anne colleton did the job herself it would not give the negroes any wrong ideas about her place and theirs in the marshlands scheme of things not when the motorcar she was waiting for had her brother in it she wondered whether she ought to give tom a sisterly hug and a kiss or box his foolish ears for him the first clue shed had that he was anywhere but up in virginia was a telephone call from columbia less than an hour before hed just got off the train hed said and was on his way scipio came up to her tall imposing perfectly formal have you any special suggestions on how we may make your brothers stay as comfortable and pleasant as possible he asked in his pipeorgan voice anne waved him away i leave it in your hands scipio i cant think now maybe ill have some ideas later if i do ill tell you the butler bowed and withdrew since the start of the war hed pulled back even further than usual into the shell of service he wore around himself like armour hed always been a private person even before his training for high service but now it was as if he didnt want anyone having the slightest inkling of what he was thinking or feeling stinking war it oppresses everyone she thought sometimes i wish i were a simple field nigger so i wouldnt have to think about it but even the plantation hands were thinking about the war thinking how they could make money from it by going to work in the factories instead of staying here where they belonged and raising cotton anne sighed even for a field nigger life wasnt simple any more she drew herself straighten all right life wasnt simple up till now shed always revelled in complication and profited from it too nostalgia belonged to the last century if you didnt look ahead you were in trouble then all such worries vanished from her head here came the motorcar kicking up a cloud of dust from the reddirt path that led up to the mansion the negro driver stopped the automobile leaped out of it and got out tom colletons bags then he opened the door to the rear seat and let out tom who handed him a silver coin that sparkled in the sun tom picked up his own bags and carried them to marshlands front door he wouldnt have done that before the war started anne thought and then an instant later with concern more maternal than sisterly hes gotten so thin she hurried to the door scipio somehow got there ahead of her he shared with cats the ability to leave later than you did but to arrive sooner anyhow and without seeming to have crossed the intervening space he opened the door letting in the warm may air and said welcome home captain colle he stopped for a moment looking quite humanly surprised tom colleton wore a single star on each collar tab scipio corrected himself welcome home major colleton anne threw herself into her brothers arms he dropped his bags and squeezed her tight after the joyous hellos and iloveyous and goodtoseeyous anne said indignantly you didnt tell me youve been promoted again tom shrugged weve seen a lot of casualties somebody has to step up and do the work when hed joined the army bare days after war broke out hed put a fancy plume in his hat and gone off gaily like a knight heading out on a crusade now he sounded both tired and altogether matteroffact about his business more like a cabinetmaker than a cavalier he looked tired too his forehead had lines that hadnt been there the year beforehe was eighteen months younger than anneand he carried dark circles under his eyes his cheeks were hollow a long pink scar seamed one of them hesitantly anne reached up to touch it you didnt tell me about this either her brother shrugged again got kissed by a shell fragment battalion doctors assistant sewed it up i didnt lose any duty time so i didnt think it was worth talking about youve changed anne said perhaps more wonderingly than she should have the young man whod gone off to war had been the little brother shed always known witty easygoing not too effectualcertainly not effectual enough to want to put in any work at operating marshlands when his sister seemed happy enough doing it all and that had suited anne fine she rejoiced in the power it gave her but when she looked into the eyes of the lean nearstranger who was her own flesh and blood she didnt know what she saw it flustered her tom had always been so easy to read so predictable scipio scooped up the bags i shall put these in your room sir he said my room tom echoed as if the phrase were in a foreign language slowly he nodded yes go ahead and do that scipio the butler carried the bags into the mansion tom took one step to follow him then stopped still outside very strange he murmured unbelievable what is anne asked she wasnt used to being unable to follow his train of thought that all thistom waved at the marshlands mansionand all thisthe next wave encompassed the many square miles of the marshlands estateis minepart mine excuse me dear sister and excuse me for sounding not quite like my old self for most of the past nine months my horizons have been limited to a hole in the ground and whether thered be enough beans in the pot for my men and me coming back to this is like falling asleep and dreaming youve gone to heaven it should be like waking from a nightmare anne said this is where you live this is where you belong at least for as long as you dont get in my hair while youre here you never used to will you now harder to tell her brothers mouth set in a hard line another expression shed never seen on his face till now im going back to the front in three days time he said his voice flat till the war is done this is the dream and when the war is done its liable to disappear like a dream too what are you talking about of all the people in the world anne should have been able to keep up withto keep ahead ofher brother ever since they were tiny shed been the clever one the dominant one in the family shed taken that so much for granted it had never occurred to her things might change never mind tom stepped past her into the hallway his grin was more like the one shed known though not quite the same feels good to get out of the sun he kept on walking and looked up toward the secondfloor galleries like the grin his chuckle had something new in itrestraint maybe pointing he said still got the funny pictures hanging on the walls do you some of them anne said hed teased her about the exhibition ever since shed had the idea for it marcel duchamp is still here too is he toms lips thinned again do we have any liquor left and how many yellow babies are due that wasnt teasing it was cold contempt one more thing she wasnt used to hearing from him that it matched her own feelings about the frenchman was next to the unaccustomed harshness a small thing she decided taking tom literally might be the best way to defuse the situation theres enough whiskey left for you to have a drink if you want one when her brother nodded she called for scipio as usual he answered the call faster than should have been possible two whiskeys over ice she told him he bowed and disappeared again ice tom said saw plenty of that this past winter not in my drink though he shook himself as if realizing at last he really was away from the trenches of the roanoke valley i heard from jacob not long before i hopped on the train down here hes well or was then i got a letter from him just the other day anne answered he said it looks like the yankees are up to something in kentucky but nobody seems to know what it is or when the storm breaks wont be long now tom said roads should all be dry they can build their supply dumps up to as big as they want them put their reserves in place as soon as theyre ready theyll hit us he spoke again like someone discussing the ins and outs of a business he knew well musingly he went on show probably would have started there already if they hadnt had to pull men to deal with the revolt in utah anne nodded between the mormons and the socialists they have so much trouble inside their own borders it hurts them when they try to fight us she spoke with vindictive relish scipio returned then two tumblers full of amber whiskey gleaming on a silver tray ice clinked gently anne took one drink tom the other she said its not like that here thank god we all stand behind the cause to her amazement her brother threw back his head and laughed this is the dream all right he said and knocked back his whiskey with a flick of the wrist youre not living in the real world thats certain being the object of her brothers scorn angered her who in the confederate states throws bombs and rises up against the government she demanded and then answered her own question no one thats who no tom set the tumbler down hard on the tray scipio still held these past few months theyve executed a couple of dozen niggers in my division alone reds every last one of em outandout reds worse than plain old socialists and mormons put together if you ask me thats not the same as anne began her brother cut her off one more thing he wouldnt have donewouldnt have dared dobefore the war and thats just in my division alone others its been worse and god only knows how deep the rot has spread away from the front ive heard that i dont believe it anne said firmly its not a problem here i can tell you that much when she used that tone of voice it was supposed to make tom shut up and knuckle under it always had in the past it didnt any more everybody says the same thingtill they get their noses rubbed in it he told her a plantation this size if theres not a red cell somewhere on it ill eat my hat he pointed to the brown felt hed hung just inside the door and turned a hard and thoughtful gaze on scipio that was too much for anne tom stop this at once or youll make me sorry youve come home she said scipio has raised both of us since we were babies the idea that he could be a redits disgusting thats the only word i can find for it things change tom colleton swung back toward her he leaned forward a little the implied threat of attack made anne take half a step back before she realized what shed done and her brother did attack though only with words youre the one whos always going on about change its not as much fun as you make it out to be not all the time it isnt and if you think it cant happen right here at marshlands youre deliberately blinding yourself anne stared first at him then at scipio her brothers face was grim and intent scipio showed nothing of what he thought but then he never did anne finished her whiskey then even harder than her brother had done slammed the tumbler down onto the tray the butler was holding a chunk of ice jumped out leaving a little wet trail as it skidded across the polished silver surface get me another drink scipio she kept her voice low but it was brittle with fury even so the butler hurried away when he came back a moment later with the second whiskey she drank it fast too she could feel the liquor building a transparent wall between her and the world but even that numbing could not disguise the fact that her kid brothers homecoming far from being the celebration shed expected looked more like a disaster percy stone was dressed in his flying togs and had his camera by his side but that hadnt kept him from sitting in on a poker game while he waited for jonathan moss to finish getting ready to fly by the expression on his face it hadnt kept him from losing money to lefty the mechanic either he was in good company there almost everybody rash enough to sit down with lefty ended up sadder if not necessarily wiser oh thank godduty calls stone said when moss came in i think id sooner go up there and get shot at than stay here and get skinned amid laughter he studied his cards then tossed a big silver coin into the pot raise a dollar and other one the mechanic named byron tossed in a folded bill two other players threw in their hands with various noises of disgust lefty said ill see those and bump it another three he made his five dollars with a gold halfeagle thats enough for me stone said and folded byron looked harassed but calledand promptly regretted it chuckling lefty scooped up the pot i could have told you not to play cards with lefty moss said as stone picked up the camera and the two fliers walked out to their wright as a matter of fact i have told you not to play cards with lefty its the socialist in me stone answered moss let out a questioning grunt the observer explained i make more money than lefty does but at the poker table we redistribute the wealth he shook his head i wouldnt mind it so much if the redistribution went my way a little more often moss blew air out through his lips with a snuffling noise like a horse im a democrat he said always have been probably always will be if i earn something i figure its mine and i want to keep it i dont much like riots either so socialism was a hard sell for me even before the remembrance day horrors that was pretty bad if you believe what you read in the newspapers stone agreed he lifted the camera into his cockpit then climbed in after it once hed set it in the mount though he added of course if you believe what you read in the newspapers weve already won the war four or five times by now which does make me wonder what the two of us are doing going up in this contraption he slapped the doped linen fabric covering the side of the fuselage it was taut and thumped like a drum he had such a disarming manner to him that even political arguments that could have turned hot and heavy in a hurry got defused earning our salaries so you can give yours to the ground crew moss replied scrambling into the forward cockpit you have less faith in my cardplaying than i do and i didnt think that was possible stone said he whacked the pilot on the shoulder with a length of rubber tubing to which a cheap tin funnel had been attached stick this up to your ear and lets see how it does the rubber tubing was of the sort that ran from the speedometer to the pitot tube out at the far end of the wing moss undid the funnel and stuck it through one ear hole of his flying helmet then fixed it to the tube again stone tossed him another length of rubber tubing with funnel that one moss left in his lap his observer would have the other end pressed to one ear stones voice sounded metallically in his ear can you hear me all right moss spoke into the funnel of the second tube yeah sure down here when its quiet how well do at eight thousand feet with the engine going is liable to be a different ball of wax he chuckled this isnt a whole hell of a lot fancier than tying a couple of tin cans to a string the way we did when we were kids sure isnt stone agreed they dont pay off for looks though not in this mans army they dont if we can make it work somebody elsell make it pretty sooner or later the ground crew men came out to help them get the twoseater started lefty grinned through gibes about bulges in his trousers that had more to do with his financial endowments than his masculine ones he spun the prop the wrights motor buzzed to life at once tachometer gasoline gauge gasolineflow indicator gasoline feed system pressure indicator oil gauge oilpressure gauge radiator temperature indicatorall the instruments were good moss waved to the ground crew men byron and another mechanic a fellow named edwin pulled the chocks away from the wheels moss advanced the throttle the wright bounced down the airstrip after enough bounces it didnt come back to earth percy stones voice sounded in his ear can you hear me he shifted the other tube to his mouth i sure can can you hear me when the observer assured him he could moss went on say this is great we can really talk to each other now percy stone promptly started singing america the beautiful moss made a hasty amendment maybe its not so great after all both young men laughed pleased with their ingenuity more seriously now stone said we have to spread the word about this biggest problem twoseaters have is that the pilot and observer cant talk back and forth ive seen that with us working together moss agreed now that we know pitot tubing makes a good speaking tube we could come up with better earpieces and mouthpieces than these funnels i bet playing with them makes me feel like im home from school on summer vacation thats not bad stone said better than thinking about this like it is school anyway if you flunk here they dont make you take the class over you get expelledfor good yeah moss said it wasnt anything on which he cared to dwell he peered ahead fronts coming up get ready for some hate land over which the american and canadian armies had already fought was barren chewed to shreds as if an insane giant had gnawed on it for a while and then deciding it wasnt to his taste spit it out again over the front itself smoke and dust rose high into the air a legacy of the shelling the two sides kept trading percy stone said youd think wed have fired enough shells by now to kill all the canadians there are by hitting them over the head if no other way dont i wish we had moss said them and the englishmen both british reinforcements for the dominion hadnt come in any great numbers but the ones who had come had stiffened the canucks will to keep fighting in spite of being outnumbered and outgunned by the usa and in spite of being outnumbered and outgunned the canadians were a long way from out for the count as soon as the wilbur flew over the front the canucks proved that they gave the american aeroplane all the hate anyone could want black puffs of smoke filled the sky all around the wright machine the ones that burst close sounded like big mean dogs barking waugh waugh waugh nice to know they love us stone said moss laughed he sped up and slowed down and turned now off to the left of his course now off to the right all in an effort to keep the gunners down on the ground from putting a lucky shell right where the aeroplane would be he had never been sure dodging and changing speed did that much to improve the odds but they couldnt hurt the front hasnt moved much for a while he said sadly hed expected things to pick up with the coming of spring but it hadnt happened yet he knew from seeing the mud back at the aerodrome how thick and clinging it was trying to advance in it was anything but easy the canuck and british offensive south from winnipeg had started off alarmingly well but the enemy proved to have no easier time advancing through muddy broken country than did the americans once he flew past the reach of american artillery the towns and rich farmlands of southern ontario gave him much more attractive things to view than hed had till then the farms glowed green with early growth the canucks not yet at the front were getting in what crops they could even the farmlands though bore scars looking down and seeing the same thing percy stone said theyre digging in for a long fight digging in the canadians and british certainly were trench lines drew dark brown furrows across green fields every mile or so with zigzag communication trenches running back from one set to the next just as in the niagara peninsula if the us army blasted them out of one position theyd fall back to the next and keep on fighting they fight hard too moss said giving the foe grudging respect i go to bed every night getting down on my knees and thanking god for not making me an infantryman ahhmen percy stone sang out as if at the end of a hymn then in an entirely different tone of voice he said jesus he amplified that bandit on our tail and diving on us moss swung the wrights nose up till the aeroplane almost stalled then rolled hard to the right trying to slip away from the pursuer he hadnt seen fear and excitement ran through his body a jolt stronger than proof rum the rum wouldnt kill you even if come the next morning you wished it had the enemy though he thanked god for the speaking tube without it stone would have had the devils own time warning him they had company in the sky they werent supposed to have had company the enemys aeroplane force was supposed to have been so beaten down oneaeroplane missions were allowed again like a lot of things that were supposed to have happened that one hadnt he gave the aeroplane full throttle swinging through a quick circle in the sky to try and get on the foes tail instead of the other way round acceleration and centrifugal force threw him around in the cockpit halfway through the turn he got his first glimpse of the enemy bus an avro an aeroplane whose performance closely matched the wilburs the canadian pilotor maybe for all moss knew he was an englishmanrolled through a manoeuvre like his own so the two flying machines turned away from each other behind him percy stone squeezed off a burst with his machine gun the avros observer fired back moss saw flame burst from the muzzle of the enemy machine gun tracers sparked across the open empty air thwump thwump thwump bullets punched through fuselage fabric sounding like flung stones off a tightly stretched awning stones fire abruptly ceased im hit sounded tinnily in moss ear he couldnt answer for a moment he needed both hands to twist the aeroplane through a roll that had earth and sky twisting dizzily all around him where was the avro were more enemy aeroplanes in the sky with his observer wounded he couldnt fight back he wished again for the super hudson he wasnt flying any more of course had he been in that bus the bullets might have gone through him not stone his head swivelled wildly as he levelled off and scooted back toward the american lines his altimeter was still unwinding it hadnt been able to keep up with his dizzying dive he didnt need it to tell him hed shed several thousand feet his ears ached dully theyd popped several times in the descent but like the altimeter hadnt caught up with the rest of him he didnt see any canucks or limeys grabbing the speaking tube he shouted into it percy you there how bad are you one in the side one ricocheted off the damn camera and nicked me in the leg stone answered a moment later another word dragged from him hurts moss flew straight and level sacrificing everything for speed till tracer bullets zipped past the wright then he began dodging and swerving again you couldnt outrun a bullet your best hope was to evade one behind him the observers machine gun started chattering he had no idea how accurately percy stone was firing that he was firing at all seemed a good sign but tracers were coming from more than one direction which by un pleasant logic meant he had more than one aeroplane on his tail that wasnt a good sign anything you did to evade one was liable to bring you right under the gun of another and then like angels with flaming swords a flight of american aeroplanes dove on the canucks or limeys who went from pursuers to pursued in seconds theyre breaking away stone said moss didnt like how quiet and tired he sounded he should have been screaming for joy leaning forward to pound his pilot on the back straight and level that was the answer get stone to a sawbones on the double enemy antiaircraft gunners sent up a storm of hate as moss flew over the front line he didnt waste time on evasive action not now odds werent so good as if hed been dodging all over the landscape but they were still on his side he got away with it almost home percy he said stone didnt answer moss looked back over his shoulder the observer was slumped to one side his eyes closed moss tried to fly even faster but the wilbur was already going flat out he landed at as high a speed as he could using the whole airstrip and taxiing to a stop close to the barracks he was waving for help before the aeroplane stopped rolling as soon as it did he scrambled back into the observers cockpit blood was everywhere back there on the walls on the seat on the floor on the cameraand on percy stones flying togs moss yanked back the observers sleeve and jabbed his finger down on the inside of stones wrist he let out a whoop when he felt a pulse hurry up dammit he shouted hes hurt bad by then the ground crew were already at the bus they had a stretcher with them lefty helped moss unbuckle stone and get his limp weight out of the cockpit and down to the ground cant let him die the mechanic said i need his money if he was kidding he was kidding on the square he and byron rushed stone away jonathan moss looked down at him self his friends blood was on his flight suit on his boots on his hands wearily he trudged in to make his report to captain franklin no pictures to develop not today stone had got hit before he had the chance to take any and the camera looked to be hors de combat too somebody brought him a whiskey he gulped it down without tasting or feeling it after what seemed a very long time the telephone jangled lefty got it before moss could even move from his chair yeah the mechanic said and again yeah all right good thanks he hung up then turned to moss collapsed lung and hes lost a lot of blood but they think hes gonna pull through thank god moss said and fell asleep where he sat stephen ramsay sipped coffee from a tin cup then said captain lincoln sir aint this a hell of a war ive been a cavalryman a long time when we got into okmulgee here i didnt mind fighting like a dragoon on account of thats what you got to do when you fight in builtup country but now theyve dragooned us into the infantry and its not even the confederate states infantry well not exactly he amended youre the captain now ramsay lincoln said ill have you remember im a colonel these days his hand went to his collar he didnt wear the three bars of a confederate captain any more or the three stars of a confederate colonel either instead he had two red costumejewellery jewels the newly devised insigne for a colonel in the equally newly devised creek nation army ramsay had shed his sergeants stripes too he wore one red costumejewellery jewel on either side of his collar both he and lincoln also had red armbands on the left sleeves of their tunics other than that they unlike the soldiers they were now commanding retained ordinary confederate uniform captain me ramsay snorted doesnt seem real he drank some more coffee it was hot and strong past that he couldnt think of anything good to say about it after swallowing he went on last time i got paid though it was a captains money so i cant kick about that same herei got a colonels money lincoln said and were earning what they pay us by god do you doubt it when you put it that way no sir ramsay laughed a little crazy how things work out isnt it we were the first white soldiers in town we helped the creeks throw back the damnyankees so chief fixico figures were the ones to turn his braves into real soldiers under his breath he added stupid damn rank badges anyone wants to know i told him the same thing lincoln s chuckle was wry they turned out to be his idea so were stuck with them as long as we do this job he shrugged i hear tell english officers when they get hired to bring an indian maharajahs militia up to snufftheir kind of indian i mean not oursthey have to wear the nativestyle uniform too it could be worsethey could have put us in war paint and feathers creeks dont seem to go in for that kind of thing much ramsay said you look around at this placethe way it was before the fighting started anywayand it could be anybodys town you wouldnt know reduh indianshad built it you had to be careful about saying redskins hereabouts the indians didnt like it for beans ramsay had the idea negroes didnt like being called niggers either but he didnt let that stop him it was different with the creeks though they werent just hewers of wood and drawers of water by law and by treaty they were every bit as much confederate citizens as he was up till manumission theyd kept slaves of their own captain ramsay that was moty tiger probablyno certainlythe best sergeant ramsay had he was the young fellow whod apologized to ramsay when he suddenly got a lesson in what foxholes were worth now his broad bronze face was worried when moty tiger worried ramsay figured he ought to worry too whats up moty he asked getting to his feet ive got a discipline problem captain the creek sergeant said carefully well lets see what we can do about that ramsay said the indian with the picturesque name turned and led him down the trench presumably toward whoever was involved in the discipline problem ramsay kicked at the muddy dirt as he followed the creek nation armyboth regiments of ithad an inordinate number of discipline problems part of that was because the men had been under military discipline for only a few weeks they chafed under it like barely broken horses and part of it was that they were indians and maybe less used to taking orders from anybody than a like number of whites would have been they particularly didnt like taking orders from their own people they accepted it better from their white officers ramsay didnt think that was because he was white as he would have if he were dealing with negroes but the creeks seemed to figure that as a real live working soldier he knew what he was doing whereas to them their noncoms were the same kind of amateurs they were tenshun moty tiger called as he came up to the knot of indians gathered around a fire the creeks got to their feet not with the alacrity confederate regulars would have shown but fast enough that ramsay couldnt gig them about it in lieu of uniforms which hadnt arrived yet from back east they wore denim pants flannel shirts with red armbands like ramsays and a variety of slouch hats all right whats going on here ramsay asked with something close to genuine curiosity he gave me the shit duty again one of the creeks exclaimed somebodys got to have it perryman ramsay said we dont take the honey buckets to the pit and cover it up wed get even worse stinks than we have already and wed start getting sick before long too no way to keep clean or anything close to it but weve got to do what we can those damn buckets are disgusting perryman said hauling them is nigger work not soldier work mike we aint got no niggers here moty tiger said more patiently than ramsay would have expected all we got is us and if we dont do it nobody will and its your turn is it your turn ramsay asked mike perryman there was always the chance moty tiger was picking on his fellow indian which would have to be stopped if it was happening but reluctantly perryman nodded then youve got to do the job ramsay told him ive done it myself on manoeuvres and out in the field take em to the pit fling em in cover everything up and then you can pretend it never happened you really did that perryman asked his black eyes scanning ramsays face searching for a lie but it was the truth ramsay nodded with a clear conscience youre a soldier now he said this isnt a lark and it isnt a game it isnt pretty it isnt a whole lot of fun but its what needs doing soare you going to be a soldier or are you going to be an old soldier somebody whos always complaining and carrying on when hes got no cause to you said yourself your sergeant wasnt being unfair if you dont do the job somebody else will have to and that wouldnt be fair to the rest of the men in your squad he waited to see what would happen he didnt want to have to punish mike perryman hed already seen that punishment didnt work as well with the creeks as it did with white soldiers the indians only resented you more perryman muttered something ramsay only half heard he didnt think it was in english that was liable to be just as well if he didnt understand it he didnt have to notice it but then slowly and with nothing like enthusiasm or even resignation the creek got to his feet and headed off to the latrine bay dug out from the main trench nobody watched him as he carried the buckets off to the disposal pit nobody watched him bring them back eithermore courtesy than white soldiers would have shown one of their comrades in the same fix thank you captain moty tiger said quietly as the two of them walked back toward where ramsay had been drinking his coffee youre welcome ramsay answered you were right so i backed you up before too long everybody will have the idea and you wont need me to back you up i shouldnt have this time the creek sounded angry at himself as an old sergeant himself ramsay understood that but things were different here from the way they were in the confederate army or any other longestablished force next time or maybe the time after that everything will go smooth ramsay said what you want to do is thisyou want to make sure they do what you tell em before the damnyankees try another push into okmulgee thatll keep a lot more of em alive whether theyre smart enough to know it or not they wont thank you for it but theyll be here i understand the creek sergeant said he hesitated then asked if the united states soldiers do attack here can we hold them back weve got the creek nation army weve got some good texas infantry weve got artillery back of town and over in the hills ramsay said and then because honesty compelled him damned if i know depends on how hard the yankees push things attacking costs more than defending but theyve got more men than we do too moty tiger nodded soberly this is not war the way we creeks talk of war this is not warrior against warrior it is a whole nation throwing itself at another nation it does not bring men glory or fame it uses them up and it buries them and then it reaches out and uses more youre only wrong about one thing ramsay said the indian looked a question at him he explained a lot of the time this here war doesnt bother with buryin the men it uses up moty tiger pondered that he showed his teeth in a grimace of pain but didnt argue with ramsay instead after a grave nod he turned around and went back down the trench back toward his squad they and heand ramsayhadnt been used up yet the train shuddered to a stop paul mantarakis conscious that the two dark green stripes on the sleeve of his tunic meant he had more important work to do and that he had to do it under more important eyes than before said my squad get ready to pile on out soldiers stirred on the floor of the boxcar not so long ago it had been carrying horses the strong smell lingered some of the farm boys found it soothing as far as paul was concerned that was their problem not his they grabbed their rifles made sure they had all their gear and grunted as they slung their packs onto their backs not far away gordon mcsweeney also sporting corporals stripes was telling his squad properly speaking these mormons are not even christians they will go to hell regardless of whether we shoot them down or they die in bed spare not the rod then for not only are they heretics they are rebels in arms against the united states of america lieutenant norman hinshaw was talking to the whole platoon we have to root out these bandits and rebels and bring utah back under the stars and stripes remember most of the people we come across will be loyal americans only a handful have sold themselves to the canucks and the rebs and theyre the ones causing all the trouble once we get rid of them utah should be a peaceable state just like all the others he paused to let that sink in then went on when they first hatched their plot these mormon madmen blew up the railroad line right at the border and seized the weapons in every arsenal in the state now weve pushed more than halfway to salt lake city the town ahead of us is called price well take it repair the tracks and move on he didnt ask for questions he worked the latch on the boxcar door and slid it open lets go after so long cooped up on the train mantarakis eyes filled with tears when he stepped out into bright sunshine the first breath of fresh air told him he wasnt in kentucky any more or in philadelphia either it was hot and dry with an alkaline tang to it it wasnt summer yet but it felt that way ahead westwardand to the north he saw forested mountains in the distance a nearer line of green marked the price river but the land where he was standing had only scattered sagebrush and tumbleweeds and other desert plants on it all it needed was the bleached skull of an ox to make it the perfect picture of an arid waste this is the abomination of the desolation as was spoken of in the book of daniel mcsweeney said and mantarakis for once was not inclined to disagree the boxcar from which theyd emerged was one of dozens hundreds carrying the two divisions pulled out of kentucky to their new theatre of operations they unloaded men horses mules wagons trucks gunsall the tools needed to wage war in the modern age and to keep on waging it in country like this where they would be hard pressed to draw supplies from the land every officer of captains rank or higher was running around with a list and a pencil checking things off as fast as he could in an amazingly short time what had been two entrained divisions turned into two divisions ready for action in spite of himself paul was impressed soldiers spent a lot of time groaning about officers but every now and then they showed what they were worth dust puffed up under mantarakis boots as he marched along dust hovered all around the thousands of marching men it held a stronger dose of the alkaline tang hed noticed before how the devil were you supposed to raise crops on soil like this plainly the mormons did it he marched past a big farmhouse of a sort hed never seen before it looked to be made of rammed earth in a country where it rained more often a house like that would fall apart pretty damn quick this one looked to have been standing for a generation maybe two it stood open now so did the barn alongside whoever had lived here didnt want to stick around and greet the united states army with a big smile and an american flag they like the rebels mantarakis thought not very happy with the idea if only a handful of people were in revolt why had the squad run across some of them so soon then ahead and off to the right the familiar poppoppop of gunfire rang out we will move to the firing to support our soldiers under attack lieutenant hinshaw proclaimed the whole platoonthe whole companydid just that the mormons were holed up in another farmhouse it had a big flag flying above it on what had to be a makeshift pole paul couldnt make out what the flag was but it wasnt the stars and stripes he saw muzzle flashes from several windows the mormons were putting a lot of lead in the air doing their best to hold the us troops at bay they hadnt built the place for defense though the barn offered one avenue blind to them for soldiers to approach the well and the haystacks and the outhouse gave other approaches before long mantarakis whole company was peppering the farmhouse from pretty short range a machine gun came up and started rattling away dust flew from the adobe as bullets stitched back and forth its pole clipped the flag fell in the dirt in front of the house mantarakis and his comrades cheered lets go lieutenant hinshaw shouted under cover of the machine gun he rushed toward the farmhouse mantarakis and the rest of his squad followed so did mcsweeney and his men if an officer had the guts to go out there you couldnt let him go by himself a bullet whistled past pauls headnot everybody in the farmhouse was down the machine gun blasted away at the window from which the shot had come paul trampled on the fallen flagit was he saw a beehive with the word deseret beneath iton the way to the front door along with several men he hammered at it with the butt of his rifle someone inside fired through the door a us soldier fell with a groan then the door went down soldiers were already clambering into the house through the windows mantarakis rushed in somebody shot at him from pointblank rangeand missed after a last fusillade of firing silence fell only us soldiers were left alive in there of the mormon defenders five had been men and two women they had all had rifles and had all known what to do with them mantarakis had seen plenty of death but never till now a woman in a white shirtwaist with pearl buttons and a long black skirtand with half her head blown away he turned away a little sickened they fought hardern the rebs ever did he muttered fanatics lieutenant hinshaw said this is what they warned us about these nests of maniacs but most of the people are loyal to the usa well see that when we get into price come on men he led his soldiers outside once out there he picked up the mormons flag spoil of war now on with the advance if the people of price utah were loyal to the united states nobody had bothered telling them about it they had a trench line just east of town and defended it ferociously till machinegun and artillery fire drove them back in amongst the buildings but when the us soldiers tried to advance into price rifle fire and a couple of mormon machine guns hurled them back with heavy losses looks like were going to be in the next wave mantarakis told his squad unhappily hed become numbed to the prospect of charging straight ahead at the enemys line that was how first army operated but the divisional commander showed a little more imagination than general custer ever had instead of drowning price in us blood he decided to shell it into ruins back of the us line more artillery unlimbered and started bellowing away the mormons had machine guns but evidently no cannon of their own a great cloud of smoke and dust rose above the utah town in an abstract way mantarakis sympathized with the mormons whod been stupid enough to rise up against the might of the united states hed had artillery barrages come down on his position only too often he knew what being under one of them was like he hoped though that this one would be so stunning so deadly that the defenders would be either blown to bits or too battered to fight back after the barrage let up his neck would be on the line it went on for three hours when it stopped whistles blew ordering the us soldiers forward paul came up out of the foxhole in which hed crouched and sprinted toward the outskirts of price he hadnt gone fifty yards before a mormon machine gun started stuttering out death after that he didnt run any more he scrambled from one piece of cover to the next firing as he went so did the men with him theyd learned in a hard school he didnt know where the mormons had learned wherever it was theyd earned high marks they defended every ruined store and pile of rubble as if losing it meant losing the war they wouldnt retreat they wouldnt surrender sometimes they would hold their fire till a party of us soldiers had gone by then shoot at them from behind blazing away with no hope of escape until they were either dead or too badly wounded to hold a rifle men women children down to about the age of eightevery mormon in pricefought and fought to the death every smashed house had to be combed through room by room every cellar checked for lurkers with guns it was a grimmer bloodier more expensive nightmare than paul had ever imagined he crouched down behind tumbled boards that had probably once been a false front and lighted a cigarette a moment later gordon mcsweeney took cover with him tobacco is a filthy weed mcsweeney said as far as mantarakis could see the big scotsman disapproved of everything im not making you smoke it he pointed out he blew a stream of smoke toward the little patch of price to which the mormons still clung still think this is just a few fanatics fighting us if the rest of utah is anything like this the next mormon who likes us will be the first you may be right about that mcsweeney said but what if you are i keep telling you the mormons will burn in hell regardless of what they do here on earth thanks a lot gordon mantarakis muttered mcsweeney didnt see it but to him fighting a whole bunch of people who all hated you was different from fighting fanatics who hated you hidden among people who mostly didnt if all the mormons hated the us government what did that make them when they rose up against it patriots whatever it made them it made them dangerous a couple of bullets snapped by too close for comfort paul stubbed out his cigarette on a rock made sure he had a full clip in his springfield and went back to clearing the mormons out of price sylvia enos looked at her husband in dismay are you sure this is what you should do she asked in lieu of screaming are you out of your mind you havent been home long enough to be sure of anything im sure of this he answered and she could hear he meant it but being sure wasnt the same as being right cant you wait a little longer before you join the navy sylvia knew she was pleading she didnt care would you rather i signed up on a fishing boat george asked sylvia flinched by way of answering the confederates the canadians and the british had sown georges bank and the other fishing waters around boston full of mines not a week went by when a boat didnt blow up if another boat was nearby it sometimes brought back survivors more often than not though the only way you knewor thought you knewa fishing boat had hit a mine was when it didnt come back to t wharf id rather you didnt put to sea at all sylvia said it was about the worst thing a fishermans wife could tell her man sylvia knew that and said it anyhow she was listening to george jr and mary jane snoring in their bedroom they were both getting over colds with their heads full of snot they counted for something too she went on id rather you stayed ashore is what id rather he didnt get angry as shed expected he would he just shook his head in absolute rejection i had a lot of time to think about this down in the camp in rebel country nobody on land would hire me fishing is all i know theyll take any bodies they can get sylvia shot back i didnt know anything to speak of and they hired me yeah but conscription wont drag you into the army like it will me george answered i wouldnt last a month before the letter came if im going to go fight id rather do it on the water i thought about that too i thought real hard sylvia didnt have a good comeback shed already had a cousin wounded the army seized men and mangled themthat was the sense you got when you scanned the casualty lists every day anyhow she let out a sad defeated sigh you were gone so long you had to make friends with your children all over again after you got off the train how long will you be away if you join the navy years at a time maybe stay here a while he shook his head again and live off the money youre making thats not anything for a man to do i know you had to get work while i was gone you had to keep bread on the table but i feel useless sitting around here if im in the navy theyll send part of my pay home every month to help you and the kids out thats a better bargain pride she said bitterly as if it were a dirty word as far as she was concerned it was mens pride along with the childrens snores she heard the relentless ticking of the alarm clock from the bedroom she now shared once more with her husband shared now but for how long every tick meant a second less she did not have that many ticks to spare what good is it if it werent for mens pride we wouldnt have this war i dont know anything about that george told her all i know is i didnt like what the rebs did to mei sure as the devil didnt like them murdering poor lucas phelpsand im going to give some of it back to them when i get the chance that was mens pride too but what point to saying so he got me so im going to get him back you heard it in the schoolyards on the streets you saw it in feuds between fishing captains feuds that sometimes ended up fought out with broken bottles or with pistols and here was a war throwing half the world into the fire he got me so im going to get him back i wish i were a heathen chinese sylvia said they have better sense than to mix themselves up in such foolishness no they dont her husband answered theyre on the rebs side same as the japs are i remember one of the guards gloating about it and about all the people china has and captain odonnell he looked at that confederate and he said yeah and all of em put together aint worth a regiment of united states marines in a scrap that reb he was angry but he didnt know what to say captain odonnell the light that went on in sylvias head was brighter than the gas lamps that lit their apartment it blazed like an electric light you spent all that time down there in north carolina listening to him hes the reason you want to join the navy so bad when george didnt answer right away she knew shed hit that one on the nose at last slowly he said we talked about it sure but i wouldnt say i made up my mind just on account of him you wouldnt say that does that mean its not true when she had him he folded up to his credit he didnt usually bluff and bluster the way so many men did he took her by surprise by not folding up now it wasnt just the captain he insisted like i said a lot of it was the way the rebs treated us down there like we were dirt because we came from the usa they shot poor lucas and what they did to charlie white hes joining the navy too for all i know he may have signed up alreadyi havent seen him past couple of days that surprised sylvia too in a different way she said i didnt know they let colored people into the navy not in the army no george said but in the navy they do even back in the war of secession they did coalheavers cooks that kind of thing the way charlie is with a frying pan hed get himself whatever rank they give number one cooks in no thin flat sylvia had no great use for negroes in general but charlie wasnt a negro in general he was a negro in particular and somebody who fed her husband at least as often as she did she saw him more as a man and less as a colored man than anyone else of his race shed ever knownnot that that took in any great sample of boston s negro community i can see why charlie would want revenge but she said and then stopped in dismay at her own words he got me so im going to get him back god in heaven where did it end like i said we all owe the rebs george said sensing her hesitation and me joining the navy is the best i can do safer than being a fisherman these days safer than being in the army by a long shot if i sit idle or if i get a land job the army hooks me sure if you looked at things logically what he said made good sense sylvia didnt want to look at things logically what she wanted now that george was home at last was for him to stay home he didnt want to stay home even if he had reasons for not wanting to stay home it still hurt she put her face in her hands and started to cry shed kept up a strong front for the children for so long that when the dam finally broke it broke wide open honey cut that out george sounded nervous almost alarmed sylvia didnt cry very often and he didnt know how to cope when she did helplessly he went on it doesnt do any good he was right but sylvia couldnt stop you just came back and now youregoing away again she sobbed that was it in a nub george slid closer on the sofa he reached out awkwardly to stroke her wet cheek his hand wasnt so hard and rough as it had been before the rebs captured him whatever theyd had him doing down there in the prison camp it was easier than fishing itll be all right he said and put his arm around her they ended up in the bedroom not much later since hed come home theyd made love more than they had even when they were first married sylvia had joked about pausing to take an occasional look at the floor because all she ever saw was the ceiling this had more a feel of desperation to it even when she gasped and quivered as powerfully as she ever had in her life fear as much as healthy excitement drove her to that height and afterwards lying there spent in the darkness beside her husband she realized making love didnt do any more good than crying did when you were done the world hadnt changed a bit god damn the war she whispered as she got up to put on her nightgown george didnt hear her he was already breathing the deep regular breaths of sleep she lay down beside him she knew she had to go to the canning plant in the morning but lay a long time awake even so ugly as a drunk white man with a chunk of firewood in his hand looking for a negro to beat on the barge made its slow way up to the covington wharf unlike a drunk white man though it was in full and complete control the fellow piloting it was a master in fact cincinnatus had never seen anybody do a better job of easing such an ungainly craft into place the army men on board threw lines up to a couple of roustabouts on the wharf even before the barge was fully fast they ran a gangplank up to the wharf too that was what lieutenant kennan had been waiting for all right you lazy niggers he shouted to the work gang of which cincinnatus was a part you been lollygagging long enough now get your black asses down there and get to work two men to a crate thats what my order says and thats how were gonna do it move god damn you lord have mercy said a grayhaired negro named herodotus i been workin doin bard work since slavery days an i didnt never have no overseer with as mean a mouth as that yankee watch out he dont hear you cincinnatus warned though the other negro being no ones fool had kept his voice down aint just his mouth thats mean hed just as soon kick a black man as look at him along with the rest of the work crew he and herodotus went down into the barge the crates they were to unload were a funny shape as long as a man but only a foot or so high and wide they were of more solid wood than the usual run of box and bound with iron straps too whatever was in there the people back in the usa whod packed it didnt want it coming out each crate had neatly stencilled on it battery f and below that disin fection cincinnatus scratched his head you put those two together they didnt make a whole lot of sense but then you could say that about a whole lot of things hed seen since the war started he and herodotus lifted a crate it was heavy enough to need two men on it sure enough you niggers want to watch out what youre doin lieutenant kennan said as they started up the gangplank anybody who drops one of these here crates he doesnt just get his ass fired he gets himself blacklistedno work at all for him and you want to know what i think about that i hope the fucker starves and all the little pickaninnies hes spawned too give that man a whip and put him in the cotton field he get five hundred bales to the acre herodotus said yeah till one fine mornin they find him with his head broke in and what a shame nobody knows who done it cincinnatus said wouldnt take long neither herodotus nodded that sort of thing happened every so often but lieutenant kennan had more than a whip to back him up he had the united states army on his side if anything happened to him the yankees would take hostages and shoot them that had happened before too cincinnatus and herodotus loaded the long narrow crate into the back of a motor truck whatever it was that said it had a certain amount of importance because things that werent of high priority got hauled to the front in horsedrawn wagons more than the usual number of us soldiers were standing around the trucks too keeping an eye on the loading but not of course deigning to help with what they like whites in the csa called nigger work back and forth back and forth back and forth cincinnatus was glad he was wearing leather gloves his hands were hard but the rough boards of the crates would have torn them up anyhow he didnt want to stop for the dinner break hed got into a rhythm pausing to eat took him out of it when you were working like a machine that happened sometimes but stop he did if you didnt take whatever breaks the yankees doled out to you they were liable to figure you didnt need em and not dole out any they were nasty in a more efficient coldblooded way than confederate whites sure enough when he went back to work after his sowbelly and greens and his canteen full of cold coffee he needed a while to get used to things again and he never did quite find the trancelike state in which hed been working before dinner thinking about what he was doing made the afternoon seem to last three times as long as the morning had about halfway through the afternoon another big barge came across the river from cincinnati it too was loaded almost to the wallowing point with long skinny crates stencilled battery f and disinfection as the negro labourers unloaded the crates us soldiers strung up electric lamps so another crew could eventually replace them and keep working through the night herodotus raised an eyebrow aint never seen em do that before he said cincinnatus nodded he hadnt seen them do that before either at last lieutenant kennan shouted all right nigs knock off anybody back here even one minute later than seven oclock tomorrow morning he can kiss my ass but he still wont get any work go on now get the hell out and well put some fresh mules on the job thats how he thinks of usmules cincinnatus said as he and herodotus lined up to get their days pay cincinnatus knew hed busted his hump but kennan wasnt handing out fiftycent bonuses to anybody not today mus be his time of the month herodotus said hes sure enough cranky like that some of the work gang stood at the trolley stop and waited for a ride back to the negro district of covington othersmen who saved every nickelleft them with waves and weary calls of see you in the mornin and started walking south away from the ohio cincinnatus was one of those he hadnt ridden the trolley since he found out elizabeth was in a family way a little south of downtown he peeled off from the group of labourers got to buy me some new laces for my shoes he said got so many knots holding these ones together its like puttin rocks in my shoes you could pick a better place herodotus said conroy therehe pointed to the name on the awning above the storefronthe dont like black folks much feldman down the street hes a better bet i aint never had no trouble with conroy an hes cheaper to buy from than the jew cincinnatus answered herodotus shrugged waved and kept on walking conroys general store was typical of the breed the proprietor a big redfaced fellow with a formidable grizzled mustache and a wad of tobacco in one cheek looked a lot more pregnant than elizabeth did he had dry goods at the right of the store yard goods at the back groceries to the left with barrels of flour sugar and crackers in front of his counter cigars and candy reposed in glass jars on the counter a white man and a couple of white women were in the store cincinnatus took off his cap and waited till conroy served them another white man came in after cincinnatus but before the storekeeper was done taking care of the others he got served ahead of cincinnatus too at last the labourers turn came the storekeeper got him three pairs of shoelaces and gave back ninety cents change on the days dollar cincinnatus handed him some of the coins were confederate others us seen somethin interesting cincinnatus remarked making sure conroy hadnt shortchanged him casually as if it were no particular import and for all he knew it wasnt he described the unending loads of crates hed hauled all day long and the curious words on them conroy tugged at one end of his mustache that a fact he said well youre right mebbe that is interesting he spat and fell a little short of the cuspidor by the brown stains on the pale pine boards near the spittoon he missed a good deal of the time with ninety cents in change clinking in his pocket cincinnatus irrationally felt richer than he had with a single silver cartwheel he got out of the store as fast as he could passing the time of day like that with a white man felt unnatural to him and by conroys attitude to the storekeeper as well when he got home elizabeth had a stew of chicken and okra and rice waiting for him i was startin to be worried about you she said and then yawned shed been tired all the time since she was expecting but she hadnt worked any less with everything more expensive because of war and occupation she couldnt afford that put in some extra time cincinnatus explained didnt get any extra money for it but i didnt have no choice neither and afterwards i stopped by conroys bought me some shoelaces did you elizabeth said and let out a long sigh dear god i wish we didnt have to have nothin to do with conroy or any of the other people still spyin for the csa up here lord have mercy so do i cincinnatus said but after we didnt give tom kennedy to the yankees they got themselves a hold on us no good will come of it elizabeth predicted gloomily no good at all cincinnatus couldnt argue and didnt try while kennedy was in the house hed had the upper hand on the white man once kennedy had left though despite whatever profuse thanks he gave the upper hand was his again because he could blackmail cincinnatus and elizabeth threatening to let us authorities know what theyd done he hadnt ever made that threat but when he asked cincinnatus to let conroy the storekeeper know about anything intriguing he picked up on the wharfs his former driver didnt see how he could say no besides the shoelaces why did you stop by conroys elizabeth asked him he explained his wife nodded thats peculiar it sure is did conroy say anything about it when you told him not a word cincinnatus answered but he wouldnt if i dont know it i cant blab it thats so elizabeth said what do you suppose is in them crates no way to know he replied but i expect well find out xiv lucien galtier looked up in the sky with something like approval winters were long winters were hard they wore at a man it seemed he never saw the sun for weeks at a time but spring when it finally burgeoned made up for that at least until winter came again fluffy white clouds drifted from west to east their shadows sailing across the farmland like clipper ships across a smooth sea the weatherhe paused to thank godhad been very good this year true from time to time there were americans on the road in trucks or on horseback or in long columns afoot but god didnt take care of all the little details in your life you had to do some of the work for yourself if the farm survived the ravages of rabbits and rats and insects it was likely to survive the ravages of americans too here came georges running up the path that separated potatoes on the one side from rye on the other papa he called and waved when lucien straightened up from weeding the potato plot papa father pascal is back at the house with an american officer and they want to see you calisse galtier said hed been so engrossed in his hoeing hed paid no attention to traffic on the road for a while now he put the hoe up on his shoulder as if it were a rifle well if they want to see me then see me they shall it is an invitation i cannot refuse not so his younger sons eyes twinkled they want to see you but they did not bother to ask if you wanted to see them georges said with gallic precision they do not care they have no reason to care they are the authorities and i i am but a farmer of the humblest sort lucien sounded too humble to be quite convincing but that was what happened when you took on an unfamiliar role and as he had said whether he wanted to see them was an irrelevance he tramped back toward the farmhouse georges running ahead to let the important visitors know he was coming father pascal and the american officer whoever he was had come in the priests buggy the horse bent its head down to crop grass by the rail to which it was tethered seeing the buggy relieved galtiers mind he would have thought senility closing in on him had he missed the noisy arrival of a motorcar inside marie and nicole had already presented the priest and the officerhe was lucien saw the heavyset major with whom father pascal had been talking when galtier first went into riviereduloup not long after the americans arrivedwith coffee and cakes he would have been astonished had his wife and eldest daughter done anything less even if your guests going would have been more welcome than their coming you had duties as a host or hostess here he is father pascal said rising from the sofa with a wide smile on his smooth plump face allow me to present to you the truly excellent husbandman lucien galtier lucien i have brought here major jedediah quigley enchante monsieur galtier quigley said in the elegant parisian french lucien had heard him using up in town father pascal has been loud in singing your praises he honors me far beyond my poor worth galtier replied wishing the priest had chosen to throw himself into the st lawrence rather than praising him to the occupying authorities the less notice he attracted from them the happier he was you are a modest man father pascal said this is the mark of a godly man a christian man of solid virtue i have also taken the liberty of passing on to major quigley your generous willingness to inform me of anyone who misunderstood my role in the situation as it is galtier spread his hands they were hard and rough with callused palms and dirt under his nails and ground into the folds of skin at each knuckle i am desolate father that i have had nothing of which to inform you spring is a busy season for a farmer and i have had little to do with anyone of late galtier lucien major quigley took a piece of paper from one of the many pockets with which his uniform was adorned from another pocket he drew a pair of steelrimmed spectacles which he set on his nose he unfolded the paper and studied it for a moment ah yes i regret that the requisitions drawn from this farm were so heavy last winter i should not be surprised if it turned out that the soldiers who carried out the program did so with an excess of zeal as a result you must think less than kind thoughts of the american military government for this district major in a war each side does what it can to win galtier answered with a shrug i am not a soldier now but you must know i served my time i know these things he chose his words with great care this american major who talked like a parisian aristocrat was liable to be as dangerous as half a dozen of the likes of father pascal quigley folded up the paper and put it in his pocket he got out a pipe a pouch of tobacco and a match safe after a glance toward marie for permission he lit the pipe once it was drawing well he spoke in musing tones i am confident that when requisition time comes round again it will be easier to restrain the enthusiasm of the soldiers carrying out their duties not it may be easier to restrain them if you cooperate most men trying to establish such cooperation would have spelled out the terms of the bargain to be struck that was how father pascal operated for instance not major quigley he started at the point of assuming cooperation and went on from there a man to reckon with indeed and of course it would be impossible to keep the neighbors from learning he and father pascal had been here some of them would assume that alone meant lucien was collaborating with the americans why else would the major and the priest have come keeping his good name was going to take galtier some work he wanted to glance over at marie to see what she was thinking a winter free of requisitionsor anything close to thatwould all but guarantee a successful year a full belly peace of mind against what was in essence robbery at gunpointthose were not small items on the balance sheet provided he grew a beard so he did not have to look at himself in the mirror when he shaved every morning but looking at yourself in the mirror was not a small item either as i say major i am only a farmer and spend most of my time here on my land i am not a man who often hears things of any sortcertainly not scandal and slander spoken about the pious father here no eh father pascal led me to believe it might be otherwise what a pity major quigley said he didnt snarl and bluster at lucien he didnt turn and glower at father pascal either he just spread his hands such is life he got to his feet which meant the priest also had to rise hastily major quigley bowed to marie thank you madame galtier for your generous hospitality we shall not take up any more of your time or of your husbandshe is as he says a busy man he didnt even warn galtier that the requisitions instead of being extra gentle when harvest time came around would be extra harsh if lucien couldnt figure that out for himself hed learn come fall but lucien knew perfectly well what would happen come fall he also knew hed have to spend almost as much time working to make the farm seem poor as he would making sure it really wasnt as the major with the strange christian name had said that was life major quigley climbed into the buggy father pascal untied his horse then joined the american soldier the priest was expostulating violently and gesturing with such passion he could hardly handle the reins but the horse must have been used to his theatrics it turned around and started back up the road toward riviereduloup lucien galtier sighed now he did turn to marie wondering if she was going to shout at him for guaranteeing the whole family a harder time when autumn rolled around instead she ran to him and squeezed the breath out of him with the tightest embrace shed given him outside the bedroom in years a moment later nicole and georges piled onto him too and after that his three younger daughters who must have been listening somewhere out of sight only his son charles busy in the barn didnt know to join and mob him and galtier knew perfectly well how charles felt about the american occupiers oh papa you were so brave nicole exclaimed i was lucien said that had not occurred to him what was i sup posed to do turn my coat for a little more in the barn it is not worth it you were very brave lucien marie said if she thought so it was likely to be true we would have loved you whatever you told the american but after what you didwe are proud of you well galtier said this is all very good i am sure and i am glad you are proud of me but pride does nothing to weed the potato patch i shall have to work harder today because of the boche americain and the foolish priest for that i do not thank them i work long enough as it is he disentangled himself from the armsthe proud armsof his family went outside picked up his hoe shouldered it and headed back toward the potatoes not much was left of slaughters kentucky a few miles north of madisonville us troops pushing east had managed to drive the confederates out of it only a few days before after fighting that fully lived up to the name of the place fought over as far as abner dowling was concerned the fight like most of those general custer planned had been far more expensive than it was worth however much he wanted to he couldnt say that to the war reporter walking through the ruined streets of slaughters beside him custers famous name was what had drawn richard harding davis out to kentucky to see the american troops in action davis had seen a lot of wars all around the world his reports from manila as the japanese were entering the city were classics in their way so were his reports on what theyd done to the spanish prisoners theyd taken though those hadnt been filed till he was safely out of the philippines and now here he was with custers first army and with the chance even if he hadnt known it when he got here to write stories about something new in warfare on the north american continent youre sure the general will let me go right up to the front the reporter asked dowling for about the fourth time davis was fifty or so ruggedly handsome though his color wasnt all it could have been and he panted a little as he walked along beside dowling and wore a greengray jacket halfway between a military style and one a biggame hunter might have used it had more pockets than you could shake a stick at dowling wished he owned one like it mr davis he answered general custer is going up to the front he wants to see this for himself he has already told me repeatedly you are welcome to accompany him and me now that youre here mr davis general custer would strangle with his own liverspotted hands anyone who had the gall to try to get between him and headlines which is to say between you and him custer had billeted himself in one of the few houses in slaughters only lightly damaged a twostory victorian structure whose windows had only jagged shards of glass in them but whose walls and roof remained intact a couple of sentries stood outside the front door theyd dug foxholes nearby into which they could dive in case the rebs started shelling the town again they saluted dowling and eyed richard harding davis with respectful curiosity he wasnt just a reporter but had a name as a novelist and playwright as well go on in one of them said opening the door the general should be finishing up his breakfast about now and i know hell be glad to see you as the sentry had said custer sat at the kitchen table the view through the bay window had probably been lovely back before it turned into a prospect of charred rubble and shell holes the general was attacking his plate with knife fork and great gusto he turned when dowling and davis came into the room pointing down at his breakfast he exclaimed raw onions such was his delight that had he been writing he probably would have used capital letters and four exclamation points dowling did not share that delight he coughed and did his best not to inhale but his eyes started watering to beat the band in spite of the improved ventilation the shattered bay window gave the kitchen hed known about custers love for onions anyone who had anything to do with custer found out about that but why had the general chosen today of all days for them richard harding davis did his best to take the potent vegetables in stride a warmup for the rest of the days show eh he said but could not help wiping his eyes with his sleeve thats right by jingo custer said shovelling another odorous forkful into his mouth he went on till he was done when hed finished the whole plate he spoke in meditative tones those onions could have used some salt well cant be helped shall we go disinfect some rebels gentlemen off they went custers motorcar despite having to veer off the road a couple of times to avoid craters brought them past the artillery posts where men without shirts stood waiting in the june sunshine for the order to rain death down on the confederate lines custer talked gaily about custer all the while davis scribbled an occasional note dowling wished the commanding general would shut up not only because hed heard all the stories before but also because even with the wind streaming by in the open motorcar custers breathe was still hideously vile once they came to the rear of the trench system the motorcar could advance no farther dowling wondered if custer would make it to the front under his own power the commanding general was a long way from being the spry dashing soldier of thirtyodd years gone by though obviously he was convinced that times wrinkled hand hadnt touched him at all he was spry enough to reach the trenches without undue difficulty though richard harding davis proved to be the one who had trouble there wind isnt what it used to be he said apologetically letting a hand rest on his chest for a moment as if his heart pained him he lighted a cigarette and went gamely on here and there along the way pieces of crates stencilled battery f and disinfection were used as corduroying on the floor of the trench or as pieces of leantos and other shelters cut into the earth of the trench wall custer had just started talking about them when a confederate aeroplane came buzzing overhead shoot him down the general shouted his sagging features twisting in alarm if the rebs see what were up to therell be hell to pay for once dowling agreed completely with his commander yelling in the middle of the trench line though didnt strike him as the best way to get the antiaircraft gunners to go to work fortunately they didnt need custers encouragement they opened up on the confederate scout with everything they had the air around his aeroplane filled with black puffs as intense a barrage as dowling had ever seen the reb must have felt the same way he turned around and scooted for his own lines the antiaircraft fire followed him till he was out of range moving forward grew difficult then because the trenches were packed with men in greengray their gauze masks making them all look alike waiting to storm forward when the order was given it wouldnt be long now dowlings bulk and the magic of custers name cleared the path enough that the general his adjutant and davis were able to reach the very forward most trenches in good time resting at the front of those trenches spaced several yards apart were metal cylinders about as long as a man each one painted dark blue alongside each cylinder stood a masked man with a wrench ready to open the fitting and let its contents spew forth into the air what is the hour major custer demanded he had a pocket watch of his own but asking dowling the question was easier than taking it out and looking at it sir its dowling said resignedly after checking his own watch splendid custer said capital couldnt be better were scheduled to begin at provided the wind holds he licked a finger and stuck it up in the air he stuck it up high enough as a matter of fact that he was lucky not to get shot in the hand holding very nicelystraight out of the west just as we want when the germans used chlorine gas against the french and the english at ypres they made gains but not a breakthrough davis said how will you make sure we do better than our allies that was a good question dowling wondered how custer would answer it dowling wondered if custer could answer it the truth was that the usa like everyone else in the war seized eagerly on anything that might yield a small edge in the murderous struggle every us army in kentucky was trying chlorine gas today making gains without losing men by the tens of thousands looked very good even to custer who normally used up soldiers as if they were so many pieces of blotting paper but instead of replying custer shouted release the gas it was by dowlings watch still a minute early but custers watch might have run fasternot that he checked to find out the men at the closest chlorine cylinders gave counter clockwise twists with their wrenches puffs as of pale green smoke spurted from the cylinders custer had been right about one thing the wind was out of the west it blew the puffs of smoke into a single dirty green cloud and sent that cloud rolling and billowing toward the confederate trenches thatll shift them custer said jubilantly he got up on the firing step to watch the progress of the gas davis got up beside him if he didnt watch the progress of the gas he didnt have much of a story and dowling got up there too as long as he was custers adjutant this was as close to real combat as he was likely to come every now and then little bits of high ground between the us and cs lines would remain visible above the chlorine cloud which being heavier than air stuck close to the ground except when the wind blew it up into little puffs and wisps despite that steady wind the harsh bleachlike odor of the gas made dowlings throat raw his nose sore and his eyes even more watery than custers vicious onions had done as soon as the chlorine cloud rolled over and into the confederate trenches observers telephoned word back to the us artillery emplacements they opened up with a savage bombardment explosions sent dirt flying and made the gas jump and writhe like a plateful of gelatin before long the cylinders of chlorine gas were empty the artillery stopped pounding the confederates forward most trenches and moved back to the support trenches to keep reinforcements from moving up all along the us line officers whistles blew cries of lets go and get moving rang out one nearby officer added come on the closer we stay to the hind end of that gas cloud the worse shape the rebsll be in when we hit em over the top the troops went that would have been plenty to inspire abner dowling to follow close behind the chlorine only in books by writers whod never smelled powder more to the point whod never smelled the shit from spilled guts did soldiers want a fair fight what soldiers wanted was a walkover with none of them getting hurt they didnt get what they wanted very often maybe today brave men richard harding davis said quietly watching the soldiers in greengray their uniforms fading almost to invisibility when seen against the chlorine swarming out of the us trenches and toward those of the confederates very brave men here and there rifle and machinegun fire greeted the americans not all of the rebels had been overcome by the poisonous gas men caught between the trench lines fell sometimes one by one sometimes in rows but most of the us soldiers moved forward one after another the weapons aimed at them fell silent do the rebels know how to block the chlorines effect davis asked i wouldnt be surprised dowling said at the same time as general custer was snapping i doubt it custer glared at his adjutant dowling hung his head and muttered an apology reports from europe though showed how chlorine could be countered even something as simple as pissing in a rag and holding it over your mouth and nose could keep most of the gas out of your lungs though it would still burn your eyes and the limeys and the frogs were supposed to be using the same sort of masks german and now us troops had too i shant give any details davis said though i doubt the confederate states need to read my columns to garner military intelligence that was sure to be true where the usa had german reports on the effects of chlorine the csa would have got details from paris and london whatever the reports had said though the rebs hadnt paid much attention to it us soldiers still flooded forward and now confederate prisoners herded along by jubilant americanssome wearing their masks some with them hung around their neckscame stumbling back to the us lines some of the rebs were ordinary captives either men whod surrendered in the fighting or were taken after being wounded but others showed the effects of the poisonous gas some had blood running from their mouths or bubbling out of their noses others seemed to be doing their best not to breathe at all from the tiny taste of chlorine dowling had got he tried to imagine what their throats and chests felt like he was glad he failed a couple of confederates tried to scream at every breath they took but emitted only little gasping sounds of agony not much glory here dowling observed watching the wretched prisoners defeating the enemies of my country is glory aplenty for me custer declared in his own way he meant it but his own way included seeing his name in the newspapers preferably in letters several inches high and by the way the attack was developing he might get glory on his own terms a big victory here and roosevelt would be hard pressed to keep from giving him the command in canada he so desperately craved a runner came up and said in tones of high excitement sir we just captured a whole battery of those damn fastfiring threeinch guns the rebs have not a man at em most of the gunners ran and the gas got the rest thats firstrate custer said positively firstrate we have to keep throwing men at them till they crack pour it on by god pour it on have you got more chlorine ready to make another breach in their lines after they manage to plug this gap davis asked dowling nodded again the reporter had found the right question to ask the right answer unfortunately was no the usa didnt turn outor hadnt turned outchlorine in the quantity germany a chemical powerhouse did if the thought of not having more bothered custer he didnt let on we wont need more he said grandly now that weve got them on the run well make sure they keep running ill send in the cavalry to complete their demoralization the stalemate on this front mr davis is over and you can quote me davis wrote the words down he didnt ask any more questions maybe that meant custer had convinced him maybe on the other hand it meant the reporter had seen enough war on his own to know the general commanding first army was talking through his hat abner dowling was glumly certain about which way he would have bet retreat it was an ugly word jake featherston hated the sound of it but he hated the sound of annihilation a lot more if the first richmond howitzers hadnt pulled back from the susquehanna when they did they would have been in no position to do it later i knew we were in trouble when we didnt make it to the delaware he muttered as he trudged along a dirt road that coated him the horses the guns and everything else nearby with a redbrown haze of dust he hadnt expected to be overheard not through the clopping of the horses hooves and the rattle and squeak of the gun carriage but the new loader for the piece a youngster named michael scott said whys that sarge featherston scowled he almost didnt answer as far as he was concerned nero and perseus had manned the gun better than the kind of replacements you got nowadays what theyd learned when they were serving their time as conscripts god only knew featherston wasnt convinced theyd learned anything but he replied as patiently as he could when we didnt finish the big wheel to the delaware that let the damnyankees keep shipping supplies into baltimore and that let the bastards break out of baltimore too if they cut us off were still liable to be in a lot of trouble never happen scott declared not in a million years well whip em same as weve done twice running i figured the same thing when the fighting started featherston answered its already gone on a hell of a lot longer than i figured it would the yankees this time feels like they mean business same as us they crossed codorus creek the guncarriage wheels rumbling over the planks of the bridge on the southwestern side of the creek negro labourers and confederate infantry were digging in aiming to hold back the advancing us troops at least for a while and to hold on to the town of hanover a couple of miles to the west featherston was glumly certain they wouldnt keep hanover long with the chunk of land theyd carved out of yankee territory being nibbled away at the base theyd have to keep moving back toward washington and smartly or the us soldiers would cut them off but they couldnt just skedaddle not unless they wanted endless grief from the damnyankees whod halted them at the susquehanna scott said if things had gone the way they were supposed to wed have been in philadelphia a long time ago yeah and if pigs had wings wed all carry umbrellas featherston replied with a snort when youve been through even a little more fighting kid youre going to see that things just dont go the way theyre supposed to the yanks theyve got their own set of supposedtos and what we get is whats left over when ours bump up against theirs the loader nodded respectfully not only was featherston a sergeant he was that even more exalted creature a veteran the combination gave his views an authority few mortals could claim more hoof beats here came pompey mounted on one of captain stuarts fine horses captains compliments sergeant he said in his syrupy voice an we gonna go into battery by that slate quarry over yonder he pointed off to the west of the road all right featherston said shortly he still didnt care for the way stuart used the negro to relay orders but however much authority he might seem to have to michael scott to the battery commander he was just another noncom who did what he was told pompey rode on to give the rest of the guns in the battery the word jake admitted to himself that stuart had picked a good spot in which to deploy the howitzers they were only a couple of miles back of codorus creek in good position to pound the yankees when they approached the line the confederates were creating better yet piles of spoil from the mine offered fine cover for the guns and negroes were already busy digging firing pits to protect them even better as featherston supervised the emplacement of his own howitzer captain stuart rode up himself featherston saluted stuart watched the black men in butternut tunics of simpler baggier cut than soldiers wore with a sly grin he said got yourself a whole readymade gun crew this time in case the one the government issued you goes down uh yes sir jake said a little nervously he still wasnt happy about having used nero and perseus as fighting men nobody else was happy about it either except possibly the two negroesand their opinion didnt count what the reaction of the brass amounted to was that featherston had done what hed had to do and it was too damn bad hed had to do it that was pretty much how he felt about it himself stuart swung down off the horse and tied the reins to a sapling what really makes life difficult is that you put the niggers on the guns right after that major potter came sniffing around with all his crazy talk about every other nigger in the army being a damned red would you believe it he wanted to take pompey away for questioning is that a fact sir featherston said in tones he devoutly hoped were un revealing he after all had been the one whod suggested pompey could do with some investigating it is indeed jeb stuart iii kicked at the ground to show his indignation it wasnt aimed at jake from which he concluded stuart didnt know who mistrusted his supercilious servant i had to get hold of my father back in the war department and he had to do some pretty plain talking to the army of northern virginia intelligence before they turned pompey loose when those people question somebody hes lucky if he comes out of it in one piece especially if hes a nigger ever since the days of robert e lee confederates had used those people spoken in a particular tone of voice as a euphemism for the enemy featherston had never heard it used that way to mean part of the confederate army not till now he hoped he didnt hear it used that way again for another fifty or sixty years so jeb stuart jr had saved pompey from the tender mercies of army intelligence had he if pompey wasnt any more than an ordinary black servant stuck up beyond his station because of whom he served that was fine if pompey was a snake in the grass it was anything but fine but how were you sup posed to know which if you didnt try to find out pompeys family has been with my family since my greatgrandfathers day the captain said hed be loyal to the stuarts before hed join up with a pack of red revolutionaries just because they have black skins featherston didnt answer arguing with your superior had no future in it arguing with your superior when he was also in the third generation of a leading confederate military family had less than no future and in any case he had enough other things to do making sure the gun was sited as well as it could be making sure the wheel brakes were set and the spade on the end of the trail dug into the ground making sure there was a good thick earthen rampart between the ammunition and the crew so a lucky shell hit wouldntor might notblow them all to jesus all that took time and work as he readied the position he kept peering over the creek looking for the caterpillar ripples on the distant ground that marked advancing yankee infantry sure enough here they came larger dots punctuating the ripples were horses cavalry featherston thought with a mixture of respect for their courage and scorn for their uselessness then the dots peeled off they know better than to get their precious horses and their precious selves too close to the machine guns jake thought poor dears might get hurt cavalry would charge though when ordered after staring a moment he recognized the pattern the horses were forming thats not cavalry he shouted thats field artillery jeb stuart iii came trotting up beside him he nodded as he stuck a brass telescope up to his eye field artillery sure as hell he agreed i make the range about two and a half milessay four thousand yards for starters lets give them a hello shall we he started bawling for the whole battery featherston handled his gun it was the second one of the battery to open up the shell fell a couple of hundred yards short of the us field gun the next shell a few seconds later was long after that they started landing in the right general area you put enough shells in the right general area you did damage the yanks had probably figured they could get their battery into position and into action before the retreating confederates were ready to reply theyd made a mistake there and they were going to pay for it the us battery did get a few shots off shells crashing down on the trench line behind codorus creek but that kind of nuisance firing went on every day of the war it was hardly worth noticing even by the negro labourers who were more flighty than soldiers when it came to being on the receiving end of bullets since they couldnt shoot back jake found it hard to blame them for that he glanced over to nero and perseus they stood by the horses and were plainly ready to dive into the foxhole if the damnyankees started hurling shells at the battery theyd shot back featherston hoped to high heaven theyd never have to do it again after a few minutes the us field guns couldnt stand the heat from deploying out in the open they started moving again this time against the tide of the advancing us infantry so long featherston shouted at them tell your mama what its like when you really have to work for a living his gun crew yelled and waved their hats at captain stuarts orders they started pouring shells into the foot soldiers approaching the creek they worked a formidable slaughter among them too but a couple of hours later they had to abandon their position and pull back another mile or two somewhere farther west the yankees had forced a crossing of the creek doesnt seem right michael scott grumbled as nero and perseus hitched the horses up to the guns we were massacring the bastards wasnt so much what they did in front of us that made us start this retreat featherston answered it was what happened off to the flank and the rear you can win your own part of the battle and still have the whole army lose i wish you hadnt said that the loader told him after jake thought about it for a while he wished he hadnt said that too when flora hamburger went downstairs from the socialist party offices to walk across centre market place and buy a sandwich in the market max fleischmann was arguing with two goons outside his butchers shop no i dont got no ham he said to them dont got no pigs knuckles dont got no head cheese dont got no bacon dont got no time for no silliness neither im a jew you maybe may have noticed yeah pop we noticed one of the goons said his nasty grin showed a couple of broken teeth maybe you noticed this he raised the billy club he carried in his right hand the armband wrapped around his left sleeve read peace and order he and his equally unpleasant friend looked like a couple of soldiers circle men and were helping to hold down the staunchly socialist neighborhood by main force leave that man alone flora said crisply her english was precise and almost unaccented the two volunteer policemen gaped at her as she went on not only has he done nothing to you but if you beat him you will be beating one of the few democrats in this part of new york aint no democrats here said the goon with the club ready to use just jews and socialists he leered at her which are you lady both flora answered the thugs undoubtedly knew that they hung around the socialist party office to harass the party regulars and maria tresca aside few gentiles came here angelina tresca wouldnt ever again floras party affiliation though was a sword that cut both ways and if you beat me todayor if you beat mr fleischmannevery socialist paper in the country will carry the story tomorrow that was true by the unhappy look on the goons faces they knew it too the one with the club raised lowered it come on paddy he said in disgust well find games to play somewheres else they mooched off looking for people more willing to be intimidated thank you the butcher said to flora in english before dropping back into yiddish when you go home you stop in here ill have something for you to take back to the flat not something big maybe but something you dont need to do that she said also in yiddish hush fleischmann told her his voice stern you have a sister who can use good food right now take it for her if not for you his stiffbacked pose declared he would allow no disagreement flora gave up ill stop she promised wondering how fleischmann knew about sophie gossip on the crowded lower east side was an amazing thing no doubt fleischmann also knew the baby would be illegitimate flora sighed even if you disapproved of bourgeois conventions you couldnt escape them more goons patrolled the centre market the remembrance day riots had given the authorities the excuse they needed to clamp down on socialist strongholds throughout new york city though no one had proved or could prove a socialist had started the disturbances flora bought a smokedtongue sandwich from a little stall in the market a couple of pickled tomatoes from a man who carried his great vat of spiced brine on a pushcart and coffee from another fellow with a pushcart this one mounting a samovar she ate quickly then went back upstairs where she spent the afternoon writing one letter after another all of them aimed at getting roosevelts repressive restrictions lifted from new york city if the president keeps up with them said herman bruck who was also writing hell provoke a workingclass uprising a hundred times worse than anything we saw in the nineties that will play hob with carrying on his foolish war his bruises had faded roentgenray photographs had shown his left hand wasnt broken after all he wore as a badge of honor the gap in his smile that hed got when somebody wearing a heavy soldiers circle ring had punched him in the face during the riots and loudly proclaimed to whoever would listen that he preferred it to going to the dentist for bridgework flora found that absurd but didnt say so whenever she argued with bruck about anything he thought it meant she was interested in him maria tresca in mourning black was very quiet flora finished her letterwriting said her goodbyes and went downstairs max fleischmann stood waiting for her as if in ambush he thrust a paperwrapped package into her hands her eyebrows flew up at the weight of it this is too much she exclaimed im sorry im not hearing very well today the butcher said and went back into his shop that left her the choice of pursuing him when he plainly did not want to be pursued and going home shaking her head she went home what do you have there her mother asked when she walked into the crowded apartment i kept mr fleischmann the butcher from having some trouble with trs hooligans so he gave me this she answered and opened it on the kitchen counter marrow bones and stewing beef there must be three or four pounds of it thats very nice her mother said we can use thatbarley soup with onions and carrots maybe the way your father likes yes mama flora said to her mother utility made anything even socialism worthwhile ill put it in the icebox her brothers came in then bantering with her and their younger sister esther as they hung up their jackets and caps david lighted a cigarette a habit he was just acquiring and one flora wished hed lose the harsh smoke made the flat stink it wasnt flavourful like the pipe tobacco their father used even the cheaper grades he was using nowadays smelled better than this nasty weed when benjamin hamburger came in he got the pipe going right away perhaps in selfdefense sophie dragged in last of all the war had created relentless demands on seamstresses in new york city all over the usa and no doubt all over the world the bosses didnt care if you were going to have a baby you had to show up and you had to work no matter how tired no matter how sick you were if you didnt somebody else was waiting to do your job over small helpings of pot roast and big ones of potato kugel benjamin hamburger remarked on that with so many jobs needing doing now wages may be going up alevai he added dragging superstition into a discussion of what should have been the most unsuperstitious study of economics before flora could turn the discussion into a more rational pattern someone knocked on the door floras mother bounced to her feet and strode to the door with a determined stride saying a peddler who comes round at suppertime deserves a choleryeh hell remember for a year and ill give him one you see if i dont but when she threw open the door it was not a peddler hawking knives or pens or stereoscope slides through the block of flats instead it was an unfamiliarlooking man in a greengray uniform yossel sophie exclaimed recognizing him without his beard where flora had not may i come in yossel reisen asked when sarah hamburger showed no signs of getting out of his way you may come in benjamin called over his wifes shoulder when she whirled around to protest he waved for her to calm down continuing how long you stay depends on what you have to say for yourself once you are in here thus appeased sarah grudgingly stepped out of the way yossel came past her and into the flat esther quickly got up here find a chair and eat something she said hurrying into the kitchen and returning with a plate piled high with potato kugel thank you reisen did sit down and looked around nervously the grimace with which he greeted sophie was no doubt intended for a smile but failed of its purpose hello he said cautiously as if she were an armed rebel behind a wall how are you as well as i could beconsidering she answered you know how i amthe rest of it though you must have got my letters even if i havent heard from you she stared at him as defiantly as a confederate soldier in arms he had a mouth full of kugel and used that respite to good advantage yes i know he said and then im sorry sophie i didnt intend that to happen didnt intend which to happen flora wondered didnt intend to sleep with sophie or didnt intend to get her with child but she held her tongue to see what her older sister would do people dont intend that to happen sophie said taking him to mean he hadnt planned to impregnate her but it does and then they have to decide what to do next thats why i came here yossel answered i managed to get four days leave i spent most of one day coming up from maryland and ill need most of another to get back between timeshe licked his lipswe can get married bourgeois respectability flora thought as sophie clapped her hands together once and nodded the idea should have carried more scorn than it did somehow the feeling of contempt for bourgeois values was harder to come by when those values benefited her sister benjamin hamburger also nodded as if hed expected nothing less from yossel maybe he had expected nothing less but he raised an objection even with the war youll have trouble finding a rabbi to perform the ceremony on such short notice yossel reisen shrugged then well find a judge and find a rabbi when i get a longer leave or else after the war is over you say that flora exclaimed you who wanted to do nothing but sit on your tokhus and study talmud all day flora sophie said indignantly flora realized everyone else must have heard what she said as an insult she hadnt meant it that way what shed been expressing was astonishment for a wonder yossel understood that he held up a hand which after a moment quieted the angry outcry from the rest of floras family yes i say that he answered when you have been where i have been when you have seen what i have seen when you have done what i have done his voice trailed away he was sitting across the table from flora and looking in her direction but he wasnt looking at her he looked through her to some place he alone saw some place maybe more real to him than the crowded apartment in which he sat he needed a little while to realize he had stopped talking and coughed a couple of times before he resumed when all that is true you know right down to the soles of your boots you know how little time there is and when you have a little of that little time you do what you can with it and what you cannot do now you will do later if god lets you no one spoke for a minute or so after that then quietly benjamin hamburger asked sophie is this all right with you yes sophie answered also quietly perhaps of its own accord her left hand settled on her belly which was beginning to bulge as yossel said we have only a little time well do as much as we can with it floras father looked to her mother sarah hamburger didnt say yes but she didnt say no either it is not a perfect arrangement benjamin said but what in life is perfect except god if sophie agrees it will do flora was temperamentally opposed to compromise of any kind she was the one whod wanted to fight to the end against voting to pay for roosevelt s war here though when it was her own family things didnt look the same it wasnt her choice anyhow it was sophies youll sleep here on the divan tonight her father told yossel as if you were a boarder again everybody smiled at that benjamin hamburger got up and went into the kitchen he rummaged in the pantry and in a cabinet and came back with a bottle of whiskey and enough glasses for everyone floras brothers told how the old men at the shul had given each of them his first shot just before his bar mitzvah amid toasts of lchaym everybody knocked back the drinks isaac might have been emboldened by the whiskey for he asked yossel reisen what is it like at the front emboldened or not he sounded hesitant yossel looked into the depths of his glass as he had looked through flora at last he answered think of all the worst things you know in the world think of them all in one place think of them as ten times as bad as they really are then think of them ten times worse than that what you are thinking about when you do that is one tenthousandth of what the front is like nobody asked him any more questions somewhere in the yankee lines in the ruins of big lick virginia a rifle cracked about fifty feet away from reggie bartlett an incautious confederate soldier toppled back into the trench shot through the face he wasnt dead not yet a scream bubbled through the blood flooding from his nose his mouth and the wound between them god damn that fucking sniper to hell somebody snarled as a couple of men hauled their wounded comrade back toward the doctors to see if they could do anything for him thats the fourth one of us hes got on this sector this week we ever catch him ill gutshoot him and watch him die bartlett hardly looked up either for the gunshot or for the screams and curses following it he was hunting lice a matter that could have taken up most of his waking day if duties demanded by his officers hadnt intervened every one of the little bastards you crunched between your thumbnails was one more that wouldnt bite you one more that wouldnt leave sores and scabs in your hair one more that wouldnt leave itchy welts on your body he tried to remember his leave in richmond he knew hed been there seen old friends made new ones got drunk got laid at a soldiers brothel full of boredlooking colored girls it was a matter of a few weeks not months or years but seemed far more distant than that when you were at the front everything else was distant if you singed the seams of your tunic and trousers you killed nits and drove lice out to where you could grab them and squash them reggie lighted a candle shed his tunic and ran the flame along one sleeve pausing every so often to slaughter the vermin hed flushed out a fat rat came strolling down the middle of the trench it was light enough not to get stuck in the mud from the recent rains bartlett wished he could have said the same the rat paused and stared at him with its beady black eyes ill steal your rations see if i dont it seemed to say and if i dont one day soon a yankee shell will turn you into rations for me shells never seemed to kill ratsor maybe it was just that there were so many of them every piece of artillery in the world couldnt have slaughtered them all well if wholesale didnt work there was always retail reggie snatched up the entrenching tool beside him and threw it at the rat the rat was quick and alert but hed guessed right about which way it would jump and it couldnt outrun the sharpened shovel blade which cut it almost in two bartlett retrieved the tool and used it to smash in the twitching rats head the twitching ceased he looked around to see if any more rats were close by spying none he went back to delousing his tunic you hammered that fat ugly bastard corporal robert e mccorkle said sure did bartlett agreed mccorkle was a fat ugly bastard himself but saying so struck reggie as impolitic theyre getting awfully bold these days parading through the trenches like theyve got stars in wreaths on their collars mccorkle laughed at that reggie relighted the candle which had gone out and went back to killing lice he had just started on the other sleeve when first one man and then several began banging with entrenching tools on shell casings that had been hung like temple bells from tripods made of boards with the unmusical banging a warning cry raced up and down the trench line gas the yanks are using gas being shot at having artillery shells land all around even going out between the trench lines to lay wire or to raidreggie was used to all that almost to the same degree hed been used to waiting at a richmond corner for the streetcar to pick him up on his way between his apartment and the pharmacy where hed worked it wasnt that he was fearless it was much more that anything even the worst of horrors becomes routine and what is routine no longer terrifies but gas gas was new the us soldiers hadnt used it on the roanoke front not till now the maskswhich looked like plump versions of the ones surgeons wore over their mouths and nosesand the hyposulfite solution in which to soak them had arrived days before he snatched his mask out of the breast pocket in his tunic where hed stowed it and sprinted barechested for the hyposulfite tin there he discovered arrangements could have been better everybody else was as frightened of the poisonous stuff the damnyankees were spewing as he was and the big tin stood at the center of a struggling knot of men form a line corporal mccorkle shouted from behind him god damn you form a line and on the double discipline held when a voice with command told the men what to do they did it bartlett dipped his mask into the big widemouthed tin and tied it over his face as the first yellowgreen tendrils of chlorine gas came down into the trench like so many poisonous snakes slithering in the late spring sun his eyes burned he passed the palm of his hand over the dripping mask and then over his eyes that helped a little he had no idea whether the hyposulfite solution would hurt his eyes he knew damn well the chlorine would though his lungs burned too he could smell the harsh chlorine in his nose taste it in his mouth the mask he wore like a cold clammy veil was anything but perfect but men who hadnt donned masks or who hadnt tied them tight were coughing and choking clutching at their throats and turning blue not perfect no but a hell of a lot better than nothing if you cant get to the chemical piss on your mask that was captain wilcox his voice muffled by the mask he was wearing its disgusting but it may keep you alive as the chlorine spread from the frontline trenches toward those farther to the rear us artillery opened up pounding the confederates with a harsh bombardment reggie bartlett huddled in the mud near the rat he had killed any one of those shells could lay him open the way his entrenching tool had gutted the rat he held his hands over his face both to protect it from splinters and to keep his mask on tight the bombardment was sharp but it was also short no more than fifteen minutes up dammit up captain wilcox shouted farther along the trench the battalion commander major colleton echoed the command get up and fight like americans here come the damnyankees bartlett s eyes burned worse than ever tears streamed down his face but he hadnt been killed he hadnt been maimed thank you jesus he scrambled to his feet and ran to the firing step sure enough the yankees were cutting their way through the wire most of them wore masks like his the white cloth squares made good targets he fired again and again and again us soldiers fell more kept coming though their uniforms almost the color of chlorine confederate machine guns opened up the damnyankees started falling faster but still they came urgent shouts blurred under the hyposulfitesoaked gauze pads on their mouths some of them got close enough to throw grenades one burst near bartlett leaving him stunned and half deafened after a moment he realized his left leg hurt fragment or a nail or whatever must have kissed me he thought when he put weight on the leg it held he could worry about the wound later then a few yankees leaped down into the confederate trench but none near him those men were dead or wounded or running or crawling back to their own lines a pistol barked its sharp report like a terrier yapping amid retrievers probably major colleton doing some of his own fighting you couldnt fault him for guts god damn a man in butternut beside reggie said reverently as the firing slowed we beat the sons of bitches back bartlett needed a moment to recognize jasper jenkins with a mask on his face even though the two of them had shared cornbread and jam and coffee for breakfast that morning sure as hell did jasper he answered using his friends name to cover his own embarrassment these masks do help nice to know we got something at least partway right negro stretcherbearers red cross armbands on their left sleeves and masks on their faces came forward to take the men who had been gassed and the other casualties back to where the doctors could work on them staring at the yellowish foam on the lips of one poor fellow who moaned with every breath he took reggie wondered what the quacks could do for him and if they could do anything at all he brought his hand up to his mask if hed been at the tail end of that line instead of near the front id have pissed on my mask he said anything is better than nothing he unbuttoned his fly and faced the wall of the trench he noticed he was pissing on a dead rat nobody had smacked it with an entrenching tool like the gassed soldier hed seen it had yellow foam on its whiskers as he walked along the trench he saw more rats either frozen in death or thrashing like soldiers whod inhaled what wasnt an immediately fatal dose of chlorine he kicked a couple of the corpses and stamped the life out of a couple that were still breathing gas must bring the sons of bitches up out of their holes jasper jenkins said reckon so reggie agreed they come up for fresh air but there isnt any fresh air maybe well have a few days without them thieving and chewing on dead bodies he picked up the tunic hed thrown down when the gas attack started i wonder if that chlorine stuff kills lice too if it does there may be something to it after all he squatted down to examine the tunic and find out nellie semphroch went from table to table with a tray for empty plates and coffee cups and a damp rag to wipe the tables clean of spilled coffee and bits of bread from sandwiches thanks to mr jacobs she hadnt had any trouble getting good bread and meats despite what her ration books said no snoopy confederate inspectors had walked in and started asking questions mr jacobs evidently knew a way to keep that from happening too she looked around the coffeehouse business was good business in fact was booming if she wasnt careful shed get rich confederate inspectors might not come into the coffeehouse but confederate officers did and they told their friends and she stiffened there sat nicholas h kincaid moodily sipping at a cup of coffee he hadnt come in for food or drink hed come in to try to seduce edna having come so close once before why nellie thought resentfully hasnt he gone and gotten himself killed she wished she could walk up to him and throw him out on his ear since he was an occupier and she one of the occupied she couldnt do that what she could do and did was thank heaven she had edna in the back washing dishes and not here out front waiting tables with a final scowl at kincaid she carried the tray back to her daughter hello ma edna said looking up from the sink you got more presents for me why dont you bring me a diamond ring and a motorcar instead of all these miserable stinking goddamn dishes youve got the soap right there nellie pointed to it why dont you wash your mouth out with it mother and daughter glared at each other mother and daughter had been doing a lot of that lately the more nellie tried to keep an eye on edna the more edna took to sneaking around nellie didnt know what to do about it she had to sleep she had to eat she had to mind the customersand edna was so wild for life these daysthat was what the young people called it anyway to nellie it was just another word for loose that fifteen or twenty minutes unwatched might well have been all she needed why dont you let me be edna said oh no nellie answered i know you too well youre too much the way i was more than half a lifetime ago easing back never occurred to her nor did the notion that part of ednas wildness might have sprung from being watched too closely too often for too long with a martyred sigh edna took the cups and saucers and plates from the tray and set them in the soapy water in the sink nellie noddedthat was what her daughter was supposed to be doing leaving edna to the scrubbing nellie went back out to see what her customers needed a couple of rebels held up empty cups and asked for refills one of them asked for another ham sandwich too it was a good thing she was getting those extra rations thanks to mr jacobs if the rebs fought half as well as they ate the united states were in more trouble than they knew she had just served the sandwich when a civilian came into the coffeehouse that did happen now and again some washingtonians came in arm inarm with confederate officers and a lot of those who didnt still had the slick prosperous look of men who were getting along well by getting along well with the enemy shed passed a name or two to mr jacobs in the hope of helping a collaborator to an untimely demise this fellow didnt have that look he was a middleaged man with gray muttonchop whiskers and hadnt shaved the rest of his face any time in the past couple of days he wore a suit and tie but hed been wearing his collar for a while and his jacket had shiny elbows and a couple of spots on the front nellie prominently posted her prices one look at them was plenty to send most customers not armed with either confederate scrip or good connections fleeing out into the street the stranger studied the list sighed shrugged and sat down at a corner table nellie went over to him may i help you sir he looked up at her sharply almost disconcertingly his eyes were tracked with red he might have had a drink or two but he didnt stink too badly of booze a turkey sandwich and a cup of coffee he said yes sir nellie answered when a customer didnt say what kind of coffee he wanted he got the cheapest she had thatll be a dollar even she went on in a tone of voice suggesting she wanted to see the dollar before she served him getting the unspoken message the fellow dug in his trouser pocket a big silver cartwheel chimed sweetly on the tabletop there you are he said still studying her she ignored that she was good at ignoring men when they looked at her more closely than they should have she didnt ignore the dollar that she scooped up maybe this fellow thought he could leave it sitting there till she gave him his order then scoop it up and slide out the door washington had always been full of grifters and all the more so since the rebs occupied it money in hand she went back behind the counter poured the coffee and made the man his sandwich because he looked down on his luck she piled the smoked turkey higher than she would have for a damned reb and stuck a couple of sweet pickles alongside even though she usually tacked on an extra nickel apiece for them she carried the turkey sandwich and the steaming coffee cup over to him he smiled which stretched his mouth out almost to the tips of his muttonchops that looks mighty good he said tucking the napkin into his collar to protect his shirtfront thank you little nell nellie froze no one had called her that since a couple of years before edna was born shed hopedshed thoughtno one would ever call her that again as long as she lived eat your sandwich whoever you are she said tonelessly eat your sandwich drink your coffee get out and never come back here again time was when you gave me something better for my dollar than meat and bread the man said with a reminiscent leer yes there was whiskey on his breath get out now nellie said perhaps more quietly than shed intended because she felt a scream boiling up inside her that would shake the place down if she let it loose get out now or ill have the rebs here throw you out he assumed an injured expression dont take it like that little nell dont you remember bill reach of the evening star and for a wonder she did hed been panting after stories in those days hed been panting after anything else he could get his hands on too and hed got his hands on her once a week or so for months at a time hed been better than some but that wasnt saying much not with what shed seen there for a couple of years men were brutes men were beasts no doubt about it your voice hasnt changed at all he said which explained how hed recognized her youre not as blond as you used to be though her golden curls had come out of a bottle they drew customers so shed kept them that color till she managed to escape the life shed been leading bill reachs looks werent what they had been not by a long shot he looked to be about two steps up from a bum too serves him right she thought but because hed been better than someonly out for his own pleasure not actively cruelshe said all right eat before you go but dont come back dont you ever come back here is that any way to talk to an old friend he demanded indignantly maybe that was how he thought of himself as if shed made friends with the men who set money on the nightstand the idea made her want to laugh in his stubbly face the only thing theyd ever done to make her happy was to get up get dressed and leave a large shape loomed up beside her a confederate officer is this man bothering you maam nicholas h kincaid asked the clear implication was that if she said yes bill reach would regret it for a long time she would have been happier with anyone but kincaid coming to her aid he wasnt helping her because he felt like helping her he was helping because if she approved of him hed have a better chance at laying edna she knew how mens minds worked oh yes she did all too well its all right she said surprising reach and disappointing kincaid he didnt mean any harm she looked that eatandgetout warning at the exreporter what was he doing now nothing too well by the look of him reluctantly kincaid went back to his table and sat down again nellie stayed out front till reach had eaten and left then she gathered up his dirty dishes and those from several other tables and carried them in to edna whats the matter ma her daughter asked you look like you seen a ghost or something maybe i have nellie answered her daughter scratched her head xv m ajor irving morrell was waiting for the stew pot full of odds and ends to come to a boil when a runner hurried up to him sir the fellow said saluting im supposed to bring you back to division headquarters right away are you morrell raised an eyebrow well youre going to have to wait a minute anyhow he raised his voice schaefer sir the senior captain in the battalion called im ordered back to division dutch morrell told him try not to let the rebs overrun us till i get back ill do my best captain schaefer said chuckling as long as youre going back there see if theyll send another couple of machine guns forward we can use the firepower ill do that morrell promised he turned to the runner all right lead the way he was sweating by the time he got out of the frontline trenches the runner had taken him literally and was setting a hard pace his wounded leg had unhappy things to say about that sternly he told it to be quiet it didnt want to listen he ignored the complaints and pushed on through the hot muggy summer night division staff was too exalted to try to survive under canvas theyd taken over several houses in the little town of smilax kentucky the one to which the runner brought morrell had sentries all around and a us flag in front of it he gave the fellow a startled look you didnt say general foulke wanted to see me yes sir thats who the runner said he spoke to one of the sentries this heres major morrell the soldier nodded and went inside he emerged a moment later and held the door open for morrell to go in and see the divisional commander as morrell climbed the stairs the runner trotted off down the street perhaps on another mission perhaps to escape one major general william dudley foulke was sitting in the front room scribbling a note when morrell came in the general was a plump man in his midsixties with a bald crown a white fringe around it and a bushy white mustache he looked more like a french general than an american one all he needed was a kepi and a little swagger stick to complete the impression at ease major foulke said after they exchanged salutes effective immediately i am removing you from command of your battalion sir morrell hadnt expected to be summoned before the divisional commander at all and certainly not for that reason on what grounds sir what grounds foulke wheezed laughter then held up a plump pink hand on the grounds that philadelphia asked me for a younger officer who could fill a staff position there and that your name topped the list are those satisfactory grounds major uh yes sir morrell said i cant imagine any better ones and a whole slew that are worse when general foulke had told him he was being removed hed imagined that slew of worse grounds though he didnt think hed given reason for invoking any of them stubborn honesty though compelled him to add after i spent so long in the hospital sir i do regret being pulled away from active service again if you dont mind my saying so i dont mind at all general foulke said id be disappointed if you said anything else as a matter of fact a staff officer who likes being a staff officer because he has a soft billet far away from the line isnt a man of the sort the country needs men who want to go out and fight theyre the sort who do well for the general staff you will be fighting i promise you the only difference will be youll do it with map and telegram not with a rifle yes sir morrell knew he should have been overjoyed a tour on the general staff would look very good on his record but he revelled in the rugged outdoor life whether in the sonoran desert or the kentucky mountains getting stuck behind a desk struck him as altogether too much like being stuck in a hospital bed william dudley foulke was thinking along with him at least up to a point steepling his fingers the general said staff work can be the making of a promising young officer if you see opportunity by all means seize it here he handed morrell a book something for you to read on the train my translation of the roman military writer vegetius either it will engage your interest or help you sleep the miles away thank you very much sir morrell said wondering whether an ancient writers precepts would have any bearing on the modern art of war my pleasure foulke sighed when i was a boy i thought i would be a lawyer or a scholar but i was fourteen years old when the rebs beat us the first time and i knew then i wanted to spend the rest of my life in the military service of my country that little volume there is a relic of what might have been im afraid nothing more he grew brisk again well you dont want to hear an old man maundering on about himself i certainly didnt when i was a young officer at any rate morrell flushed that embarrassed him which only made him flush more ill treasure the book sir he said or perhaps you wont foulke said its all right either way major ive sent philadelphia a wire letting them know youre on your way now the trick will be getting you there this part of kentucky isnt what youd call overburdened with railroads well send you up the hydenhazard road and east from there to hazard where you can catch a train youre ready to go now i assume uh two things sir morrell said first i promised id ask for a couple of more machine guns for my battalion theyll have them foulke promised what else morrell looked down at himself if im going to philadelphia shouldnt i cleanup a bit first foulke snuffled air out through his mustache seeing what a real front line soldier looks like would do philadelphia good but you may be right he called for his adjutantcaptain rothbartand said get major morrell a hot bath get him a fresh uniform and get him on the road to hazard so he can catch the train for philadelphia yes sir rothbart said and efficiently took care of morrell if he handled everything as smoothly for the divisional commander general foulke was well served inside an hours time morrell clean and newly decked out was jouncing along in a motorcar over dirt roads never intended for automobile traffic the motorcar had three punctures before he got to hazard which in the light of that experience seemed wellnamed morrell stood guard with a rifle while the driver fixed the first two punctures bushwhackers and rebel guerrillas still roamed behind us lines looking like innocent civilians when they werent out raiding for the third puncture morrell pitched in and helped with the repair job he thought about the state of his uniform only after his knees were already dirty no rebs shot at the motorcar but the train he boarded in hazard took gunfire three different times before it got out of kentucky and once had to turn around on a siding when the confederates blew up a bridge on the route north occupied eastern kentucky might have been subdued it was not under the white glare of the trains acetylene lights morrell pondered vegetius some parts of the book the ones that dealt with roman military equipment were as dry and dusty as hed feared and vegetius own proposed inventions didnt strike him as any great improvements he started wondering why general foulke had wasted his time translating such a useless work but when vegetius started talking about principles of the military art the book came to life it was as if more than fifteen centuries had fallen away leaving morrell facetoface with someone who worried about all the same things he did ambushes ways to deceive the enemy the importance of intelligence and other such concerns as vital in the twentieth century as they had been in the fourth and one sentence seized his attention and would not let it go let him who desires peace prepare for war being ready to fight he thought instituting conscription and all the rest of it had kept the united states from having to do more fighting after the defeat in the second mexican war when he finished the volume he set it down not only with respect but also with real regret not only was it interesting in and of itself but general foulke wrote gracefully an attribute more common among officers of the war of secession than their busy modern successors he changed trains in wheeling west virginia the new one pulled into the pennsylvania railroad station at thirtieth and market in the middle of the night waiting for him at the station was a spruce young captain who might have been rothbarts cousin his hat cords were intertwined black and gold he wore black lace on his cuffs and a badge with the coat of arms of the united states superimposed on a fivepointed starthe marks of a general staff officer his salute might have been machined major morrell he said his voice as crisp as the creases on his trousers at morrells nod he went on im john abell as soon as we pick up your bags ill take you over to the war department and well find quarters for your stay in the city i havent got any bags morrell told him when general foulke let me know id been detached from my battalion he gave me time to take a bath and put on a clean uniform and then he stuck me in an automobile my gear will catch up with me eventually i expect no doubt captain abell said looking at the mud on morrells knees well if a general staff officer didnt know motorcars got punctures on bad roads that was his lookout the captain shrugged plainly deciding not to make an issue of it lets go then a couple of antiaircraft cannon stuck their snouts in the air outside the train station philadelphia s been in the war morrell observed that it has captain abell waved a driver in an opentopped ford came up he opened the door to the rear seat for the two officers then used the hand throttle to give the automobile more power as he chugged east through the streets of philadelphia toward the war department headquarters abell went on when the rebs came storming up out of virginia we were afraid wed either have to fight for the town or declare it an open city and pull out that would have been very bad ill say it would morrell agreed since the war of secession and especially since the second mexican war philadelphia had been the de facto capital of the united states washington was simply too vulnerable to confederate guns in the hills on the south side of the potomac could the united states have gone on with the war after losing both their de jure and de facto capitals maybe morrell was glad they hadnt had to find out despite the hour motor traffic kept rumbling through the city probably interrupting bureaucrats sleep philadelphia wasnt just an administrative center it was also a key assembly point for southbound men and materiel here and there morrell saw houses and shops and buildings that had taken damage the rebs never got into artillery range of you did they he asked no sir abell answered they send bombing aeroplanes over us when they can though a lot of bombs have fallen around the war department but only a couple on it his lip curled they cant aim for beans it wasnt as if the war department were a small target either it covered a lot of space between the united states mint and franklin square thinking of it as one building was a mistake too it was a whole great complex some structures of marble some of limestone some of prosaic brick the driver had to jam on the brake several times to keep from running down uniformed men hustling from one building to another when he finally stopped it was in front of a building that looked more like a tycoons house than anything the government maintained one way to keep from being noticed is to look poor and worthless captain abell said noting morrells expression another way is to look rich and useless if the confederates didnt know exactly where the us army general staff made its headquarters morrell would have been astonished he didnt say anything though but hopped out of the ford and followed captain abell into the building by the captains reasoning the sentries outside should have been decked out in servants livery and carried trays for visitors cards rather than rifles morrell was relieved to see they werent and didnt inside the place was ablaze with electric lamps morrell blinked several times the security officer to whom captain abell took him was brisk thorough efficient after satisfying himself that morrell really was morrell he gave him a temporary pass and said good to have you with us major thanks morrell answered still a long way from sure he was glad to be here no matter what william dudley foulke had said could you really fight a war in a fancy place like this then abell took him into the map room morrell had always had a fondness for maps the more you studied them the more you geared strategy and tactics to the terrain the better off you were liable to be and here was the whole war spread out before him in blue and red lines and arrows both ontario fronts kept on being clogged the enemy had the initiative in manitoba kentucky still hadnt been knocked out of the fight guaymas remained in rebel hands morrells leg twinged utah was still in flames too but the confederates were being driven from pennsylvania the usa had bitten off big chunks of sequoyah and the rebs had been chased from new mexico and well back into texas other maps showed the confused fighting at sea his head swung back and forth as if on a swivel seeing all the maps together he felt like a general not just a major worrying about his tiny part of the big picture i think im going to like this place he said the motorcar carrying jacob colleton kicked up a plume of redbrown dust as it came up the path toward marshlands is everything ready anne colleton demanded of scipio her voice harsh yes maam he answered she would have been astonished to hear him say anything else the room is waiting for him dr benveniste should be here momentarily and we are prepared to do all we can all we can anne echoed there in the back seat of the motorcar sat her brother stiff and pale as a mannequin hed be sitting or standing for a long time maybe for the rest of his life if he lay down the telegram had warned her the fluids in his gasravaged lungs were liable to choke him to death she opened the door as the motorcar jounced to a stop scipio rolled out the wheeled chair that had belonged to her greatgrandfather after he started having strokes but hed been an old man jacob should have had a long healthy life stretching ahead it might still be long the question was did jacob wish it would be short the negro chauffeur anne wondered if he was the man whod driven tom down from columbia but who paid enough attention to negroes to be sure opened the door so jacob could get out of the motorcar the effort of sliding over getting out and walking two steps to the chair set him coughing and that set him groaning he sighed when he sat in the chair and that made him groan anew anne gave the chauffeur two dollars thank you maam he exclaimed tipping his cap the grin was broad and white across his black face shed greatly overpaid him she didnt care her brother was worth it the negro climbed back into the automobile put it in reverse so he could turn away from the mansion and the people who had come out of it and drove off jacob colleton looked up at his sister not quite the homecoming i had in mind when i went off to war he said his voice was a rasping whisper as if he were a hundred years old and had smoked a hundred cigars a day for every one of those years you hush jacob well make you as comfortable as we can anne replied her brothers voice so far from the vibrant baritone she remembered made her grind her teeth at the inadequacy of what shed just said so did the purple circles under his eyes almost the only color in his corpsepale face youre coming home a hero the same way they did after the war of secession a hero his laugh was a coughing wheeze id had two cups of coffee and i was on my way to the latrine when the damnyankees gassed us only fool luck my men took me with em when they fell back otherwise id be in a prison camp or a yankee hospital not a damn thing heroic about it speaking so much gave him color but not of a healthy sort his whole face turned a leaden violet as if he were being strangled and so he was from the inside out he sounded much the way tom had too utterly forgetful of the patriotism that had sent him rushing to join the fight against the usa when we get you to your room what can we bring you anne asked whiskey jacob answered morphia if you can lay hold of it dr benveniste is on his way she said hell prescribe it if he doesnt hell be sorry she nodded to scipio take him upstairs well discuss permanent service arrangements for him shortly yes maam the butler said and then to jacob ill be as careful as i can sir jacob let out a sound full of pain only once when scipio had trouble getting the chair smoothly over the threshold then in the front hall he had to stop because marcel duchamp was standing there and would not move the artist stared avidly at jacob colleton modern man as defective part in the assembly line of war he murmured or is it man as perfect partthe end product of what war is designed to produce he probably did not mean to be offensive he must have seen jacob not as annes injured brother but as an inspiration for art at that moment she did not care what he meant get out she said in a cold deadly voice pack your paintings and be gone from this house by tomorrow but where shall i go duchamp exclaimed in horror sweat beading on his forehead you can go to columbia you can go to charleston or for that matter you can go to hell anne told him crisply i dont care you are no longer welcome here he tried to outstare her to will her into changing her mind men had tried that with her before and all of them had gone away defeated so did marcel duchamp then he tried for the last word you are not modern you are only a rich atavism playing with the new but belonging to the old that held enough truth to hurt looking down at poor jacob anne saw how important things like the ties of family truly were to her if those things had a smaller place in the world duchamp inhabited she would turn her back on that world or on the parts of it she did not care for she let the frenchman see none of that ill take my chances she said and what i told you stands now get out of the way or ill throw you out this instant should have thrown him out before he got here jacob croaked like tom hed had no use for the exhibition of modern art but you dont need to throw him out now on account of me far as i can see he was right thats what war does makes lots and lots of things just like me take him upstairs scipio anne didnt directly answer her brother but she was never one to change her mind once shed made it up duchamp would go or she would throw him out dr saul benveniste arrived a few minutes later a short dark clever man who looked she thought as confederate founding father judah p benjamin might have looked were he as thin as alexander stephens the doctor went upstairs and came down a few minutes later ive given him morphia he said ill leave a supply here so you can give him more whenever the pain is very bad past that he spread his hands and shrugged is there any treatment you can give anne asked something that will make his lungs better i mean not just something to relieve the pain i dont know of any the doctor answered his brown eyes mournful but then nobody knows much about the business of poisonous gases though i expect well all learn you have to understandthe tissue in there is burned i cant repair that from the outside breathing warm moist air may help and marshlands has a good supply of that he may heal some on his own too i cant really offer a longterm prognosis im too ignorant thank you for being honest with me she said ill do everything i can for him benveniste said i dont want you to get any exaggerated notions of how much thats likely to be though thank you anne repeated then she said he wants whiskey will having it make him worse his lungs you mean i dont see why dr benveniste told her most of the time i dont have much good to say about drinking whiskey now though he shrugged again if he hurts less drunk is that so bad not in the least she said all right doctor ill call you as i need you benveniste nodded and left his ford started up with a bang and a belch then rattled away anne went upstairs her brother was sitting up in bed propped up by pillows he had a bit more color than when hed arrived at marshlands nodding to anne he said here i am a relic of war in his ruined voice dr benveniste said they might come up with new ways to make you better before too long anne told him dr benveniste hadnt quite said that but he had said he didnt know much about treating poisongas cases so surely he and other medical men would be learning new things about them and giving her brother hope counted a good deal too best thing he could have done for me was shoot me through the head jacob said morphias the next best thing though im still on fire inside but its not as big a fire he yawned the drug was making him sleepy though his bedroom was rather dim the pupils of his gray eyes were as small as if hed been in bright sunshine he yawned again then started to say something the words turned into a soft snore without his seeming to realize it his eyelids slid shut the snore got deeper raspier anne could hear the breath bubbling in and out of his tormented lungs as if he had pneumonia she walked out into the hall and called one of the servants julia when the negro woman had come into jacobs bedroom she said i want you to sit here and make sure my brother does not lie down no matter what if he starts to slump away from the pillows that are supporting him you are to straighten him up someone will have to be here all the time when hes asleep ill make arrangements with scipio for that do you understand what ive told you yes maam julia said don let mistuh jacob lay hisself down no matter what thats right you stay here till he wakes up or till someone takes your place when julia nodded again anne went out of the room half closing the door behind her quite coldbloodedly she decided to arrange for jacobs tenders to be chosen from among the younger betterlooking wenches of the household she didnt know whether injured as he was he would be able to do anything with them or have them do anything for him if he could she would give him the chance in her office a few doors down from jacobs room the telephone rang she hurried down the hallway the silk of her dress rustling around her ankles picking up the earpiece she spoke into the mouthpiece anne colleton how do miss anne the voice on the other end of the line had a back country rasp to it not a carolina accent at all and certainly not the almost english phrasing of her broker who was the likeliest person to call at this hour and who came from an old charleston family she couldnt immediately place who this caller was though he did sound vaguely familiar when she didnt say anything for a few seconds he went on this heres roger kimball miss anne how are you she needed a moment to place the name even though hed written to her more than once after their encounter on the train to new orleans the randy submersible skipper hello lieutenant kimball she said im well thank you i didnt expect to hear from you where are you calling from lieutenant commander kimball now he told her proudly though i reckon you know me well enough to call me roger that was true in a biblical sense but probably in no other where am i at im in charleston thats where fishing over on the other coast is so bad they moved a good many of us back here i wish you luck with your fishing anne said that was true after what the damnyankees had done to her brother she wanted every ship flying their flag to go straight to the bottom of the sea true or not though she wished shed phrased it differently kimball would think kimball did think since im so close now i was figurin on gettin me some liberty time and then comin up there and he let his voice fade but she knew what he had in mind since shed already given herself to him he thought he could have her any time he wanted that shed made a related calculation about jacob and her serving women never once entered her mind what did enter it was anger lieutenant commander kimball my brother just now came from the western kentucky front suffering from chlorine in the lungs i am not really in the best of positions to entertain visitorslet him take that however he wouldat the present time im very sorry to hear that miss anne the submariner said after a short silence sorry to hear which anne wondered that jacobs been gassed or that i wont let you lay me right now no sooner had the thought crossed her mind than kimball continued that chlorine thats filthy stuff by everything ive heard tell about it i hope your brother didnt get it too bad it isnt good anne said a larger admission than she would have made to someone with whom she was socially more intimate the physical intimacy shed known with kimball was of different substance somehow despite it the two of them remained nearstrangers i really do hope he gets better kimball said and then half to himself nice to know theres somethin in this war you dont have to worry about aboard a submersible that brief bit of selfreflection done he went on all right i wont come up there right awayyoull be busy and all maybe in a few weeks after i make a patrol or two his arrogance was breathtaking so much so that anne instead of going from mere anger to fury admired the quality of his nerve he had been enjoyable on the train and in new orleans a town made for enjoyment if ever there was one thinking about jacob she also thought she was liable to need relief from thinking about jacob she tapped a fingernail on the telephone case indecision was unlike her all right roger maybe in a few weeks she said at last but then warned do telephone first i promise miss anne he said she didnt know what his promises were worth but thought him likely to keep that one he started whistling before he hung up the telephone anne wished she had any reason to be so happy george enos set his gutting knife down on the deck of the steam trawler spray opened the icefilled hold and threw in the haddock and halibut hed just finished cleaning then he went back to the latest load of fish the trawl had just scooped up from the bottom of browns bank the seaman who was helping him clean the fish a fellow named harvey kemmel who spoke with a harsh midwestern accent utterly unlike enos new england dialect wiped his face on his sleeve and said this here fishing for a living its damned hard work you know i had noticed that as a matter of fact george answered dryly as he yanked another squirming halibut up off the deck slit its belly open and pulled out the guts he tossed the fish into the hold and grabbed another one patrick odonnell came aft a mug of the cookies good coffee clamped in his right hand with his left he slapped the side of the hold nice the boats so much like the ripple he said means i dont hardly have to think to know where things are at same with me skipper george enos agreed and i heard charlie say the same thing about the galley i like it that were all still togetherexcept poor lucas i mean me too odonnell agreed he glanced down at the load of fish enos and kemmel were gutting we bring those into boston well make ourselves some pretty fair money off em his gaze swung northward browns bank lay north and east of georges bank where the ripple had usually operated in time of peace that would have mattered only because it cost them more fuel to reach now with the southern coast of nova scotia some of it still unconquered not so far away other concerns also mattered under his breath odonnell added if we get back to boston work went on work always went on and there were never enough men to do it like harvey kemmel several of the other sailors were working aboard a steam trawler for the first time that meant odonnell and enos and even charlie white spent an inordinate amount of time explaining what needed doing which in turn meant they didnt have as much time as they would have liked to do their own work one of the new men a tall skinny fellow named schoonhoven whod started life on a dakota farm was the first to spot the approaching boat skipper he called his voice cracking with what might have been alarm or excitement or a blend of the two tell me thats not a submarine odonnell raised a telescopejust like the one hed had aboard the ripple to his eye all right willem ill tell you thats not a submarine he said and then after a perfectly timed pause he added if you want me to lie to you cleaning flatfish forgotten enos hurried to the rail and peered out across the atlantic it was indeed a submarine traveling on the surface now because the spray couldnt possibly hurt it in case the fishermen hadnt noticed it was there it fired its deck gun a shell sent up a plume of seawater a couple of hundred yards in front of the trawler patrick odonnell ducked into the cabin then came out again in a hurry run up the white flag he shouted maybe theyll let us take to the boats before they sink the trawler as the signal of surrender fluttered up below the us flag the spray was flying odonnell peered once more through the telescope at the submersible thats a confederate boat he ground out the bastards cruise up to canada and back same as the canucks do to their ports the submersible closed rapidly soon enos could see the stars and bars flying above it too a sailor ran out onto the deck of the confederate vessel and began working the signal lamp abandonship along with the rest of the sprays crew enos read the morse as it flashed across the water letter by letter word by word weaimtosinkher theres a surprise charlie white said with a grunt of laughter i figured they were going to buy our fish off us nova scotia coastmilesnorth the signal lamp said someyankheldgoodluckgettingthere thanks a hell of a lot enos said he helped schoonhoven and kemmel put the boat over the side it looked very small and a hundred miles of ocean enormously large he glared toward the rebel submersible muttering and the horse you rode in on too one after another the crewmen from the spray scrambled down into the boat as captain patrick odonnell came last lets get clear he said they worked the oars and moved away from the trawler if no storm rose you could row a hundred miles the boat had food and water and a compass all the same enos hoped they wouldnt have to try it off to the other side of the spray he spotted what looked like a length of pipe sticking up out of the water and moving toward the confederate submarine he deliberately looked away from it the rebs on board the submersible paid it no heed they were intent on coming right up to the spray so they could sink her at pointblank range if you didnt miss you didnt waste shells pay attention to the trawler he thought at the confederates pay attention to the trawler a little longer hed just started to think that again when three men in the boat who hadnt made themselves not look at that moving length of pipe whooped at the top of their lungs odonnells whoop had words in it the fish is away everybody stopped rowing along with everybody else george watched the torpedos wake speed toward the confederate submersible hed never seen anything move so fast in the water run true he breathed come onrun true the torpedo did run true it couldnt have had more than five hundred yards to travel it was a pointblank shot too three rebs were standing with their heads and shoulders out of the conning tower an instant before the torpedo slammed home one of them spotted it enos saw him point he might have yelled something but that was lost in the dull boom of the torpedos slamming into the submarine a little before amidships water and spray spurted up from the explosion hiding the submersible for a moment when it became visible again it had broken in half bow and stern portions both sank amazingly fast diesel oil from the submarine spread over the water flattening out the light chop in the oil floated bits and pieces of debris and three splashing menprobably the ones in the conning tower george thought most of the crew wouldnt have known they were in danger till the torpedo hit lets go pick em up odonnell said and they rowed toward the confederates struggling in the atlantic as they did so the us submersible that had torpedoed the rebel boat surfaced like a broaching whale men tumbled out of the conning tower and ran to the deck gun to cover the confederate sailors enos reached out a hand to one and helped drag him into the boat filled with the crew of the spray the reb was filthy with fuel oil and beneath that dark brown coating looked stunned my name is briggs ralph briggs he gasped in the accent george had learned to hate down in north carolina senior lieutenant confederate states navy he rattled off his pay number welcome aboard senior lieutenant briggs odonnell said as sailors hauled the other two rebel survivors into the boat youre a prisoner of the united states navy briggs looked over to the us submarine then glared at odonnell youre the luckiest damned fisherman in the history of the world pal having that damn boat show up just when we were about to blow you to hell and gone odonnell erupted in laughter so did george enos so did all the other sailors from the spray that wasnt luck reb odonnell said a huge grin on his face we were out hunting boats like you we had the bluefin there on tow behind us all the time when you came up i telephoned em they slipped the line and they put a fish in your boat while you were busy with us we dont need to give you to the bluefin to make you us navy prisoners either enos added gleefully were us navy too but i dont have to tell you my name rank and number more laughter roared out of the sailors and exfishermen who crewed the spray charlie white said how many more rebel submarines do you think we can sink before your boys catch on briggs and the other confederates looked appalled to discover the trap into which theyd walked the senior lieutenant had spunk wet and stunned though he might be savagely he ground out i hope you sons of bitches tow that damned boat right into a mine you go to hell enos said horrified at the notion several other sailors echoed him an officer from the bluefin used a megaphone to shout across the water shall we take your friends off your hands we have more men aboard to keep an eye on them sounds good to me patrick odonnell yelled back they rowed over to the submersible sailors theresailors in navy whites not fishermens dungareeshelped the confederate survivors up onto the bluefins deck and then marched them into the conning tower and down below when they had disappeared odonnell said all right we can go home now they returned to the spray which bobbed in the chop once up on deck charlie white shook himself as if awakening from a happy dream lord that was sweet he said for the black man jeering at the rebels had to be doubly delightful it was plenty sweet enough for george too didnt figure id just keep on doing a fishermans job after i joined the navy he said its worked out pretty well thoughcouldnt have worked out better he turned to patrick odonnell this whole hunting scheme was your idea do you think theyll make you an officer now that its worked im too old and too stubborn to make an officer out of me now odonnell said cpo suits me fine he waved to the cookie charlie why dont you break out the medicinal rum this may be the first submersible a fishing boat ever sank but it isnt going to be the last yes sir white said enthusiastically you werent supposed to call a chief petty officer sir but odonnell didnt correct him sam carsten was walking along the wharf toward the dakota when all the antiaircraft guns at pearl harbor started going off at once guided by the puffs of black smoke suddenly blossoming in the sky he spotted an aeroplane flying so high it seemed nothing more than a speck up in the sky too high for him to catch the sound of its engine for a moment he stood watching the spectacle wondering if the guns could bring down the aeroplane then he realized that if they were shooting at it it had to be hostile and a hostile aeroplane could not have come from anywhere on the sandwich islands which were firmly under the control of the united states it had to have been launched from an enemy ship and an enemy ship not too far away and an enemy ship means an enemy fleet he said out loud and an enemy fleet means one hell of a big fight he started running back toward the dakota as he did so klaxons and hooters began squalling out the alert the guns had first signaled when he got to the battleships deck he looked around for the aeroplane again there it was streaking away to the southeast he pointed to it we follow that bearing and well find the limeys or the japs one of the sailors near him said yeah another one though said thanks a lot admiral carsten shook his head you said anything on a ship somebody would give you a hard time about it battle stations shouted people who really were officers all hands to battle stations prepare to get under way carsten sighed as he sprinted toward his own post inside the sponson you couldnt see anything all you ever got were orders and rumors neither of which was apt to tell you what you most wanted to know as usual sam got to the fiveinch gun after hiram kidde but only moments after him because no one else but the gunners mate was there when he arrived do you know whats up for sure capn he asked kidde shook his head limeys or japs dont know which that carsten had figured out for himself the gunners mate went on dont much care either theyre out there well smash em the rest of the crew was not far behind luke hoskins said i heard it was the japs one of the other shelljerkers pete jonas had heard it was the english they argued about it which struck carsten as stupid what point to getting yourself in an uproar about something you couldnt prove the deck vibrated under carstens feet as the engines built up power lieutenant commander grady who was in charge of all the guns of the starboard secondary armament stuck his head into the cramped sponson to make sure everything and everyone was ready even though they were still in harbour he didnt know to whom the aeroplane had belonged after grady had hurried away carsten said thereyou see if the lieutenant commander doesnt know whats going on anybody who says he does is just puffing smoke out his stack were moving kidde said a few minutes later and then after that i wonder how theywhoever they are sams right about thatmanaged to sneak a fleet past our patrols and aeroplanes however they did it theyre gonna regret it there wasnt much to see there wasnt much to do either not until theyd caught up to whatever enemy ships had dared approach the sandwich islands the gun crew took turns peering through their narrow view slits hoskins and jonas quit arguing about who the enemy was and started arguing about how much of the fleet had sortied with the dakota given how little they could see that argument was about as useless as the other after he couldnt see oahu any more carsten stopped looking out hed seen a lot of ocean since he joined the navy and one trackless stretch of it looked a hell of a lot like another he didnt get bored easily which was one of the reasons he made a good sailor lieutenant commander grady came back his thin face red with excitement for once its the japs he said one of our aeroplanes has spotted them looks like a force of cruisers and destroyersthey must have figured they could sneak in for a raid throw some shells at us and then run home for the philippines again we get to show em theyre wrong doesnt look like they know theyve been seen either he rubbed his hands in anticipation told you it was the japs hoskins said triumphantly ahh go to hell jonas said not much of a comeback but the best he could do when his idea had struck a mine stupid slanteyed bastards hiram kidde said if theyre raiding us they dont want their damned aeroplane spotted that pilots going to join his honourable ancestors when they find out he dropped the ball like that cruisers and destroyers sam said dreamily he patted the breech of the fiveinch gun theyll be sorry they ever ran into us the big guns up topll pound em to bits at a lot longer range than they can hit back from thats why we built em kidde said he didnt sound dreamy he sounded predatory by the sound by the feel of the engines they were making better than twenty knots an hour passed after they steamed out of pearl harbor then another one a colored steward came by with sandwiches and coffee from the galley pete jonas got out a deck of cards kidde waved for him to put it back in his pocket he made a sour face but obeyed all of a sudden the dakota swung hard aport the engines roar picked up the flank speed what the deuce luke hoskins said an instant before the torpedo slammed into the port side of the ship the deck jerked under carstens feet if you got hit the rightor rather the wrongway the shock wave from an explosion like that could break your ankles that didnt happen but sam sat down hard on the steel plates of the deck the electric lights in the sponson flickered then for a dreadful second or two they went out oh sweet jesus jonas moaned which was pretty much what carsten was thinking too he scrambled to his feet hed just regained them when the lights came back on he glanced toward the door that led out of the sponson out to the stairway to the top deck out to the deck itself out to the lifeboats he didnt move toward the door not a step nobody else did either in spite of bawling klaxons and shouts outside in the corridor they were still at battle stations nobody had given any orders about abandoning ship dangerhell fearmade his mind work very quickly very clearly we got suckerpunched he exclaimed nothing else but the japs put that little fleet out there where we had to spot itchrist they sent out that aeroplane to lead us right to it and they posted submersibles right out here between it and pearl and just sat there waiting for us to come running out and we didand look what it got us how come youre so goddamn much smarter than the admiral kidde sounded half sardonic half respectful not likely sam answered now that weve been torpedoed i bet hes figured out whats going on too if the engines quit were in trouble luke hoskins said thatll mean the boilers are flooded he stood quite still a thoughtful look on his face were listing to port i think carsten could feel it too the deck wasnt level not any more he glanced to the doorway again if he left without orders it was a courtmartial if he stayed and the battleship sank a courtmartial was the least of his worries but the engines kept running and the list wasnt getting worse in a hurry lieutenant commander grady came in looks like were going to make it he said compartmentings holding up engines are safe and the aft magazine didnt go up he scratched his chin if it had i think we would have known it so what have we got sir kidde asked a couple thousand tons of water in us something like that grady agreed we limp back to pearl harbor if we can we go into drydock for six months or however long it takes to patch us up again and then we go back to war his features lean scholarlymore a professors face than a naval officerswent grim we got off lucky they sank the denver and it doesnt look like many of her crew had time to get off before she went down not a better cruiser in the pacific fleet than the denver they were laying for us carsten said they showed the fleet and the aeroplane to bring us out and then id say youre right grady replied the ships kept the submarines in fuel and supplies too not likely theyd have the range to go from manila to here and back without stocking up along the way i hope the rest of the fleet manages to punish them were out of the fight for now out of the fight the words seemed to echo in the sponson as grady left to pass the news to the rest of the gun crews under his command the dakota swung through a long slow turn as awkward as a horse with a lame hind leg and began limping back toward pearl harbor they hadnt done anything wrong except pursue too eagerly but they were sure as hell out of the fight fuck it were alive luke hoskins said sam looked back at the doorway one last time he wouldnt have to run out through it hoping he could make it up on deck before water or fire engulfed him when you got down to it that wasnt such a bad bargain were alive he repeated and the words sounded very fine mary mcgregor bounced up and down on the seat of the wagon beside her father what are we going to get she said shed been saying that ever since theyd left the farm for the trip into rosenfeld manitoba as hed done every time she asked arthur mcgregor answered i dont know youre the one whos turning seven today ive got fifty cents in my pocket and you can spend it any way you please ill get a store doll one with real glass eyes mary declared then she shook her head making her auburn curls fly around her face no i wont ill get candy how much candy can i get for fifty cents pa enough to make you sick for a week mcgregor answered laughing his youngest child was full of extravagant notions he figured a few more years of living on the farm would cure her of most of them off to the north artillery rumbled mary took no notice of it prattling on cheerfully about everything on which she might spend her halfdollar if she got everything she wanted it could easily have cost mcgregor fifty times that moreover her choice was liable to be severely limited if henry gibbon didnt have it in his general store she couldnt get it her father let her go on all the same dreams were free even if presents werent the artillery rumbled again arthur mcgregor sighed though dreams were free they didnt always come true when the anglocanadian offensive opened and pushed the americans south from winnipeg hed dreamt they would throw the yankees out of canada altogether but rosenfeld had never seen a single khaki uniform not unless the yanks had shipped prisoners through the town and his farm hadnt even come within artillery range of the front it was high summer now and everything around these parts remained under the muscular thumb of the usa coming into rosenfeld he saw just how muscular that thumb had be come soldiers in greengray crowded the streets some no doubt going up toward the front some coming back for relief their boots and the tires of motorcars and great grunting white trucks made dust swirl like fog all through the town they had soldiers serving as traffic policemen now halting a stream of trucks so an officer in an automobile could cut across now halting a column of men who looked fresh off the train so more trucks could get through and now holding up mcgregor to let another column of soldiers these men veterans go by from the veterans whose uniforms were sunbleached and imperfectly clean rose a smell that put him in mind of the farmhouse the morning before the bathtub got filled hed smelled it in barracks too and especially out on manoeuvresmen on the front line had little incentive and less ability to keep clean get off the main road canuck one of the soldiers called pointing the wagon onto a little side street there wasnt any particular animosity in the or der mcgregor could even see the need for it but whats a canuck pa mary asked as he stopped disrupting traffic you are he answered getting out of the wagon to tie the horse to a hitching post i am he picked her up and put her down on the plank sidewalk its what americans call canadians when they dont like us much oh she thought about that then nodded you mean the way we call them goddamn stinking yanks yes just like that he said and coughed but we dont call them that where they can hear us and for that matter who called them that where you could hear him it wasnt a himit was ma mary answered which made mcgregor cough all over again hed have to have a talk with maude when he got home mary went on how come they get to call us names whenever they please and we dont get to call them names whenever we please thats not fair because they have more guns than we do and they drove our soldiers out of this part of the country he told her if you have more guns in a war you get to say whats fair she chewed on that to his relief she didnt argue with him about it he took her hand and walked toward the general store several us soldiers smiled at her along the way a lot of them werent far from mcgregors age reservists called up for the war probably with daughters as old as mary or maybe even older she took no notice of the americans she made a point of taking no notice of the americans mornin arthur henry gibbon said when they went into the general store gibbon beamed down at mary and a good mornin to you little lady good morning mr gibbon she answered very politely the storekeeper being a canadian deserved not only notice but respect reason were here mcgregor said is that somebody here just turned seven years old and shes got half a dollar to spend however she pleases shell be wanting to look at your toys and dolls and candy unless i miss my guess we can probably do somethin along those lines gibbon said he beck oned mary over to the jars of sweets on his counter why dont you have a look at these here little lady and ill see what ive got in the way of toys he glanced up at marys father were apt to be a bit picked over things bein like they is i understand that he answered but if anybody in rosenfeld has anything good youre the man that i am the storekeeper agreed solemnly he had just turned around to see what a pasteboard box held when something exploded across the street the plateglass window at the front of the general store shattered fragments flying inward one glittering shard flicked mcgregors sleeve another stuck out of the floor boards bare inches from his foot mary screamed he ran to her and scooped her up afraid some of the shrapnellike slivers of glass had cut or stabbed her but she wasnt bleeding anywhere though glass dust sparkled in her hair like diamonds she trembled in his arms holy jesus henry gibbon said he looked at what had been his window and said holy jesus again louder then he looked out through what had been his window and said holy jesus a third time louder still this time he amplified it somewhat thats the register office blown to hell and gone mcgregor had been too worried about his daughter even to think about what might have blown up out there now he looked too sure enough the woodandbrick building that had housed rosenfelds weekly newspaper was nothing but a ruin now and beginning to burn if the fire engines didnt get here in a tearing hurry that whole block was liable to go up in smoke and maybe this one too if the wind blew sparks across the street in the street lay us soldiers some down and writhing some down and still a couple of horses were down too screaming like women in torment an officer went up to them and quickly put them out of their torment with his pistol mcgregor thought well of him for that he would have done the same in that spirit he set mary down and went out of the general store to see if he could do anything for the wounded us soldiers they were the enemy yes but watching anybody suffer wasnt easy one of them had a leg bent at an un natural angle mcgregor knew how to set broken bones he never got the chance the officer whod shot the two horses swung up his pistol and aimed it at mcgregors head dont move canuck he snapped youll be hostage number one well take twenty of you bastards and if the bomber doesnt give himself up well line you up against a wall and teach you a lesson youll remember the rest of your life he laughed mcgregor froze hed known the yankees did things like that but hed never imagined it could happen to him mary came flying out of the general store dont you point a gun at my pa she screamed at the officer mcgregor grabbed her before she could hurl herself against the american he had to move to do that but the man didnt fire henry gibbon came out of the store too have a heart crane he said to the us officer arthur mcgregors no bomber and he doesnt live in town so he doesnt make much of a hostage neither only reason he came in is that todays his little girls seventh birthday he pointed to mary the us officercranescowledbut after a moment he lowered the pistol all right he said to mcgregor get the hell out of here mcgregors legs felt loose and light with fear and relief so he seemed to be floating above the ground not walking on it he steered mary toward the side street on which hed left the wagon but i didnt get my birthday presents she said and started to cry oh yes you did he told her no i didnt she said not anything not even one peppermint drop oh yes you did he repeated so emphatically that she looked up in puzzled curiosity he pointed to himself do you know what you got you got to keep me she kept on crying he wasnt a doll or a ball or a top or a peppermint drop he didnt care he was alive and he was going to stay that way a while longer jefferson pinkard got to the foundry floor at the sloss works a few minutes early as he usually did vespasian and agrippa the two negroes whod taken over the night shift nodded and said mornin mistuh pinkard together mornin pinkard said both blacks had proved themselves solid workers worthy of being talked with almost as if they were white men he looked around wheres pericles at hes usually in here before i am after a pause vespasian said he aint corain in today mistuh pinkard oh jeff said he sick pericles and vespasian were kin or inlaws or something of the sort he couldnt quite remember what just because you talked with black men didnt mean you had to keep track of every little thing about them vespasian shook his head no suh he aint sick he answered he sounded tired unto death not just because of the nights work but also from a lifetimes worth of weariness a moment later the words dragging out of him one by one he went on no suh like i say he aint sick he in de jailhouse in the jailhouse pericles that caught pinkard by surprise what the devil did he do get drunk and go after somebody with a busted bottle that didnt sound like pericles a sobersided young buck if ever there was one and vespasian shook his head again no suh he do somethin like that we can fix it he in de jailhouse for sedition he whispered the word pronouncing it with exaggerated care sedition now jefferson pinkard frankly stared vespasian was right he thought you could fix a charge of brawling against a black man easily enough provided he hadnt hit a white of course if he was a good worker a couple of words from his boss to the police or the judge would get him off with a small fine maybe just a lecture about keeping his nose clean but seditionthat was another ball of wax neither vespasian nor agrippa said much more about it they waited till it was time for them to go off shift then left in a hurry pinkard didnt suppose he could blame them when one of your own got into trouble you didnt spend a lot of time talking about that trouble with an outsider he had to start his shift by his lonesome which left him too busy to think about anything else about half an hour into the shift a colored fellow who introduced himself as leonidas joined him jeff hoped to high heaven leonidas wouldnt take pericles place for good he was strong enough but he wasnt very smart and he didnt remember from one minute to the next what pinkard had told him jeff kept him from getting hurt or from messing up the job at least half a dozen times that morning it was more nerveracking than doing everything by himself would have been because he never knew ahead of time when or how leonidas would go wrong and had to stay on his toes every second when the lunch whistle blew pinkard sighed with reliefhalf an hour when he wouldnt have to worry see you at one suh leonidas said taking his dinner bucket and heading off to eat with other negroes yeah pinkard said he wondered if leonidas could find some way to kill himself when he wasnt anywhere near the foundry floor he wouldnt have been a bit surprised the negro was an accident waiting to happen and probably could happen any old place pinkard opened his own dinner pail he had a chunk of cornbread and a couple of pieces of roasted chicken in there leftovers from the night before hed just started to eat when a couple of middleaged fellows in gray police uniforms came up to him you jefferson davis pinkard asked the one who wore a matching gray mustache thats me jeff said with his mouth full he chewed swallowed and then asked more clearly whore you im bob mulcahy the policeman with the mustache answered he pointed to his cleanshaven partner this heres bill fitzcolville were looking into the matter of a nigger named pericles hear tell hes been working alongside you a while thats a fact pinkard agreed and took another bite of chicken they werent going to hold things up on the floor because he was talking with po lice if he didnt feed his face hed have to go hungry till suppertime this pericles he been a troublemaker uppity anything like that mul cahy asked not hardly pinkard shook his head didnt cotton to the notion of workin with a nigger not even a little bit i tell you but it aint worked out too bad he does his job did his job i guess i oughta say this nigger leonidas buck they gave me instead of him he aint fit to carry guts to a bear doesnt look like but pericles he pulled his weight fitzcolville scribbled down his words in a notebook mulcahy shifted a goodsized chaw of tobacco from right cheek to left then asked this nigger pericles he a smart fellow or a dumb one nothin dumb about him jeff answered you show him somethin once you tell him somethin once you dont need to do it twice on account of he remembers it and does it right his own self uhhuh fitzcolville grunted as if pinkard had said something alto gether damning mulcahy kept on with his questions steadily imperturbably he ever talk about anything political while the two of you was working together political pinkard paused for a bite of cornbread what the hell kind of politics is a nigger supposed to have it aint like he can vote or nothin oh niggers have politics all right mulcahy said red politics too damn many of em this pericles he ever talk about how the war was going or how the war was changing things here back at home red politics emily had said something like that and he hadnt taken it seriously the birmingham police did jeff said we was talkin one time about how after herb wallace got hisself killed in the war the sloss folks threw his widow out of factory housing here pericles didnt reckon that was fair uhhuh fitzcolville said again and scrawled more notes you gonna call him a red for that pinkard demanded you better call me a red right at the same time cause i think it stinks like shit too what they done to daisy here her husbands gone and got killed for the sake of the fat cats up in richmond and they throw her out of her place like a dog you call that the way things oughta be hed gone too far he could see it by the way the two policemen stared at himstared through him really maybe you are a red mulcahy said but i doubt it most of the ones who are have too much sense to run off at the mouth like you do sides white men can pretty much say what they please its a free country niggers now we gotta watch niggers i been watchin this crazy damnfool nigger leonidas every goddamn minute of the mornin shift pinkard said you give me a choice between him and pericles ill take pericles every goddamn time when hes here he does his job i dont know what he does when he aint here and i dont care thats not your job mulcahy said it is our job and weve found this nigger tied up in all sorts of stuff niggers got no business sticking their noses into whatever else he is hes a steel man jeff answered steel hes helped make i reckon its done more to hurt the damnyankees than anything else hes done has hurt us the two policemen looked at each other maybe they hadnt thought of it like that maybe too they just didnt care for the idea of a white man speak ing up for a black that second maybe soon proved the true one for mulcahy said you like that nigger pretty well dont you pinkard surged to his feet get out of here he said his voice thick with anger and cornbread both both policemen gave back a step too the foundry floor was no place for anyone unused to it to feel comfortable either jeff had an advantage and he used it you got a lot o damn nerve you know that callin me a niggerlover like i aint a proper white man go on get the hell out didnt mean it like that pinkard bob mulcahy said just trying to get to the bottom of who all this damn niggers been messing with he aint messed much with me and he know what hes doin too not like this lamebrained halfwit they saddled me with now that you took him away pinkard said pretty soon way things look theyre gonna drag my ass off to war hell of a lot o white men gone already you want to keep makin steel its gonna be niggers doin the work mostly maybe you ought to think about stuff like that a little more often fore you start haulin hardworkin bucks off to the jailhouse for no reason at all weve been thinking about it bill fitzcolville said proving he did have more words in him than ubbub dont like the answers we get neither but this here pericles we got him dead to rights mulcahy said found all kinds of subversive literature at his house marx and engels and lincoln and haywood and i dont know who all else niggers aint allowed to have that kind of stuff hell spend a while cooling off in jail thats for damn sure were trying to track down how much damage hes done is what were doing here like i said he aint done me any damage i know of pinkard said the policemen shrugged and left but he didnt think that meant he was going to get pericles back any time soon hed just have to go and see if he couldnt turn leonidas into something a little bit like a steelworker the odds were against him he could see that much already he sighed life could be a real pisser sometimes no two ways about it xvi c aptain elijah franklin stuck out his hand were going to miss you here moss he said the pilots and observers in jonathan moss squadron all nodded so did the mechanics moss knew why lefty would miss him no more easy pickings at the poker table ill miss you too sir and everybody else here he said but ive been sort of a fifth wheel ever since percy got hurt and when this chance to transfer came along it looked too good to pass up fighting scouts i should say so stanley mcclintock said he twiddled with one of the waxed spikes of his mustache you never did like the idea of company in your aeroplane did you why darling i didnt know youd miss me that way moss said archly the laugh he got let him slide over the fact that mcclintock had a point hed been the one whod complained longest and hardest about the introduction of the twoseater wright s in the old super hudsons you had nobody but yourself to blame if you made a mistake up there the new fighting scouts were like that too you did what you did and if you did it right you lived and you got to keep on doing it if not it was your own damn fault no one elses people crowded round him pressing chocolate and flasks of brandy and whiskey into his pockets they slapped him on the back and wished him luck mcclintock wasnt the only one who looked jealous if you did your job in a twoseater your observer took his pictures and you came home and got them developed if you did your job in a fighting scout you shot down enemy aeroplanes and soldiers in the trenches shouted their heads off for you so did reporters if you shot down enough enemy aeroplanes people back home shouted their heads off for you come on lets go lefty said moss shouldered his duffel bag and climbed into the ford that did duty as squadron transport unlike models that came off the assembly line this one had been modified to boast an electric starter button on the dashboard lefty mashed it with his thumb the engine thundered to life as they rolled away from the aerodrome lefty handed moss a pair of dice you ever get in a hot crap game where you need some sevens in a hurry these are the babies to have moss stared down at the ivory cubes in the palm of his hand lefty doubt less meant them for a thoughtful goingaway present they made him thoughtful all right he thought about what a profitable time lefty had had ever since the squadron went into canada as if reading his mind the mechanic said i never use em myself and nobodyll ever be able to prove i do same goes for poker lieutenant in case youre wondering know what youre doing and youll never need to cheat by which he was saying moss didnt know what he was doing at cards or dice he probably knew what he was talking about too the ford rattled along the road was nothing to boast about which made the motorcars big wheels and high ground clearance all the more valuable nothing in americanheld ontario was anything to boast about though every inch had been fought over every inch wrecked what had been little farms by the side of the road were now cratered ground and rubble with hardly a house standing here and there skinny people came out of ruins to glower at the automobile as it rolled past lefty pulled off the road and onto a new track made by us vehicles after the war had passed this stretch of canada the fighting scouts having shorter range than the observation aeroplanes were based closer to the front the strip on which they took off and landed had so much fresh dirt on it it had pretty obviously been shelled not long before the land then releveled by trac tors or more likely by lots of men working hard alongside the strip sat the martin singledeckers next to the bulky wilburs hed been flying they looked little and low and fast next to the cur tiss super hudsons pushers with more wires and struts than you could shake a stick at they looked like something out of the s maybe the s not merely next years model you got to hand it to kaiser bills boys lefty said stamping on the none too effective brake to bring the ford to a halt when you needed to stop in a hurry stamping on the reverse was a better idea puffy summer clouds drifted lazily across the sky they know how to make aeroplanes no two ways about it yeah moss said with a small sigh the wright brothers might have flown the first aeroplane in but the machines had evolved faster in europe than in the usa the singledecker was a straight knockoff of the fokker monoplanes now flying above france and belgium also a knockoff was the machine gun mounted above the engine almost the only bulge marring the smooth lines of the aeroplane good to know somebody finally figured out how to build a decent interrupter gear even if it wasnt us we get to borrow it thats right lieutenant lefty said chew the hell out of the canucks and the limeys for me you hear he stuck out his hand moss shook it then grabbed his duffel bag and jumped down from the ford lefty took his foot off the brake gave the motorcar more throttle with the hand control and puttputted away shouldering the bag moss made for the canvas tents that housed his new squadron such arrangements were all very well now with the weather warm but could you live in a tent in the middle of winter maybe the war would be over and he wouldnt have to find out he clicked tongue between teeth hed believed nonsense like that the year before he was a tougher sell now somebody came out of the closest tent and spotted him moss isnt it the man called with a friendly wave welcome to the monkey house thank you captain pruitt moss said letting the bag fall so he could salute shelby pruitt lazily returned the gesture moss had already gathered hed have to get used to a new style here captain franklin his co since the start of the war had been the sort who dotted every i and crossed every t pruitt didnt seem the sort to make much fuss over little things as long as the big ones were all right now he said come along with me well give you someplace or other where you can lay your weary head he didnt particularly look like a flier he was short and dark and on the dumpy sideand his southwestern accent made him sound almost like a reb when you watched him move though you got the idea he always knew exactly where every part of him was at every moment and that was something a pilot certainly needed he led moss along the row of greengray canvas shelters till he flipped up one flap ah thought so he said weve got room at the inn here peering in moss saw the tent held four cots the space around one of them conspicuously bare and empty one airman sat on the edge of his bed writing a letter he looked up at moss and said youre the new fish are you im daniel dudleythey mostly call me dud he shrugged resignedly he had a pale bony face and a grin that was engaging even if a little cadaverous jonathan moss moss said and shook hands he set his gear down on the empty cot pruitt nodded to him then went off on whatever other business he had moss understood his offhandedness he wouldnt really be part of the squadron till hed flown his first mission dudley made a small production out of sticking the cap back onto his fountain pen that let him effectively do nothing till captain pruitt was out of earshot then he asked what do you think of hardshell so far moss needed a moment to grasp the nickname the captain you mean he asked to make sure he had it right when dudley didnt say no he went on he seems all right to me friendlier than the fellow im leaving thats clear what do you think of him hell do no doubt about it dudley took a panatela out of a teakwood cigar case he offered the case to moss who shook his head the pilot bit off the end of his cigar lighted it and sighed with pleasure who else sleeps here moss asked pointing to the other two cots tom innis and luther carlsen the other pilot answered good eggs both of em luthers a big blond handsome guy and thinks hes a wolf if the girls thought so too hed do pretty well for himself thats true about a lot of guys who think theyre wolves moss said to which dudley nodded moss turned serious in a hurry though what can you tell me about the martin that i wont have picked up from training on it good question dudley said a wide smile only made him look more skulllike than ever but he couldnt help that weve just been flying martins a month or so ourselves they dont have a lot of vices that weve found good speed good view good acrobatics he paused oh there is one thing whats that moss leaned forward every once in a while the interrupter gear will get a little bit out of alignment how do you find out about that you shoot your own prop off and you shoot yourself down daniel dudley answered his face clouded thats what happened to smitty the guy who used to have that cot if it does happen to you the beast is noseheavy you have to watch it in your glide thanks ill remember moss started unpacking his bag when do you suppose theyll let me up in one tomorrow unless im all wet dudley answered hardshell doesnt be lieve in letting people sit around and get rusty he was right captain pruitt sent moss up as tailend charlie on a flight of four martinshimself and his tentmatesthe very next morning his scout aeroplane was factorynew still stinking of the dope that made the fabric of wings and fuselage impenetrable to air but the mechanics here had modified it as they had the other three martins of the flight by mounting on the left side of the wooden cockpit frame a rearview mirror like those on some of the newest model motorcars moss found that a very clever idea one that would keep his neck from developing a swivel mount the rotary engine kicked over at once when a mechanic spun the prop castoroil fumes from the exhaust blew in his face the inline engine in the wright he had flown had been petroleumlubricated which had made his bowels happier than they were liable to be now one after another the four singledeckers took off moss tried to get a handle on innis and carlsen by the way they flew their aeroplanes he hadnt had much chance to talk with them the day before carlsen was always exactly where he was supposed to be in the flight which dud dudley led cap tain franklin would have approved of that precise finicky approach innis on the other hand was all over the place whether that bespoke imagination or carelessness remained to be seen up to the front they flew dudley swung the nose of his martin so that he flew parallel to the front on the american side of the line the rest of the flight followed innis frisking a little up and down from side to side they were under orders as strict as captain pruitt could make them not to cross over to enemyheld territory no matter what neither the canadians nor the british yet had a working interrupter gear and nobody in the usa wanted to hand them one on a platter flying a combat patrol was nothing like being trained on a new aero plane moss had discovered that when hed made the transition from the su per hudson to the wright and now found out all over again when you were in training you were concentrating on your aeroplane and learning its idiosyncrasies when you were up here on patrol all you cared about was the other fellows aeroplane with your own reduced in your thoughts to a tool youd use to shoot him down he spotted the avro in that newfangled rearview mirror it had probably been flying a reconnaissance mission on the american side of the line and was now heading back toward canadian territory with its pictures or sketches or whatever it had moss peeled off from the flight and gave his martin single decker all the power it had as he raced toward the avro its pilot spotted him and tried to bank away which also gave the observer a better shot at him he dove and then climbed rapidly all he had to do was point his aeroplanes nose at the enemy and squeeze the firing button on his machine gun hed practiced shooting during training but having the bullets miss the prop still seemed half like black magic to him the avro was still trying to manoeuvre into a position from which it could effectively defend itself he kept firing playing the stream of bullets as if they were water from a hose all at once the avro stopped dodging and nosed toward the ground as he had with his first kill back when the war was young he must have put the pilot out of action the observer kept shooting long after he had any hope of scoring a hit martin respected his courage and wondered what he was thinking about during the long dive toward death he looked around to see if he could spot any more british or canadian aeroplanes he saw none but all his flightmates were close by he hadnt noticed them coming to his aid hed been thinking about the avro nothing else dudley innis and carlsen were waving and blowing him kisses he waved back he might not have fully belonged in his new squadron the day before but he did now the us army sergeant doing paymaster duty shoved a dollar and a half across the table at cincinnatus and checked off his name on the list you get the bonus again today he said thats twice now this week aint it dont usually see lieutenant kennan actin so free and easy with the governments money dont usually see him give a negro anything close to an even break was what he meant cincinnatus had no doubt that was true but for a white man for a us soldierthe paymaster seemed decent enough figuring he owed him an answer cincinnatus said whatever you do you got to do it as good as you can yeah that aint a bad way to look at things the sergeant agreed but you made kennan notice how good youre doin it you got a black hide and you manage that you got to be doin awful damn fine my wifes gonna have a baby cincinnatus said extra halfdollar now and then it means a lot he cut it short after that no point to getting the la bourers in line behind him angry he was about halfway home when it started to rain herodotus and a couple of the other negroes with whom he was walking ducked under an awning for protection the awning conveniently for them was in front of a saloon they went on inside cincinnatus kept going he took off his hat and turned his face up to the warm rain letting it wash the sweat off him that felt good sometimes after a hot muggy day he felt as crusted in salt as a pretzel when he walked past conroys general store he looked in through the window as he often did one lone white man was in there with the storekeeper after a second glance cincinnatus stiffened that white man was tom kennedy kennedy saw him too and waved for him to come inside he did his heart full of foreboding a us army patrol was walking down the other side of the street one of the men paused to smear petroleum jelly on his bayonet to hold back the rain all they had to do was look over and recognize kennedy and everything went up in smoke they didnt they just kept walk ing one of them making a lewd crack about what else you could do with a greasy hand hello cincinnatus kennedy said about as cordially as if cincinnatus had been white he didnt know whether he liked that or not it made him nervous he did know that he wished kennedy had never come knocking at his door in the middle of the night but kennedy had evenin cincinnatus answered reluctantly what kin i do for you today glad you stopped in kennedy said again sounding as if cincinnatus were a favourite customer rather than a negro labourer would have had some body by to pay you a visit tonight if you hadnt is that a fact cincinnatus sounded dubious the last thing he wanted was some white man coming around his house late at night hed been lucky none of the neighbours had said anything to the us soldiers after kennedy paid him a visit that first time lucky once didnt have anything to do with lucky twice though halfprobably more than halfthe negroes in coving ton preferred the usa to the csa although a plague on both their houses had wide popularity among them too who wants to visit me and how come kennedy and conroy looked at each other kennedy kept doing the talking which was smart because cincinnatus trusted him further than the storekeeper he said weve got a delivery we need you to make he grinned sort of like old times isnt it not so youd notice cincinnatus answered what did you have in mind drive a truck up in front of my house dont think id much fancy that hed been trained to be cautious and polite around whites so as not to let them know everything that was going on in his head that was the only thing that kept him from shouting are you out of your skull mr kennedy sir nothing like that kennedy said raising a soothing hand well have somebody bring by a wagon with a mule pulling it nothing that would look out of place in your part of town the unspoken assumption that that was the way things ought to be in the negro district of covington grated on cincinnatus oblivious kennedy went on well have a colored fellow drivin it too so you dont need to worry about that either you already got a wagon and a driver you dont need me mr kennedy cincinnatus said he put his hat back on and touched a forefinger to the brim see you another time evenin mr conroy get back here conroy snapped as cincinnatus turned to go we know where you live boy remember that cincinnatus had had all the threats he could stomach blackmail cut both ways i know where youre at too mr conroy aint never had reason to talk to the yankee soldiers but i know impasse conroy glanced at cincinnatus he didnt glare back in the confederacy even the occupied parts of it blacks showed whites respect whether they deserved it or not wed really rather you did this cincinnatus kennedy said weve got this other fellow yeah but we dont know how reliable he is we can trust you you can trust me cincinnatus said kennedys reasonable tones in their own way irked him more than the storekeepers bluster bitterly he asked how do i know i can trust you why should i suppose the confederate states do win this here war what kind of place are they gonna be for colored folks afterwards everything stay the same it aint worth livin for us not hardly conroy looked as if hed just taken a big bite out of a florida lemon tom kennedy sighed reckon its going to be some different he said all the niggers working in factories these days the csa could hardly fight the war without em you think they can send em all packing send em back to picking cotton and growing rice and tobacco when the war is over they can try but you cant unring a bell i dont think itll work what he said made the storekeeper look even more unhappy never should have set the niggers free in the first place conroy muttered a little too late to worry about that now wouldnt you say kennedy scraped a match on his shoe and lighted a stogie hell i hear theres talk about putting negroes in butternut and giving em rifles you get in a war like this youve got to fight with everything you have damn foolishness conroy said he looked cincinnatus straight in the eye and if you want to tell the yankees i said so go right ahead he was at least honest in his likes and dislikes tom kennedy blew a smoke ring then held his cigar in a placatory hand we dont want to get in a quarrel here joe he said from which cincinna tus learned conroys christian name but if a nigger fights for the csa how are you going to take his gun away and tell him hes got to go back to being a nigger once the fightings done hed spit in your eye and would you blame him shit conroy said even the damnyankees got better sense than to go giving niggers guns mr conroy cincinnatus said quietly i aint carryin no tredegar rifle but aint i fightin for the csa the yankees catch me they wont give me no medal all they do is put me up against a wall and shoot me same as theyd do with you hes right joe kennedy said go ahead tell him he isnt he doesnt want to take the packages over to the kentucky smoke house he aint right at alljust a damn lyin nigger conroy said kentucky smoke house hell you dont need me to take anything there cincinnatus said yall could go your own selves an nobodyd notice anything different that was only the slightest of exaggerations the kentucky smoke house did up the best barbecue anywhere between north carolina and texas that was what the proprietor an enormous colored fel low named apicius claimed and by the hordes of negroes and steady stream of whites who came to the tumbledown shack out of which he operated he might well have been right easier sending somebody colored safer too kennedy said which was probably true if youre making the delivery people will think youre bringing him tomatoes or spices or something like that joe or me wed stick out too much hauling crates that was also probably true cincinnatus sighed sensing his weakening conroy said got the wagon and mule out back in the alley waiting to be loaded cincinnatus sighed again and nodded good fellow kennedy said and tossed him something he caught automatically this is for taking the risk cincinnatus looked down at the fivedollar stonewall in his hand a moment later the gold piece was in his pocket along with the dollar and a half hed made bonus included for eleven and a half hours of gruelling labour on the docks without another word conroy led him into the back room and pointed to a couple of crates and a tarp he opened the door out onto the alley cincinnatus picked up the crates which felt very full and were heavy for their size then heaved the canvas sheet over them the rain had stopped but no guessing whether it might start up again the weight of the crates and the need for the tarpaulin made cincinnatus guess they held pamphlets or papers of some sort he hadnt driven a mule for a while kennedy had bought motor trucks three years before but he discovered he still knew how and the mule a tired beast with drooping ears didnt give him any trouble kennedy and conroy had done one thing right no one black or white paid any attention to a negro on a battered wagon pulled by a lazy mule if theyd wanted him to leave a bomb in front of us army headquarters he could have done that too he thought and slipped away with no one the wiser his nose guided him to the kentucky smoke house a lot of buggies and wagons were tied up nearby along with a couple of motorcars again he re mained inconspicuous the sweet smell of smoke and cooking meat made spit flood into his mouth when he went inside there stood apicius splashing sauce on a spitted pigs carcass with a paintbrush got a couple boxes for you from mistuh conroy cincinnatus said coming up close so nobody else could hear the fat cook nodded felix he bawled lucullus two youths with his looks but without his bulk came hurrying up to him he jerked a thumb at cincinnatus he got the packages we been waitin fo his sonsfor so cincinnatus figured them to behurried outside and carried the boxes into a back room of the restaurant one of them gave cincinnatus a package wrapped in newspapers through which grease was starting to soak best ribs in town he said i know that already cincinnatus said obliged he drove conroys wagon back to the general store then walked home the smell of the ribs tormented him all the way there when he opened the door elizabeth started to yell at him for being late that savoury package started the job of calming her down the fivedollar gold piece finished it because of the yankee curfew nights were usually quiet the sound of banging not gunfire but something elsewoke cincinnatus a couple of times when he headed for the docks the next morning every other telegraph pole and fence post was adorned with a fullcolor poster of teddy roosevelt leading a detachment of us soldiers all of them wearing germanstyle spiked helmets each one with a baby spitted on the bayonet of his rifle peace the poster said freedom in his minds eye cincinnatus saw lots of negro boys with hammers and nails running here and there putting up posters in the dead of night with his real eyes he saw us soldiers tearing them down he didnt know for certain hed had anything to do with that doing his best to take no notice of the angry us troops he kept on walking toward the docks once upon a time provo utah had probably been a pretty town mountains towered to the east and northeast to the west lay utah lake the streets were wide and shade trees had lined them this july as far as paul mantarakis was concerned the place was nothing but a bottleneck corking the advance of us forces toward salt lake city the trees had either been blasted to bits by artillery fire or cut down to form barricades across the broad streets thanks to the mountains and the lake you couldnt go around provo you had to go through it mantarakis scratched his left sleeve he was probably lousy again the only notice he took of the third stripe on that sleeve was that the double thickness of cloth made scratching harder captain norman hinshaw a captain because of casualties the same rea son mantarakis was a sergeantsquatted down in a foxhole beside him he pointed ahead the big set of buildingsthat big set of ruins i should say thats whats left of brigham young college thats where the damned mor mons have all their machine guns too thats what keeps us from taking the whole town yes sir mantarakis said he knew where the mormons had their ma chine guns all right theyd killed enough americans with them deadpan he went on of course its just a few goddamn fanatics doing all the fighting the rest of the mormons all love the usa hinshaws narrow sour face looked even narrower and more sour than usual theyre still feeding that tripe to the people back home he said some of them may even still believe it only soldiers who still believe it are the ones who got shot right off the train thats about the size of it sir mantarakis agreed as he spoke he checked right left and to the rear as in price the mormons in provo had the nasty habit of letting us soldiers overrun their positions then turning around and shooting them in the back paul summed it up as best he could if youre a mormon in utah you hate the usa isnt that the sad and sorry truth hinshaw said only people who give us any sort of assistance at all are the ones the mormons call gentiles and they assassinate them whenever they get the chance he snorted even the sheenies in utah are gentiles if you can believe it id believe anything about this damn place paul said anybody whos seen what weve seen getting this far would believe anything back of the line back behind the train station us artillery opened up on brigham young college again up above an aeroplane buzzed spotting for the guns the mormons shot at it but it was too high for their machine guns to reach hinshaw looked up at the aeroplane good for him he said hell find out where the bastards are at and well blow em up i like that the more of em we kill the less there are left to kill you said it sir paul agreed they do fight harder than the rebs every damn one of em amen to that the captain said the rebs theyre sons of bitches but theyre soldiers when the war comes through the civilians get the hell out of the way like theyre supposed to here though anybody over the age of eight boy or girl is an evenmoney bet to be a franctireur i heard tell they planted an explosive under a baby and when one of our soldiers picked up the kid boom mantarakis wondered if that was true or something somebody had made up for the sake of the story or something somebody had made up to keep the troops on their toes no way to tell not for certain that it was even within the realm of possibility said everything that needed saying about the kind of fight the mormons were putting up as if to remind him what kind of fight that was the mormons in the frontline foxholes and shelters in the rubble opened up again on the us positions south of center street rifle fire picked up all along the line as government soldiers started shooting back machine guns began to bark and chatter here and there wounded men shrieked be alert out there paul shouted to his men as he got to his feet theyre liable to rush us the mormons had done that to another regiment in the brigade down near the town of spanish fork farmers and merchants in overalls and sack suits a couple even wearing neckties had thrown the us soldiers back several hundred yards and captured four machine guns to boot that regiment had had its colors retired in disgrace it was off doing prisonerguard duty somewhere these days being reckoned unfit for anything better mantarakis didnt want the same ignominy to fall on his unit but the religious fanatics religious maniacs was what mantarakis thought of them even if that did make him seem unpleasantly like gordon mcsweeney to himselfdidnt charge they werent eager about battling their way through barbed wire not any more a few gruesome maulings at the hands of troops more alert than that one luckless regiment had pounded that lesson into them even if they didnt have uniforms they were beginning to be have more like regular troops than they had the effect no doubt of fighting the us regulars for some weeks they still had more originality left in them than most regulars though something flew through the air and crashed into the foxholes and trenches behind mantarakis he shook his head in bemusement it had looked like a bot tle he wondered what was in it not whiskey that was for surethe poor stupid damn mormons were even drier than the desert in which they lived another bottle hurtled toward the us lines the mormons had used some sort of outsized slingshot arrangement to fling makeshift grenades at the soldiers battling to crush their rebellion paul would have bet they were throwing their bottles the same way but why a trail of smoke followed that second one it smashed maybe twenty yards from mantarakis and splashed flame into the bottom of the trench jesus he yelled and crossed himself theyve got kerosene in there or something like it thats a filthy way to fight captain hinshaw said half walking half waddling he started down the trench line let me get to a field telephone well teach them to play with fire god damn me to hell if we dont look out captain paul shouted the mormons must have been saving up bottles because they had a lot of them here came another one hinshaw ducked that didnt help him it hit him in the back and shattered pouring burning kerosene up and down his body he screamed he thrashed he rolled on the ground trying to put out that fire it didnt want to go out it wasnt just the kerosene burning any more but also his uniform and his flesh the harsh acrid stink of scorched wool warred with a sweet odor a lot like that of roasting pork had mantarakis smelled that odor under other circumstances he might have been hungry now he just wanted to heave up his guts into the bottom of the trench he lacked the luxury of time in which to be sick he jumped on top of captain hinshaw smothering the flames with his body beating at them with his hands and then shovelling dirt onto them hinshaw kept on screaming like a damned soul mantarakis remembered hed asked god to damn him even as the greek battled the fire burning his captain he shivered when you said something like that you were asking for trouble a couple of other soldiers came running up and helped mantarakis extin guish hinshaw more kerosenefilled bottles kept dropping all around more men screamed those horrid screams too captain hinshaw was still smoking but he didnt seem to be burning anywhere not any more he sat up that gave mantarakis and the other two men the first look at his face theyd had since the bottle hit him mantarakis wanted to look away jesus one of the other soldiers said softly it wasnt a live mans face any more but a skull covered here and there with bits of charred meat in a voice eerily calm hinshaw said will one of you please take your weapon and kill me believe me youd be doing me a favour we cant do that sir mantarakis answered through numb lips he raised his voice to shout for stretcherbearers trying to sound soothing he went on theyll have morphia for you sir morphia hinshaws laugh made pauls hair stand on end the officer groped for his own pistol and got it out of the holster mantarakis knew he ought to stop him but crouched frozen neither of the other two soldiers moved hinshaws hand was burned too but not too burned to pull the trig ger he fell over mercifully dead a few minutes later artillery stopped pounding brigham young college and started hammering the mormons in the frontline positions a couple of shells fell short too ploughing up the ground too close to paul for comfort whistles shrilled for once mantarakis was glad to go over the top glad to struggle through paths in the wire that werent paths enoughanything to get away from the roastmeat horror captain hinshaw had become beside that the bullets cracking past him were nuisances distractions nothing more by the way his men were shouting as they rushed the mormon lines they felt the same as he did he sprang down into a length of trench the mormons fought hard they always fought hard hardly any of them threw down their rifles even in the face of death that didnt matter not today it didnt he hadnt planned on taking prisoners anyhow from an upstairs bedroom came the insistent clanging of a bell ill speak further to you later griselda scipio said the servant whod given anne colleton rancid butter looked suitably downcast but he hadnt quite turned away before she stuck out her tongue at him she would have to go he realized as he hurried up the staircase whether that meant another situation indoors somewhere else or work out in the fields he didnt know but such insubordination could not be tolerated and then around three steps higher he remembered he was part of a revolutionary movement that if it succeeded would sweep away negro servitude forever until it succeeded though the most he could do to help it was to make everything seem as normal as he could yes griselda would have to go coming captain colleton he called for the bell went on and on and on he had been too welltrained ever to look like someone in a hurry but he was walking very fast by the time he got to jacob colletons bedroom took you long enough colleton said in a slurring rasp that didnt spring from the effects of the gas alone he was drunk as he was most of the time a cutglass whiskey decanter nearly all the whiskey it had once held now decanted sat on a table by the chair in which he perched i am sorry to have inconvenienced you sir scipio said he had to fight to keep his air of servile detachment around jacob colleton you knew people came back from war wounded even maimed you didnt think they could come back ruined this particular way though condemned to maybe a full lifes worth of hell chlorine gas that was stuff more appalling than anyone had imagined back before the war if the confederates had thought of it they wouldnt have used it against the usa not at first they wouldnt theyd have used it to keep their own blacks in line he had a sudden horrid vision of black men and women lined up and made to breathe the stuff a lot more efficient than just shooting them in that choking wreck of a whisper jacob colleton said i want to see cherry bring her here to me she can tell me a story one of those congaree yarns you niggers spin take my mind off how wonderful the world is for me these days he coughed his face already the color of parchment went paler yet to the shade milk had once youd skimmed off the cream you understand sir that she is in the fields at present scipio said colleton nodded impatiently face not showing any of what he was thinking sci pio said i shall fetch her here directly muggy heat smote him when he went outside he felt himself starting to sweat it was for once honest sweat sweat having nothing well only a little to do with fear the kinds of stories cherry told jacob colleton had nothing to do with words colleton of course had no notion cherry was anything but one more negro wench to distract him and keep his mind off his pain what she thought about him was harder for scipio to unravel she gave colleton what he wanted from her the butler was sure of that much he wouldnt have kept asking for her if she didnt understanding why she did was harder come the revolution jacob colleton like every other white aristocrat in the csa was fair game maybe he told her things when they were in there together with the doors closed cassius might know about that scipio didnt he didnt have the nerve to ask the hunter either maybe cherry revelled in making herself feel worse now so revenge would be all the sweeter when it came and maybe too revo lutionary sentiments or not she also felt something akin to pity for jacob col leton people werent all of a piece not whites not blacks not anybody scipio was sure of that he sent a little boy who wore nothing but a grin and a shirt that came halfway down to his knees out to find cherry that meant hed have to give the little rascal a couple of pennies when he came back but going out into the fields after a particular woman was beneath a butlers dignity while he waited for the boy to return with cherry he looked back at the marshlands mansion halftone photographs in the newspapers showed what towns looked like after the rake of war dragged through them he tried to imagine marshlands as a burntout shell horror ran through him when he did he loved and hated the place at the same time himself here came cherry a plain cotton blouse over an equally plain cotton skirt but a fiery red bandanna tied over her hair scipio gave the boy three pennies which was plenty to send him capering off with glee why fo you wants me cherry asked aint me scipio shook his head in denial marse jacob he want you say he want you to tell a story to he he say dat cherry asked scipio nodded now he was sweating from nerves if cherry told jacob colleton the wrong story he himself was a dead man he hoped she didnt truly care for miss annes brother if she did she was liable to talk more than she should that was the last thing scipio wanted she said well he gwine like de story he get scipio wouldnt have doubted that she was a finelooking woman with high cheekbones that said she had some indian in her youd have never a dull moment between the sheets with her of that much scipio was sure all the same knowing what he knew he would sooner have taken a cougar to bed cherry walked on toward marshlands scipio followed her with his eyes any man would have the roll she put to her hips she opened the door closing it after her as she went inside something else occurred to scipio something he hadnt thought through before cherry was going up to that bedroom to do what jacob colleton wanted colleton probably didnt care much about whether it was what she wanted if the uprising of which she dreamt ever came off scipio wouldnt have cared to be in the shoes miss annes brother was or at the moment most likely wasntwearing well that was jacob colletons lookout not scipios the butler had enough to worry about keeping marshlands going with servants constantly leaving for betterpaying jobs and with the threat of revolt from the field hands growing worse every day and he remembered with insolence from the servants he did have deal ing with griselda came within the normal purview of his duties that it was normal made it all the more attractive to him now straightening up until he looked as stiff and stern as the confederate sergeant on the recruiting poster pasted to every other telegraph pole he marched back to the mansion griselda predictably screamed abuse at him when he told her she had to go that will be enough of that he said using his educated voice he was speaking as anne colletons agent now not as himself if you comport yourself with dignity i will prevail upon the mistress to write you a letter that will enable you to find a good situation elsewhere otherwise but that was not so effective as it would have been a year earlier fuck yo letter an fuck you too griselda shouted don need no letter not these days i dont take myself to columbia git me work at one o the factories they got there don have to lissen to no nigger talkin like white folks what needs to go take a shit neither she stormed out of marshlands slamming the door behind her scipio stared out the window as she flounced down the path that led to the road she hadnt even bothered going to her room and getting her belong ings maybe shed be back for them later or maybe shed have somebody send them on to her when she found a place in town wherever the truth lay there she never would have behaved that way before the war made it possible for her to find a job without worrying about her passbook or a letter of recommendation or anything past a strong back and a pair of hands the war he muttered it had dislocated everything including god only knew his own life anne colleton came out of her office and looked down at him from the second floor what was that all about she asked or dont i want to know one of the house staff has seen fit to resign her position maam scipio answered tonelessly miss anne raised an eyebrow i didnt know an artillery accompaniment was required with resignations these days she remarked but didnt seem inclined to take it any further for which scipio was duly grateful the mistress of marshlands was turning away from the railing when an other door opened upstairs cherry walked by anne colleton nodding to her almost although not quite as an equal miss anne looked at her looked back to the door from which she had emerged and went back into her office shak ing her head as she went cherry paused by scipio i hear one of the house niggers up an leave she asked when the butler nodded she said how about you give de job she was doin to me i kin do it better dan she could i bet you scipio licked his lips she might well have been right but i gwine ask cassius see what he say using that dialect inside the mansion even speaking quietly as he was now made him nervous cassius would probably be glad to have an extra set of eyes and ears inside marshlands but if for some reason he wanted his followers to stay as inconspicuous as possible scipio didnt want to cross him scipio didnt want to cross cassius for any reason the hunter was altogether too good with a gun or a knife or any other piece of lethality that came into his hands cherry tossed her head caint ask cassius he aint here what do you mean he isnt here scipio asked returning to the form of english that seemed more naturalor at least saferto him inside marshlands has he gone hunting in the swamps for a few days he gone but not in de swamp cherry agreed she too dropped her voice to a throaty whisper who know what kind o good things he bring back wid he when he come home what the devil was that supposed to mean scipio couldnt come right out and ask too many ears around in a place like marshlands and not all of them none of the white and too few of the blackto be trusted he focused on what lay right before him very well cherry he said starchily we shall try you indoors for a time and see how you shape in your new position have you anything more suitable for wear inside marshlands sho do her eyes flashed deviltry jus axe marse jacob she slipped outside laughing while scipio was still in the middle of a coughing fit chester martin scratched his head the gesture for once had nothing to do with the lice that were endemic in the front lines near the roanoke and everywhere else sir these are the craziest orders i ever heard he said captain orville wyatt said theyre the craziest orders i ever heard too sergeant that hasnt got anything to do with the price of beer though we got em so were gonna obey em but behind the wirerimmed spectacles his eyes were as puzzled as martins oh yes sir martin said but how are we supposed to pick out this one particular nigger those bastards do a lot of deserting he scratched his head again you had to want in the worst way to get out of your country if you were willing to crawl through barbed wire willing to risk getting shot to escape and it wasnt as if the usa were any paradise for colored people not even close what did that say about the csa nothing good martin figured captain wyatt said hell let us know who he is and when he does were supposed to treat him like hes whiter than the president he spat down into the mud of the trench that stuck in his craw the same as it did for martin the sergeant sighed son of a bitch would have to pick our sector for whatever hes up to ill pass the word on to the men specs peterson who was cleaning his eyeglasses on a rag that looked likelier to get them dirty looked up his gray eyes watery and unfocused his voice was very clear though what a lot of fuss over one damn nigger the rest of the soldiers in the squad nodded so did chester martin for that matter but he answered when the order comes down from philadelphia you dont argue with it not if you know whats good for you anybody who shoots that fellow when hes coming through the wire is gonna wish hed shot himself instead but sarge what if this is all some kind of scheme the rebs cooked up and they sneak a raiding party through we wont shoot at them neither not till too late joe hammerschmitt protested you ought to be writing for scribners instead of whatshisname that davis martin said maybe you can make a gas attack sound exciting instead of nasty too but if the rebels are that smart theyre probably going to overrun us you ask me though they aint that smart or if they are they sure havent shown it with that the menand martin himselfhad to be content it turned out to be enough too for two nights later hammerschmitt shook martin awake as he always did when he woke up he grabbed for his springfield which lay beside him dont need to do that sarge the private said i think i got that nigger with me you were talking about the other day yeah martin sat up rubbing his eyes it was dark in the trench the confederates had snipers watching for any light and anything it showed same as the usa did the man beside hammerschmitt wasnt much more than a shadow martin peered toward him how you going to prove youre the one weve been waiting for cause i de one gwine bring de uprisin o de proletariat to de white folks o de csa the negro answered gwine end de feudal pression gwine end de capitalis pression gwine end all pression de dictatorship o de prole tariat gwine come down in de csa his eyes glittered as he peered toward martin an de revolution gwine come in de usa too you wait an see his accent was thick as molasses but if anything it added to the grim intensity of what he was saying jesus christ sarge hammerschmitt burst out hes a fuckin red he sure is martin answered plainly the negro wasnt just a socialist martin voted socialist as often as not though hed favoured tr in the last elec tion the negro was an outandout bombthrowing red red as a russian bolshevik probably redder than an iww lead miner or fruit picker out west martin scrambled to his feet ill take you to the captain uh whats your name they didnt tell us about that i is cassius the negro answered you sho you got to waste time wid de captain i got portant things to do up here in yankeeland think a good bit of yourself dont you cassius martin said dryly yes you have to go see captain wyatt you satisfy him hell pass you on up the line and if you dont he didnt go on cassius sounded like a man with a head on his shoulders he could work that out for himself cassius picked his way over and around sleeping men and avoided holes in the bottom of the trench with an ease a cat would have had trouble matching and martin couldnt approach the negro couldnt have acquired that sense of grace and balance chopping cotton all day martin wondered what he had done captain wyatt as it happened was awake studying a map under the tiny light from a candle shielded by a tin can he looked up when martin and cassius drew near this the man were looking for sergeant he asked i think so sir martin answered his names cassius and hes a red he wondered how the negro would react to that he just nodded matteroffactly as if hed been called tall or skinny he was a red wyatt frowned martin knew he was a democrat and a conservative democrat at that but after a moment his face cleared if the rebs have them selves a nice red revolt in their own backyards that wont make it any easier for them to fight us at the same time he swung his eyes toward the black man isnt that right mr cassius martin had never heard anybody call a negro mister before cassius nodded its right but we make dis revolution fo our ownselves not fo you yankees like i tol you sergeant here one fine day you gits yo own revolution yes when pigs have wings wyatt said crisply the two men glared at each other in the gloom neither yielding in the least then the captain said but its the csa were both worried about now eh and cassius nodded wyatt went on i still dont know if it was them or the canucks who set utah on its ear but your people will do worse to them than utah ever did to us he pointed to martin take him back to the support trenches and tell them to pass him on to divisional headquarters theyll see he gets what he needs yes sir martin said he headed for the closest communications trench cassius following as they made their way back through the zigzag trench connecting the first line to the second martin remarked i sure as hell hope you give those rebs a hard time oh we do dat cassius said with a dark skin wearing a muddy con federate laborers uniform he might almost have been an invisible voice in the night we do dat we been waitin fo dis day a long rime pay they back fo what dey do to we all dese years chester martin tried to think of it as an officer would weighing everything he knew about the situation even with the rebs having to fight us too you uh negroes are going to have the devils own time making the revo lution stick a lot more whites with a lot more guns than youve got you yankees gwine help wid de guns i here fo dat cassius said an dis aint no uprisin o jus de niggers o de csa dis an uprisin o de proletariat like i done say befo de po buckra the what martin asked white folks cassius said impatiently like i say de po buckra he pressed too workin in de factory an de mill fo de boss wid de motorcar an de diamond on he pinky an de fancy seegar in he mouf come de revolution all de proletariat rise up togedder he walked on a couple of steps what you do fo you go in de army worked in a steel mill back in toledo martin answered thats where im from you in de proletariat too den cassius said the boss you got he throw you out in de street whenever he take a mind to do it an what kin you do about it caint do nothin on account of he kin hire ten men what kin do jus de same job you was doin you call dat fair you call dat right ought to point you gun at dey fatbellied parasites suckin de blood from yo labour telling a soldier to rise up against his own country is treason martin said dont do that again cassius laughed softly tellin de proletariat to rise up fo dey class aint no treason sergeant de day come soon you see dat fo your own self a sergeant in the secondary trenches called a challenge that was more than half a yawn had martin and cassius been confederate raiders the fel low probably would have died before he finished as things were he woke up in a hurry when martin identified his companion oh yes sergeant he said weve been told to expect him martin surrendered the negro with more than a little relief and hurried back up toward the front line some of the things cassius had said worried him more than a little too so did the reds calm assumption that revolution would break out come what may not only in the confederate states but in the united states as well could it would it maybe it had tried to start in new york city on remembrance day but it had been beaten down then would it stay beaten down capital and labour hadnt gotten on well in the years before the war plenty of strikes had turned bloody if a wave of them came all across the country after the war something new would go into the mix too a lot of men whod seen fighting far worse than strikers against goons would be coming back to the factories if the bosses tried to ignore their demands what then the night was fine and mild but martin shivered captain stephen ramsay remained convinced that his creek army rank badges were stupid and with their gaudiness were more likely to make him a snipers target he also remained convinced that entrenching in or more accurately in front ofa town was a hell of a thing for a cavalryman to be doing not that nuyaka sequoyah was much of a towna sleepy hamlet a few miles west of okmulgee but with the damnyankees shifting forces in this direction it had to be defended to keep them from getting around behind okmulgee and forcing the confederates out of the creek capital where the blacks had run off everybody had to do nigger work ramsay used an entrenching tool just as if he still was the sergeant hed been not so long before alongside him moty tiger also made the dirt fly pausing for a moment the creek noncom grinned at ramsay and said welcome to new york huh ramsay answered he paused too he was glad for a blow the heat and humidity made it feel like mobile what are you talking about new york moty tiger repeated pronouncing the name with exaggerated care almost as if he came from the usa then he said it again pronouncing it as a creek normally would have sure as hell it sounded a lot like nuyaka this little townramsay picked his words with care not wanting to offend the creek sergeantis named after new york city moty tiger nodded ramsay asked how come back in washington s time when the creeks still lived in alabama and georgia he invited our chiefs to new york to make a treaty with him the sergeant told him they were impressed at how big and fine it was and took the name home with them we took it here too when the government of the usa made us leave our rightful homes and travel the trail of tears his face clouded richmond has been honest with us the usa never was being at war with the usa feels right sure does ramsay said but the creeks had been fighting the usa back when his ancestors were us citizens that made him feel strange whenever he thought about it the confederate states had been part of the united states longer than theyd been free if theyd lost the war of secession the damnyankees had forced on them theyd still be part of the usa he scowled thinking christ what an awful idea perhaps luckily he didnt have time to do much in the way of pondering when you were digging like a gopher trying to get underground before a hawk swooped down and carried you away worries about what might have been didnt clog your mind colonel lincoln whose twojewel insigne was twice as absurd as ramsays came up to look over the progress the creek regiment had made he nodded his approval good job he told ramsay youve got foxholes back toward town dug so you can fall back if you need to youve got the machine guns well sited youve done everything i can think of that you should have thank you sir ramsay said and this isnt any ordinary town either he told lincoln the story of how nuyaka had got its name is that a fact lincoln said yes sir moty tiger answered when ramsay glanced his way colonel lincoln shook his head in bemusement like ramsay he was careful to do or say nothing that might offend the indians he commanded but nuyaka any way you looked at it was pretty damn funny lincoln peered back toward okmulgee smoke and dust were rising up above the hills rimming the valley in which the town sat the rumble of artillery carried across the miles theyre pounding each other again he said sure sounds that way sir ramsay agreed im glad to be out of there you want to know the truth this herehe waved at the creeks preparing the position in front of nuyakait aint cavalry fighting but its better than what it was back there for now its better anyways for now colonel lincoln echoed the fight around okmulgee has got itself all bogged down the way things are in kentucky and virginia and pennsylvania a whole lot of men battling it out for a little patch of ground but sequoyahs got too much land and not enough men for most of it to be like that and where men are thinner on the ground you can get some movement not cavalry sweeps ramsay said mournfully hell of a thing training for years to be able to fight one kind of way and then when the war comes you find you cant do it machine guns lincoln said by the way he said it he couldnt have come up with a nastier curse if hed tried for a week he pointed to the ones the creeks were setting up theyll mow down the yankees if they try to come in this direction but they mow down horses even better than they do men yes sir thats a fact ramsay said he thought back to the days when the confederates had been raiding up into kansas rather than us troops pressing down into sequoyah if this war ever really gets moving again itll have to be with armored motorcars not horses armored motorcars moty tiger said i read about those in the newspapers bad to run up against are they you shoot a horse it goes down ramsay said dryly you shoot one of those motorcars the bullets mostly bounce off its got machine guns too and it keeps right on shooting at you im just glad the damnyankees dont have a whole lot of them more than we do captain lincoln sounded grim back before the war started they were building a lot more automobiles than we were they come this way well deal with em sir the creek sergeant said ramsay didnt want to discourage pluck like that the creeks had turned out to make far better far steadier soldiers than hed ever figured they would one of the reasons was they thought they could do anything when you thought like that you were halfwaymaybe more than halfwayto being right they got the rest of that day that night and the first hour or so of daylight the next morning to dig in before the first us patrols started probing their positions pickets in rifle pits well in front of the main creek position traded gunfire with the yankees things had changed over the past year when the war was new infantry running up against opposition would mass and then hurl itself forward aiming to overwhelm the foe by sheer weight of numbers sometimes they did overwhelm the foe too but at a gruesome cost in killed and wounded no more the damnyankees coming down toward nuyaka from the north must have been veteran troops when they started taking fire they went to earth themselves and fired back instead of swarming forward they advanced in rushes one group dashing up from one piece of cover to another while more soldiers supported them with rifle fire that made the creeks keep their heads down then reversing the roles in danger of being cut off from their comrades the pickets retreated to the main line when the us troops drew a little closer the machine guns opened up on them spraying death all along the front again the us soldiers halted their advance where a year before they would have charged it was as if they were pausing to think things over not far from ramsay moty tiger peered out over the forward wall of the trench uhoh he said i dont like it when they stop that way next thing that happens is they start shooting cannon at us youre learning ramsay told him he looked back over his own shoulder the confederates had promised a battery of threeinch field pieces to help the creek nation army hold nuyaka ramsay hadnt seen any sign of those guns getting shelled when you couldnt shell back was one of the joys of the infantrymans life with which hed become more intimately acquainted than hed ever wanted instead of rolling out the artillery though the damnyankees as if to give moty tiger what hed said he wanted rolled out a couple of armored motorcars the vehicles didnt come right up to the trench line they cruised back and forth a couple of furlongs away plastering the creek position with machinegun fire ramsay threw himself flat as bullets stitched near dirt spattered close by kicked up by the gunfire cautiously he got to his feet again shoot out their tires if you can he shouted to the creek machinegun crews the tires werent armored although these motorcars unlike the first ones ramsay had encountered carried metal shields covering part of the circumference of the wheels one of the armored motorcars slowed to a stop the creeks cheered it was less of a victory than they thought though as they soon discovered the motorcar though stopped kept right on shooting where are those damn guns ramsay growled a target youd dream about sometimes dreams did come true hed just sent a runner back toward okmulgee to demand artillery support when earth started fountaining up around the automobile its hatches flew open the twoman crew fled for the nearest yankee foxhole moments before the machine was hit and burst into flames the other armored motorcar skedaddled shells bursting around it it hid itself behind bushes and trees before it got knocked out the creeks yelled themselves hoarse the damnyankees already have one new york ramsay said to moty tiger trying to pronounce the name as the indian did what the hell do they need with two his sergeant grinned at him by way of reply xvii s ylvia enos finished tying george jrs shoe her son had just turned five pretty soon she or better george would teach him to tie shoes for himself and that would be one less thing shed have to worry about every morning quite enough would be left as things were she looked up in the half minute during which shed been dealing with those shoes mary jane had disappeared come here this instant she called were going to be late no mary jane said from the bedroom she shared with her brother no was her standard answer to everything these days not long before shed an swered no when asked if she wanted a piece of liquorice shed realized that tragic error a moment too late and burst into tears sylvia didnt have much time or patience left do you want me to whack you on the fanny she demanded clapping her hands together no mary jane answered this time with alarm instead of defiance then come out here and behave yourself sylvia said i have to go to work and you have to go to mrs conevals come out right now or mary jane appeared both hands pressed over her bottom to protect it from the slings and arrows of an outraged mother sylvia knew she shouldnt laugh that just encouraged her daughters mischief and a twoyearold needed no such encouragement she couldnt help herself though virtuously george jr said im all ready mama good sylvia said and now mary jane is ready too so well go to mrs conevals she held out her hands george jr took one and mary jane the other they paraded down the hall to brigid conevals flat at sylvias knock mrs coneval opened the door ah tis the heros children she said come in the two of ye george jr puffed out his little chest and looked impressive and important it all went over mary janes head ill see the two of you tonight sylvia said bending down to kiss her children goodbye mama george jr said ill be good im sure you will lamb sylvia turned to mary jane youll be good too wont you no mary jane said which might have been prediction or warning orsylvia hopednothing more than the answer she gave to most questions these days shes no trouble at all brigid coneval assured sylvia good as gold she is most o the time but if ive coped with my own hellions so long shell have to go some to put me out of kilter she cocked her head to one side and how does it feel to be after having your husbands picture in the papers and all it feels wonderful we have a copy of the globe framed in the kitchen sylvia answered and then i wish theyd never done it confusion spread across mrs conevals long pale face begging your pardon but i dont follow that now that the papers have blabbed what that fishing boat did and how it did it itll be harder and more dangerous for them to do it again sylvia explained i wish the rebs didnt have any idea what sort of trick they used ah now i see mrs coneval breathed god bless you mrs enos and may he keep your man safe she crossed herself thank you sylvia said from the bottom of her heart she did a lot of praying too it had brought george safe from the sea to north carolina and from north carolina back to boston whatever god chose to do about that he wouldnt let her stand around flapping her gums with brigid coneval she hurried downstairs the air was cooler and fresher outdoors than in the apartment building but that wasnt saying much it was going to be hot and sticky it was usually hot and sticky in boston in july but she hadnt known what that meant not really till shed put in a few shifts under a corrugated tin roof at the fishcanning plant she got onto the trolley a man who looked like a factory worker stood up and gave her his seat she sat down with a murmur of thanks men were more inclined to be gentlemanly in the morning shed found than in the eve ning after a full days work when they were tired and wanted to get a load off their feet then it was everyone for himself shed heard women complain and shame men to their feet but she never did that herself she knew all about be ing tired riding the streetcar gave her a few minutes to herself even in a crowd of strangers she spent half the time thinking of the pork chops shed fry up for supper when she got home that night the other half inevitably worrying about george the spray was out on patrol again what she hoped most of all was that the boat would come back from the banks with a hold full of hake and halibut having seen no confederate canadian or british warships of any description that had happened on one cruise already and was probably the only thing the navy was doing during the war to turn a profit next best would be to sink an enemy submersible george would have disagreed with those priorities but what did he know going face to face with the rebs and canucks put him in even more danger than simply going out to sea and so many men never came home in time of peace and of course the tables could turn that was even more likely now thanks to the enterprising reporters whod published their stories about fishing boats that were so much more than they seemed making the foe wary might tempt him to shoot at long range or make him more watchful for the towed submarine or any number of other unpleasant possibilities on that cheerful note she got off the trolley and walked to the factory a couple of cats stared at her with green green eyes the smell of the fishcanning plant and the scraps outsidedrew them like a magnet she wondered if they were jealous watching her go into the dingy building if they were it was only because they didnt know what she did in there her childrens best efforts to the contrary notwithstanding she got to work on time has the machine been behaving itself she asked elena gomes who worked the night shift it did not jam muchnot too much the other woman answered some nights i think it has the devil in it but tonight it was not bad she patted her lustrous black hair instead of cutting it short as most of the women at the factory did she wore it under a hairnet to keep it from getting caught in the machinery thats something anyway sylvia said though what the labelgluing machine did on one shift was no guarantee of what it would do on the next for the moment as shifts changed all through the canning plant the produc tion line was quiet your husband he is well elena asked as far as i know yes sylvia said but his boat put to sea again three nights ago so i wont know for certain till they come back from the trip and if something did go wrong she wouldnt know till days maybe weeks passed dead captured shed been through the agony of wondering once she didnt know if she could stand to go through it again the portuguese woman made the sign of the cross i pray for him as i do for my own husband thank you sylvia said as she had to brigid coneval hows your pedro elena gomes husband was in the army somewhere out in the south west have you heard from him lately i got a letter yesterday thank god elena said they are moving farther into texas to a town called she frowned lummox is that right lubbock i think sylvia remembered seeing the name in the newspaper im glad hes all right oh so am i the other woman replied he says they are thinking of making him a corporal he talks it down he says it is only because again thank godhe has stayed alive but i can tell he is proud of it still it is noth ing like what your george has done to be one of the crew that sank a submarine her eyes glowed what george had had to say about that was that the spray had gone to sea with a big sink me sign painted on the cabin and that the confederate submarine had thought it was part of the freelunch spread at a saloon he didnt think being a decoy was worth getting as excited over as the papers had gone and done before sylvia found a way to put any of that into words the conveyor belt gave a couple of jerks she knew what that meant it would start up in earnest in a minute or two elena gomes understood that too i am going to go home and try to get some sleep she said with a wan smile so i can come back tonight and do the same thing all over again such is life she hurried away such is life sylvia thought drudgery exhaustion never enough money never the time to lift up your head and look around wasnt it last week shed had george jr the day before yesterday shed given birth to mary jane if it wasnt where had the time gone how had it slipped past her she hadnt even been working thenif that is you didnt call raising children work people who didnt have to do it didnt think it was which as far as she was concerned only showed how little they knew or maybe they thought it wasnt work because women didnt get paid for it that was nothing but more foolishness with a clatter the conveyor belt got rolling in earnest sylvia thought the trouble with this job is that i dont get paid enough if shed been a man she would have made more money then again if shed been a man she probably would have been in the armed forces by now soldiers and sailors didnt get paid much either and the things they did she remembered george talking about the torpedo that had slammed into the confederate submersible it was there hed said and then it was in two pieces sinking nobody had a chance to get out hed known some pride in being part of the ambush that sank it but also a sailors horror of watching any vessel go to the bottom she pulled the levers on her machine as elena had said it was behaving pretty well when the paste reservoir ran low she poured more into it from a big bucket that sat by her feet she had to keep an eye on the labels too to make sure the machine didnt run out of them shed let the feeder go empty once and had the foreman screaming at her because unlabeled cans were go ing down the line she never wanted that to happen again she ate dinner with isabella antonelli whose husband had been a fisherman and these days was fighting somewhere up in quebec he say they going to do something big she told sylvia what it is i don know the how you saythe censor he scratch out so much i cannot tell what his big thing is gonna be i hope hell be all right sylvia answered not knowing what else to say isabella nodded and then started complaining about her machine which fas tened strips of tinned steel into cylinders that would be soldered to make the bodies of cans if half of what she said was true it made the labeling machine a delight by comparison but she liked to complain so who could guess whether half was true when she finally slowed down about the machine she said your hus band hes a hero you dont get no extra money for that so you no havea to work here i wish i did sylvia said but what i really wish is that we werent at war at all so he could just catch fish and make a living and we wouldnt have to worry about anything else i wish we never had the war so do i isabella antonelli said but we have it what can you do nothing sylvia answered bleakly nothing at all she gulped her cold coffee and went back to work behind lucien galtier a motorized rumble and rattle and racket grew rapidly he paid it no mind clucking to his horse and saying in a little while we shall be at riviereduloup no point in hurrying on such a fine day i am certain you agree if the horse disagreed it didnt tell him so brakes squealed lucien did not look back over his shoulder then he heard the raucous squawk of a horns rubber bulb as it was vigorously squeezed again and again through those squawks an american bellowed at him get out of the road you goddamn stinking canuck or well run you down now galtier did look back sure enough he was holding up a convoy of big snorting white trucks all of them painted the greengray of the us uniform i am desolate he said dropping the reins so he could spread his hands in apology i did not know you were there the driver of the lead truck shook a fist at him through the duststreaked windscreen get the hell out of the road he shouted again or we wont know youre there lucien fumbled as he picked up the reins which made the driver start squeezing that rubber bulb again lucien tipped his hat to show he did at last hear then guided the wagon onto the verge to let the truck convoy pass delay ing things any longer he calculated would be more dangerous than enjoyable truck after truck roared past gears clashing as drivers upshifted for better speed the noise of the growling engines was appalling so was the dust the trucks kicked up from the road the horse snorted indignantly and twitched its ears as if blaming lucien for the gray choking cloud that enveloped them i am sorry lucien told the animal we would have had the same trouble had we pulled off right away the horse looked unconvinced so did the chickens in the slotted crates in the back of the wagon they squawked almost as loud as the truck horn and flapped their wings in a vain effort to escape galtier wasted little sympathy on them not when they were bound for the stew pot or the roasting pan he counted the trucks that passed him noting how many carried men and how many supplies having done that he laughed at himself the army stint hed put in had trained him well when in contact with the enemy gather intel ligence the only problem with that was he had nowhere to convey the intelligence hed gathered and even if he had known to whom to convey it how much good would that have done him anyone on this side of the st lawrence would have needed a wireless set to pass the information on to where it might do some good he knew no one with such exotic equipment dust from the trucks hung in the air when he got back onto the road and headed up toward riviereduloup once more before he got to town he had to pull off again to let another convoy pass him as he had with the first one he waited to the last possible moment and then a couple of moments more forcing the whole convoy to slow down to a horses walking speed before fi nally noticing the trucks were there and getting out of their way how much good does this do do you think he asked the horse when they started traveling again after the curses of the us drivers finished wash ing over him this getting them angry and giving them a couple of minutes delay is it worthwhile again the horse did not answer he got the distinct impression the horse did not care although the animal had no great use for trucks whether delayed or rolling past foolish beast he thought as he drew near riviereduloup the wagon rolled through an enormous us encampment more tents than he had ever imagined and he was familiar with tents soldiers bustled about doing soldierly things but for the color of their uniforms and the fact that their brand of soldiers slang had no french in it they might have been the sons of the men with whom he had served a gen eration before up near the river artillery pieces squatted like longnecked dangerous beasts some of them were big six or eightinchers not just the threeinch popguns that had been here the year before the americans could answer warships in kind now he still remembered the weight of metal the cruiser had been able to hurl at those popguns thinking about it brought a smile to his lips out in the river guns boomed for a moment he hoped naval vessels were shelling the camp it would be a target of the sort about which gunners dreamed but then he realized it was the battery the americans had placed on the isle aux lievres the isle of hares out in the st lawrence he wondered if the guns were shooting at ships on the river or at the canadian and british po sitions on the north bank either way they would miss if god was kind those guns out on the isle aux lievres had shelled the south bank once after a couple of companies of picked men rowed over from stsimeon or somewhere nearby under cover of darkness and wiped out the american garri son the locals had laughed about that for weeks even though the soldiers of the british empire hadnt been able to hold the island against a massive us counterattack into riviereduloup lucien rode enjoying such summer warmth as quebec offered before he got to the market square us soldiers not once but twice inspected him the horse the wagon and the chickens he hoped to sell they didnt turn him back and they didnt demand payment in exchange for letting him go forward so he supposed he had no real complaint maybe they thought hed hidden a bomb in one of the capons he thought about making a joke with them about that but decided not to they did not look as if they would be amused he found a place to hitch his wagon not far from the loupdunord he thought about going in too but the place was bustling with soldiers neither the idea of good liquor nor that of leering at angelique and the other bar maids was enough to counterbalance their presence as soon as he had his chickens on display american soldiers came up and started buying them the birds mostly went for a couple of dollars apiece prices had shot up since the americans came into quebec because there was little to buy here besides most of the soldiers knew no more about haggling than they did about archery he soon found one exception to that rule a small swarthy man older than the latest class or two of conscripts where most of the us soldiers looked like englishspeaking canadians this one might have been a cousin of luciens he also understood something of bargaining to galtiers disappoint ment he had patience which most of the americans signally lacked come on antonelli you gonna stand there all day one of his comrades asked buy the damn chicken already ill buy it when this guy here quits trying to steal my money antonelli said he turned back to galtier awright you damn thief ill give you a dol lar ten for the bird i steal galtier assumed an injured expression i no monsieur you are the thief even at a dollar forty it is for me no bargain he ended up selling antonelli the hen for a dollar and a quarter he could have done better by refusing to deal with the american at all and getting more from a less able haggler but he enjoyed the bargaining enough to make the deal at that price simply for the sake of having met a worthy opponent marie no doubt would cluck at him when he got back to the farm but money was not the only thing that brought satisfaction to life when the americans had snapped up all the chickens he had for sale he put the crates back in the wagon and then wandered over to the edge of the river more boats were tied up at the quays below the town than he was used to seeing there not all of them were the usual sort of fishing boats and tramp steamers either he didnt think hed ever seen so many barges at rivieredu loup a lot of them looked new as if theyd just been put together from green timber and had engines bolted to them they wouldnt go far or fast for a moment he had trouble figuring out why they were there then he did and crossed himself as soon as hed done that he looked around to see whether anyone especially father pascalhad noticed but the priest was nowhere in sight for which he thanked god so many men around riviereduloup so many barges and boats of all kinds assembled here could mean only one thing the americans were making ready to cross the st lawrence and inflict on the rest of quebec all the delights their rule had brought here mauvais chance bad luck he murmured under his breath too much of france already lay under the boots of the americans german allieswould all the french speakers in the world now be occupied and tyrannized prevent it god he said quietly he wanted to run to the church so his prayers would have more effect but who presided over the church in riviereduloup no one other than the odious father pascal to the priest his own advancement counted for more than the fate of his countrymen when the day of reckoning came if god was kind enough to grant such father pascal would have much for which to answer glumly lucien walked to the general store and bought his monthly ration of kerosene with some of the money hed got from selling the hens he was pleased by how little he paid for it compared to other things it hadnt risen so sharply it would he expected but it hadnt yet he understood military bureaucracies and how slowly they worked having been part of one himself but hadnt expected to be able to turn that to his advantage with another halfdollar of hen money he bought hair ribbons in several bright colors for his womenfolk he put the kerosene and the ribbons into the back of the wagon he was just coming up onto the seat when angelique came out of the loupdunord hand in hand with an american soldier look at that little whore one housewife said to another near lucien the second womans claws also came out why doesnt she simply tie a mattress on her back it would save so much time and then as if to prove their own virtue and piety the two of them turned their backs on the barmaid and noses in the air strode into the church father pascals church galtier sat scratching his head for a minute or two then flicked the reins and got the wagon moving getting out of riviereduloup felt more like escape than it ever had before it is a very strange thing he told the horse when he was out in open country and could safely have such conversations how those women despise angelique who at most gives the americans her body and think nothing of going in to confess themselves to father pascal who has assuredly sold the americans his soul do you understand this mon cheval if the horse did understand it kept its knowledge to itself well i do not understand either lucien said it is to me a complete and absolute mystery soon though i shall be home and then thank god i shall have other things to worry about the horse kept walking nellie semphroch pasted a sign to the boards that still did duty for her shattered front window yes we have iced coffee shed lettered it herself along with the slogan just below come in amp try it its good with summers heat and humidity as they were she would have lost half her business without iced coffee have to go to the bank she muttered and then laughed at herself banks in washington dc werent safe these days anyone with any sense kept his money at home or in his store or buried in a tin can in a vacant lot a robber might take it away from you but the army of northern virginia might take it away from the bank the confederates from everything shed seen of them made the local robbers seem pikers by comparison off in the distance artillery rumbled nellie hadnt heard that sound since the early days of the war for the confederates opening drive had pushed the front too far north for the gunfire to carry it had returned with the us armys spring offensive the breakout from baltimore but the breakout like so many breakouts in the war had not turned into a breakthrough the rebs though theyd drawn back from pennsylvania still held most of maryland and us forces were nowhere near ready to regain poor washington as if to underscore that a couple of confederate soldiers came out of mr jacobs shoemakers shop across the street one of them holding a pair of marching boots the other shiny black cavalry boots the fellow with the cavalry boots must have told a joke for the other reb laughed and made as if to throw half his own footgear at him nellie ducked back inside the coffeehouse and said im going over to mr jacobs for a few minutes edna all right ma her daughter answered from behind the counter the place was busy too busy nellie hoped for edna to get into any mischief while she was gone nicholas kincaid wasnt in there soaking up coffee and mooning over edna which nellie took for a good sign she had to hurry across the street to keep a big truck from running her down the colored man at the wheel of the truck laughed because hed made her scramble she glared at him till the truck turned a corner and went out of sight she was a white woman she deserved better treatment from a negro but she reminded herself sadly she was also a damnyankee and so deserving of no respect from confederates even black ones the bell above the shoemakers door jingled as nellie went inside shed thought jacobs was alone but he was in there talking with another grayhaired nondescript man they both fell silent quite abruptly then mr jacobs smiled hello widow semphroch he said smoothly dont be shythis is my friend mr pfeiffer lou widow semphroch runs the coffee house across the street she is one of the nicest ladies i know pleased to meet you maam lou pfeiffer said and you mr pfeiffer im sure nellie glanced over at the shoemaker since you have your friend here mr jacobs ill come back another time dont hurry off jacobs said mr pfeiffer louwas telling me some thing very interesting you might even want to hear it yourself if youre not too busy why dont you stay well all right nellie said a little surprised shed intended giving mr jacobs some of the dirt shed gleaned from the coffeehouse and he had to know that he wouldnt have wanted her to do it while anyone else was around so why keep her here when she couldnt speak of what really mat tered she shrugged go ahead mr pfeiffer i was just telling hal here what a nuisance it is to try and keep pigeons in washington these days pfeiffer said hal nellie raised an eyebrow years across the street from mr jacobs and shed never known his first name his friend went on the rebs dont want anybody having birds these days pi geons arent just pigeons not to them a pigeon can carry a message too so theyve confiscated all the birds they could find but they havent found all of them eh lou jacobs said pfeiffer shook his head he had a sly look to him that had nothing to do with his rather doughy features more the glint in his eye the angle at which he cocked his head not all of em no not mine for instance not some other peoples too weve got an underground you might say we keep birds but the rebs dont know it makes life exciting so to speak he set a finger by the side of his nose and winked a few months before nellie would have taken his jaunty talk at face value and not even thought to look below the surface now now she was convinced everything had unplumbed depths that is interesting mr pfeiffer she said she looked at him then at mr jacobs a silent question ever so slightly the shoemaker nodded he turned to pfeiffer and started to laugh you see lou not just a nice lady but a clever one too i see pfeiffer said agreeably ive thought so from what youve said about her every now and then that cleared up the last small doubt nellie had had can i tell you some interesting things ive heard in the coffeehouse mr pfeiffer or would you rather have me wait and tell mr jacobs so he can tell you she is a clever lady pfeiffer said and then to nellie you can tell me eliminate the middleman he and jacobs both wheezed laughter so nellie as if casually gossiping told of the troop movements and other interesting bits of news shed heard in the coffeehouse over the past couple of days she got interrupted once when a colored servant brought in a confeder ate officers boots for resoling the negro paid no attention to anything but his business and was soon gone nellie finished her report was the right word for it she thought well well lou pfeiffer said yes i am glad i still keep pigeons that i am thank you widow semphroch nellie isnt it mr jacobs said suddenly thats right hal she answered smiling at him he smiled back theyd knocked down a barrier one theyd taken for granted but one that had been there for a long time she smiled at mr pfeiffer too partly for being what he was partly for his help in making that barrier fall gentlemen if youll excuse me i have to go back across the street and keep the rebs in or der at the coffeehouse a pleasure to have met you mr pfeiffer and you widow semphroch pfeiffer said as she went out the door when she got back into the coffeehouse edna discreetly beckoned her over she went curious to see what could make her daughter circumspect in a low voice edna said there was a man came in here askin after you ma and i didnt fancy his looks even a little if you know what i mean fear leaped up and bit nellie the rebs would have people hunting us spies what did he look like she asked forcing herself to speak quietly too old and ugly edna answered with the callousness of youth either he ought to shave or else he ought to let his whiskers grow one way or the other said his name was bill or phil or pill or something like that she shrugged it hadnt been important to her a chill ran through nellie that sounded altogether too much like bill reach to suit her if he ever comes back tell him i dont want his business here if he doesnt like that throw him out im sure some of our customers would be delighted to help you do anything you ask yeah probably edna said she enjoyed being attractive to the rebs her gaze sharpened hes known you for a long time this fellow whoever he is hasnt he why do you say that nellie asked at the same time as she was think ing longer than youve been alive edna gave back some of that thought he said i looked just like you did when you were my age maybe even younger did he know you way back then ma thats a long time ago now dont i know it nellie made her shrug quiet casual easygoing i knew a lot of men when i was a young lady and even more when i wasnt being a lady i dont remember anybody named phil or pill though she hoped her smile was disarming it wasnt disarming enough how about somebody named bill edna said a lot of bills back then nellie tried a small joke always a lot of bills never enough money to pay em youre giving me the runaround ma edna didnt raise her voice but sounded very certain she had a right to sound that way a lifetime with her mother had made nellie transparent to her how well did you know this fel low anyways did you she wouldnt say it but she was thinking it none of your business nellie hissed and then louder go serve that man there would you he wants himself filled up again edna glared at her but went over to give the confederate lieutenant an other cup of coffee there you go toby she said smiling a smile very close to the ones nellie had once had to paste onto her own face thank you miss edna toby said she put a little extra wiggle into her walk too the rebs eyes followed her every inch of the way back behind the counter nellie wanted to grab her daughter and shake her or better yet pour a pitcher of iced coffee over her head and serving the confederate hadnt distracted edna or made her forget what shed asked her mother cmon ma she said dont tell me you actually had a life back then whatever i had back then it wasnt very good nellie said all im try ing to do is keep you from going through the same things i did edna shrugged you got through em looks like even if youre too goodygoody to talk about it now you dont want me to have a good time thats all it aint fair nellie sighed theyd had this fight before likely they were going to go right on having it too you dont know what youre talking about nellie said that was true it was also the problem edna didnt know and was wild to find out i wont let her nellie told herself fiercely i wont bremen kentucky had been a coalmining town before the us first army drove the confederates out of it abner dowling had no doubt the place had been grimy and ugly and smelly back in peacetime now it was grimy ugly doubly smelly thanks to so many dead horses nearby and wrecked to boot given a choice it was not where dowling would have made first army headquarters he had not been given a choice dowling george armstrong custer shouted his rasping old mans voice put his adjutant in mind of the braying of the donkey in the fairy tale about the musicians of bremen dowling had done plenty of braying himself reading his nieces the fairy tale theyd giggled wildly back ten years before dowling custer yelled again coming sir dowling said listening to a real donkey bray wasnt nearly so much fun as impersonating one the major squeezed his bulk through the narrow doorway of the house custer had taken over he came to attention custer was a stickler for courtesyfrom subordinates what can i do for you sir bring me some coffee from the mess custer said put some fuel in it before it gets here too yes sir dowling said resignedly he turned to go custer didnt drink so much as some officers hed knownbut then they hadnt been in command of whole armies either do you know custer said i hardly drank at allno more than for medicinal purposestill after we lost the second mexican war no matter the renown i won in that last campaign the thought of my beloved country having gone down to defeat at the hands of rebels and traitors and stabbed in the back by foreign foes twice in a generations time was too much for me to bear since then i have been known to indulge myself as an anodyne if nothing else yes sir dowling repeated he didnt know whether the lieutenant general was telling the truth or not he didnt much care either however custer had first made the acquaintance of the brandy bottle hed since become quite intimate with it getting the coffee and adulterating it was a matter of a few minutes dowling was carrying the steaming cup back to custer when the general let out a great bellow as if hed been gored by a bull oh lord what now dowling thought it wasnt he was sure that the first army drive on moreheads horse mill had stalled it had been obvious for days that us forces werent going to reach the road junction that had been their goal since they forced the rebs out of madisonville any time soon it also wasnt the casualty figures coming from their efforts to reach the town custer viewed casualty figures with considerable equanimity especially seeing how many of them his own headlong ferocity caused what was rattling his cage then is something wrong sir the major said advancing with the coffee cup here drink this and youll feel better for it at least you wont be able to scream while youre drinking it custer seized the cup and poured its contents down his throat his face already red got redder he coughed a couple of times before coherent if highly irate speech emerged that son of a bitch that nogood lying stinking scoundrel that fiend in human shape when im through with the bastard hell wish he was never born i already wish he was never born uhwho sir dowling asked if custer was swearing at general pershing or one of the other younger officers in the service dowlings job was to listen and calm him down and make sure he wouldnt do anything that would damage not only himself something dowling didnt mind at all but also first army which would be regrettable who custer thundered that blackguard davis thats who for a moment dowling remained confused davis being anything but an uncommon name then custer pointed to the scribners magazine on his desk it hadnt been there when dowling went to get the generals coffee a messenger must have delivered it to custer and then disappeared in a hurry dowling felt a certain amount of sympathy for that messenger unfortunately he didnt have the option of disappearing in a hurry very cautiously he asked youre disappointed in the coverage you got from richard harding davis disappointed great heavens the man proves himself a pathological liar custer picked up the offending periodical and thrust it at his adjutant see for yourself major the title of davis article was innocuous enough the first army attacks part two part one had run a couple of weeks before and had been a paean of praise for first armys courage custer had not complained about it at all dowling rapidly skimmed through part two the more he read the more he had to work to keep his face not merely straight but sympathetic richard harding davis a manly man himself had been imperfectly impressed with the person of george armstrong custer neck wattled like a turkeys squinting little pouchy eyes and hair that bought its color from a bottle in a vain attempt to hold back father time were some of the choicer epithets davis hadnt had much good to say about the generalship involved in the first gas attack either opportunity squandered was a phrase he used several times failure to achieve a breakthrough despite the advantages given by the preceding chlorine barrage was also sure to raise custers hackles to dowlings way of thinking though the most telling bit of evidence that the war reporter did know what he was talking about was the comment that up and down the front troops were committed to battle in a deployment more aggressive than strategically sound that was custers style set out in black and white for all to see im sorry sir dowling said handing the scribners back to the commanding general those reporters theyre not to be trusted inside he was chortling custer was drawn to publicity like iron filings to a magnet hed used it astutely enabling himself to stay in the army past what should have been retirement age now it had turned on him and bit him there was a saying about he who lived by the sword and another one about the pens being mightier than that sword put those together and examine their implications custer was not in a mood for logical examinations if i ever set eyes on that lying son of a whore again ill horsewhip him within an inch of his worthless life i trusted him to tell the truth about me i trusted him to paint me in glowing colors the way too many reporters have done for too many years dowling had no trouble making his own translation of custers remarks the general was in full spate now and my boys in the trenches hearing about thisthis tripe will wonder whether i have the right stuff to lead them against the hereditary foe reluctantly dowling admitted to himself that custer had a point there the men who did the actual fighting needed to think their general had their best interests at heart and was using them wisely the loss of that feeling was what had made mcclellans army of the potomac fall to pieces after camp hill during the war of secession figuring theyd get licked no matter what they did the rank and file gave up back then the feeling had been justified studying mcclellans campaigns dowling had been struck by the way he was always a step and a half behind lee the trouble was he didnt think custers men were justified in having confidence in their commander custer was brave and liked to go right at the enemy having said that you exhausted his military virtues noin military politics at least he had a solid machiavellian streak in him davis is trs fairhaired boy too he muttered gloomily when the president sees this i can kiss canada goodbye foreverhes going to want my scalp that last was true only metaphorically custer being bereft of hair on the portion of his scalp indians had customarily removed it will be all right sir dowling said sympathetically if not sincerely you and tr fought side by side against the limeys in the second mexican war im sure hell remember that half to himself custer muttered teddy always did say his troops outperformed my regulars roosevelts volunteer cavalry a regiment of miners and farmers had indeed done yeoman work in montana fighting their british opposite numbers to a standstill and had led the pursuit after the british blundered straight into custers gatling guns in dowlings view tr had a point only the armistice us president blaine had had to accept had kept the triumph from being bigger than it was id have licked them anyway custer said sounding as if he was trying to convince himself maybe he would have nobody examined chinese gordons campaigns alongside napoleons dowlings opinion remained that custer had probably needed all the help teddy roosevelt gave him all of which was irrelevant he pointed to the scribners what do we do about that sir first i shall write a memorial and send it to president roosevelt detailing the lies and calumnies and false accusations this richard harding davis has levelled against me custer declared using the correspondents full name with equally full contempt dowling nodded that was like custer if threatened attack headon and never mind scouting the ground first sometimes you won that way more often you got your nose bloodied dowling would have bet tr would be imperfectly delighted to receive custers memorial and that it would sharpen the presidents focus on details he might otherwise have ignored but that was custers lookout not his the general commanding first army went on and after that is done and on its way i am going to tear these lying pages out of the scribners and wipe my backside with them which is precisely what they deserve no more no less what do you think of that major dowling revenge is uh sweet sir dowling said he fled then before his own big mouth got him into even bigger trouble reggie bartlett sighed with relief as he tramped away from the front line east of big lick virginia he and his comrades were battered worn filthy unshaven some of them had bandages on minor wounds several were coughing from chlorine theyd sucked into their lungs during one gas attack or another none of them would have been invited to serve as a model for a confederate recruiting poster here come the rookies corporal robert e mccorkle said pointing at the men marching up to replace reggies regiment they were obviously raw troops just out of one training camp or another it wasnt so much that they wore clean uniforms soldiers coming back to the line were often issued fresh clothes it was more the look in their eyes the way they stared at the veterans as if theyd never seen such spectral apparitions before you think were ugly reggie called to them you should see the fellows who arent walking out that drew gales of laughter from his comrades theyd seen everything war could do to the human body bullets shells gas if you didnt laugh about some of the things youd seen youd go mad a couple of men had gone mad or so convincingly given the appearance of it as to fool their officers they were out of the fight for good not merely coming back for baths and delousing and a show or two from a charitable group reggie envied them intensely you got to watch out for the frontline lice boys jasper jenkins said to the replacements some of them babies is big enough so they have you stead of you havin them he scratched his crotch one of the men going up to the line a tall thin pale fellow who looked so earnest that bartlett pegged him for a preachers son went paler yet and visibly gulped poor bastard reggie thought with abstract abraded sympathy hed been fairly fastidious himself back in his civilian days anybody who couldnt stand living like a pig right down to wallowing in the mud had an even worse time at the front than everyone else he didnt like being in the zigzag communication trenches they werent deep enough and they didnt have any shelters into which to dive if the damnyankees started throwing artillery around the officers felt the same way he did move along boys move along captain wilcox said we dont want to camp here major colleton hustled up and down the line of marching actually more like shamblingmen to deliver the same message keep it moving there fellows his uniform was as spruce and neat as any of the ones the replacements were wearing with colleton it was no more than part of his jaunty persona hed have been a plumed cavalryman back in the war of se cession cavalry these days wasnt what it had been though and major colletons jauntiness wasnt quite what it had been either shake a leg he said sooner were back behind the secondary trenches sooner the yankees wont be able to reach us any more a lot of people colleton among them and reggie bartlett toohad gone into the war wanting nothing but the thrill of combat bartlett had seen plenty of combat if he never had another thrill of that sort for the rest of his life hed be content and he unlike major colleton was the only man of his family in the army sir hows your brother he asked when the major came near colletons face clouded hes back home now from what my sister writes hes never going to be able to do much for himself any more a couple of more breaths of chlorine and theyd have put him under the ground likely that would have been a mercy he remembered his manners he had the virtues of the southern gentleman kind of you to ask bartlett reggie nodded colleton went on his way still urging the men to hurry he knew just about everyone in the battalion by name of course the battalion carried only about half of its establishment strength which made learning names easier than it would have been when the war was young machine guns poked their snouts over the parapets of the secondary trenches ready to rake the ground ahead with fire if a us attack should carry the frontline positions in theory reggie approved of the precaution in prac tice a us attack sufficient to bring those machine guns into action would likely have left him dead wounded or captured he was happy they sat there quiet the men in the secondary trenches were veterans grimy worn men much like bartlett and his comrades a couple of them nodded toward the troops going out of the front line one fellow touched his butternut slouch hat in what looked like half a salute hed likely been up there and knew what the regiment coming back was escaping behind the secondary trenches negro labourers their uniforms dark with sweat rather than dirt were digging positions for confederate guns nice to see those reggie said to jasper jenkins the yanks have been throwing more shells at us than weve been able to give back aint that the sad and sorry truth jenkins looked back over his shoulder toward the front line one good thing about havin to pull back to this side o the river is we dont have the damnyankees shellin us like they was whenever we had to cross it ive been places i liked more than some of those bridges bartlett agreed with a reminiscent shudder his comrades chuckle said jenkins appreciated the understatement reggie went on it might not have been hell on earth but if it wasnt you could sure as blazes see it from there you got a good way with words jenkins said you ever try your hand at writin or anything like that oh all the time bartlett answered jasper jenkins stared at him maybe wondering whether hed been serving alongside a famous author without knowing it jenkins could sign his name but that was about as far as his read ing and writing took him reggie explained i worked in a drugstore in richmond the pharmacist would make the pills and the syrups and id write take four times a day or take two before meals or do not take on an empty stomach and glue the label to the bottle it was a wild and exciting life i tell you that sounds like it jenkins tramped on for another few paces then said bet youd trade this for it in a redhot minute no takers reggie said with considerable feeling both men laughed as they marched back toward the base camp that was near the little town called clearwater a name it might once have lived up to but no longer deserved no little town suddenly inundated by a great sea of butternut tents could hope to keep its water clear the wonder was that it still had enough water for the men to drink to men who had spent a turn in the trenches the idea of sleep under canvas on veritable cots looked very attractive indeed but before they could approach the earthly paradise they had to pass through purgatory purgatory was guarded by sternlooking military policemen and bore the banner delousing station peel off by squads one of the military policemen shouted and then seeing how small the squads were what does he know about the front reggie thought scornfully corrected himself no by sections the men had been through the drill before they didnt need the military policeman exultant in his petty authority to tell them what to do along with the rest of the men in his section reggie went into one of the big delousing tents he got out of his clothes and handed them to a negro attendant who threw his underwear into a pile that would go back to the corps laundry farther from the front and put his outer garments into a bake oven that went by the name of a floden disinfector after the genius who had invented the exercise in futility that done bartlett soaped himself at a footbath the soap was strong and stinking he rubbed it into his scalp his halfgrown beard and the hair around his private parts anyhow in the hope that it would get rid of the nits he was surely carrying then along with the rest of the men in his section and he saw with amusement with major colletonhe leaped with a splash into a great tub almost a vat of steaminghot water everyone was splashing and ducking everyone else the major joined in the horseplay with no thought for his rank he came up spluttering by reggie after someone else pulled him under saluting reggie said its a rare honor to share an officers lice sir dont know whats so damned rare about it the battalion commander retorted youve been doing it in the trenches for the past year and he ducked reggie holding him under till he thought he was going to drown the disinfector baked the soldiers uniforms for fifteen or twenty minutes when they were done more colored attendants issued fresh underwear feels good not itching i mean reggie said buttoning up his tunic the laundrymen had ironed and brushed it so he looked as smart as he was going to enjoy it while it lasts jasper jenkins said they went with the rest of the unit to stake places in the tents assigned to them and then had the rest of the afternoon to themselves before they even found the tents they spotted a crowd of men listening to a tall thin man in a black sack suit and a straw hat reggies eyes widened thats the president he exclaimed ill be a son of a bitch if youre not right jenkins said shall we find out what the devil hes got to say for himself might as well reggie answered i was there in capitol square in richmond when he declared war might as well find out how he likes it now that hes seen a years worth they hurried over and joined the crowd woodrow wilson was speaking earnestly but without the changes in tone and volume and the dramatic gestures that were likeliest to win his audience over he sounded more like a professor than the leader of a nation at war we must continue we must dedicate our lives and fortunes everything that we are and everything that we have with the pride of those who know that the day has come when the confederate states are privileged to spend their blood and their might for the principles that gave them birth and happiness and the peace they have treasured the challenge in fact is to all mankind the choice we make for ourselves must be made with a moderation of counsel and a temperament of judgment befitting our character and our motives as a nation we must put excited feeling away our motive will not be revenge or the assertion of the physical might of the nation but only the vindication of right of which we are but a single champion in concert with our allies thats pretty fancy reggie murmured to jasper jenkins too goddamn fancy for me jenkins whispered back what i want to do is i want to smash those damnyankee bastards if hed tell me how were going to do that id be a sight happier we must stay the course wilson said though a few soldiers drifted away as others came to listen we must not swerve suddenly in the middle of the great conflict upon which we have embarked giving ourselves over to foolish radicalism at a time like this would only spell disaster for our nation and for all we hold dear a light dawned on reggie hed wondered why wilson had come to the base camp when speaking before soldiers was so obviously unnatural even uncomfortable to him presidential elections less than three months off he said he wants to make sure we dont go and elect the radical liberal he dont have a hell of a lot to worry about jenkins said weve never sent one of those crazy bastards to richmond yet and i dont reckon we will this time neither politicians take all sorts of crazy chances dont suppose wed be in this damn war if they didnt bartlett said but they sure as hell dont take chances about what happens to their party wilson cant run again himself so he wants to make damn sure the vice president whatever the devil his name is gets the job sims sands something like that jenkins said whoever the hell he is im gonna vote for him me too i think reggie said but ive got better things to do than listen to speeches that tell me to do what im already going to do yeah jenkins agreed and they both walked off signboards here and there in the base camp listed attractions lets go watch a boxing match reggie suggested white men or colored somebody asked bartlett ran his finger down the list of matches to see who was fighting whom our divisions colored champion is taking on a fellow from the confederate marines whos touring base camps he said thats gonna be the best fight today no doubt about it nobody argued with him the crowd around the squared circle was al ready large by the time he got there he and jasper jenkins so effectively used their elbows to get closer to the ring that they almost started a couple of fights of their own they cheered commodus the division champion and lustily booed the negro from the confederate marines whose name was lysis which shouted the soldier doing duty as announcer means destruction more boos reggie bet another soldier two dollars that commodus would win he had to pay up depressingly soon lysis knocked commodus cold in the third round attendants had to flip water into the fallen champions face before he could get up and groggily stagger out of the ring thats one tough nigger bartlett said as lysis swaggered around with arms upraised in victory he gave the fellow hed bet a twodollar bill then a strange thought struck him i wonder how hed do against a white man his size bet he wonders too the fellow whod won his money answered if hes a smart nigger he wont let anybody know it though wouldnt be much point if he did nobodyd let a fight like that happen any which way youre right i expect reggie said niggers start thinking they can fight white men we got more trouble than we need and seeing as how weve already got more trouble than we need at that moment as if on cue in a stage play one leg started to itch in an all too familiar way he scratched and swore and scratched again the floden disinfector was like an artillery barrage it made the lice put their heads down but it didnt get rid of all of them some nits always survived and hatched out after youd had your clothes on for a while he sighed and scratched still more no matter what you did you couldnt win anne colleton wrote a check computed the balance remaining in the account and made a nasty face everything cost more these days niggers wages their food the manure to keep the cotton fields fertile the kerosene for the lamps in the nigger cottageseverything shed got more money than usual for the latest crop shed brought in but the rise in prices hadnt stopped since then if anything it had got steeper a discreet tap at the door to her office made her look up there stood scipio starched immaculate stolid in his deep rumbling voice he said maam as you ordered i have brought the negro cassius here for your judgment at his recent abscondment she nodded disciplining the field hands was a job she undertook from a sense of duty and necessity not because she enjoyed it disciplining a top flight hand like cassius was especially delicate being too lenient with him would provoke worse indiscipline from the field force being too harsh though would make another three or four or half a dozen negroes up and leave the fields for factory work in columbia or down in charleston but disciplining him didnt look so repugnant as it usually did not when the alternative was paying more of the bills that made her capital flow away like the waters of the congaree in fact more swiftly than the lazy waters of the river she nodded again send him in yes maam scipio turned and murmured to his companion in the hallway cassius showed himself for the first time his shapeless cotton garments brightened only by the blue bandanna he wore round his neck made a sharp contrast to scipios formal livery anne glared at cassius for a few seconds without saying anything scipio silently slipped away not wanting to hearor to be known to hear whatever punishment the mistress of marshlands meted out he respects cassius position on the plantation too anne thought yes she had to proceed with caution cassius could not long bear up under her scrutiny he cast his eyes down to the hardwood floor anne watched him intently his gaze flicked to right and left taking in the books that filled the office shed deliberately summoned him here to add the intimidating alien environment to the moral effect of tak ing punishment from a white what do you have to say for yourself she asked her voice crisp and businesslike it had better be good he interlocked the fingers of his hands a gesture almost prayerful in its supplication i is sorry miss anne i truly is he said i couldnt hep myself the dialect of the negroes of the congaree district spilled thick as molasses from his lips a white from charleston would have had trouble understanding it a white from say birmingham would have been all at sea so would a black from birmingham for that matter anne followed his speech as readily as she followed scipios formal precise language shed grown up with the negro dialect all around her as a child shed spoken it half the time till trained out of it by parents and teachers she didnt think of speaking it now using her own brand of english helped remind cassius who was superior who inferior sorry might be enough to make amends for being gone a day or two she snapped you were gone for four mortal weeks where did you go what did you do did you think you could just show up here again one day and go on about your business as if nothing had happened answer me cassius did some more handwringing he was good at it too good to be altogether convincing he had a foxy gleam in his eye too one that never quite went away no matter how contrite and woebegone the rest of his face looked whe i was at miss anne i was up de country a ways i was huntin he nodded in sudden assurance dats what i was doinhuntin i dont believe a word of it she answered if you wanted to go on a long hunting trip you know you wouldnt have had any trouble arranging it with me youve done that before never for four weeks but youve done it he hung his head again now she thought she recognized the expression on his face if hed been white he would have blushed after a long silence he said miss anne kin ah talk to you like you was a man not a white man she noted just a man a suspicion began forming in her mind go ahead she told him he twisted his hands once more this time she judged in embarrassment she wasnt a man no one who was had any cause to doubt that miss anne cassius said what i huntin she bout nineteen year ol an you kin put yo hans roun she waist he made a circle to show what he meant an yo fingers dey touches theyselves dats what i was huntin fo true since hed been gone that long anne reckoned hed bagged her too he was a good deal more than nineteen he was a good deal more than twice nineteenbut those things happened she knew those things happened she was still angry at the hunter but not so angry as she had been whats her name she said whereabouts exactly does she live how did you meet her she name drusilla miss anne she live on de marberrys plantation over by fot motte she come into st matthews dis one time i see she i know i got to have she and so you just went off after her for all her effort anne couldnt make herself sound as severe as she would have liked men had their appetites and whether they were white or black didnt seem to matter much there a pretty face a nice shape and they were off like a shot sounding exasperated came easier i dont suppose anyone bothered checking your passbook no maam cassius shook his head but he might have said the same thing before the war he was far and away the best hunter on the plantation he was liable to make himself invisible to anyone who wanted to keep an eye on him well now that hed come back he wasnt invisible any more turning up the intensity of her glare anne said i am going to check on you if i find out you are lying to me you will regret it i aint lyin miss anne i is a truthful man scipio anne called when the butler came back she said take cassius downstairs and have him wait there we shall see what we shall see she picked up the telephone rang jubal marberrys home and put her questions to him what drusilla he said shouting at her he was old and deaf yes theres been some new buck nigger sniffing around drusilla theres always a buck or two sniffing around drusilla same as theres always flies buzzing around sugar water heh heh the last was a wheezy chuckle anne wondered if marberry was too old to go sniffing around drusilla himself but that whether or not it was his affair was his concern hed told her what she needed to know she summoned cassius back to the office all right it seems you were where you say you were you could have gotten into worse mischief even so of course your pay for the time you were gone is gone too cassius grimaced but didnt say anything anne could have done worse she did in fact do worse im also going to dock you every other weeks pay for the next eight to take out a matching sum losing both may remind you to stay here where you belong and not go chasing after every pretty woman you happen to see maybe miss anne but i doubts it cassius grin was jaunty and very very male anne wanted to throw something at him instead she made a sharp gesture of dismissal grinning still cassius took his leave just like a nigger she thought too happygolucky to care hes thrown away two months pay plus whatever he wasted on that drusilla tart anne hoped the negro wench had soaked cassius good she went back to her billpaying a few minutes later the telephone rang she was alert as she picked it up maybe jubal marberry had done some more checking and found out that the negro whod been keeping drusilla company wasnt cassius after all but the voice on the other end of the line wasnt old and rheumy but young and vigorous miss anne this heres roger kimball i was just callin to ask how your brother was doin i was just calling to find out whether the coast is clear for me to go up there and sleep with you anne colleton almost laughed in the submariners face she could have mortally offended him if shed told him how much he reminded her of her black hunter but instead she answered the question hed asked im sorry roger im afraid i have to tell you hes not much improved oh im right sorry to hear that sorry both ways probably she thought the wounded tone in his voice certainly suggested he was sorry she wasnt inviting him up despite poor jacobs condition and then he said maybe you could come down to charleston one day and pay me a visit then anne almost slammed down the earpiece of the telephone the arrogance kimball displayed infuriated her but as it had on the train to new orleans also attracted her what with jacob what with the neverending bills what with escapades like cassius didnt she deserve a little amusement a little escape a little plain oldfashioned physical relief life was about more things than simply running marshlands and so instead of hanging up she said maybe i will roger maybe i will xviii j efferson pinkard shoveled a last forkful of ham and eggs into his mouth then sprang to his feet emily whod already finished breakfast was about to head out the door and he didnt want to let her go without getting a kiss every time he took her in his arms he felt like a brand new bridegroom he knew how lucky he was to have that feeling still after years of marriage all things considered though hed had better kisses than the one he got this morning you all right darlin he asked his wife i think so she said lately im just tired all the time thats what it is i reckon theyre workin us hard we got our quota kicked up again the other day got to turn out more shells make up for the ones the soldiersre shootin at the damnyankees damnyankees pinkard muttered the war had passed a year old now no end in sight who woulda thought they could fight like this here they stood in western virginia in kentucky in sequoyah in texas in sonora they were pushing confederate forces out of pennsylvania and maryland and giving the canadians and british a hard time too aint like it was in the last two wars emily nodded pecked him on the cheek and hurried off to catch the trol ley her step didnt have the bounce to it hed once taken for granted she wasnt pink and perky either the way she had been maybe working to fill the increased quota was what made her seem so wrung out so sallow god damn the war jeff said sincerely he grabbed his dinner pail and headed for the sloss works as they did every morning agrippa and vespasian greeted him with polite respect he accepted that as nothing less than his due leonidas aint got here yet vespasian told him why aint i surprised pinkard said scornfully you ever hear anything about pericles no suh vespasian said he still in the jailhouse i dunno if they ever gonna let him out hope to jesus they do jeff said that leonidas he dont have the brains god gave a possum hell the two of you do bettern i do with him on account of i got to carry all my own weight and about three quarters of his i been yellin for a replacement an i dont care if hes black or white long as he aint stupidbut no luck so far vespasian and agrippa looked at each other pinkard wondered if hed offended them calling leonidas stupid so much landed on negroes in the con federacy they stuck together and defended their own whether their own deserved it or not but god damn it to hell leonidas was stupid he would have been stupid if he were white hell he would have been stupid if he were green slowly cautiously vespasian said mistuh pinkard suh this here would be a different place if mo people cared about gettin the job done an less of em cared about who was doin it when jeff didnt blow up at that remark the black steelworker made another even more wary comment not jus a different place a better place get your ass out of here go on go home pinkard said you dont want those policemen throwin you in the jug for sedition vespasian took off agrippa right behind him pinkard looked after them with something as close to approval as he was likely to give two negroes they did their job they didnt complain much they didnt try to rock the boat what more could you want from people he looked around still no sign of leonidas he didnt miss him a lot of ways he was better off without him handling his shift by himself would leave him dogtired when the closing whistle blew but the world wouldnt end on account of that jeff knew what he was doing leonidas came in about half an hour late the floor foreman reamed him out about it as he started to work when the fellow finally let him be he shook his head and said lord i wish that man would shut hisself up got me a hangover make my po head ring like a bell pinkard grunted hed done that once in a great while when your head already felt as if somebody were forging steel in there going to a place where they really were forging steel wasnt high on the list of enjoyable things leonidas had been working here for only a couple of months and this was a long way from the first time hed strolled in a good deal the worse for wear stupid jeff thought again some people belonged in the cotton fields leonidas got through the day without maiming either himself or pinkard he managed partly by not doing much but that didnt matter since he never seemed to do much pinkard minded less than he would have with a more capable partner the more leonidas did the more he was liable to foul up the quitting whistle made the young negro jerk as if hed sat on a nail thank god i can get out of here he said and proceeded to do just that moving faster than he had out on the floor pinkard followed more slowly he was just as tired as he would have been had leonidas stayed home with an ice bag or whatever his preferred hangover cure was he hadnt had to do quite so much as he would have had leonidas stayed home but being careful for two was hard work when he got back to his house he built up the fire in the stove sliced a few potatoes and set them to frying in lard in a black iron skillet likely made from metal worked at the sloss foundry theyd go nicely with the pork roast emily had put in the oven over a low fire before she went off to work it wasnt really cooking he told himself only a way to save time and have supper ready sooner emily came in about twenty minutes after he did smelled those potatoes outside comin up the walk she said they always smell so good like that give me some of my appetite back you havent hardly been eating enough to keep a bird alive pinkard said he took the potatoes off the stove so they wouldnt burn while he was kissing his wife he wondered if she was finally in a family way only not far along enough to be sure she was tired all the time she hadnt been eating well and hed noticed at breakfast how sallow she was he took another look at her in the evening sunlight pouring through the kitchen window she wasnt just sallow her skin was downright yellow honey what the dickens is the matter with you he demanded and heard the alarm clanging in his voice what do you mean whats the matter with me emily said he held her hand up in a sunbeam it looked all the more yellow against his own rough red scarred skin i mean youre only a couple steps this way from bein the color of a baby chick thats what oh that his wife answered i didnt even hardly notice it happens to a lot of the girls who work around the smokeless powder like me it does somethin to your liver blamed if i know what but it makes you yellow that way like i say some of the girls are almost lemon color does it get better jeff demanded oh yeah it does emily said casually when somebody gets sicknot just yellow i mean but really sickthey move her to another section of the plant for a while till she gets over it we havent had but a couple of people come down that bad oh pinkard was about to shout at her to demand that she quit her job and come back home where she belonged the words died unspoken people got killed every year at the sloss works and had been getting killed there long before the war pushed everybody up into a higher gear he remembered poor sid williamson emily and her comrades were making munitions for the csa the country depended on them hardly less than it did on the courage and tenacity of the confederate soldiers itll be all right darlin emily said now why dont you go sit down ill finish doin up the potatoes and bring you your supper jeff went and sat down his wife had the right way of looking at things and he couldnt very well complain about it he had to hope her supervisors or foremen or whatever they called them there were paying attention to what they were doing from what shed said it sounded as if they were when she came in with a full plate for him he asked anxiously this color youre getting it will go away if you stop doin what youre doin right she nodded ive seen it happen with some of the other girls the ones they had to move away from the powder but this here what ive got it aint hardly nothin and besidesshe cocked her head at a saucy angle and stuck out her hipaint you got a yen for a highyellow gal hed just taken his first mouthful and almost choked on it men told smokingcar and aftersupper stories about negro women with a lot of white blood in them they were supposed to provide some of the fanciest stock in the fanciest sporting houses all over the csa jeff didnt know anything about fancy sporting houses not from experience some of the stories about highyellow women were pretty fancy all by themselves though he tried to sound severe the way you do talk he couldnt do it he started laughing so did emily he said gal i got a yen for is you an if i say that after the day i put in you better know its the truth i like that emily said i feel the same way about you shed always been a boldtalking woman a lot of men pinkard supposed wouldnt have liked that he didnt understand why as far as he was concerned thinking about it and talking about it were almost as much fun as doing it after supper he dried pots and dishes as hed been doing for a while no sooner had he put the last plate back in the cupboard than emily said you are the helpingest man thats another reason i love you is that a fact he still didnt quite know himself how he felt about doing womens work he never told anybody at the foundry he did it for fear people would say he was henpecked emily usually didnt say much about it either maybe to keep him from worrying his own mind now that she had said it he felt obliged to answer gruffly you know why im doin this dont you why dear i havent got the faintest idea her smile and her voice and the way she stood all conspired to make a liar out of her why dont you tell me instead of telling her or rather instead of telling her with wordshe picked her up and carried her into the bedroom she squealed and beat at his shoulders but she was laughing while she did it getting out of his own clothes was the work of a moment getting her out of hers required more complicated unbuttonings unhookings unlacings his hands were big and clumsy but he managed he scraped a match afire and lighted a kerosene lamp on the nightstand by the bed the light it gave was ruddier than sunlight by it he could hardly tell emilys skin had changed color he didnt care that wasnt why hed lighted it you are one zwelookin woman he told his wife the words came thick from his throat and what do you propose to do about that she asked he reached out for her and showed her again without words afterwards with her curled up head on his shoulder both of them drifting off toward sleep he wondered if fanny cunningham had listened to the bedsprings creaking he and bedford had teased each other about that every now and again heading off toward work of a morning if fanny heard it now though it had to remind her that her husband wasnt there pinkard hoped bedford was all right he hadnt heard anything different but what did that prove not enough might be my turn next he muttered conscription had scooped more white men out of the sloss works over the past couple of weeks whats that honey emily asked drowsily you say somethin no he said and she fell asleep eventually he did too herman brucks face twisted in annoyance why dont you want to go to the play with me tonight he asked in a low voice doing his best not to draw the notice of anyone else at the socialist party office i just dont herman flora hamburger told him when im done with work im tired what i want to do is go home and rest nothing else that wasnt the entire reason but it was polite and true as far as it went bruck as usual did not know how to take no for an answer but its one of gordins best he exclaimed it has the most powerful arguments against the war ive seen anywhere im already against the war she reminded him i dont need any fresh arguments to be against it what educates the proletariat is liable to bore me but it shows the effect of the war on the poor on the working classes he persisted youll find things you can borrow and get use of here flora exhaled bruck was drawn to her and had trouble realizing she was not drawn to him in return shed done her best to avoid being rude after all whether she went out with him or not they had to work together instead of sharply telling him to go away and stop bothering her she answered i can see the effect on my own family thank you very much my sister married to a soldier my brothers both turning into militarists and liable to go through conscription as soon as they get old enough i was against this war before it was declared remember do you have to keep throwing that in my face he said angrily maybe you were even right i dont know but if the united states win this war and were seen as opposing it we wont win an election anywhere in the country for the next twenty years people will vote for the republicans before they vote for us i dont know about that flora said i dont know about that at all with so many dead with so many maimed even winning this war wont be enough to make anyone glad we fought it write that down bruck exclaimed its a good propaganda point and i havent seen it anywhere else he swung from suitor to political animal like a weathervane in a shifting wind flora preferred him as political animal there his instincts were good which she would not have said about him as a suitor she did write down the idea we should let it come from someone who isnt operating out of new york city she said the roosevelt propaganda machine has made new york socialists pariahs as far as the rest of the country is concerned thats not right bruck said its not fair he calmed down but it is real no doubt about that well manage roosevelt cant censor everything we do no matter how much he wishes he could figuring ways to do that kept bruck happily occupied till quitting time indeed flora was able to slip out the door and down the stairs while he was still shouting into a telephone when she could she preferred to deal with annoying men peacefully and indirectly rather than whipping out a hat pin when peaceful indirect means didnt work speak softly and carry a sharp pin she murmured laughing at the way shed twisted trs slogan but the laughter did not last long roosevelts stick had not been big enough to knock over either the confederacy or canada at the first onslaught which meant casualties by the tens by the hundreds of thousands over chunks of land hardly large enough to serve as burying grounds for the dead soldiers circle men still prowled through the lower east side but fewer of them than in the days just after the remembrance day riots they werent so likely to break heads as they had been then either shed even heard a story that one of them had put aside his truncheon after falling in love with a pretty jewish girl she didnt know whether it was a true story no one seemed to have details that people were telling it was interesting though true or not they wanted to believe it when she got back to her familys apartment her sister esther was helping their mother get supper ready her brother isaac had his nose in a book her other brother david walked in a few minutes after she did looking tired hed got a sewing job and was putting in long hours at it her father came in next hed worked the same hours as his son more or less but bore them better or at least more easily hed been putting in a backbreaking day for many years and was used or resignedto it his pipe smoke though harsher than it had been in the days before the war started still blended nicely with the odor of the stewing chicken in the pot on the stove sophie dragged herself in last of all she was very close to her time of confinement but that didnt keep her from putting in a full days work if you couldnt do the job the boss would find someone who could once shed recovered from having the baby shed have to find a new position too no one would hold the old one for her it wasnt right it wasnt just but as herman bruck had said it was real did i get a letter from yossel today she asked as soon as she walked into the apartment a framed photograph of yossel reisen looking stern in his us army uniform stood on the table next to the divansofa where hed slept so many nights not today sophie esther answered sophie looked disappointed thats three days now with nothing she said setting both hands on her swollen belly as if to say the baby expected to hear from its father too her fingers had got too swollen to let her wear the wedding band yossel had bought for her but she had worn it and more to the point had the right to wear it he hasnt been writing every day flora said and then quickly added but he has been very good about sending you letters for one thing that was true for another now that yossel had made sophie his wife she defended him like a tigress defending its young flora didnt want her thinking she had to do that now suppers ready their mother said another way of defusing a situation that could get sticky over chicken stew benjamin hamburger said i saw in the papers today that we are making good progress in the roanoke valley that we are pushing the confederates back there soon alevai we will clear them out of the land between the blue ridge and the alleghenies you sound like a general papa david hamburger said with a smile did you know where these places were before we went to war i didnt know where these places were before i had a soninlaw fighting there his father answered he snapped his fingers and i didnt care that much either you care about what touches you everything else is not so important thats shortsighted papa flora said respectfully but firmly thats how the bosses keep the workers under their control by mystifying them about what really is important to their wellbeing politics at the supper table we can do without benjamin hamburger said i wasnt talking about politics i was talking about this family you cant separate them like that flora said her father started to raise a hand she got in one last shot before he could if it werent for politics would yossel be in virginia now thats different he said a moment later he looked sheepish if you ask me to explain exactly how its different i may have a little trouble flora smiled at him liking him very much right then not many people had the intellectual honesty to admit something like that because he had admitted it she didnt push him any further the rest of the meal passed in peace afterwards sophie sat and rested while her mother and esther and flora washed the dishes the kitchen was crowded with the three of them in it but they made short work of plates and glasses and pots and silverware someone knocked on the door someone was always knocking on the door neighbors wanting to borrow something neighbors giving something back young men coming to talk or play chess or cards with david and isaac young men coming to call on esther older men coming to talk and smoke with benjamin women coming to gossip delivery boys flora was closest to the door so she opened it the young man who stood in the hall was a few years too young for a military uniform but the western union uniform he had on was of similar color and cut even if its brass buttons were shinier and more aggressively visible than a soldier would have liked telegram for mrs sophie uh he looked down at the yellow envelope he was carryingsophie reisen sophie flora called and started to give him a nickel for delivering the wire she was for a moment puzzled who would send sophie a telegram then the western union boy said no maam i never take money for delivering these he took off his hat when sophie came to the door handed her the envelope and hurried away who is sending me a telegram sophie asked the same question flora had put to herself suddenly flora knew a dreadful certainty god forbid she thought and bit her tongue to keep from saying anything while sophie opened the thin flimsy envelope its from philadelphia sophie said from the secretary of war her voice got weaker and more full of fear with every word she spoke it is my sorrowful duty to inform you that she didnt go on not with words instead she let out a great fullthroated wail of grief that had doors flying open up and down the hallway flora took the telegram from her limp fingers and read through it yossel had died in virginia heroically defending the united states and the restoration of their proper place among the nations of the continent and of the world and the cause of liberty flora wanted to crumple up the telegram and throw it away but didnt because she thought her sister might want to keep it the only truth in it she thought was that yossel was dead everything else was patriotic claptrap sophie hugged her belly and moaned what am i going to do what are we going to do im a widow and i never even had a husband that wasnt quite true but it wasnt far wrong either people came flooding into the apartment the building had heard that kind of anguished cry more than once before everyone knew what it meant women began bringing food everyone whod ever met yossel reisen had a good word for him as did a good many people who hadnt in the midst of the gathering esther asked flora are we going to sit shiva for yossel sophie will flora answered but that went almost without saying would the rest of the family sit in mourning with torn clothes and pray for a solid week everything american in flora and evidently in esther too cried out against it especially for a man who wouldnt yet have been part of the family if he hadnt impregnated their sister but when death struck new customs had a way of sloughing off and old ones reasserting themselves resignedly flora said if mother tells us to do it how can we say no esthers mouth twisted but in the end she nodded and flora knew that while she was rocking back and forth sitting shiva for yossel she would not be mourning him alone but the country and the whole world thrown onto the fire of war salt lake city paul mantarakis said with considerable satisfaction one more fight to go and then weve licked these mormon bastards once and for all matter of fact i hear tell theres one big town after salt lake city ben carlton said place called ogden north of here yeah all right i heard about ogden too mantarakis admitted but it stands to reason once they lose their capital they aint gonna have a whole lot of fight left in em just like the usa and washington right the cook said with weary cynicism mantarakis gave him a resentful look its not the same he said salt lake s the only real city citytype citythe mormons have provo and ogden theyre just towns im from philly remember i know the difference next to what im used to even salt lake city isnt a big thing be a hell of a big fight though carlton predicted gloomily he stirred the cookpot the smell that rose up from it was none too appetizing hed made some kind of horrible stew from bully beef and hardtack and whatever else he happened to have handy paul sighed since hed started wearing stripes on his sleeves he hadnt been able to see to the cooking nearly so often as he had before that meant the whole company ate worse than they would have otherwise gordon mcsweeney a man with a castiron stomach or at least no sense of taste to speak of came up smelled the pot looked into it and scowled at carlton if i were a papist id give that last rites he said he was a sergeant these days too so the cook could only assume an ex pression of injured innocence itll be ready pretty soon he said which considering mcsweeneys editorial comment was apt to be something less than a consummation devoutly to be wished but mcsweeney luckily for him was looking north toward salt lake city now also the axe is laid unto the root of the trees there every tree which bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down and cast into the fire he said because they had no root they withered away so it says in the holy scriptures whose words shall be fulfilled mantarakis looked north too here and there flames burned in the mormons capital artillery fire had blown the gilded angel off the eastcenter tower of the temple and had knocked down two of the other towers but the big building the heart of salt lake city still stood enormous beehive flags flapped defiantly from the towers that survived they read a different book there paul said and they will burn in hell because of it mcsweeney answered sounding as certain as he generally did when speaking of matters of religion the book of mormon is no more the word of god than is an advertising circular for stomach powders it wasnt so much that mantarakis thought mcsweeney wrong he didnt figure the book of mormon was divinely inspired either but the way mcsweeney said it like the way mcsweeney said anything put his back up lot of people up there think youre wrong gordon he remarked the more fools they mcsweeney said they suffer in this world for their arrogance and overweening pride and in the next for their false and blasphemous faith he wasnt simply armored in his faith but also used it as a sword against the foe mantarakis supposed that helped make him a good soldier it also made him a scary man an aeroplane flew in lazy circles above salt lake city spotting targets for the us artillery all of a sudden black puffs of smoke started dotting the otherwise clear summer sky around the aeroplane what artillery the mormons had was mostly here theyd got their hands on it by overrunning camp douglas east and north of town they knew the aeroplane was the us ar tillerys eye in the sky if they brought it down they could fight on more nearly even terms and bring it down they did the aeroplane seemed to stagger in the sky then plunged earthward trailing smoke and flame it crashed just in side the mormon lines the cheer the religious rebels raised rang in mantarakis ears kyrie eleison he muttered for once gordon mcsweeney did not upbraid him for praying in greek damn them mcsweeney said over and over again damn them damn them it wasnt cursing it was nothing like the casual way in which most sol diers would have brought out the words it sounded more as if mcsweeney was instructing god about what needed doing and how to go about it paul wanted to take a couple of steps away from the other sergeant in case god got angry at him for using that tone of voice with their great factories the united states had guns especially devoted to antiaircraft fire and others given nothing but ground targets the mormon insurgents did not enjoy the luxury of specialization having shot down the aeroplane they began working over the frontline trenches in which mantarakis and his companions sheltered he crouched down in the dirt hands clutching his head his body folded up into a ball to make himself the smallest possible target hed been through worse in kentucky the confederates had far more guns to fire at us forces than the mormons did but any barrage was a bowelloosener the ground shook and jumped shrapnel balls and fragments of shell casing filled the air whether he lived or died wasnt really in his hands not for the time being either gods providence or random luck de pending on how the world worked would decide his fate after about half an hour the mormon guns eased up men helped their wounded comrades back toward the rear mormon snipers took potshots at them the mormons were short of men short of guns short of munitions but they not only held the high ground they had their artillery on the mountain spur above temple square not far from the wreckage of what had been the state capitol before the revolt but they also knew the terrain well and squeezed from it all the advantages they could first lieutenant cecil schneider made his way down the battered trench line seeing how his company had come through he was a little weedy fellow who would have looked more at home in mechanics coveralls than in his grimy us uniform hed been leading the company since captain hinshaw died a lot of companies had lieutenants commanding them these days and more than one had no surviving officers left at all schneider sniffed at ben carltons stew pot sighed and crouched down by it he took out his mess kit im hungry enough for this to smell good he said paul mantarakis didnt know if he could get that hungry but he was aware he had higher standards than most people carlton as if vindicated filled the lieutenants tray with stew schneider dug in sighed again and kept on eating that mantarakis understood you had to keep the machine fueled or it wouldnt run when schneider was nearly done mantarakis asked sir is there any way of rooting out the mormons without going straight at them general staff doesnt seem to think so schneider answered theyve got the great salt lake on one side and the mountains on the other after all its not going to be pretty but its what weve got to do not going to be pretty was a euphemism for forward companies getting melted down to nothing like candles burning out paul knew that so no doubt did lieutenant schneider sir mantarakis said are the two divi sions weve got here going to be enough to do the job i hear we have more troops on the way schneider answered this sort of fighting chews up men by carloads he sighed one more time now not about the vile stew we have the men to spend and were spending them this narrow front makes the fighting as bad as it is in the roanoke valley or in maryland mormons dont help ben carlton said the rebs fought fair anyways any civilian you see here man woman boy girlis gonna cut your throat in a second if he catches you asleep you got that right mantarakis turned to lieutenant schneider sir once we beat these mormons flat what the hell are we going to do with them what the hell can we do with them ubi solitudinem faciunt pacem appellant schneider answered that made gordon mcsweeney rumble down deep in his chest he obviously didnt know what it meant but he knew it was latin given how he felt about the catholic church that was plenty to make him suspicious sir paul said he didnt know what it meant either hed grown up speaking greek but you needed more in the way of education than hed picked up to throw latin around like that where they make a desert they call it peace schneider said mcsweeney rumbled again this time in approval just what the mormons deserve he said solitude lake city mantarakis stared at him mcsweeney joking was about as likely as pigs with wings he couldnt let it go by without trying to top it yeah well make a desert out of deseret he said lieutenant schneider laughed ben carlton looked from one punster to the other equally disgusted with both you birds dont shut up i aint gonna feed you promises promises paul said which made schneider laugh louder than ever irving morrell studied the situation map of utah with considerable dissatisfaction if it had been up to him he would have tried to push men through the wasatch mountains and he would also have had a column coming down from idaho to make the mormons divide their forces and keep them from concentrating everything they had on the main us attack but it wasnt up to him he was new at general staff headquarters and only a major hed made suggestions hed sent memoranda he might have been shouting into the void for all the attention the higherups paid him he hadnt expected much different sooner or later theyd listen to him on something small if it worked theyd listen to him on something bigger a lieutenant came up to him saluted and said major morrell when morrell admitted he was who he was the lieutenant saluted and said general woods compliments sir and hed like to see you immediately if youll please follow me sir yes ill follow you morrell said without another word the lieutenant turned and hurried away walking along behind him morrell wondered what enormity hed committed to make the chief of the us general staff land on him personally he didnt think his memoranda on the utah campaign had been as intemperate as all that maybe he was wrong no evidently he was wrong he shrugged if speaking his mind made them want to ship him out odds were theyd send him back to one of the fighting fronts and let him com mand a battalion again that wasnt so bad a captain in an outer office who was pounding away on a typewriter looked up when the lieutenant brought in morrell after hed been identified the captainpresumably woods adjutantnodded and said oh yes let me tell the general hes here he vanished into the chief of staffs inner sanctum then emerged once more come right in major morrell hes expecting you he didnt sound overtly hostile but the general staff had an air of genteel politeness over and above the usual military courtesies so that didnt signify anything wondering whether to ask for a blindfold morrell walked past the captain and into the office he came to stiff attention and saluted major irving morrell reporting as ordered sir at ease morrell leonard wood said returning the salute he was a broadshouldered man in his midfifties with irongray hair and a kaiser bill mustache waxed to a pointed perfection that didnt quite go with his craggy tiredlooking features morrell eased his brace only a fraction wood said relax major youre not in trouble the reverse in fact sir morrell said he couldnt fathom why the general had summoned him if not to call him on the carpet instead of explaining wood went off on a tangent you may have heard that i earned a medical degree before i went into the army yes sir i have heard that morrell agreed he didnt know where general wood was going but he wasnt about to try to keep him from getting there good the chief of staff said then youll have an easier time under standing why i was extremely interested when a memorandum from you and dr wagner reached my desk earlier this year dr wagner in any setting less august morrell would have scratched his head im afraid i dont remember from tucson wood broke in impatiently the memorandum where the two of you were discussing the potential advantages of protective headgear light dawned on morrell oh yes sir he said hed utterly forgotten the physicians name if hed ever known it hed forgotten their conversation shortly before he was discharged too hed figured the doctor had also forgotten it but that looked to be wrong not only had wagner remembered but hed remembered to give morrell half the credit too not just a doctor that damn near made him a prince general wood leaned over the side of his chair picked something up and set it on his desk a steel helmet shaped like a bowl with a projecting brim in front and an extension in the back to give the neck a little extra protection what do you think of your idea major he asked morrell picked up the helmet it weighed he guessed a couple of pounds leather webbing inside kept it from resting right on a mans head a leather chin strap with an adjustable buckle would help it stay on he rapped the greengray painted metal with his knuckles will it really stop bullets sir he asked wood shook his head not square hits no it would probably have to be three times as heavy to do that but it will deflect glancing rounds and a lot of shrapnel balls and shell fragments head wounds are so often fatal anything we can do to diminish them works to our advantage sir youre a hundred per cent right about that morrell said he thought of the man in the bed next to him in tucson the man whod been made into a vegetable in the blink of an eye the memory made him want to shiver better to die straight out than to linger on like that without hope of ever having a working mind again a commendation for this idea will go into your permanent file major wood said our german allies i understand are going to copy the notion from us and ive heard though its always hard to gauge how much truth comes from sources in enemy country that the froggies are also working along similar lines but we have the helmet first and thats thanks in large part to you thank you very much sir morrell said getting credit for the idea had never crossed his mind not least because hed never thought it would see the light of day i hope doctor uh wagner gets a commendation too sir if it hadnt been for him this never would have gotten off the ground yes he has a commendation coming too general wood assured him but such things count for rather more on a fighting soldiers curriculum vitae eh yes sir morrell hefted the helmet sir may i keep this one if im ever transferred back to the front ill need one and id be honored to have it be the one you gave me yourself my pleasure wood said and morrell tucked the helmet under his left arm the chief of staff studied him so you want to get back to the front do you why does that not surprise me fighting the war with map and wire isnt your chosen style is it morrell had had very much the same thought himself sir i like the out doors i always have i like hiking and fishing and hunting a lot better than fill ing out forms and such i think im more useful to the country up at the front if you want to know the truth general wood steepled his fingers what youre saying major is that youd have a better time up at the front than you do here which is not the same as being more useful to the country were going to teach you everything we can here major and i suspect youll teach us a few things too if you measure up well change the color of the oak leaves on your shoulders maybe give you eagles instead and well send you back to the front in charge of a regiment then youll be more useful to your country uh thank you sir morrell said again hed dared hope something like that might happen but he hadnt taken the notion seriously he made a men tal note to write general foulke a thankyou letter foulke must have seen something in him that he liked and sent him on to the general staff to find out if they saw it too that was how careers got made if you were goodand lucky enough to be good when people were watching wood said this isnt for your benefit major its for the benefit of the united states of america we are surrounded by foes on all sides as we have been since the days of the war of secession the confederate states and the empire of mexico to the south canada to the north england and france across an atlantic none too wide and the japanese and the british empire across the pacific seizing the sandwich islands was a heavy blow against them otherwise theyd be menacing our western coast even now but they are going to try to take those islands back as a first step toward carrying the war to our shores surrounded as i say we cant afford to waste talent if we see it he went from cordial to brisk in the space of a heartbeat dismissed major morrell saluted did a smart aboutface and left the office of the chief of the general staff the lieutenant was still in the antechamber with general woods adjutant he bounced to his feet do you need me to guide you back to your assigned area sir i dont think so morrell answered i expect i can manage on my own unless the birds have eaten the trail of crumbs i left behind the lieutenant looked blank the adjutant chuckled recognizing the allusion three different men stopped morrell in the hallway all of them exclaim ing about the helmet he was carrying two of them like him were ecstatic the third a whitebearded brigadier general in his late sixties who might have first seen action in the war of secession shook his head in dismay its a damned shame we have to resort to means like those to fill the men with the spirit of aggression he growled and walked on being far outranked morrell didnt answer he didnt see anything wrong with giving the common soldier some slightly better chance to do his job with out getting killed or dreadfully wounded he set the helmet down beside the map of the utah rebellion try as he would he couldnt make himself believe the general staff had come up with the best possible plan there was his first efforts to convince his superiors otherwise had failed if he was going to try again hed have to be more subtle he was poring over the map when someone behind him said major morrell yes morrell turned around before the turn was completed he came to attention and revised his words yes mr president theodore roosevelt pointed to the helmet general wood tells me thats partly your idea its a bully one i must say we aim to win this war but we aim to do it with the greatest possible efficiency and care for the men who fight it your notion goes a long way toward that end congratulations thank you sir morrell said hed known wood and tr were longtime friends he hadnt imagined that might ever matter to him what other useful ideas have you roosevelt pointed to the map of utah how would you cauterize that running sore for instance he sighed my experience has been that man for man mormons make excellent even outstanding citizens in a mass though their religion gives them the ambition to be a nationality of their own rather than americans this i realize is in no small measure engendered by the treatment they have received at the hands of the united states since the s but fault is irrelevant revolt and secession from our country cannot be tolerated yes sir morrell said what would i do in utah sir he took a deep breath and explained to the president what he would do in utah roosevelt listened with poker face till he was through then said have you presented these ideas to the general staff with a view toward implement ing them i have presented them yes sir morrell answered my superiors are of the opinion theyre impractical fiddlesticks tr burst out your superiors are of the opinion that since they didnt think of these things themselves they cant be any good thats what you get for your low rank major morrell he stood up straight and stuck out his chest have not got a low rank major when i see something worth doing it has a way of getting done im glad we had this little talk a very good day to you he hurried off morrell stared after him somewhere between horror and delight if roo sevelt started shouting orders the plan for operations in utah would change morrell was confident enough that the results could not be worse than those now being obtained would they be better would they be perceived as being better if they were perceived as being better would he get the credit for thator the blame roosevelt slammed a door behind him he was shouting already morrell glanced over to the helmet hed brought from general woods office he snorted when he took it he hadnt imagined hed need to wear it inside gen eral staff headquarters but tr might have taken care of that achilles started crying this was the third time hed started crying since cincinnatus and elizabeth had gone to bed cincinnatus didnt think it was far past midnight the baby might wake up a couple of more times before morning when he woke up cincinnatus woke up hed be a shambling wreck on the covington docks hed been a shambling wreck a lot of the days since achilles was born with a small groan elizabeth staggered out of bed and over to the cradle where achilles lay she picked him up and carried him into the front room to nurse him nights were even harder on her than they were on cincinnatus she came back from her domestics work ready to fall asleep over supper cincinnatus twisted and turned trying to get comfortable and get back to sleep in the process he wrapped sheet and blanket around himself till he might have been a mummy when elizabeth came back she had to unroll him to give herself some bedclothes that woke him up again when the cheap alarm clock on the nightstand jangled he jerked upright as horrified as if a confederate aeroplane had dropped a bomb on the house next door then he had to shake elizabeth out of slumber she hadnt so much as heard the horrible racket the clock made they both dressed in a fog of fatigue the smell of coffee drew cincinna tus to the kitchen like a magnet though the stuff for sale in covington these days had more chicory in it than the genuine bean whatever it was made of it pried his eyelids open after bacon and eggs and cornbread he was more nearly ready to face the day than he would have believed possible fifteen min utes earlier someone knocked on the front door elizabeth opened it hello mother livia she said hello dear cincinnatus mother answered hows my little grandbaby without giving elizabeth a chance to answer she went on he must have been a terror in the night againi kin see it in your face cincinnatus grabbed his dinner pail and hurried out the door pausing only to kiss his mother on the cheek that damned lieutenant kennan timed things with a stopwatch if you were half a minute late you could kiss work for the day goodbye cincinnatus had seen it happen to too many other people to intend to let it happen to him get your black ass going the us lieutenant snarled at him when he got to the waterfront from kennan that was almost an endearment barges full of crates of munitions had crossed the ohio cincinnatus and his work crew unloaded the barges and loaded trucks and wagons us soldiers drove them off toward the front cincinnatus had given up asking to be a teamster the yankees wouldnt hear of it even if it would have freed up more of their men for actual fighting at the front lines he disguised a shrug in a stretch as he walked back to unload another crate whites in the csa had better sense black men in the confederacy did everything but fight they drove they cooked they washed they dug trenches without them white confederate manpower would have been stretched too thin to have any hope of holding back the us hordes when the long day was done the paymaster gave cincinnatus the fifty cent hardwork bonus god damn said herodotus who stood behind him in line that theres gettin to be your reglar rate got me a baby in the house now cincinnatus said as if that explained everythingwhich to him it did herodotus said plenty fellers here got five six eight chillun in de house dont see them gettin no bonus cincinnatus shrugged again that wasnt his lookout an awful lot of people in this world wanted just to get by no more hed always had his eye on doing better than that even now in the middle of the war he had his eye on the main chance he didnt know what would come of it but he did know he couldnt win if he didnt bet herodotus made a point of not walking home with him as if to say he disapproved of such effort that meant cincinnatus was by himself when he noticed a wonderful smell in the warm wet late summer air a moment later a delivery wagon with the words kentucky smoke house painted in big red letters rounded the corner he waved to the driver apicius son felix felix slowed down and waved back my pa he say for you to come in some time before too long he called he got somethin he want to talk over with you do it right now cincinnatus said felix nodded flicked the reins and got the wagon moving again when cincinnatus got to the kentucky smoke house the aroma there reminded him how hungry he was after a day hauling heavy crates apicius other son lucullus was basting the meat that turned on a spit over the firepit seeing cincinnatus he waved him into a little back room in there apicius was stirring spices into a bubbling pot making up more of the wonderful sauce that went onto his barbecued beef and pork ha he said when cincinnatus came in saw felix did you sure did cincinnatus answered he said you wanted to see me bout somethin somethin to do with the underground i reckon he spoke quietly after having closed the door behind him apicius gave the mixture in the iron pot another stir might say that he replied after a moment he gave cincinnatus a thoughtful glance howd you get mixed up with those underground folks anyways wish i hadnt pretty much cincinnatus said but the white man i used to work for hes one of em and he was always pretty decent to me sides from what ive seen i aint got much use for the usa neither he met and held apicius eyes how bout you unless he got answers that satisfied him he wasnt going to say anything more apicius massive shoulders went up and down in a shrug first time the yankee soldiers come in here they clean me out of everything i got they say they shoot me if i squawk an they call me more kind o namesn i ever hear before they aint done nothin like that since mind you but it dont make me want to cheer for the stars an stripes yeah thats about right cincinnatus sighed i be go to hell though if i see us black folks gettin any kind o square deal after the war an it dont matter if the usa or the csa win dats the exact truth apicius said emphatically the exact truth an nothin but the truth so help me god he held up a meaty hand as if taking oath in court not that blacks could testify against whites in court not in the csa after stirring the barbecue sauce again he went on on de odder hand theres undergrounds and then theres undergrounds is that a fact cincinnatus said if apicius was going to come to a point he hoped the fat cook would do it soon and in his own way apicius did offhandedly he asked you ever hear tell about the manifesto he didnt say what kind of manifesto if cincinnatus hadnt heard of it he probably would have slid the talk around to something innocuous then sent him on his way none the wiser but cincinnatus did know what he was talking about he stared wideeyed be you one of the people who he didnt go on hed heard about reds a good many times always in the whispers that were the only safe way to mention such people he hadnt really imagined he would meet such an exotic specimen we git justice for ourselves apicius said in a voice that had nothing in it of the jollyfatman persona he affected only steely determination come the revolution nobody treat a workin man like dirt only on account of he be black that was a heady vision cincinnatus however had already met the heady visions of the confederacy and the united states and seen how neither reality lived up to those visions he had no reason save hope blinder than he could justify to believe the red vision would be different and besides even if the revolution come in the csa right now we be under the usa and it dont look like they gonna give us up revolution comin in the usa too apicius replied with calm certainty now we kin help the red brothers in the csa we git stuff they kin use ship it south an what so funny between giggles cincinnatus got out we take stuff the white men in the confederate states ship north an use it to drive the damnyankees crazy then we take stuff the damnyankees ship south an use it to drive the white men in the csa crazy if that aint funny what is apicius smile was thin the only thin thing about him but it was a smile you wif us then when elizabeth found out shed want to kill him he had a baby now he was supposed to be careful that consideration made him hesitate a good half a second before he answered yes up in pennsylvania jake featherston had been acutely conscious that hed come to a foreign country houses looked different the winter weather had been harsher than he was used to the local civilians those who hadnt fled before the advancing army of northern virginia had looked and sounded different from their counterparts in the csa and they hadnt made any bones about despising the men in butternut whod overrun their farms and towns now the army of northern virginia wasnt advancing any more it wasnt in pennsylvania any more either hampstead maryland where jakes battery in the first richmond howitzers was stationed looked a lot more like a corresponding small town in virginia than had anything hed seen in pennsylvania the old hampstead store for instance wouldnt have been out of place in some rural county seat outside of richmond a twostory clapboard building a hundred years old if it was a day in the shape of an l with a massive water pump shielded from the street by the longer side of the l nero was working the pump when hed filled a bucket perseus lugged it over to the horse trough the draft animals that had pulled the batterys can nons and ammunition limbers drank greedily dont give em too much too fast jake said warningly theyre liable to get the colic and peg out and we cant afford that not now yes suh marse jake i knows perseus answered but they got to drink some they been workin hard i know featherston said i dont think well do much more moving back though he paused to wipe his sweaty forehead we belter not or well be fighting this damn war back in virginia jeb stuart iii came round the corner in time to hear that it will not hap pen sergeant he said crisply they will not get past us they will not come any farther all right we couldnt take philadelphia thats too bad it might have made the damnyankees roll over and show us their bellies like the cow ardly curs they are but maryland we hold washington we hold and were going to keep them yes sir jake saidyou didnt get anywhere arguing with your captain but he couldnt help adding if the damnyankees are such terrible cowards how come theyre moving forward and were going back we arent stuart said not one more step backi have that straight from the war department in richmond when jeb stuart iii had something straight from the war department in richmond he had it straight from his father whod worn the wreathed stars of a confederate general for a good many years that sort of information came straight from the horses mouth then featherston said its good to hear sirif the yankees cooperate for a moment stuart seemed more a tired modern soldier than the cava lier he tried to be his shoulders sagged a little the trouble with the yan kees sergeant is that god was having an off day when he made them because he turned out altogether too many they die by thousands but more thousands keep comingas you may perhaps have noticed who me sir all too well featherston remembered the us barrage that had cost him his first gun crew and remembered pouring shells into oncoming greengray waves till they broke barely beyond rifle range of his piece theres a lot of weight behind them he agreed there certainly is weight of metal and weight of men stuart said and they use that advantage of size in place of true courage battering us down by stunning us with their big guns and then drowning us in those as saults that leave hillsides and meadows paved with broken bodies from one end to the other you ask me sergeant that has very little to do with real courage real elan as our gallant french allies call it elan consists of throwing yourself at the foe regardless of his size and in going forward for the simple reason that you refuse to admit to yourself you might be beaten look what it did for us in the opening days of the war yes sir jake said took us all the way to the susquehanna but not quite to the delaware if wed made it to the delaware we surely would have crossed it and broken into philadelphia stuart agreed and baltimore would have withered on the vine but without elan could we have stopped the yankee break out from baltimore before it trapped all our forces up in pennsylvania i guess not sir featherston said which by the sour look stuart gave him was not a good enough answer but he didnt know whether it had been elan or good field fortifications that had stopped the us drive for that matter he didnt know for a fact it was stopped the yankees were still shipping men and materiel down into the bulge around baltimore sooner or later it would burst again like any carbuncle but if they break past poplar springs toward frederick we may have to skedaddle out of here yet now stuart looked angry hed had his theory contradicted he put a bit ing edge in his voice sergeant ive seen the trench lines weve constructed to make sure the yankees dont break out i am confident they will hold against any pressure brought to bear against them just as i am confident the lines ahead of us will hold against any conceivable pressure from the north yes sir featherston said woodenly he was kicking himself for dis agreeing with the captain after hed told himself not to be so foolish but damn it wasnt he a free white man with the right to say anything he chose the way the army treated you you had to act like a negro to your superiors he didnt see the justice in that pompey came up and said captain stuart suh your supper will be ready in a couple minutes we found us a nice wine to go with your lamb chops suh im sure youll enjoy it i dont doubt that stuart said pompey went on his way watching him stuart returned to the argument with jake without our niggers the yankees would squash us flat no way around it but with them to build the works we use every white confederate man is a fighting man we use our resources more efficiently than the usa can yes sir thats a fact featherston agreed now anxious for nothing so much as to get the battery commander out of his hair he was watching pompey too still wondering whether hed been right to tell that major about stuarts servant hed never find out now not with the influence a stuart had in richmond just because he was a stuart happier now that the sergeant was agreeing with him captain stuart headed off presumably to enjoy his lamb chops featherston wasnt going to be eating lamb chops hed have whatever came out of the battery kettle probably some horrible slumgullion whose sole virtue was filling his belly he wouldnt have a nice wine with his slop either he clicked tongue between teeth the first richmond howitzers had been an aristocratic regiment since the days of the war of secession hed managed to get in because he was good at what he did everybody above the rank of sergeant had got in by being good at who he was some times the differences were more glaring than others to nero perseus said bet you that pompey he gwine eat hisself lamb chops tonight too i dunno nero answered maybe he gwine wait till capn stuart done used em up then go to the latrine to git em both black men laughed so did jake featherston down deep inside seeing the armys negroes distrusting one another made white men sleep better at night actually nothing could have made featherston sleep well that night us aeroplanes buzzed over hampstead dropping bombs at random none of them landed within a couple of hundred yards of the battery none of them so far as jake could judge from the absence of screams and cries of alarm from confederate soldiers landed within a couple of hundred yards of any worth while target even landing out of the range where they could do any damage though they made a hell of a racket antiaircraft guns hammered away at the us bombers adding to the din they didnt hit anything or at least the rhythm of the engines throbbing overhead didnt falter eventually the us aeroplanes gave up and flew back to the north jake rolled himself tighter in his blanket which was stiflingly hot but which had the virtue of shielding large areas of his anatomy from mosquitoesand went back to sleep some time in the wee small hours another flight of bombing aeroplanes visited hampstead again they dropped their bombs with nothing more than the vaguest idea of where those bombs might land and again the bombs did no damage featherston could discern they did however wake him up and keep him awake when he would sooner have grabbed as much sleep as he could get the next morning shambling around like a drunk barely remembering his own name he realized the bombers had done some damage after all xix a few miles outside of boston harbor patrick odonnell stuck his head out of the cabin of the spray and called to george enos the submersible has cast off the tow and the telephone line haul em aboard aye aye skipper enos answered the biggest difference between life aboard the spray and the way things had gone aboard the ripple was that commands got answered in navy talk these days george wished he had a winch with which to haul in the thick line and the insulated telephone wire wrapped around it but the spray had no winches for its own trawls and one would have looked decidedly out of place at the stern the steam trawler wanted to look like an ordinary fishing boat not arousing the suspicions of entente warships till too late and so he did the work by hand harvey kemmel said talk about locking the barn door after the horse has been stolen although he had been in the navy for years kemmel still flavored his speech with midwestern farm talk george enos sometimes found incompre hensible and often amusing today though he could do nothing but nod we were a little on the excited side when we sank that rebel submarine he admitted beginners luck you might say one way to put it kemmel said christ our pictures in the paper and everything felt good while it lasted but we havent had a sniff from the rebs or the canucks since a nibble enos would have said however you said it though the message was the same nobody could prove the enemy was wise to the trick the spray and other boats like her were trying to play but neither she nor any of those other boats had lured a cruiser or a submarine to destruction since either hey weve got a good load of fish in the hold george said pausing for a moment to look back over his shoulder kemmel rolled his eyes i dont think im ever going to look a fish in the face again now that i know what a hell of a lot of work it is to try and catch the bastards i thought i was tired on a destroyer but i didnt know what tired was i feel like somebody rode me hard and put me away wet that was another comparison enos never would have come up with on his own he had trouble remembering the last time hed ridden a horse again though he understood what his comrade was driving at he answered the smaller the boat the more work it takes you did this stuff for years didnt you kemmel said each cat his own rat but he shook his head in bemusement id sooner fish than watch a horses rear end all day george answered dirt farming being the only thing he could think of that might possibly have been harder work than fishing soon as i got old enough though i got off my pas farm and as far away as i could go kemmel shot back war hadnt come along you would have kept on doing this your whole blessed life george enos shut up and went back to pulling in the heavy wet rope and the telephone line one tug after another hand over hand it was hard work but easier than bringing in the trawl full of fish there was at the moment nothing at the end of this rope hed just brought in the dripping end and coiled the rope neatly in place when a tug steamed up alongside the spray and demanded her papers no ship got into the harbor these days without being stopped and inspected first since they were navy passing the inspection proved easy enough a pilot came aboard to guide them through the mine fields protecting boston from enemy raiders every time they came back from a trip out to one fishing bank or another more mines had been sown every once in a while the mines came loose from their moorings too then pilot or no pilot a boat or even a ship was likely to go to the bottom in a hurry wonder where the submersibles gone enos said as had become its custom the submersible had remained under the sea after releasing the tow line maybe it went into boston sneaking under the mines or maybe to one of the other ports nearby harvey kemmel laughed i can tell you aint been in the navy long you still ask questions what they want you to know theyll tell you what they dont want you to know aint your business anyhow george would have argued with him but he looked to be right the pilot brought them in to t wharf as if the spray were an ordinary fishing boat patrick odonnell disposed of the catch as if she were an ordinary trawler too then the illusion that she was still a part of the civilian world took a beating an officer with a lieutenant commanders two mediumwidth stripes surrounding a narrow one strolled up the wharf to the spray and said men youll come with me we have some matters to discuss by that he meant he would tell them what to do and they would do it whats going on sir george asked him off to one side harvey kemmel snickered enos ears got hot he did still ask questions the united states were a free country and most places you could do things like that but when you were in the navy your freedom disappeared im going to pretend i didnt hear that the lieutenant commander said the hell of it was george understood the fellow was doing him a favor they all walked down t wharf after the officer real fishermen and other people with business on the wharf gave them curious looks those who didnt know they were navy themselves what the dickens did a spruce lieutenant commander want with a bunch of ragamuffins in dungarees and overalls and slickers and hats that had seen better days most of the couple of blocks just back of t wharf were full of tackle shops and saloons and boatbuilders offices and whorehouses businesses serving the fishing trade and the men who worked it in one of the whorehouses a girl stood naked behind a filmy curtain a living advertisement a cop across the street looked the other way actually he looked right in at her but he didnt do anything about her george looked at her too he was happy being married to sylvia but he was a long way from blind he flicked a glance up toward the lieutenant commander the mans head never moved maybe his eyes slid to the right but george wouldnt have bet on it he seemed as straight an arrow as enos had come across in some time he led the crew from the spray into a navy recruiting station sandwiched between a saloon and a cheap diner charlie white said scuse me sir but we already joined up the exfishermen all laughed the sailors who filled out the crew didnt a couple of young men sat in there talking earnestly with a grayhaired petty officer enos had a pretty fair idea what they were doing trying to con vince him they ought to be allowed to put on whites before conscription made them don greengray from things hed read about what life in the trenches was like and from the blackbordered casualty lists the papers printed day in and day out he had a hard time blaming them the lieutenant commander led the men from the spray into a back room be seated men he said waving to the chairs around the big wooden table there were just enough chairs for the ersatz fishermen and at the head of the table for the officer as george enos sat down he wondered if that was a co incidence he had his doubts the navy didnt run on coincidences he also wondered if patrick odonnell would start asking questions odonnell after all had commanded a naval vessel that had helped sink a confederate submarine while the lieutenant commander had the look of a man who didnt go to sea much but the former skipper of the ripple sat silent he had too much navy in his blood to pressure an officer the lieutenant commander coughed maybe he was having trouble coming to the point george didnt like that if somebody didnt want to tell you something odds were you didnt want to hear it either at last the officer did speak men we are ending the program in which you have been engaged results have not shown themselves to be commensurate to the effort involved kemmel and schoonhoven and a couple of other regular navy men aboard the spray nodded it didnt matter to them one job another job so what they were little rivets on a big machine theyd fit wherever someone put them now patrick odonnell found his voice but sir we did sink a submarine i know you did the lieutenant commander said another towing couple sank one off the western coast of the empire of mexico too both though came in the very earliest days of the program and both unfortu nately received wide publicity now our enemies are suspicious of targets that look too tempting to be true and towed submersibles are operating with a far smaller range than would be the case if they were cruising on their own and so he spread his hands what do we do now sir in that case odonnell asked youll be reassigned of course the lieutenant commander answered crisply orders have already been cut for all of you and transportation arranged for those being moved out of the area he pushed back his chair the legs scraped against the floor i have them in my office ill distribute them to you wait here he left the room returning a moment later with a manila folder from which he drew envelopes with names typed on them he handed odonnell his without hesitation but had to ask who the other men were george enos fingers fumbled with the flap of the envelope as if they didnt want to find out what lay inside no not as if he had no desire whatever to learn that the faceless redtape twisters in philadelphia had sent him to new york or san diego or san francisco or want to or not he pulled out the papers folded into the fat envelope the name leaped out at him at once st louis he said his voice a raw hiss of pain report at once to the river monitor uss punishment st louis missouri a train ticket fell out of the mass of other papers he stared at it in horrified dismay sir this says im supposed to leave this afternoon thats correct the lieutenant commander agreed we expected the spray in three or four days ago and made arrangements accordingly your family will be notified i assure you your family will be notified a bloodless way to say it a gutless way to do it sylvia would be at the canning plant now he couldnt reach her there the children were at mrs conevals but she had no telephone any more than his own apartment did send a wire he shook his head that would make sylvia think hed been killed charlie white said san diego in that same wounded disbelieving voice they looked at each other despite the difference in the color of their skins they were in that moment very much alike marshlands had two wheelchairs now the old one for upstairs and a new one with bigger wheels one also easier to maneuver outside for downstairs anne colleton had bought the second chair without a murmur after watching scipio bump her brother down the stairway and escape losing control of the chair only by luck getting jacob colleton downstairs without having to bring his chair along certainly made matters easier for scipio he wheeled the mistress brother to the top of the staircase helped him rise draped one of jacobs arms over his own shoulder let the gassed man hang onto the banister with the other hand and walked down more or less normally then he eased jacob colleton down into the other wheelchair my gun colleton rasped are you certain that is what you require sir scipio asked tonelessly as usual jacob reeked of whiskey hed also given himself an injection of morphia not long before the butler did not think well of a drunk drugged mans prospects for straight shooting jacob colleton glared at him his body was wrecked his eyes redtracked and blurry but the hate and rage that poured out from them made scipio back up half a step in alarm they werent aimed at him in particular but at the world as a whole the world that had done what it had done to jacob that made them more frightening not less bring me my gun colleton hissed he paused to draw a painful breath then added if youre lucky ill give you a running start scipios laugh was dutiful he might have found that funnier if he hadnt been sure miss annes brother at least half meant it ill be back directly sir he said and went upstairs again hung on brackets above the bed in which he could sleep only propped up by pillows jacob colleton had a tredegar military rifle scipio took it and a couple of tenround clips of ammunition and carried them down to colleton jacob laid the rifle across the arms of his wheelchair and stuck the ammunition in one of the deep pockets of his robe push me over by that stand of trees he told scipio you know the one by the nigger cottages yes sir scipio said see what kind of varmints i can get colleton went on what a caliber bullet meant for knocking over men at five hundred yards did to a squirrel at fifty wasnt pretty but jacob colleton didnt seem to care much about that he was a good shot a far better shot than he had been before he went off to war he looked up at scipio those pale eyes blazing i keep wish ing it was damnyankees in my sights do you have any idea what im telling you no you wouldnt how could you but scipio did as he opened the front door so he could push jacob colleton out of marshlands he thought of the negro revolutionary cell to which hed so unwillingly become attached and of their endless hungry murmurs of come de revolution come the revolution theyd take aim at jacob colleton with exactly the same loving hate he lavished on the men of the usa a couple of negro children broke off their games to stare at jacob and scipio as they went by colleton made as if to lift his rifle you better run fast you damn little pickaninnies he croaked run the children did squealing in delicious fear colleton laughed his ghastly shattered laugh he looked up at scipio again if i dont have any luck in the woods ill bag em on the way back to marshlands scipio maintained a prudent silence again he thought colleton was mak ing a joke again he wasnt sure enough to be comfortable some of the trees by the negro cabins bore fruit or nuts the plantation hands shared out what they got from them some of the trees and bushes were just there and had been there since before the war of secession maybe before the american revolution colleton clicked a magazine into the tredegar and chambered the first round scipio stood behind the wheelchair he had other things he needed to be doing plenty of them unless miss anne called him they wouldnt get done for a while jacob wanted to be moved every so often if he didnt shoot anything if scipio wasnt there to move him he really might use the butler for target practice on his reappearance a crow flapped by and landed in a pecan tree fast as a striking snake jacob colleton slapped the rifle to his shoulder aimed and fired the report as always made scipio jump and his heart start to pound he wondered what war sounded like every time he tried to imagine it his imagination rebelled the crow lost its perch and fell to the ground with a plop it lay a black puddle on the grass and moss and leaves below the tree with a click jacob colleton worked the bolt and brought a fresh cartridge into the chamber the brass casing hed ejected glittered by the wheelchair good shot sir scipio said shall i recover the bird dont bother colleton wheezed crow isnt worth eating no kind of crow is worth eating you say that to a negro scipio wanted to snatch the rifle out of his hand and smash in his skull when whites came out with witless cracks like that it did more than cassius red rhetoric to make scipio think the black revolution was not only needed but might succeed no matter how sharp jacob col letons eyes were he was blind colleton fired again missed and swore his trainwrecked voice made ordinary words sound extraordinarily vile killing a foolish possum a few minutes later partially restored his spirits you can get that he told scipio give it to one of those little niggers for the pot every once in a while he remembered he was still supposed to be a gentleman scipio carried the possum back by the tail jacob colleton had put a bullet half an inch back of one eye the ugly little beast couldnt have known what hit it and possum after some time in the pot or the bake oven was tasty eat ing indeed very good shooting sir scipio said laying the little body down beside the wheelchair jacob colleton started to say something but coughed instead he kept coughing and finally started to turn blue at last as scipio helplessly stood by he mastered the spasm lord god almighty he whispered feels as if theyre taking sandpaper and a blowtorch to my insides along with the clips of ammunition he had a silver flask in one pocket of his robe he gulped from it swallowed and gulped again his color slowly improved he looked down at the possum he had killed good shooting scipio he shook his head this is nothing its not even proper sport the possum cant shoot back sir scipio knew he was supposed to say something in response to that but for the life of him couldnt figure out what colleton breathed whiskey up into his face dont look at me like that i wasnt joking not even slightly what better game to play what more exciting game to play than wagering your life that youre a better shot than the damnyankee on the far side of the barbed wire but machine guns cheat artillery cheats gas cheats worst of all it doesnt care how good a soldier you are if youre in the wrong place it kills you and theres no sport at all about that again scipio kept his mouth shut a robin flew down toward a treetop jacob colleton fired while it was still on the wing it seemed to explode in midair feathers drifted to the ground scipios eyes got wide that wasnt just good shooting it was outstanding shooting and since there wasnt much left of the poor songbird colleton hadnt done it for any reason but to show off and maybe to savor the moment of killing something scipio shivered after hed killed a squirrel and missed a couple of shots jacob said enough of this take me back inside yes sir scipio said and he did he helped miss annes brother upstairs and back into the pillowstrewn bed in which he could not lie down scipio whose mind took strange leaps these days wondered how he did what he did with the women he summoned to his room the negro who was very conventional in those matters had trouble imagining alternatives he escaped from the bedroom with more than a little relief but try as he would he could not escape jacob colleton down in the kitchen he ran into cassius the hunter was bringing in a turkey hed killed in the woods beyond the cotton fields cassius had been very quiet since his return from what hed told anne colleton was jubal marberrys plantation now he signaled scipio with his eyes the two of them walked outside a stove had made the kitchen blazing hot no stove burned outside but it was blazing hot there too and so muggy scipio expected rain he and cassius strolled along side by side they made an incongruous pair because of their difference in dress but nobody paid them any mind both the field hands and the white folks were used to seeing them together in a low casual voice cassius said kip you got to keep marse jacob way from them trees he pointed to the little wood into which jacob colleton had been shooting how kin i do dat scipio demanded in a flash he went from congaree dialect to the english he used around miss anne and other whites im sorry sir but the huntsmaninchief requires you to take your sport elsewhere he fell back into dialect aint gwine happen cass cassius guffawed and slapped his thigh do jesus that funny he grew se rious again in a hurry though don care how you do it but you do it hear scipio stared at him in something approaching agony ah caint cass he say go dere we gots to go dere i tell he no i dance me all round why fo no he jus git mo and mo spicious you hear what i say i dont got to hear you kip you got to hear me cassius said not loudly but not in a way scipio thought he could ignore either don wan no white folks traipsin through they woods don wan no white folks nowheres near they woods you hear better shoot me now scipio said hed never tried standing up to cas sius till this moment hed never had any chance before the hunter had effortlessly dominated him but now hed asked the impossible if he was too stupid to recognize that too bad too bad for everyone too bad for everything he stared at scipio now defiance was the last thing hed expected you got to kip he said at last ain no two ways bout it you got to but he wasnt ordering now he sounded more like a man who was pleading how come i got to scipio demanded cassius didnt want to tell him he could see that with no room for doubt after a long long pause the hunter said on account of i got a whole raf o guns whole raf o bullets back in there white folks finds that aint gwine do nothin but hang all the niggers on this here plantation reckoned it were sumpin like dat scipio said nodding wherever cas sius had been when he was away it wasnt in bed with a nineteenyearold wench named drusilla where had he got the weapons how had he got them back here scipio didnt know or want to know he pointed toward the woods in question you worry too much you know dat marse jacob he caint git out o that chair not hardly he shoot hisself a possum i gits it an brings it back he aint goin in they woods an you wants me to ruin everything on account of you gits de vapors do jesus he clapped a hand to his forehead cassius soberly studied him all right kip we does it yo way he said and scipio breathed again you better be right you is wrong you is dead you is wrong we all dead he walked off shaking his head perhaps wondering if hed done the right thing scipio stood where he was till he stopped trembling hed got away with it not only had he been right hed made cassius recognize that he was right as triumphs went it was probably a small thing but he felt as if hed just won the war of secession all by himself pa julia mcgregor asked with the intent seriousness of which only elevenyearold girls seem capable are you going to send me back to school when it opens again after harvest time arthur mcgregor looked up from the newspaper he was reading he rested while he could harvest would be coming soon the paper was shipped up from the usa and full of lies since the demise of the rosenfeld register which had been only half full of lies no local paper had been permitted but even lies could be interesting if they were new lies why else did people read so many books and magazines id thought i would he answered slowly the more you learn the better off youll be he brought that last out like an article of faith even if he couldnt see how he was all that much better off for his own schooling he studied his elder daughter why dont you want me to no she said and shook her head so vigorously that auburn curls flipped into her face i dont want to go either mary exclaimed hush he told her im talking to your big sister mary did hold her tongue but looked mutinous she had an imp in her that wouldnt placidly let her do as she was told her backside got warmed more often than julias or alexanders ever had but the imp also drove her to acts of real even foolhardy courage as when shed charged at the american officer whod wanted to take mcgregor hostage in rosenfeld her father turned back toward julia you used to like school why dont you want to go any more you remember how i went last spring when the yankees let the schools open up again julia asked arthur mcgregor nodded his daughter went on the books they made the teachers use they were american books she couldnt have spoken with greater contempt had she called them satans books numbers are numbers and you do have to learn to cipher he said reluctantly julia nodded back at him he added words are words too no they arent his daughter said americans spell funny mcgregor spelled funny himself his spelling had probably got funnier in the years since hed escaped the classroom julia though had always been clever in school that must have come from maudes side of the family he knew it hadnt come from his he said they dont spell all their words different not even most he thought that was true he hoped it was at any rate julia didnt argue it what she did say was its not that stuff so much pa its the history lessons i dont ever want to go to another one of those again she looked and sounded on the edge of tears mcgregor glanced down at the newspaper which had come from a little town in the state of dakota he remembered what hed thought about it mo ments before they telling you lies in the schoolroom sweetheart he asked julias nod was as emphatic as her headshake had been they sure were pa she answered all kinds of lies about how america was right to have the revolution and the king of england was a wicked tyrant and the loyalists were traitors and they should have conquered us in and canada was worse off for staying with england and how england and france and the csa kept stabbing the united states in the back none of its true not even a little bit not even a little bit mary echoed happily hush arthur mcgregor told her he picked his words with care as he spoke to julia its what they have to teach to keep the schools open at all same as the register had to print what the americans told it to a lot of the time i understand that julias voice was impatient hed underestimated her and disappointed her because of it she went on i know theyre teaching us a pack of rubbish i know what really happened just like they taught me before when they were telling the truth that isnt what bothers me or not so much anyway but i dont think i can stand going back to school and listening to the teacher talk about all the lying things the americans make him say and read ing the books that say the same stupid things and watching the other pupils at the schoolhouse listen to all the same lies and believe them do they mcgregor wished he had enough tobacco to let himself light a pipe right now it would have helped him think he looked at the dakota newspaper again people all over americanoccupied manitoba were getting papers on the same order as this one he didnt take seriously the propaganda with which it was laced and had assumed nobody else did either but how true was that assumption all at once he wondered they really do pa julia said seriously making him wonder all the more its like they never paid attention before so when the teacher tells them american lies and the books say the same thing they dont know any better they just give it back like they were so many parrots awrk mary squawked polly want a cracker polly want to go to bed right now mcgregor asked and his youngest got very quiet he sat there thinking his chin in his hand he was a hardnosed rockchinned scotsman he knew what was so and what wasnt so did his wife theyd brought up their children to do the same and evidently succeeded but what about the people who werent the same and who didnt do the same for their children he hadnt thought much about them now listening to julia he realized that was a mistake what about the lightminded souls who believed the germans were about to take petrograd and paris and the americans richmond and toronto for no better reason than that the news papers said as much what about their children who believed when they got told the confederacy had had no right to secede from the united states or that custers massacre of general gordons brave column had been a heroic victory not a lucky ambush what about all the people like that mcgregor got an answer far more quickly and with far more confidence in his accuracy than if hed had to do arithmetic on paper if you rilled the heads of people like that with nonsense like that and did it for a few years or maybe for a generation at most what would you have youd have people who werent emptyheaded canadians any more youd have people who were emptyheaded americans instead maybe we wont send you back to that school after all he said slowly julia beamed at him looking as much surprised as delighted and mary let out such a whoop of delight that her mother came out of the kitchen to see what had happened when arthur mcgregor explained what he said and why maude nodded yes i think youre right she said if theyre going to try to make us over we cant very well let them can we i aim to do everything i can to stop them anyhow he answered we have primers of one sort or another here around the house anyway you and i can give the girls some lessons anyhow that way when this country is back in canadian hands the way its supposed to be they wont have lost too much time with their schooling oh thank you papa julia breathed thank you so much mary was looking less pleased with the solution you mean well have to go to school here she said thats no good i expect your mother and i can probably do a better job of riding herd on you than any schoolteacher ever born mcgregor said by the expression on marys face she expected the same thing and the expectation filled her with something other than delight she turned on her big sister now look what youve gone and done she said shrilly its not my fault julia said before mary could demand whose fault it was if not hers as mary was plainly about to do she answered the not yet spoken question on her own its the americans fault that for a wonder satisfied her little sister mary believed the americans capable of any enormity arthur mcgregor was inclined to agree with her later that night after the children were asleep and he and maude lying down in their bed his wife said to him i wouldnt mind so much sending the children to the school no matter what it taught about history and such if her voice trailed away mcgregor understood what she meant he didnt want to say it either but say it he did if you thought theyd only have to listen to american lies for another year or two at the most beside him maude nodded the night was warm but she shivered im afraid were going to lose the war and im afraid we wont have a country we can call our own any more im afraid were going to lose the war neither of them had come out and said that before now i think well beat them in the end mcgregor an swered trying to keep up his spirits as well as hers they havent licked us yet and the mother country is helping all she can everything will turn out right you wait and see i hope so she said but then she sighed and fell asleep arthur mcgregor hoped so too but hed long since discovered the difference between what he hoped and what came true now that maude had named the fear he could feel it nibbling at his soul too im afraid were going to lose the war no mat ter how tired he was sleep took a long time catching up with him sam carsten peered out of the barracks at pearl harbor toward the drydock where the damaged dakota was being repaired other buildings hid the drydock from sight but he knew exactly where it was he thought he could have been dropped anywhere in or near honolulu and pointed accurately toward it just as a compass reliably pointed north his affinity for the ship was hardly less than the instruments for the north magnetic pole knowing the dakota was wounded ate at him so much so that he burst out im afraid were going to lose the goddamn war hiram kidde understood him perfectly fleets not gonna go to the devil on account of were one battleship light the gunners mate said reassuringly he got a sly look in his eye sides sam i know whats really eating you whats that carsten said now that were stuck here on the beach we have to make like soldiers instead of sailors kidde answered thats not all bad carsten pointed to the row on row of iron cots nice to be able to get some sack time without crosetti farting in my face from the top bunk chows better too same as it always is when were in port instead of steaming but yeah i havent been out of a ship for such a long stretch since i joined up i dont much like it me neither kidde said on both counts and i been in the navy damn near as long as youve been alive other thing is when youre on a ship you arent just spinning your wheels you keep things clean you keep things neat on account of it makes the ship work better doing it on dry land why bother orders carsten said making it a dirty word somebody says you got to do it you got to do it never mind whether it makes sense im damn glad you understand how that is sam damn glad kidde said in a tone of voice that made carsten realize hed been betrayed worse that hed just gone and betrayed himself smiling at how nicely the trap had worked kidde went on got a lot of walks out there that need policing get yourself a broom and get to it have a heart capn sam said piteously you send me out in the sun for a couple hours here and they can stick an apple in my mouth and serve me up at the officers mess tonight ill be cooked meat he ran a hand along his arm showing off his fair fair skin grab a broom kidde said all at once sounding much more like a chief petty officer than a buddy i hope you screw maggie stevenson carsten said and then while kidde was still blinking any male human being who didnt want to screw maggie stevenson had to have a screw loose himself he added right after the guy with the chancre there were people who when they said things like that started fights when carsten said things like that he got laughs youre a funny guy funny like a crutch kidde said but if he was trying not to chuckle it was a losing effort go on funny guy get moving sam smeared his arms and his nose and the back of his neck with zinc ox ide ointment he was unhappily aware that the stuff didnt do much good but it was or at least it might have been better than nothing he supposed that made up for the medicinal stink of the goop resigning himself to baking he went out broom and dustpan in hand the dustpan wasnt standard military issue some ingenious soul had mounted it on the end of a broomstick too so sam didnt have to bend down every time he swept something into it he approved of that he approved of any thing that made work easier especially when it was work he had to do the walks were pretty clean even ashore sailors were most of them neat people carrying over the habits theyd picked up at sea whenever he came across a cigar butt or a crumpledup empty pack of cigarettes or a scrap of pa per he swept it into the dustpan with a muttered god damn the marines he muttered his curses for two reasons first he didnt know whether marines were actually responsible for the trash though he would have bet on it they werent trained to neatness the way ordinary navy men were the other reason was that even if hed been right some marines walking by might have heard him and theyd have beaten the stuffing out of him just as enthusi astically as if hed been wrong marines strolled through pearl harbor as if they owned the world marines acted that way even aboard ship it drove navy men crazy but you had to be worse than crazy to want to mess with one of the hardfaced men in forest green even if you were a tough guy and you beat him all of his buddies would come after you then and they hung together a lot tighter than sailors did marines put sam in mind of mean hunting dogs you took them to where the game was you pointed them at it and you stood back and let them kill it if you got in the way theyd chew you up too and so when after an hour or so of sams being out in the sun a marine walking past turned to his friend and said you smell something scorched carsten kept on pushing his broom both marines themselves bronzed and fitlooking laughed he sighed he couldnt do anything about the kind of skin he had except wish he were back in san francisco or maybe up in seat tle seattle was a good town if you were fair the sun hardly ever came out and when it did it was a lot paler than the lusty fire in the sky above pearl harbor thinking of things in the sky above pearl harbor sam scanned it for aeroplanes he didnt see any either american or belonging to the enemies of the usa he wished he hadnt seen the last aeroplane that one from japan if it hadnt come buzzing around the dakota wouldnt have been in drydock with a large hole blown in her flank a couple of navy men came by they werent off the dakota carsten hadnt seen them before he picked up snatches of their conversationplace names mostly kodiak prince rupert victoria seattle since hed just been thinking wistfully of a cooler clime he called after them what about seattle the two men stopped nothing good one of them answered the goddamn japs have reinforced the limey fleet off british columbia youre rightthat isnt good sam agreed the places theyd mentioned made sense to him now they sailed up by way of russian alaska and then down along the west coast of canada did they thats what they did all right the bastards the other sailor agreed unhappily on account of it the north pacific squadron cant hardly stick its nose out of puget sound you dont have to tell me about the japs carsten said i was on the dakota after they suckered us out of pearl the two strangers nodded sympathetically for once at a predicament other than his sunburn he went on you ask me everybody in the whole damn pacific had better watch out on account of the japs theyre making like theyre buddybuddy with england but if the limeys ever turn their backs on em theyll get cornholed fastern youd believe us too i already seen that happen we werent out here yet when the japs suckered you guys one of the strangers said he stuck out his hand homer bradley off the jarvis he was sandyhaired but to carstens annoyance suntanned dino dascoli same ship his companion added the honolulu sun wouldnt faze him he was as swarthy as vic crosetti carsten shook hands with both of them and introduced himself then he explained how the americans dash after the fleet that had launched the aero plane had gone wrong finishing as soon as we got torpedoed it was easy to figure out what the hell we hadnt thought about next time i hope we dont stick our dicks in the meat grinder that particular way thats the truth bradley agreed he studied carstens uniform you talk like a seaman first sam but you sort of sound like you think like an officer you know what i mean too damn much time on my hands thats what it is just like everybody else on the dakota who isnt fixing her up sam said nothin to do but stuff like this or else sit around and play cards and shoot the breeze and think about things he grinned catch me at my battle station and im as stupid as anybody could want his new acquaintances grinned you got a good way of lookin at things sam dino dascoli said he lowered his voice and since you got a good way of lookin at things maybe you got a good way of lookin for things too a guy wants to have a good time around here wheres the best place at a good good time sam asked dascoli nodded you dont mind spending some money dascoli nodded again sam smiled till his sunburned face hurt all right what you do then is you hop on the trolley into honolulu and you get off at the kapalama stop theres this gal named maggie stevenson dascoli and bradley leaned closer down below jonathan moss the town of guelph ontario was dying a slow horrible death incessant artillery fell on the canadians and englishmen still holding out in the provincial town built of gray stone the guns had been hammering at the church of our lady cathedral for days the canucks werent shy about putting artillery observers up in the spires and so the spires had to come down come down they had only smoke rose above the cathedral now it rose high enough to make moss cough and choke some thousands of feet above the ruined house of god in a way he wished the order loosing the onedeckers to fly above enemyheld territory had not come it would have spared him the sight of towns given over to pounding from the big guns hed seen plenty of that while pi loting observation aeroplanes and would not have minded missing it in his flying scout in another way though it mattered little although he might not have seen them as they were being wrecked hed flown over plenty of towns after the united states took them away from canada and they made a pretty ap palling spectacle then too and thrusting ahead like this he felt he was doing more to help the american soldiers on the ground push forward against the unceasing and often insanely stubborn opposition of the canadian and british troops strug gling to hold them back more than a year he said through the buzz of the engine more than a year and we still arent in toronto he shook his goggled head back in au gust no one would have believed that the americans werent in mon treal as long as canada still hung on to the land between the one big city and the other she was still a going concern moss knew better than to let such gloomy reflections keep him from do ing what he needed to do to stay alive he kept an eye on his position in the flight of four martins without consciously thinking about it he checked above below and to both sides his head was never still he used the rearview mirror the mechanics had installed on his aeroplane but did not rely on it alone every minute or so hed half turn and look back over his shoulder he hoped that was all wasted precaution but his hope didnt keep him from being careful the canucks hadnt been sending many aeroplanes up lately to oppose the us machines but the british were shipping over more and more aeroplanes and pilots to make up for the shrinking pool of canadian men and aircraft he and his comrades had found out about that the hard way if the prospect of running into more british airmen bothered dud dudley he didnt let on the flight leader waggled his wings to make sure his comrades were paying attention to him then dove down toward the ground moss spot ted the target he had in mind a column of men in butternutno he reminded himself up here they called that color khaki limey fashionmoving up toward the front the first time hed machinegunned men on the ground hed felt queasy and uncertain about it for days afterwards hed heard robbers were the same way the first job they pulled was often almost impossibly hard after that things got easier till they didnt really think about what they were doing except the way any laborer might on the way to work he didnt know about robbers not for sure he did know that the only things going through his mind as he swooped on the marching soldiers like a hawk on a chipmunk were considerations of speed and altitude and angle all the little practical matters that would help him do the foe as much damage as he could he swore when the men on the ground spotted him and his flightmates a few seconds faster than hed hoped they would the infantrymen began to scatter and had good cover in which to shelter for the road along which they were marching ran through what had been a builtup area that american artillery had rather drastically built down little flashes from the ground said the soldiers down there were shooting at him he didnt think much of it after antiaircraft fire from cannon dedicated to the job what were a few rifle bullets then one of them cracked past his head almost close enough to be the crack of doom jesus he shouted and stabbed his thumb down on the firing button of his machine gun bullets streamed out between the spinning blades of his pro peller he wished dudley had never told him what happened when an interrupter gear got out of adjustment if he shot himself down now flying so low and fast hed surely crash and even if by some miracle he did manage to glide to a landing no insurance salesman would give him a dimes worth over coverage if he landed anywhere near the men hed been shooting up in their shoes he would have settled his own hash too there was a knot of them running for the shelter of rubble that might once have been a row of shops as long as he didnt shoot himself down he held the whip hand he fired another long burst and saw some of the men in khaki fall before he zoomed by those are people he thought with a small part of his mind as he gained altitude for another firing run he had no trouble ignoring that small part those fleeing shapes in uniforms of the wrong color they were just targets and if they werent targets they were the enemy hed just been thinking about what theyd do if they caught him they hadnt caught him hed caught them instead he turned and shot them up again they put a lot of lead in the air trying to shoot down his aeroplane and those of his flightmates after the second pass dud dudley waved for the flight to pull up and head back toward the american lines moss had no trouble obeying the flight leader neither did tom innis but smoke was pouring out of luther carlsens engine the careful pilot hadnt been careful enough after the smoke came fire it caught on the fabric of the onedeckers fuse lage and licked backwards with hideous speed the doping that made the fabric resist the wind was highly inflammable and the slipstream pushed the flames along ahead of it carlsen did everything he could he beat at the flames with the hand he didnt keep on the controls he brought the aeroplanes nose up into a stall to reduce the force of the wind but when he recovered from the stall and he did that as precisely and capably as he did everything elsethe fire engulfed the aeroplane he crashed into what might once have been a pleasant block of houses in guelph numbly moss innis and dudley flew back to their aerodrome which with the forward movement of the front had advanced to near the city of woodstock woodstock before the war had been famous for its treelined avenues when the front passed through it the famous trees were reduced to kindling in which sad state they remained woodstock had also been promi nent for its munitions plants nothing was left of them but enormous craters the retreating canadians had exploded them to deny them to the usa the three survivors landed without any trouble ground crew men asked what had happened to carlsen the pilots explained in a couple of short sentences the mechanics didnt push them those things had happened before they would happen again all too often captain shelby pruitt took their report nothing to be done he said when they were through go where there are bullets and theyre liable to hit you he shook his head its too damn bad he knew what he was doing up there pointing to a big tent not far from the one in which he made his office he added go on over to the officers club im not going to send you up tomorrow that was the polite way of saying go get drunk and then sleep it off the pilots gratefully took him up on it staring down into a glass of whiskey tom innis said i always figured i would be the one to go luther did everything right all the time now hes dead god damn it to hell anyway he knocked back the drink and signaled for another dont talk about whos going to go moss said earnestly if a little blur rilythe tip of his nose was getting numb and so was his tongue bad luck bad luck innis repeated he gulped down the new drink too how many pilots who started the war will still be alive at the end of it do you think moss didnt answer that he didnt want to think about it not at all to keep from thinking about it he got as drunk as he could as fast as he could he and innis and dud dudley were all staggering when they made their way back to their tent by the time they got there somebody had cleaned out luther carlsens personal effects to send back to his next of kin seeing the bare neat empty cot made moss shiver hed taken over a cot like that who one of these days would take over the one over which he now sprawled at an angle no sober man would have chosen he was lucky he fell asleepor passed outbefore he could dwell on that one for long when he woke up the next morning the whiskey had taken its revenge and he hurt too bad to dwell on anything but that afternoon after gallons of coffee and the hair of the dog that bit him he felt almost human in an elderly melancholy way he was writing a letter to a cousin in cleveland when the tent flap opened captain pruitt led in a gawky young man with a greengray duffel slung over his shoulder gentle men he said this is zach whitby lieutenant whitby we have here dan dudley tom innis and jonathan moss whitby threw the duffel down on the cot that had been luther carlsens he stuck out his hand pleased to meet you all you all moss ran the words together look out boys weve got a reb flying with us if you laughed you didnt have to think about it not so much anyhow why major why did you pick my farm lucien galtier demanded as he knew perfectly well what the answer to that question was he was not so much seeking information as plumbing the depths of major jedediah quigleys hypocrisy i have several excellent reasons monsieur galtier quigley answered as he spoke he ticked them off on his fingers which with his elegant parisian accent and his incisive logic made him seem more a lawyer than a soldier to galtier an invidious comparison if ever there was one first monsieur your farm is sufficiently far back from the banks of the st lawrence as to be be yond artillery range even from the gunboats that try to harass our operations on the river and our crossings this is an important matter in the placement of a hospital as i am sure you must agree without waiting to learn whether galtier agreed or not he went on second the road is already paved to within a couple of miles of your farm extending it this much farther is a work of no great trouble i would not put you to any trouble whatever galtier said knowing he was righting a losing battle as i say it is a small matter quigley replied it will even work to your advantage an allweather road passing by your farm will enable you to sell your produce ever so much more readily than you do now i shall have ever so much less produce to sell however as you are taking so much of my patrimony for the purpose of building this hospital lucien told him and you appear to be taking the best land i have that given over to wheat only the most convenient major quigley assured him and you will be compensated for the use compensated as i was for my produce last winter galtier shot back quigley shrugged a fine french gesture to go with his fine french tongue yes his hypocrisy was deep indeed he never once mentioned luciens refusal to give names to father pascal or to collaborate with the americans in any other way but the farmer was as sure as he was of his own name that had he cho sen to collaborate the hospital would have gone up on someone elses land quigley said do not think of this hospital as a permanent structure monsieur galtier it will serve its purpose for the time being and then pass away and be forgotten as we establish and enlarge our foothold north of the st lawrence no doubt it will become practical for us to build hospitals in se cure areas there no doubt lucien agreed tonelessly thinking he ought to learn all he could about the american incursion on the far side of the river he asked and how is the war faring for you there major quigley spread his hands though not a real frenchman he played the role well enough to take it on the stage not so well as we would like not so poorly that the enemy will be able to throw us back into the river by the enemy of course he meant the forces of galtiers rightful government and those of great britain which was proving a loyal ally to france lu cien did not reply what could he say he was just an ordinary farmer he supposed he should have been grateful that the americans revenge was no worse than this from what he had heard people who crossed the us mili tary government sometimes disappeared off the face of the earth he had a wife and half a dozen children who needed him he could not afford to let his tongue run as free as he might have liked when he didnt say anything jedediah quigley shrugged again there you are monsieur galtier we should start construction in the next few days if you have any objections to the plan as currently constituted you can offer them to the occupation authorities in riviereduloup thank you so much major quigley galtier said so smoothly that the american did not notice he was being sardonic oh yes you could make a trip up to riviereduloup for the privilege of complaining to the authorities about what they were doing to you but since theyd already decided to do it how much was that likely to accomplish the short answer was not much the longer answer was that it might do harm because daring to complain would get his name underlined on the list the occupation authorities surely kept of those they did not trust now that i have given you the news monsieur i must return to town quigley said he climbed onto an utterly prosaic bicycle and pedaled away off to the north across the river artillery rumbled galtier wondered whether it belonged to the american invaders or to those who tried to defend quebec against them the defenders he hoped he glanced up to the sky the weather was still fine and mild how much longer it would remain fine and mild with september heading toward october remained to be seen long enough for him to finish getting in the harvest that long certainly if god was merciful even to the least degree but the day after the harvest was done let the snow come then he said half prayer half threat the americans would not have an easy time keeping an army on the far side of the wide river supplied if the winter was harsh the defenders would not have an easy time either but they would not be cut off from their heartland as the invaders would how well did americans used to warm weather deal with weather that was anything but before long the world would find out marie came out of the farmhouse and looked down the road toward riviereduloup major quigley a rapidly disappearing speck was still visi ble lucien wished quigley would disappear for good his wife asked what did the boche americain want of you he was generous enough to inform melucien rolled his eyesthe americans are taking some of our land for the purpose of building a hospital on it it is a safe place to do so major quigley says marie stamped her foot if he wants to build it in a safe place why does he not put it in father pascals church no one would bring war to holy ground is it not so that is an excellent thought galtier said even the pious father could not disagree with it good and christian man that he is he shook his head the war was making him more cynical than hed ever dreamt of being before it began but no marie went on it must be on our good cropland well i have a hope for this hospital of theirs i have the same hope i think lucien said his wife looked a question his way i hope it is very full of americans he told her she nodded satis fied theyd been married a long time and thought a lot alike stephen ramsay used a makeshift periscope to look up over the parapet at the yankee lines between nuyaka and beggs if hed stuck his head up to have a look around some damnyankee sniper would have blown off the top of it the creek regiment in which ramsay was a captain had pushed us troops a few miles back from nuyaka but then the lines had set like concrete he turned the periscope this way and that what he saw remained pretty much the same regardless of the angle barbed wire some shiny and new some rusting firing pits for yankee scouts and then another trench line just like his lowering the periscope a couple of little hand mirrors mounted at the proper angles on a boardhe turned to moty tiger and said far as i can see those damnyankee sons of bitches are here to stay thats not good sir the creek sergeant answered seriously this is our land creek land if we can we have to throw them off here you confeder ates have the right to be here you are our friends you are our allies but we have been enemies of the united states for many generations the yankees do not belong here im not going to argue with you sergeant ramsay said all im going to do is give you this here periscope and let you take a look for yourself if that looks like a position we can rush you tell me straight out go on take a look moty tiger looked he looked carefully or as carefully as he could given the limitations of the instrument as ramsay had before him he lowered it his coppery face was glum doesnt look easy captain he admitted i didnt think so either ramsay said with more than a little relief hed been afraid moty tiger would think like a creek before he thought like a soldier and would feel dutybound to try to recover every scrap of creek terri tory regardless of the cost he outranked his sergeant of course but moty tiger was a creek and he wasnt in a contest for the hearts and minds of the soldiers in the creek nation army that counted more than rank did for that matter moty tiger didnt just influence the opinions of his fellow indians he also reflected those opinions there the matter rested till late that afternoon when colonel lincoln came up to the frontline trench when ramsay saw the regimental cos face his heart sank lincoln looked thoroughly grim he didnt say anything ramsay got the idea that wasnt because he didnt know anything more likely because he knew too much and didnt like any of it when lincoln stayed quiet for more than five minutes ramsay who favored the direct approach asked him whats gone wrong now sir colonel lincoln gestured for ramsay to walk with him once they got out of earshot of the men lincoln said ill tell you whats gone wrong charlie fixicos up and decided hes a goddamn general thats what lihoh ramsay said without any great eloquence but most sincerely what sort of stupid impossible thing does he have in mind for us to do he still thought like a sergeant not an officer what were generals for but ordering troops to try to do stupid impossible things lincoln was a longtime officer but he looked to feel the same way point ing northeast he answered he wants us to break through that yankee line and retake beggs jesus ramsay said hed talked moty tiger out of that talking the chief of the creek nation out of it wasnt going to be easy why does he want to do that isnt he grateful we saved okmulgee for him not any more hes not that was a while ago and politicians arent what youd call good at remembering lincoln answered why two reasons far as i can make out first one is he wants to get back the oil fields around beggs second one is its creek territory its got damnyankees on it and he wants em gone thats about what it boils down to jesus ramsay said again doesnt he know that if we try to take those yankee positions were gonna get ourselves slaughtered nothing else but if he doesnt its not because i didnt tell him till i was blue in the face lincoln answered he ordered the attack to go in anyhow i hope you got the confederate corps commander to overrule him sir ramsay said itd be suicide like i said i went to corps headquarters yes lincoln said they told me that if chief fixico wants an attack chief fixico gets an attack two reasons again one is his own men usare in it so hes not asking the csa to do all his work for him two is near as i can tell they dont want to make the indians angry so they go along with any requests they get bombardment begins tomorrow morning at supposed to chew up the barbed wire between us and them and make reaching their trenches easier we go over the top at yes sir ramsay said he couldnt think of anything else to say he knew what was liable to happen shortly after he wasnt afraid or not very much afraid at any rate what he felt was more like numbness as if hed been told out of the blue hed need a surgical operation he went up and down the trench line letting the men know what theyd be doing at dawn tomorrow some of the creeks especially the younger ones and the replacements who hadnt seen much action looked excited a couple of them let out happy yowls war cries moty tiger just glanced up at ramsay and nodded what was going on behind those black eyes that impassive face ramsay couldnt tell he made sure his rifle was clean and that he had plenty of ammunition then wrapped himself in his blanket and tried to sleep he didnt think he would but he did the beginning of the barrage at woke him he got up and made sure the men would be ready to move forward when the shelling stopped with luck he said the damnyankeesll be too battered to do any shooting back till were in amongst em good luck boys at on the dot the bombardment ended colonel lincoln blew a whistle lets go he shouted out of the trenches swarmed the creek nation army along with confed erate troops proper to either side of them they went forward as fast as they could knowing their best hope for safety was getting to the enemy front line before us troopers could recover from the barrage theyd taken and reach the firing steps and the machine guns they surely had all along the line the shelling had knocked aside or wrecked some of the barbed wire but not all or even most first one creek then another then another got hung up in it dont try and cut em loose ramsay called keep moving thats the best thing we can do it wasnt easy the stuff grabbed and clung and bit so you felt as if you were moving underwater with sharks nipping you or through a nightmare trying without much luck to run from a monster you dared not turn around and see but the monster was in front here and there along the yankee line muzzle flashes showed men who despite the artillery barrage knew they had to kill the attackers now or die themselves in moments then a couple of machine guns one right in front of ramsay came to hammering life men of the creek nation army fell before that hateful patter like wheat before a reaper there went moty tiger clutching at his belly there went colonel lincoln down with boneless finality my regiment now ramsay thought he waved the survivors forward come on he shouted we can still one moment he was advancing the next without warning he found himself lying in a shell hole staring in confusion at dirt and a couple of bits of rusty barbed wire he had trouble breathing he couldnt figure out why till he tasted blood in his mouth how did that happen he wondered vaguely he looked up at the sky it was going black thats not right he thought its morning not xx s ylvia enos collected the mail from the box in the front hall of her apartment building she crumpled up a patentmedicine circular the allotment check from the navy she kept her lips twisted in a bitter smile she had the money drawn from georges pay as hed said she would before he enlisted the only trouble was she didnt care about the money she would sooner have had her husband back when hed stayed in boston after joining the navy when hed in essence gone back to being a fisherman shed been overjoyed her life had returned to one not far different from what shed known before the war started even if she had kept her job at the canning plant considering all the dislocations that had come since shed counted herself lucky so much for luck she said as she started upstairs now george was gone and gone farther and more irrevocably than when hed languished in confederate imprisonment all she had by which to remember him were the monthly allotment checks and an occasional letter there could have been more letters she supposed but george had never been much of a writer the hallway and the stairwell were not so warm as they had been a few weeks before boston s summer hot while it lasted couldnt be counted on to last far into september for the moment cutting the heat only made days and nights more pleasant pretty soon though she wouldnt be wrangling with the coal board over fuel enough to cook her food shed be wrangling with its inflexible clerks and stubborn supervisors over fuel enough to keep her from freezing during the winter she left the stairwell and trudged wearily down the hall to mrs conevals apartment she stood there in front of the doorway for a moment before she knocked it sounded as if the children were fighting a battle of their own inside a battle about the size of some of the big ones on the kentucky front she wondered how brigid coneval put up with the noise when she did knock she needed to hammer on the door to get anyone within to notice she was there after a while brigid coneval opened the door the racket without wood between it and sylvia grew from alarming to ap palling a bit rowdy they are today mrs coneval said with a smile that could only be described as wan so it would seem sylvia agreed she knew she would have gone crazy cooped up in there the day around with a horde of screaming children given the choice between that and the factory job she had she would have chosen factory work a hundred times out of a hundred her own two children were plenty to try to keep under control ill get your wee ones brigid coneval said and disappeared back into chaos a toddler smaller than mary jane started to howl sylvia thanked heaven she hadnt got pregnant again after george came back from the csa trying to take care of a new baby by herself along with two small children was nothing to anticipate with glee mrs coneval came back holding mary jane by one hand and george jr by the other george jr twisted in her grasp and fired an imaginary rifle at one of the other children i got you joey you dirty reb no you didnt you missed me joey shouted backthe next small boy who admitted himself slain in imaginary conflict would be the first and im not the rebyou are liar liar pants on fire george jr yelled at him which made mary jane giggle george jr said hello mama joey cheats i dont either joey exclaimed it doesnt matter now one way or the other sylvia said by the look on his face her son was prepared to disagree with that as eloquently as he could she didnt give him the chance see you tomorrow morning she said to mrs coneval and took her children back to their apartment it seemed empty without her husband there she was used to having him gone for days at a time shed even had to grow used to having him gone for much longer than that while he was a confederate detainee now though with him in st louis she had the strong sense she wouldnt see him again till the war ended and it didnt look as if it was going to end any time soon she had some good scrod in the icebox she hadnt lost the connections shed made down on t wharf as a fishermans wife even if her husband wasnt actually fishing right now she could find better fish than the ordinary shopper and pay less for it she breaded the scrod panfried it in lard on top of the stove and served it up with mashed potatoes george jr ate everything up and demanded more he ate almost as much as a man or so it seemed she was probably wrong about that she admitted to herself as she gave him more potatoes but she wasnt wrong about his outgrowing all his clothes she patted her purse the allotment check would come in handy the next time she went shopping at filenes mary jane by contrast had to be cajoled into eating much of anything sylvia produced a gumdrop from a bowl on a shelf too high for the children to reach she set it on the table do you want it she asked her daughter eyes wide with longing mary jane nodded having once made the dread ful error of saying no to candy she wasnt about to repeat it all right sylvia said eat up your supper and you can have it sometimes that got results sometimes a tantrum today it worked mary jane cleaned her plate and stretched out a hand that needed washing good girl sylvia told her handing her the sweet after shed scrubbed the dishes she settled the children down on the couch one on either side of her and read to them from queen zixi of ix mary janes attention sometimes wandered when she got off the couch went over to get a doll and then came back to play with it sylvia didnt mind the story held george jr rapt for most of an hour by then it was time for sylvia to get the children into bed morning came all too early then she had the apartment to herself before she also had to go to bed when george was home theyd sit and talk while he smoked a pipe or cigar when he was out fishing shed look forward to his return now now he was gone and the place seemed large and empty and quiet as the tomb she walked around for a while with a feather duster flicking specks from tables and gewgaws what with the dirt and soot always in the air things got dusty faster than they had any proper business doing that would worsen in winter when everyone burned more coal always assuming the coal board didnt decide to let people turn to blocks of ice instead she realized she was dusting a china dog for the third time shaking her head she put the feather duster away time hung heavy when she was alone but not that heavy she went into the bedroom changed into a nainsook cotton nightgown with lace at the neck and sleeves and set out the drawers and skirt and shirtwaist shed wear the next morning then she went into the bathroom where she cleaned her teeth and gave her hair a hundred strokes with the brush in front of the mirror over the sink evening ritual done she went back into the bedroom turned off the gas lamp and lay down she sat up with a start lord have mercy id forget my head if it wasnt sewed on tight she exclaimed not wanting to get up and light the lamp again she fumbled in the darkness with the alarm clock on the nightstand had she forgotten to set it she would surely have been late to work which would have got her docked at best and fired at worst cant have that she said as if someone lying beside her was trying to talk her into sleeping as long as she wanted but no one was lying beside her the bed felt large and empty some nights she was so tired she hardly noticed george was gone and would be gone god only knew how long others she missed him to the point where tears ran down her face they did no good she knew that knowing didnt help she lay on her back staring at the ceiling and trying without much luck to go to sleep she closed her eyes which didnt seem to make the room much darker but with her eyes closed as they usually were when she and george made love it was easier to imagine him on top of her imagine his familiar weight pressing her down on the mattress imagine his breath warming the hollow of her shoulder in quick gasps imagination now was all she had she shifted restlessly on the bed if george were there now shed be able to sleep pretty soon she shifted again the hem of her nightgown rode up past her knees she reached down instead of straightening it she hiked it up to her waist a few minutes later she rolled over onto her side she would sleep now she knew it she bit her lip not caring to remember what shed just done but when your man was away for months maybe for years what were you sup posed to do it wasnt as good as the real thing with george actually that wasnt quite true it felt as good or maybe even better but it was lonely at the end but it was better than nothing better than nothing she muttered drowsily with the war on wasnt that as much as anybody had any business expecting her eyelids slid down over her eyes of themselves this time she started to say something else but only a soft snore passed her lips masks and goggles captain orville wyatt ordered as the bombardment of the confederate positions east of the roanoke began chester martin quickly tied the hyposulfiteimpregnated mask over his mouth and nose he breathed in chemical dampness that was unpleasant but much less so than breathing in the poison gas that shells were spreading up and down the rebel lines he took off his newly issued helmet to strap the goggles over his eyes he didnt know whether to curse the weight of the thing or bless it for making his brains less likely to be splattered over the landscape beside martin specs peterson swore theyve been usin this damn gas more since they started loading it into shells than they did when they shot it out of those projector things and i fucking hate it he said i can leave my glasses on and have the chlorine eat my eyes up or i can take em off and fall on my damn face half a dozen times before i get to where the rebs are at hell of a deal aint it im in the same boat peterson captain wyatt said touching the earpiece to his own spectacles ive been leaving my glasses on my eyes get better after a couple of days seems like yeah but you want to be a hero peterson muttered under his breath me i just want to get out of this in one piece amen chester martin said all i want to do is live through this damn war and go home and make steel i used to complain about that job like no bodys business it was hot and it was dirty and it was hard and it was dangerous and its still every damn one of those things and you know what else next to what were doin now its so fine ill never grouse again nothin worse than farm work i always used to say that corporal paul andersen put in only goes to show i didnt know what the hell i was talking about you do your two years as a conscript and thats not so bad you figure real soldiering works out the same way ha his wave took in the trenches the filth the vermin the fear the foe captain wyatt said once upon a time virginia used to belong to the usa now were working to take it back its not the kind of job anybody wants to do but it needs doing if everything goes right we keep their front trenches no matter what happens we bring some prisoners back for interro gation he went up and down the trench line checking to make sure his sol diers masks and goggles were on securely he was a long way from being the most goodnatured of men but he fussed over the soldiers in his company like a mother cat with a litter of kittens as far as martin was concerned that made him a good officer the bombardment went on and on every so often the confederates would lob a few shells back at the us lines but they were taking it a lot harder than they were dishing it out that suited martin fine hed been on the receiving end of too many barrages to suit him giving was betteran un christian thought but a true one nonetheless sharp as an axe coming down the shelling ended up and down the trench line whistles sounded martin scrambled up the steps made of sandbags over the parapet and toward the rebel lines pioneers had cut some paths through the barbed wire between the us and confederate lines marking them with strips of cloth tied to the wire martin liked that and hated it at the same time it gave him an easier way toward the enemy trenches but also gave the rebel machine gunners a notion of what the way was if theyd zeroed their weapons on it he tried not to think about that as he tried not to think of any of the disasters that might befall him here and there the bombardment had knocked down the posts that sup ported the barbed wire leaving it sprawled in snaky coils on the rubblestrewn ground of what had probably been a suburb of big lick virginia when chester martin saw relatively clear stretches of that sort he used them to move forward the rebs wouldnt have so many guns pointed there as they would at the paths he blew out through the thick wet gauze pad he wore over his mouth the first couple of gas attacks had let us forces gain and consolidate their positions east of the roanoke river now though the rebs had learned how to defend themselves against the new american weapon and pushing them back had turned into another hard job he wasnt more than halfway toward their trenches and already the rebels were shooting back at him and his men the muzzle flashes of their rifles seeming bright as the sun machine guns started up a moment later somewhere not far away he heard the wet smack of a bullet striking flesh whoever was hurt there he hoped it wasnt too bad and he hoped theyd be able to get the fellow to a doctor before he bled to death that also made him hope nobody would get hurt picking up the wounded man nobody was supposed to shoot at people wearing red cross armbands but bullets as hed learned too well werent fussy about whom they hit one of the machine guns traversed by what their crews matteroffactly called a twoinch tap sent bullets kicking up dirt not far from his feet he dove headlong into a shell hole in front of him a horrid stench rose part of it came from the pool of noisome stagnant water at the bottom of the hole more was from the body or rather fragments of body entombed under dirt and shattered bricks us forces were advancing so the dead man was presumably a confederate but he would have smelled just as bad had he been born in michigan martin wished the gauze mask he wore were as good at neutralizing stenches as it was at keeping chlorine from searing his lungs that though wasnt why it had been designed he tried to keep his unruly stomach under control if he took off the mask to puke who could guess how much poison gas hed breathe in after every retch the hail of machinegun bullets passed on beyond the shell hole crawling through muck of a sort he didnt care to contemplate martin peered out over the forward lip of the hole whatever else he did he couldnt stay there grunting under the weight of his pack he heaved himself upright again and ran on here came the trenches he could see murky spots up and down their length spots where chlorine gas still lingered the confederate defenders wore masks like his a lot of them had goggles too they were either bareheaded or in caps though no one had yet issued them helmets one of the rebs raised a rifle to shoot at martin he shot first though on the run and from the hip as much by luck as anything else the confederate howled and dropped his weapon to clutch at his chest yelling martin leaped down into the trench he used his bayonet to make sure the confederate wasnt going anywhere then pulled a grenade improvised from nails and a halfpound block of explosive out of one of his equipment pouches and flung it into the next trench back somebody screamed a moment after it exploded so he supposed hed done that right he looked around collected a couple of his soldiers by eye and headed down the trench toward the next traverse like us forces the confederates sensibly did not dig their trenches as long straight gashes in the earth had they been so foolish any foes who got into them could have delivered a deadly enfilading fire unfortunately the game was harder than that firebays like the one he and his companions were in led to other firebays advanced or recessed from them by a short stretch of perpendicular trench a traverse so that the line if viewed from an aeroplane took on the look of a postage stamp perforated with insane regularity just because your side held a firebay didnt mean the enemy wasnt still lurking in the next traverse finding out who was in the next traverse or the next firebay if you were in a traversewas not a job for the faint of heart neither was getting rid of those people if they happened to be wearing butternut while you were in greengray one way was to go up out of the trenches and crawl along the ground between them doing that though was a lot like a snails jumping out of its shell to run faster the poor creature was all too likely to get squashed charging round a corner was not recommended either the other fellow had had too much time to prepare nasty surprises for you nearing a corner of the firebay martin called give up you rebs the only answer he got back was a grenade flying through the air it was thrown too far and detonated on the level ground beyond the firebay his own men knew how to reply to it several grenades tossed with better effect rained down on the confederates grenades martin reflected were handy things they gave an infantryman a little artillery of his own and like artillery they didnt have to wound to be effective even a near miss could leave a soldier shaken and stunned martin bet his life the grenades had stunned the rebs in the traverse for a couple of vital seconds he charged round the corner of the trench one reb had been stationed there to deal with any such unwelcome newcomers but he was down and thrashing blood pouring from his belly out between his fingers followed by the men hed gathered martin ran past him and around the next bend another confederate was down there and still others on their feet hands up you rebs he screamed reggie bartlett could barely hear the screamed order to surrender one of the grenades the damnyankees had thrown had gone off only a few feet away from him he looked down at his trouser leg he was bleeding neither the pain nor the flow of blood was too bad though so he guessed whatever fragment or nail had hit him had drilled straight through muscle without getting stuck there or slamming into bone hands up the yankee sergeant yelled again reggie let his rifle fall to the mud of the trench floor and raised his hands over his head he knew he and his companions were lucky to get a chance to surrender after theyd tried to fight back a lot of times in situations like that the side winning the fight in the trenches left only the losers corpses the us soldiers swarmed over him jasper jenkins and the other privates who hadnt been hurtor not badly hurt anyway as a couple of them bore minor wounds not much different from bartletts corporal mccorkle lay on the ground moaning the us soldier shook his head poor bastard must have taken most of a grenades worth right in the gut he said he had a lot of gut to take it in the sergeant answered truthfully but unkindly he frisked reggie with thorough haste depriving him of his pocket watch his wallet and whatever loose change he had in his pockets bartlett made no move to stop him understanding it would be the last move he ever made if he did confederate troops plundered yankee prisoners just as enthusiastically when they got the chance off toward either side and back deeper in the confederate position the sound of fighting was picking up the us sergeant peered ever so cautiously over the parados at the rear of the trench treating it as if it were the parapet at the front which from his point of view it was he fired a couple of rounds at whatever he saw back there then shook his head the iron kettles he and his men wore gave them a look as if out of another time old and fierce and sullen what with helmet goggles and mask hardly any of his face was actually visible one of his men who wore ordinary glasses instead of goggles and whose eyes were red and teary said we aint gonna be able to hold these trenches sarge yeah i think youre right the sergeant answered regretfully after gauging the noise again were bringing back prisoners so the brass cant grouse too bad he turned to bartlett and the other captured confederates all right you lugs up over the top and back to the american lines dont try anything cute or youll find out how cute dead is reggie had gone over the top a good many times but never before with out a rifle in his hands he felt very naked very much exposed as he awk wardly got up into nomansland and scrambled back through the barbed wire toward the forwardmost us trenches a few of the damnyankees in those trenches shot at him and his comrades he was glad they quit when they saw the yankee soldiers coming along behind the men in butternut hed hoped hed have a chance to jump in a shell hole and have the sergeant and the rest of the yankees go on by so he could sneak back to his own lines it didnt happen one reason it didnt was that the confederates whose positions hadnt been overrun were shooting at the damnyankees who bunched up close to their prisoners to discourage that how were you sup posed to escape a man who kept stepping on your bootheels the unhappy answer was you couldnt bartlett had jumped down into us trenches too but this time the yankees had rifles and he didnt well done sergeant said one of them an officer by his demeanor thank you captain wyatt the sergeant answered long as youre back here i dont suppose im in trouble for not holding onto that stretch of rebel entrenchment no nothing to worry about there martin the officerwyattsaid sometimes we manage to advance a few yards sometimes we dont theyre more ready to face gas than they used to be he pointed to the mask on reggies face yes sir sergeant martin shed his own mask and goggles he rounded on bartlett all right reb lets have it reginald bartlett private confederate states army reggie answered and recited his pay number what unit bartlett sergeant martin asked i dont have to tell you that bartlett said the sergeant glanced over to his captain like one of martins soldiers captain wyatt wore spectacles behind them his eyes were not only reddened by chlorine but thoroughly grim im only going to tell you this once bartlett so youd better listen hard the rest of you rebs too do you know how many thousand miles this godforsaken chunk of virginia is from the hague it wasnt a geography question although from the way jasper jenkins frowned and scowled he thought it was reggie knew better what wyatt had just given him was a warning no matter what the formal laws of war said about forcing information out of prisoners he was going to ask whatever he was going to ask and he expected answers lets try again bartlett martin said proving reggie had been right what unit if he didnt talk he knew exactly what would happen to him he didnt want to die in a yankee trench without even a chance to hit back at the enemy he wished the us sergeant had picked someone else on whom to start the questioning he wouldnt have been so ashamed had he been the second or third man to open up rather than the first seventh virginia infantry he said rapidly there it was done captain wyatt turned to the rest of the confederates how about you boys the other men fairly fell over themselves agreeing reggie wondered if wyatt had called them boys to stress that they were as much his inferiors as negroes were whites inferiors in the csa if so the captain was one devious fellow bartlett covertly studied him that seemed likely whos your battalion commander wyatt demanded major colleton jasper jenkins got it out a split second ahead of reg gie as if to make up for that reggie added i dont think he was there when you all raided ushe was back at division hq was he wyatt said in an interested voice what was he doing there dont know sir bartlett answered truthfully he didnt like the expres sion on the yankee captains face it spoke of bodies forgotten in shell holes he touched his sleeve and said im just a private sir the only time officers tell me anything is when they tell me what to do a chorus of agreement rose from his fellow prisoners it could be wyatts face went from grim to thoughtful it might even be true with us and you rebs your officers are a pack of damned aristocrats arent they somehow he contrived to look languid and effete for a moment before turning to sergeant martin next time we hit them we have to catch some bigger fish than privates these boys dont know anything raids like this sir you take what you can grab martin said which matched bartletts experience in the trenches maybe from the way wyatt acted that seemed to mean he was yielding the point sure enough he jerked his head toward the opening to a communication trench all right sergeant take em back well let the chaps from intelligence see if they have any intelligence i mean yes sir martin said he picked out a couple of his own men with quick hand gestures specs joe come on along with me these desperate charactersd probably knock me over the head and run off to assassinate tr in a redhot minute if i was with em all by my lonesome his grin said he was not to be taken seriously reggie bartlett felt like a desperate character but not in the way the yankee sergeant meant if you were a prisoner of war you were supposed to try to escape that much he knew how you were supposed to try was another question he didnt have time to think about it martin gestured with his bayonettipped rifle the confederate prisoners got moving keep those hands high warned the damnyankee with the glasses specs guys with glasses were supposed to be mildmannered he wasnt not even close confederate shells a belated response to the gas barrage and trench raid fell not far away as they went out of the front line reggie swore hed almost been killed a couple of times by short artillery rounds what irony though to end his days on the receiving end of a perfectly aimed confederate shell martin and his comrades turned the confederate prisoners over to other men farther back then returned to their position the grilling reggie got from us intelligence seemed perfunctory occupation before the war name rank pay number unit a few questions about what theyd been doing and what they might do and a few more questions just as casual about the state of morale of the negro laborers attached to their units who pays attention to niggers jasper jenkins said you tell em what to do they do it and thats that the man recording the answers a wizened little fellow who looked like a born clerk wrote down the words without comment when he was through with the interrogation the wizened fellow said all right youre going back to a holding camp now dont forget your pay number well keep track of you with it i expect youll be bored cant help that he nodded to a couple of guards in greengray almost it was like going out of the line almost the prisoners were marched back toward a railhead out of artillery range of confederate guns that felt familiar even if nobody boasted about the havoc he aimed to wreak in saloons or brothels waiting for a train was familiar too getting into a stinking boxcar that had once held horses was less so although not unknown the train fought its way up over the blue ridge mountains that line hadnt existed before the war started the yankees had built it to haul supplies to the roanoke front it was a twotrack line several eastbound trains growled past the one on which bartlett unhappily rode damnyankees do a lot of haulin dont they jasper jenkins said his voice mournful somewhere on the downhill grade or rather one of the downhill gradesthey passed out of virginia and into its breakaway cousin west virginia when the train hissed to a stop armed guards threw open the doors and shouted everybody out move move move you damn rebs again bartlett might almost have been back in a rest camp he went through the same surely useless delousing process he had then he also had his hair clipped down to his scalp the uniform he drew on completion of all that though was not his own the tunic was tight the trousers and boots too large he complained about it the fellow handing out clothes looked at him as if he were insane shut up he said flatly reggie shut up prisoner barracks were of rough unpainted wood with spaces showing between boards reggie didnt look forward to that in winter bunks were similarly rough and stacked on top of one another not double not triple but quadruple he found a thirdlevel one to call his own and climbed into it home he said sadly evening was coming to hampstead maryland as far as jake featherston was concerned it looked like a pretty good evening the yankees out in front of the confederate lines had been quiet and the battery had needed to fire only a few rounds at them some of those had been gas shells too about time featherston muttered to himself the united states had been using gas against the confederacy for months being able to respond in kind felt good let those bastards worry about masks and goggles when we want em to not the other way round he got his mess kit and went over to the stew pot perseus had bubbling some damnyankee farmer was short a chicken jake found himself imperfectly sympathetic especially when the negro ladled a drumstick into his mess tin he smacked his lips sure as hell things were looking up he sat around shooting the breeze with his gun crew it wasnt the same as it had been back in the old days with the veterans whod served beside him before the shooting started but the new fish werent virgins any more either weve got us a pretty good gun here featherston said looking back at the howitzer the best michael scott said the loader was probably right at least as far as the battery went by their smug grins the rest of the gun crew agreed with him we got us the best niggers in the battery too he added in the fond tones a man might use about a child of whom he is proud the typical tones of a confederate white talking about the achievements of a confederate negro he patronized so automatically he had no idea he was doing it that they are jake featherston said his tone of voice was a little different hed used nero and perseus as men however uncomfortable that had made both him and them he shook his head he neither particularly liked nor particularly trusted negroes and the principal reason for that was his certainty that they had more capacity than they showed as an overseers son that worried him the surprise you got if you kept thinking a man a boy was apt to be dreadful he didnt mention that the two negroes had helped him fight the gun the crew he had now knew it but they seemed intent on pretending they didnt he understood that he tried to pretend it hadnt happened too doing anything else tore a hole in the fabric of the confederate way of life he was glad nero and perseus hadnt turned uppity on account of their exploit they would have been sorry for that and some of the blame would have stuck to him too he wandered over to see if anything was left in the stew pot and came back with a couple of potatoes the rest of the chicken seemed to have walked with the lord or more likely with the cooks he shrugged you had to expect that who ever heard of a cooks going hungry after hed disposed of the potatoes he washed his mess tin in a bucket of water and scrubbed it with a rag till the metal took on a dull gleam he made sure the rest of the gun crew did the same nothing gave you food poisoning faster than eating out of a dirty mess tin scott broke out a deck of cards jake declined to get into a poker game saying my lucks been lousy lately that was if anything an understatement hed lost most of a months pay a week before betting a full house against four artfully concealed nines he walked out onto hampsteads main street and peered north the fall air was cool against his cheek he couldnt see anything much in the deepening twilight and told himself that was just as well if he had seen something it would have been yankee artillery flashes lighting up the horizon which would have meant yankee shells paying the battery a visit this past year hed had all the glory and drama and excitement of combat hed needed to prove to him that the best thing to hope for in the middle of a war was a nice quiet dayor two or three of them in a row since he didnt feel like sleeping he went back to check on the horses perseus and nero had done their usual capable job of taking care of the animals he patted the gray gelding on the nose then headed out of the barn where the animals were resting a cricket chirped somewhere off in the middle distance an owl let loose with a mournful hoot from the front came the occasional crack of rifle fire it was only occasional though not the continuous almost surflike roar it became when the action heated up he looked up to the rather cloudy heavens and thanked god he wasnt an infantryman captain stuarts tent was pitched not far from jakes gun a lot of officers instead of living under canvas would have commandeered a house and made themselves comfortable there that would have been all right with feather ston what point to being an officer if you couldnt take advantage of it but stuart despite his fancy dinners and such still affected a pose as just another artilleryman except when he needed something from his father the hypocrisy irked jake he heard a low murmur of voices from beyond the battery commanders tent he frowned what was going on back there the voices grew quiet as he approached he found nero and perseus along with the negro laborers from the rest of the guns in the battery and even with captain stuarts servant pompey gathered in a circle around a tiny fire walls all around made it impossible for any yankee to spot from the ground they could smother it in an instant if aeroplanes came over near the fire lay a pair of dice and some money evenin sergeant pompey said in his mincing voice when he recognized jake we is just spreadin the wealth around you might say he grinned his teeth were very white in his dark face yeah well i done spread my wealth around lately featherston said perseus and nero laughed theyd heard him grouse about losing his shirt with that full house when pompey reached for the dice jake shrugged and left his own gun crew had their poker game going strong he watched for a while then pulled out what money he had left and sat in with them he won a couple of little hands lost a couple then lost with a flush to a full house that cost him a big piece of the anemic bankroll hed brought to the game he quit in disgust and went off to wrap himself in his blanket some time in the middle of the night somebody gently shook him awake he looked up to find perseus squatting beside his bedroll in a voice not much above a whisper the laborer said we aint actin like niggers no more marse jake figured id tell you on account of you know we dont got to you want to be careful fo a while is all i got to say he slipped away featherston looked around not altogether sure he hadnt been dreaming he didnt see perseus he didnt hear anything he rolled over and went back to sleep a little before dawn captain stuarts angry voice woke him pompey where the hell are you pompey i call you you bring your black ass over here and find out what i want do you hear me pompey stuarts shouts went on and on wherever pompey was he wasnt coming when called and then michael scott hurried up to jake a worried look on his face sarge you seen nero or perseus dont know where theyre at but they sure as hell aint where theyre supposed to be jesus featherston said bouncing to his feet it wasnt a dream sure as hell it wasnt scott stared at him having no idea what he meant he wasnt altogether sure himself one thing seemed clear trouble was brewing the policeman at the corner of beaufain and meeting streeta pudgy whitemustached fellow who might have fought in the war of secessionthrew up his right hand halting northsouth traffic on meeting so trucks and wagons on beaufain could continue making their way to and from the charleston railroad lines and harbor anne colleton snarled something distinctly unladylike and stomped on the brakes of her vauxhall prince henry the motorcar groaned and squeaked to a stop its radiator grill projecting slightly out onto beaufain shed bought the vauxhall because it could go fast not for its ability to stop in a hurry the brakes were a good deal weaker than the sixtyhorsepower engine a man in a battered ford was stopped alongside her he gave her a look halfway between curious and rude shed long since grown used if not resigned to that look even in the usa lady automobilists were a small mi nority in the more conservative confederacy they were rare she smiled back at the man he might have thought it a sweet smile if he were an imbecile rather nervously he tipped his straw hat sure you know what youre doing in the carhe proved himself a charleston native by pronouncing it cyar little lady wouldnt you rather have a chauffeur drive you around anne smiled again even more savagely than before i had to fire my last two chauffeurs she answered they went too slow to suit me the policeman halted traffic on beaufain and let the waiting vehicles on meeting street move anne put the potent vauxhall with three times the power of the ford next to itthrough its paces she left the fords driver choking on her exhaust she was almost sorry the charleston hotel lay only a couple of blocks south of beaufain the sensation of speed in the vauxhall exhilarated her far more than the same speed would have in a train here she was the engineer her foot on the throttle freedom she thought a pair of negro servants came dashing out from under the columned portico of the hotel one of them handed her down to the sidewalk then both of them grabbed her suitcases and followed her inside the doorman a fat col ored fellow in a getup that made him look like a revolutionary soldier threw wide the door to allow the procession to enter electric fans mounted on the ceiling stirred the air without cooling it anne strode up to the desk clerk gave her name and said i believe you have the presidential suite reserved for me uh miss colleton im uh very sorry maam the clerk said plainly alarmed at having to give her bad news but weve uh had to move you to the beauregard suite on the third floor she froze him with a glance oh and why is that her voice was low calm reasonable dangerous because maam president wilsons in the presidential suite he blurted oh she said again her laugh much to the unhappy clerks relief held acquiescence nothing you can do about that i suppose i didnt know he was going to be in charleston yes maam the clerk said hes come down to launch the fort sumter you know the new cruiser that just got built thats tomorrow tonight theres a reception and dance here in fact he turned back to the rectangular array of message slots behind the registration desk and pulled out a creamcolored envelope you have an invitation here when mr wilsons private secretary learned who had been booked into the presidential suite before him he made sure to give you one i should hope so anne said conscious of her position in south carolina then she turned the warmth up on her smile that was thoughtful the beauregard suite you say it will do after shed ridden upstairs in the lift and tipped the servants carrying her bags she sat down on the bed and laughed till tears rolled down her cheeks the charleston hotel was modern enough to boast telephones in its fancy suites the beauregard among them she made a call roger she said when the connection was established im afraid i wont be able to see you tonight after all yes im seeing someone else who why should i tell you oh all right i will its president wilson that produced a good fifteensecond silence on the other end of the line then roger kimball said i hope youre not going to see as much of him as you were going to see of me though the submariner couldnt see her she nodded approvingly he had gall she admired that how can i be sure she said he hasnt asked me that made kimball sputter as shed hoped she went on i will see you tomorrow unless the president sweeps me off my feet kimball chuckled or you sweep him off his but hes a long ways from young two nights runningd probably be tough for him tomorrow then he does have gall anne murmured after shed hung up she pondered her luggage shed brought clothes for going out with a young nonetoowealthy naval officer as well as some frilly silky things for more private moments with him what did she have that was suitable for dinner with the president of the confederate states of america she went through the dresses she had with her when she came to the summerweight rose floral voile she smiled the full pleated skirt would flow nicely around her legs as she moved and the laced bodice over the white voile chemisette might draw the eye even of a president no longer young the dress was wrinkled from its time in the suitcase she grabbed for the bell pull by the bed a maid knocked at the door less than a minute later she gave the colored woman the dress for pressing as shed been sure it would it came back in plenty of time for the dinner which the invitation said was to begin at eight oclock she had expected to have dined earlier and to be engaged in other things by then but what you ex pected and what you got werent always the same like the presidential suite the beauregard suite had not only cold but also hot running water anne ran the bathtub full and washed away the dust and grime of the trip from marshlands down to charleston she knew she would start perspiring again as soon as she stepped out of the tub but no one could do anything about that not in south carolina she was glad she wore her hair short and straight so the bath did not badly disarrange it she went downstairs about half past seven as shed expected a crowd of rich and prominent south carolinians had already gathered outside the doors of the banquet hall a couple of negro attendants with almost the presence of scipio made sure those doors did not open prematurely being a rich and prominent south carolinian herself anne colleton knew a good many of the people there being younger more attractive and more fe male than most of them she had as much company as she wanted and per haps rather more she saw a couple of wives whose husbands had abandoned them to talk to her sending imperfectly friendly looks in her direction she sent back the same sort of carnivorous smiles shed given the fool in the ford they pride themselves on being useless she thought they dont know anything and they dont want to know anything if you asked one of them to drive a motorcar shed tell you how unladylike it was and how she had a chauffeur to take her everywhere she wanted to go oldfashioned boring frumps she wondered what they would have made of the exhibition of modern art shed organized her lips pulled back in even more contempt as if any of them could have brought off a show like that the womens stares turned even more poisonous when after opening the doors the attendants began escorting people to their seats not only was she placed at the presidents table but right across from him we were told to put you here maam her negro guide said to make amends for mr wilson taking your room away from you he pulled out her chair so she could sit down woodrow wilson strode in long and lean at exactly eight oclock everyone stood to honor him he had something less than the almost demoniac energy of theodore roosevelt you could not imagine him leading a charge across nomansland as you would with the yankee kaiser his appeal was more to the intellect and he gave the impression of having that and to spare which was not to say he could not be charming in his own way smiling across the table at anne he said i do hope you will forgive me for so rudely dispossessing you this afternoon miss colleton quite all right i feel im doing my patriotic duty by moving your excellency anne answered out of the corner of her eye she saw she was getting more looks from people who didnt know exactly who she was down deep where it didnt show she grinned president wilson had known who she was long before hed taken the suite away from her hed visited marshlands after all and anne would have been astonished if more than half a dozen men in the banquet hall had contributed more money to wilsons election campaign back in than she had her brothers had laughed at her then but she thought the investment had paid off well no sooner had the thought of tom and jacob crossed her mind than wilson said i understand one of your gallant brothers was wounded this summer in a us attack he was gassed yes anne said shortly having jacob back at marshlands in such a state would have been hard enough having him back at marshlands in such a state and drugged on morphia and drunk when he wasnt drugged and sometimes when he was and fornicating his way through the colored wenches was ten times worse that cherry was getting so stuck up it was as if she thought herself the rightful mistress of marshlands at her anger wilsons narrow deeply lined face hardened it is because the united states like the huns across the sea with whom they are allied employ such vile and unrestrained means of waging war that they and their arrogant pretensions must be checked down the table a plump man with a red face that had grown redder with each glass of wine hed poured down said loudly the damnyankees need whipping on account of theyre damnyankees once youve gone and said that what more needs saying anne nodded emphatic agreement but woodrow wilson shook his head i would share this continent with them if i could he said if tomorrow they would agree to a peace based on the status quo ante helium with us and our brave canadian comrades i would accept on the instant then this half of the world would be at peace and we could work toward peace as well be tween our allies on the one hand and germany and austriahungary on the other they wont agree to any such thing though anne said they tried to keep us from becoming a nation in the first place and they still think we be long to them by rights if they can snuff us out they will we cant let them unfortunately miss colleton i fear you are correct the president said sadly and so we have no choice but to continue the struggle confident that god and justice are on our side i came down to south carolina to celebrate our production of another tool toward our ultimate triumph he still seemed unhappy about such duty and paused shifting from the political to the per sonal but you undoubtedly know why i am here what brings you to charleston business or pleasure he did not say that slightingly as many a man might have he knew she was a businesswoman in her own right pleasure she answered it was at the moment pleasure she was forgoing for the sake of the dinner but presi dent wilson did not need to know about that colored waiters cleared away dishes wilson got up and made a brief speech one line of which stuck in annes memory there is one choice we cannot make we are incapable of making we will not choose the path of submission and suffer the most sacred rights of our nation and our people to be ignored or violated it got she thought less applause than it deserved colored musicians began playing a sprightly waltz couples drifted out onto the dance floor anne succeeded in dismaying the old frumps once more for president wilson asked her for the first dance he had been a widower for more than twenty years but must have had a good deal of practice at affairs like this for he was strong and sure anne enjoyed dancing with him she thought he took pleasure in it too and wondered if he was interested in something more than dancing whether he was or not she wasnt despite the way shed teased roger kimball if you slept with a man of such power he might want to go to bed with you again anne flattered herself that if she slept with woodrow wilson he would want to go to bed with her again but if she slept with him he would never take her seriously again to her that was more important when the music ended she said win the war your excellency whatever it takes win it i have done my utmost miss colleton and shall go on doing my utmost till next march he answered after that god willing it will be in the capable hands of vice president semmes god willing anne agreed she suspected gabriel semmes might prosecute the war with more vigor than wilson had done for that matter semmes principal opponent in the november elections doroteo arango would probably prosecute the war with more vigor than wilson had done arango was a young fireeater if ever there was one but arango she thought had al most no chance of winning the radical liberals who had nominated him would sweep sonora chihuahua and cuba and might take texas too but she doubted theyd have much luck farther north and east wilson said will you be at the launching tomorrow miss colleton if you would like to come see my secretary for an invitation in the morning i may do that thank you your excellency anne said going down to the harbor would make meeting roger kimball all the more convenient the music started up again three grayhaired men with the look of financiers almost got into a football scrimmage with one another inviting her to dance theyd dutifully waltzed the first round with their grayhaired wives and now obviously had decided they were entitled to some fun anne danced with each of them in turn she stayed on the floor till a little past eleven then went to bed when she checked with the front desk the next morning she discovered wilson s secretary had given her an invitation to the launching ceremony even without her asking for it she put it into her hand bag then went back to her room telephoned roger kimball and arranged to meet him at the firemark on state street not far from the harbor the launch of the fort sumter disappointed her for a couple of reasons for one even with the pass she couldnt get close enough for a good view of president wilson smashing a bottle of champagne against the cruisers bow and for another wilson a staunch temperance man made it plain in his speech that the champagne hadnt really been champagne but soda water instead anne heartily approved of overturning some traditions but that wasnt one of them roger kimball was waiting under the firemark a seal dating back to the seventeenth century showing that the building on which it was affixed carried fire insurance when anne drove up in her vauxhall the submariner looked avidly at her and even more so at her motorcar may i drive it he asked she judged he would sulk and pout unless she indulged him so she said yes and slid over into the passenger seat kimball bounded into the automobile and roared up and down the streets of charleston with a panache that sometimes bordered on the suicidal anne prided herself as a bold driver but after a few hairsbreadth escapes realized she had to yield the palm to her companion try not to put both of us through the windscreen she said with some asperity as kimball screeched to a stop bare inches from a negro fisherman selling shrimp out of a basket the negro jumped back from the vauxhall but spilled no seafood after a moment he realized he wouldnt be crushed after all smiling at the navy man in his dashing whites and at his pretty companion the fisher man held out the basket and gave forth with his sales call roro swimp roro swimp rororororo swimp coma and git yo roro swimp kimball took him at his word jumping out of the automobile and buying a couple of pounds of them the motorcar rested on a slight downgrade anne had to reach out a leg and stamp on the nonetoopotent brake to keep the vauxhall from getting the fisherman after all and kimball with him what are you doing she demanded when the submariner his hands full of crustaceans got back into the motorcar nothing fazed him he dropped the shrimp a couple of them still feebly flailing little legs on the seat between them i know a little place where theyll cook the shrimp or the fish if you bring it in cant be beat he smacked his lips then added and its only a couple of blocks from a hotel that never heard of house detectives and how do you know that she asked how many girls have i brought there before you do you mean he returned does it matter if we arent doing this for fun why are we doing it to that she had no answer kimball had never claimed to offer more than amusement or to want more than that from her under those circumstances wondering about others before her was foolish she hadnt been a virgin there in the pullman car on the way to new orleans either she nodded and said lets go the restaurant was in the far northwest of charleston well away from the fancy part of the city it was in fact much closer to one of the negro districts which began only a few blocks away the proprietor who looked as if he might have been a quadroon passing for white greeted roger kim ball as an old friend if he was used to seeing the submariner in variegated company he gave no sign of it what he did with those little shrimp made the visit worthwhile cooked with rice and okra and chopped bacon and some spices he coyly refused to name they made a better meal than anne had had with president wilson the night before she didnt tell him that assuming he wouldnt have believed her she did give him as much praise as she thought he could accept he bowed low when she left on kimballs arm the navy man looked bemused remarking hes never done that before he handed anne into the vauxhall then drove to the hotel which was even closer to the negro section of town than the restaurant had been as if to impress on her that it was a tough district he took the key out of the ignition and gave it to her a precaution with which she seldom bothered as hed predicted the desk clerk placidly nodded when kimball signed the registry mr and mrs jefferson davis a nights rent was a nights rent the secondstory room was small but surprisingly clean kimball locked the door behind him lighted the kerosene lamp and then turned to anne with a grin what are we waiting for not a thing she smiled back from a lot of men from most mensuch brashness would have put her off but it was what drew her to roger kimball she stepped forward into his arms he squeezed her to him tilted her chin up and delivered an authoritative kiss for him to get out of his uniform a little later was the work of a few moments once naked he saluted her without using his hands he took his time about undressing her pausing to kiss and caress each new bit of flesh revealed she sighed with relief when after detaching her stockings from their garters and sliding them down her legs he finally peeled her out of her steelstiffened corset you men are so lucky not to have to wear those things she said especially in weather like this he set his hand on her sweaty belly then let it stray lower suddenly impatient she caught his shoulders and pulled him onto her he rode her hard which was just what she wanted when they were through he rubbed at his back you clawed me good there he said sitting up i hope it was good anne answered sated and greedy at the same time the room had no sink but did have a pitcher and a bowl she used some water to wash him off then took him in her mouth she wanted him hard again as soon as he was she straddled him and rode him as ferociously as hed taken her until she quivered again and again and he groaned beneath her as if in pain rather than ecstasy afterwards they lay side by side on the bed too spent to move neither of them much wanting to get back into stifling clothes when being naked felt so much better roger kimball fell asleep first anne was going to tease him about it but discovered she was yawning too she dozed off a few minutes later sometime in the middle of the night the lamp had burned out leaving the hotel room very darkshe woke up needing to use the chamber pot her motion woke kimball and they made love again lazily this time she on her side facing away from him barely touching save at one sweet place in the warm muggy night when anne woke again dawn was beginning to leak through the venetian blinds over the window but the light was not what roused her from out in the street came a terrific racket of shouts and crashes and after a moment gunshots roger kimball sat bolt upright unclothed though he remained he was suddenly and obviously a military man not a lover what the devil he said his voice sharp as a cracking whip right under the window a black man without intending to gave him his answer to de barricades the fellow yelled de revolution comin anne and kimball stared at each other oh lord they said together below them the cry grew louder and came from more and more throats till it seemed to fill the whole world de revolution de revolution comin scipio was talking with one of the cooks in the marshlands kitchen when the womans scream came from upstairs good god in heaven what can that be the butler exclaimed since he was talking as an extension of the estate rather than in his own person he used the elegant formal english he would have employed when addressing anne colleton or some white guest at the mansion dunno but i gwine find out the cook said and ignoring the fine points of the pecanandsweetpotato pie about which scipio had been trying to instruct him ran up toward the front of the house scipio followed he had no sooner reached the foot of the stairs than another scream rang out this one louder than before no godalmighty no the woman up there wailed who dat the cook demanded i believe that is cherry scipio replied had it not been undignified to do so in front of the cook he would have scratched his head the second scream and the wail had both come from jacob colletons room so presumably had the first but that made no sense cherry had gone up to jacobs room a great many times scipio didnt know exactly what she and the mistress gassed brother did behind that closed door but he did know shed always kept quiet about it till now the closed door opened then slammed shut cherry came running out now the cook said godalmighty in a tone half shock half admiration she was naked and though she clutched her dress to her quite a lot of her remained on display she dashed down the stairs moaning dat debbil dat horrible debbil what he try an make me do she ran past scipio and the cook both of whom stared even more for she was not covered at all from behind she opened the front door and ran outside out toward the fields if the direction from which her cries came was any indication damn white folks the cook muttered glaring up toward the closed door from which cherry had emerged a moment later the door opened again jacob colleton wheeled himself out to the banister come up here scipio he croaked scipio obeyed as he had obeyed white men and womenevery day of his life how may i help you sir he asked his voice the polite attentive meaningless counterpart to the mask of service stretched across his face instead of answering at once jacob colleton wheeled back into his room motioning for scipio to follow him once they were inside colleton demanded whats the matter with that wench has she gone mad sir i would not have the faintest idea scipio answered stiffly oh dont act stupid with me colleton said anger bubbling in his hoarse whisper you know we dont play caroms up here we were about to screw not to put too fine a point on it the same way weve screwed two dozen times before this when all of a sudden she went tearing out of here as if i dont know as if what i havent found anything she doesnt doand like doing too by god he panted trying to catch his breath after such a long speech to scipios own surprise he believed colleton he knew bewilderment when he saw and heard it what was wrong with cherry then had she gone round the bend scipio glanced out the window toward the fields sure enough there stood cherry still holding the dress in front of her haranguing a swelling group of field hands scipio couldnt hear what she was saying but he recognized the pose from meetings of the reds in cassius cottage and scipio stiffened here came a good many negroes with rifles in their hands all at once everything came clear this was the moment cassius and island and cherry and the rest had been talking about for so long jacob colleton hadnt done anything out of the ordinary with or to cherry but she was saying he had to bring doubters over to the cause whatever colleton had or hadnt done with cherry he had seen scipios attention focus on what was happening outside coughing and swearing in rasping gasps he had a look for himself and then most abruptly he reminded scipio he had been a soldier and a good one he had the tredegar down off the wall and a clip in it before the butler could blink he pointed it straight at scipios head scipio stared down the barrel it was black as midnight in there and looked about a foot wide to his frightened gaze he could smell gun oil get out of here boy colleton said his bubbling whisper making the words all the more deadly cold you niggers want to play games ill show you how its done up at the front he was smiling scipio hadnt seen him so happy since hed been gassed the rifle barrel twitched toward the doorway git scipio fled not just out the door but down the stairs jacob colleton slammed the door behind him and locked it the first shot from upstairs rang out when scipio got to the front door which cherry hadnt closed after her he reached the doorway just in time to watch island s head explode into red mist the revolutionary took half a step then fell on what was left of his face the rifle hed been carrying bounced on the ground beside him git down cassius yelled as another rifle shot barked and another red went down probably for good some of the armed negroes listened to the hunter some just started banging away at jacob colletons window the racket was like the end of the world then colleton fired again and another black man sprawled twitching in the grass by then cassius had taken cover behind a buggy a bang from upstairs and yet another red went down scipio remembered what colleton had said about the game of war he was getting another chance to play sure enough and he still remembered how rush de house cassius shouted i cover you his men and there could be no possible doubt they were his mendid as he ordered colleton knocked down another of them but cassius was shooting at him and cassius was no mean shot either three barefoot negroes in gray homespun dashed past scipio up the stairs they pounded on the door to jacob colletons room with their rifle butts one fell back with a groan shot from inside the room but the door flew open more shots rang out and then a black mans whoop of triumph dat white debbil he done fo cassius came walking up to marshlands rifle in his hand he shouted for everyone to get out waited half a minute shouted again and then went inside wish dat damn frenchman still have he ugly paintings here he remarked to scipio i do dis wid dey he struck a match and touched it to a gauzy curtain flames raced up it reached the wall above the window and caught there grinning cassius hurried back outside catching scipio by the arm and hustling him along scipio stared in through the window at the growing fire feeling a pang for beauty destroyed no matter upon how much suffering it rested the bourgeois in you cassius would have said you got to do dat cass he asked got to cassius said firmly gwine burn it all kip de revolution here
