alexander kent in the kings name to my tiger with all my love and with thanks for your love and support was i to die this moment want of frigates would be found stamped on my heart horatio nelson us and them captain sir quietly spoken and almost lost in the creak and murmur of shipboard sounds but adam bolitho was instantly awake if he had managed to sleep at all a few hours three at the most since he had slumped into the old chair to prepare himself and be ready the great cabin was still dark but for the same small shuttered lantern burning he looked up into the face above his chair the white collar patches seemed almost bright against the darkness the midshipman removed his hand immediately he must have touched his captains shoulder the first lieutenants respects sir he faltered as feet thudded across the deck overhead slithering to a halt as a voice snapped a warning probably some of the newly joined men who had not realised the skylight was directly above this cabin he made another attempt he sent me sir the morning watch is mustered he gazed fixedly at his captain as adam swung his feet onto the deck and sat upright thank you now he could see the moisture on the midshipmans coat reflecting the lantern light still raining he had not even pulled off his shoes when he had come down here to be alone with his thoughts he could feel onward moving steadily beneath and around him still sheltered by the land plymouth but not for much longer the thought gave him time have you settled into life aboard yet mr radcliffe he sensed the boys surprise that he had remembered his name he had only joined onward a few days ago his first ship and such small details mattered today of all days yessir the boy was animated now nodding and smiling mr huxley has made things much easier for me radcliffe was a replacement for deacon the senior midshipman who had left the ship to prepare for the board the vital examination which would decide his future that step from midshipmans berth to wardroom and a career as a kings officer they all joked about it and poured scorn on the grimfaced senior captains who usually comprised each board but only afterwards adam had never forgotten and neither did any one else if he had any sense they would miss deacon keen and quickwitted he had been in charge of onwards signals crew the eyes of the ship adam remembered him when onward had been beginning her approach to gibraltar or on their way home from the mediterranean and after their savage clash with and capture of the renegade frigate nautilus men had been killed others wounded and the ship still bore the scars and reminders and he recalled pride too on that morning with the rock looming against a clear empty sky deacon had written down adams signal in full before having it run up to the yards his britannic majestys ship nautilus is rejoining the fleet god save the king the midshipman was still waiting beside the old bergere where adam was seated body swaying to onwards movement as another offshore gust hissed against the hull my compliments to mr vincent i shall be joining him on deck directly vincent would understand but when onward had first commissioned and adam had been appointed in command they had remained strangers until until when he heard the screen door close voices midshipman radcliffe on his way back to the quarterdeck with his captains message of one company this was not the time to think of the missing faces the dead men and the ones who had been put ashore badly wounded some would be over there in plymouth today watching and remembering as the anchor broke free of the land even when he thought he was immune to it the pain could still take him unawares like a wound those seamen might become like the aimless groups that waited on the waterfront at falmouth criticising the ships coming and going with the tide sometimes not a whole man among them and in falmouth when they had moved aside to let him pass with lowenna the captain with his lovely bride who wanted for nothing he walked across to his sleeping cabin which was still closed it was the morning watch four oclock when most honest folk would be safely tucked up in bed some recovering from christmas or preparing for the new year he was still unaccustomed to it despite having seen it on the official document with the familiar wording which had left no room for doubt being in all respects ready for sea and his signature he knew there were many who would envy him today there were nine hundred captains on the navy list some without hope of getting a command even here in the naval port of plymouth there were plenty of empty hulls whose only destination was the breakers yard and it was said that there was not an admiral flying his flag who was under the age of sixty the older seamen still yarned about the great sea battles when there had never been enough ships at trafalgar when our nel had been only fortyseven years old adam bolitho was thirtyeight newly married and now after only the briefest time together he was leaving her again lowenna his hand was on the cabin door but he stopped himself from opening it her portrait was hanging just beneath the deckhead where it could be reached easily and stowed away if the ship cleared for action even if only a drill where was she now lying in that same bed and waiting for the first hint of dawn or some movement in the old grey house remembering accepting or regretting the inevitable the sea is a widowmaker he swung away from the door thankful for the sound of voices beyond the screen the royal marine sentry at his post probably halfasleep on his booted feet but always ready to challenge or announce any one who might attempt to intrude on the captains privacy not this time it was luke jago his coxswain and a law unto himself and adam was suddenly grateful mark vincent was the first lieutenant and a good one despite their initial differences and he had to be ready to assume immediate command should death or injury befall his captain only a fool would ignore that very real possibility adam touched the small desk as he passed without truly seeing it in one of its drawers was the broken epaulette which had been severed by a musket ball during the fight with nautilus it had felt no more dangerous than a hand brushing against his shoulder or a fragment of falling rope he had not even noticed it until jago had told him a few more inches and vincent would have been called to take adams place he would have died like his beloved uncle sir richard bolitho who had been marked down by a french sharpshooter during napoleons escape from elba almost four years ago but when you walked the streets or along the waterfront in falmouth it could have been yesterday unconsciously adam had reached up to touch his shoulder reliving it remembering jagos words the obvious concern best to keep on the move capn jago had tried to make light of it its me theyre after but the familiar wry grin had deserted him he wondered what jago thought about leaving england again after only a brief respite in harbour while the necessary repairs were carried out jago had spent most of his life at sea in one ship or another and mostly in time of war for him there was nothing else he had seen the idlers watching from the jetties and others pulling past the anchored frigate as if unable to stay away and had said with feeling better to be stitched up in a hammock right now than end up on the beach like that lot jago had been there in church as their guest when lowenna had married his captain sitting with john allday and his wife unis there must have been more than a few yarns after the ceremony and a lot of memories mornin capn up an about already i see jago was putting down a steaming mug and turning up the solitary lantern apparently indifferent to onwards motion as the deck tilted again winds steady enoughnoreast well need a few extra hands on the capstan he flicked open the razor until the blade caught the light and glanced at the old chair ready when you are capn he watched as the faded seagoing coat was tossed onto a bench and adam lay back in the chair with a frogsounding name as hugh morgan the cabin servant had been heard to describe it so many times jago could shave his captain in a storm without effort and the razor was very sharp he always made sure of that adam glanced at the stern windows he must be mistaken but they seemed paler already ere we go sir jago steadied adams chin with his thick fingers he could think of a few throats that wouldnt have risked being in this position one in particular he heard the sound of voices feet scurrying across the deck the morning watchkeepers preparing the way for all hands when the moment came he dabbed adams face with a towel still hot from the galley fire the first lieutenant was making certain that nothing would go wrong with every naval telescope trained on onward ready to find fault if there was any misjudgment or error and this man under the blade would be the target the captain was unusually quiet jago thought getting under way a thousand things to remember maybe you never got used to it he recalled the lovely woman in the church the way she and bolitho had looked together surrounded by all those people and yet apart he couldnt imagine what it was like he thought of the painting in the sleeping cabin behind him and she had posed for it he wiped the blade and grinned close shave sir adam stood up and looked at him directly steady as a rock luke he heard a muffled clink from the little pantry so morgan could not sleep either i have a letter to finish the hardest one to write i want it to go ashore in good time jago nodded the guardboat will take it sir ill make sure of that he hesitated by the screen door but there was nothing more ill leave you in peace sir adam called after him thanks luke sir but adam had walked to the quarter windows and was standing there a slim figure of medium height eyes as dark as his hair pale shirt framed against the outer darkness like a spectre as if he could see the nearest land he heard the door shut the sentry clearing his throat while jago told him the captain mustnt be disturbed he moved to the little desk and pulled open another drawer the letter was there halfwritten the ship was suddenly quiet and he could hear the repetitive squeak of the hook where his best uniform coat hung from the deckhead complete with the new epaulettes he had worn it at his wedding in falmouth adam touched his skin and the slight scrape left by the razor when jagos concentration had wavered a rare thing for him he dipped the pen and wrote slowly as if to hear the words it was not tomorrow it was now lieutenant mark vincent stood by the quarterdeck rail and stared along onwards full length making sure he had missed nothing it was almost physical this relaxing muscle by muscle like a gun captain who has made the final decision before opening fire he had been appointed to onward just over a year ago when she had been commissioned here in plymouth and he thought he knew every inch of her one hundred and fifty feet above and below deck how she behaved at sea even how she looked to any passing vessel or to an enemy she was a frigate which had more than proved herself during her short life and one any man would be proud and these days lucky to command he pushed the envy to the back of his mind until the next time it was rare to see the deck so crowded the lower deck had been cleared hammocks smartly stowed in the nettings with a minimum of fuss he glanced up at the sky shreds of ragged cloud scudding ahead of the cold northeasterly with only a few pale streaks of blue like ice guardboats casting off sir vincent said curtly as ordered he did not know the seamans face one of the replacements for somebody killed or injured in their brief bitter fight with nautilus but a few drills or an atlantic gale would soon change that and most of the new hands were volunteers a far cry from his first days at sea when they had been pressed men or worse scrovies as the worthless were termedpicked up by local crimps when they were too drunk to know what was happening he thought of the idlers he had seen on the waterfront when he had been ashore on some mission or other doubtless some of the same jacks who had once cursed every minute they had served aboard a kings ship the guardboat was pulling away from the chains the officer waving to someone by the entry port the oars reflecting in the choppy water as they angled to take the first pull vincent unslung the telescope from his shoulder and trained it across the slowmoving boat a twodecker of seventyfour guns was anchored between onward and the inshore moorings and catching the first gleam of sunlight on her high poop and gilded gingerbread and the rearadmirals flag at her mizzen he closed the glass with a snap like a warning or perhaps it was instinct there were several figures on deck with telescopes pointing toward onward officers despite the early hour the greasy smell of breakfast still lingered on the cold air he looked over at the companion and saw the captains coxswain climbing into view and pausing to touch his hat to the royal marine officers ranged beside a squad of scarlet coats as if it were a signal vincent crossed the deck which had been cleared to allow space for the capstan bars to be slotted into place jago walked past the big double wheel and took up his station at the rail another quick glance and vincent saw the signals crew standing by the flag locker midshipman hotham in charge his narrow face set in a frown and very aware of the moment a clergymans son but as he was always quick to point out so was our nel the royal marines boots clicked together and someone saluted the captain touched his hat and vincent thought he might have nodded slightly to his coxswain he faced vincent and smiled itll be lively when we clear the sound he was looking along the deck and gangways at the groups of seamen at their stations most of them staring aft at their captain vincent swallowed his mouth felt bonedry how does it feel his decision i might never know young hothams voice scattered his thoughts signal from flag sir a pause and a telescope squeaked as somebody else focused on the flags breaking to the wind proceed when ready adam saw the acknowledgment running up the halliards hotham peering eagerly forward as the bell chimed out as if to mark the moment vincent shouted man the capstan focsle party stand by heave m lads heave adam turned momentarily caught unawares it would take time to become used to another new voice harry drummond the bosun was a professional seaman to the tips of his ironhard fingers but it was impossible to forget the massive guthrie around which the ships company had seemed to revolve like hands obeying the capstan he had fallen like a great tree his men stepping over him to obey his last order the pawls of the capstan were moving clicking into place as more men added their weight to the bars someone slipped and fell sprawling the deck was still treacherous with rain but he heard a voice trying to raise a cheer as a fiddle scraped and squealed into a familiar sailors shantythere was a lass in bristol townheave me bullies heave it was lynch the senior cook eyes shut and one foot beating time to every clink of the capstan adam stared up at the yards the topmen strung out like puppets against the hurrying clouds the long masthead pendant gave some hint of the winds strength and he could picture onwards outline like a lithe shadow edging slowly toward the embedded anchor heave me bullies heave he heard julyan the sailing master speaking to the quartermaster and his extra helmsman calm unhurried just loud enough to carry above the chorus of wind and rigging one eye on the compass another on his captain whose ultimate responsibility this was adam remained by the quarterdeck rail the ship and her company moving around him but as if he were quite alone did you ever become so accustomed to this moment or so confident that it became merely routine the capstan was moving more slowly but steadily and no more hands were called to add their weight to the bars he could see their breath like steam blown away on the wind and feel the air on his spraywet cheek like ice rime he glanced forward again and across the larboard bow the twodecker was anchored apart from the other ships her sealed gunports a chequered pattern shining in the strengthening light there were lighters moored alongside empty like undertakers waiting for the last rites how did the ship feel how would i feel he looked away but not before he had seen the powerful shape of lieutenant james squire at his station in the eyes of the ship watching the incoming cable a born seaman and navigator and one of the most senior men aboard he had come up from the lower deck and had won respect and popularity the hard way two midshipmen stood nearby david napier and the latest addition to the berth john radcliffe who was about to begin a day good or bad which would live in his memoryhis first at sea in a kings ship adam could recall his own only the faces seemed blurred or merged by time save for a few jago murmured morgan brought yer boatcloak capn he was standing by the packed hammock nettings but hardly raised his voice still got a lot to learn then the familiar chuckle the cabin servant had thought of everything that his captain any captain might require under any circumstances but he doesnt know me yet that i would freeze or be soaked to the skin rather than take cover on this day adam glanced down and saw that maddock the gunner had paused by one of the upper deck eighteenpounders as if to speak with its gun captain a careful man perhaps still puzzled by the latest order from the admirals headquarters ashore there will be no salutes fired today until adam saw him look up his hand resting on the guns wet breech head halfturned he was deaf in one ear common enough in his trade but quick enough to acknowledge adams private signal from the quarterdeck he had heard the first lieutenant brushing maddocks question aside his mind too full of the business of getting onward under way sir john grenville admiralty todays his funeral thats why and vincent had turned away to deal with another problem adam had last seen and shaken hands with grenville in the very cabin beneath his feet both of them had known they would not meet again he gave me hope when he gave me onward and in his way grenville was sharing it today adam saw squire move toward the cathead and gesture behind him as if he could feel the anchor like a physical force stand by on deck that was drummond the new bosun an unhurried but sharp almost metallic voice which carried easily above other sounds around him he seemed to be blessed with a good memory for faces even names in his brief time aboard adam had never seen him consult a book or slate faster again the capstan bars turning like a human wheel anchors hove short sir they faced one another along the ships length squire did not even cup his hands loose the headsls always a testing moment maybe too soon onward thrusting over her own anchor at the mercy of wind and tide adam stared at the masthead the rain was heavier and the long pendant was moving only sluggishly in the wind he was soaked and his neckcloth felt tight around his throat like a sodden bandage he could feel the tension on deck sharing it small things stood out a leadsman hurrying to the chains ready to call out the soundings instantly if they moved into shallows before onward was under way vincent would take no chances today beyond the revolving capstan he saw jago piling muskets to allow some marines to add their weight for the last few fathoms anchors aweigh sir shouts running feet a few curses as the sails broke free and more water cascaded from the flapping canvas adam felt the deck tilt more steeply as the topsails filled and hardened the quartermaster and an extra helmsman straddlelegged at the big double wheel to keep their balance julyan was close by outwardly untroubled as bowsprit and tapering jibboom began to answer the helm so that the anchored flagship appeared to be moving as if to cross onwards bows steadymeet her julyan peered at the compass rain dripping from his hat steady as you go adam saw him look over at the quartermaster perhaps still surprised his predecessor had been julyans friend he had been killed there at the helm during the fight with nautilus adam shielded his eyes to gaze up at the topmen spread out along the yards no doubt breathless after fisting and kicking the canvas into submission a fall to the deck or into the sea alongside as the hull submitted to the wind must never be far from their minds lieutenant squire was watching the anchor until it reached and was secured to the cathead the mud and weed of the seabed still clinging to the stock and flukes his forecastle party was already lashing it firmly into place he wiped spray from his face with his fist until the next time he gazed aft and waited until he knew the captain had seen him before crossing his hands to signal that the anchor had been made secure the remaining cable was still being hauled inboard where it was seized by the nippers ships boys who would scrub and scrape it before stowing it below no more than children he thought and what a filthy job it reminded him of the mudlarks naked youths who dived for coins in the shallows at some seaports it had cost a few of them their lives squire glanced at the two midshipmen napier and the new arrival radcliffe both good lads although it was hard to judge either of them without experiencing a pang of envy napiers background was vague he had close ties to the captains family and was a ward of some kind and radcliffe was always full of questions and completely untrained it was said that his father had an important position in banking a different world bosuns mate pipe those waisters to be ready to add their weight to the braces squire swung round still waiting for the voice even though he knew he was mistaken the bosuns mate in question was newly rated and had been one of onwards best topmen and a fine seaman until his promotion he replaced fowler a man squire had known for years they had been on the lower deck together a bully and a petty tyrant he had become a real enemy i wanted him dead him or me now fowler was missing having gone ashore in plymouth and they had marked him in the muster book as run deserted but nobody really knew maybe he was dead maybe someone else had had a score to settle but until squire knew for certain he would remain a threat he gestured to the new midshipman who responded instantly my respects to the first lieutenant and tell him we are all secured here he raised his voice as radcliffe turned to run toward the gangway easy does it i think weve earned our pay today he waited until radcliffe had dropped out of sight it was always too easy to take it out of those who could not answer back he should have known that better than most he watched some of his seamen mopping the stained deck and dismantling their tackle dull necessary routine but it gave him time to calm himself it was over someone had called his name and he tugged his hat lower over his eyes peering into the rain they were under way the flagship lying across the quarter with only her flags moving her decks deserted he stared ahead again the bluegrey water reaching away on either bow the jibboom pointing the way like the naked figurehead of the youth with outstretched trident and dolphin beneath it he looked toward the land a church or slender tower was visible despite the downpour people might still be there watching the solitary frigate as she headed for the open sea there would be mixed feelings among the civilians pride perhaps sadness but certainly not envy it was still too soon after the long years of war the fear of invasion and not least the hated press gangs lieutenant james squire gripped a stay and felt it quivering as if the whole ship were straining forward eager to leave and he was free he heard napiers voice and saw him stoop beside one of the anchor party with a spare block and tackle in his hands like thisitll run free next time he smiled wet or dry the seaman was new and squire could not remember his name but he appeared not much older than napier he saw him reach out with an answering grin to help the midshipman to his feet it was a small thing but squire knew that it mattered more than he could explain napier was pleasant if slightly shy and had already proved himself reliable and quick to learn squire gazed along the shining deck where men and boys had died brave too one day maybe soon he turned and said abruptly you were at the wedding im told napier wiped his hands on a piece of waste he was still not used to squires sharpness and swift changes of mood a man you would never really know unless he himself allowed it yes sir there were a lot of people and the bride napier recalled the church the ceremony the light on the uniforms and the girl elizabeth adam bolithos cousin dressed as a midshipman carrying the flowers she would soon forget he would not they looked so right together squire laughed well said and so they should for some reason he knew napier would say no more like me he has nobody to leave behind message from the captain sir radcliffe was back breathless cheeks glowing from the cold wind he held out a folded piece of signal pad and grinned at napier rains stopped squire unfolded it deliberately i told you to walk mr radcliffe youre puffing like an old jack it gave him another few seconds and as he opened the message he realised that the rain had indeed stopped and the sea surging away from the stem was beginning to shimmer although any real sun was still hidden beyond the clouds hands take station for leaving harbour itll be lively when we reach open water officers conference aft at noon he looked at the two midshipmen that includes you for some reason both boys turned to watch a small schooner sails in momentary confusion as she altered course toward the anchorage napier would be used to it having served with captain bolitho before but radcliffe had not been long enough afloat to get his feet wet but in all his years at sea squire had never known a captain who made a point of sharing his immediate plan with his chain of command his men were separating to join others on deck directed by the masters mate and other senior hands the wind was strong enough to require more weight on the braces as onward made more sail squire shivered it never failed to excite him even now and he thought enviously of the youngster radcliffe so many years to make his own he saw napier going aft and pausing as he met the newly rated bosuns mate tucker heading in the opposite direction their hands touched not by accident and tucker grinned as napier spoke some good had been done tucker had been promoted because of fowlers disappearance he stared at the foretop and waited for a face and a name to form in his mind you willis move yourself weve not got all day he knew his men it was his strength napier heard the shout but ignored it and ducked beneath the larboard gangway between two of the eighteenpounders the sky had become clearer but they must have been too busy to notice the sea bursting from the stem where he had just been standing was glittering in hard sunlight but the touch of the drifting spray on his skin was still like ice he looked at tucker also called david and gripped his arm havent had the time to tell you properly im so glad for youwell deserved too tucker glanced down selfconsciously at his blue jacket and the telltale silver call hanging around his neck itll take some wearing to get used to it he said it strongly enough but when he looked up at the braced topsail yards and the small figures spaced at intervals against the sky he seemed less confident i know every manjack up there and what i was doing with them only a few weeks back the same risks the same laughs when we had all canvas doing what we wanted napier nodded i think i understand david im still getting used to it myself tucker showed his teeth in another grin its us and them remember nothing to do mister napier id have thought that by now it was monteith the third lieutenant hands behind his back head on one side and angry he looked past them the boats need securing for sea as you may recall ive already detailed hands for that sir another voice drummond the new bosun very erect but casually picking a piece of oakum from his sleeve as if the bustle and shouted commands around him were beneath his notice he did not drop his gaze as the lieutenant glared at him but if you are taking over sir i am needed elsewhere napier thought monteith would explode or give vent to the usual sarcasm instead he shaded his eyes as if to peer abeam and snapped i cant do everything and stamped away to tucker the bosun said ill need you at four bells right and walked aft unhurriedly calling out an occasional name or pausing by the various working parties as he went tucker shrugged sorry david i didnt see him he turned sharply as one of the foretopmen slithered down a backstay and landed as lightly as a cat at his feet hey ted whynt you warn me he was coming napier recognised the seaman called ted he had often seen him together with tucker working aloft like the others they had been watching repairing rigging and tending the wounded after battle sharing a lively hornpipe during a dog watch when onward had first commissioned friends now the same man turned his back remarking over his shoulder didnt know it was an order tucker stared after him as if he had been struck then he said quietly its become a different ship napier gripped his arm again and waited until their eyes met seeing the pain he smiled so welcome aboard adam bolitho stepped into the great cabin and heard the screen door close behind him he had not recognised the royal marine on guard duty another stranger but he had noticed that sergeant fairfax was nearby as if by coincidence he put his hand out to steady himself the motion was more pronounced now that onward was in open sea but he knew it was not simply that his entire body ached with tiredness and strain he had been on his feet since midshipman radcliffe had roused him when the morning watch was calledhe stifled a yawnabout ten hours ago he walked aft angled to the deck eyes on the hard light from the stern windows sloping now to the thrust of wind and sea he glanced briefly at the old chair where his day had begun to sit in it now would be fatal even when he had called the meeting here at noon he had remained standing some might have thought he was impatient to get it over and let routine take charge maybe the newcomers thought so anyway there had been two lieutenants the royal marine officer all the warrant officers and the six midshipmen together in a tight group vincent had remained on watch the tallest present was the new carpenter chris hall who had served at sea in several menofwar but had also been attached to the dockyard on maintenance and even involved in the building of various types of vessel like other lofty visitors to the great cabin he had taken his place under the skylight but even there he had been stooping slightly how did he manage between decks or working in the lower confines of the hull he watched the occasional dash of salt spray drying across the stern and quarter windows at least the rain had stopped there was still a smell of rum lingering between decks he had heard a few cheers when the order to up spirits was piped it was the least he could do for men who had been hard at work since first light on a bitter morning there had been the usual comments after the meeting lieutenant squire clapping vicary the purser on the shoulder and grinning cheer up its not coming out of your purse vicary was always complaining about stores and wastage it did not help matters murray the scottish surgeon had added wont need so much grog anyway where were bound for adam stared at two gulls which were riding the wind drifting from side to side below the taffrail the galley must have thrown some scraps over the side but the surgeons words were still with him where were bound for it was freetown on what had been the slave coast of africa and it still was for those who carried out their endless patrols there but why all the secrecy and apparent urgency and why onward so soon after the mediterranean and that bloody action with nautilus but he had discovered nothing more when he had gone ashore for the last time to sign for the sealed despatches which were now locked in his strongbox even that had been unusually formal his signature had been witnessed by one of the admirals aides a senior captain another unfamiliar face courteous but unhelpful onward is a fast frigate bolitho as you will know better than any one he had paused as one of his clerks sealed the despatches and stamped the wax repairs completed to your satisfaction fully manned and stored he had walked to the familiar window and said after another silence and available reminding him that another captain could be appointed within a day less adam had not forgotten the admiralty waitingroom when he had been called to london the jealousy and the hostility nor would he he walked across the cabin and heard muffled voices beyond the pantry door morgan and a much younger servant a boy sent to help him during the conference morgan seemed to be waiting judging the moment was it so obvious more voices the sound of a musket being tapped on the grating a dispute of some kind then the door opened and closed and jago said not much to see capn more rain on th way adam reached for his boatcloak and changed his mind trouble just now jago glanced at the door yer sentrys new just needs to be told thats all capn he stepped aside as adam left the cabin the sentry was ready and snapped smartly to attention as he passed but he noticed sergeant fairfaxs burly shadow lurking by the companion ladder on deck it seemed almost dark although the bell had only just chimed for the first dog watch vincent touched his hat standing by to alter course sir adam looked past and beyond him into the murk low cloud again vague figures mustered and waiting by the braces and halliards but strangely silent so that the shipboard noises and the surge of water alongside predominated one of the midshipmen was waiting to offer him a telescope his collar patches very bright like those in the cabin before dawn he felt the air quiver and then the vibration of the rail under his hand someone said thunder vincent looked toward him but did not speak all those miles astern and yet the salute was with them personal sir john grenvilles farewell or a last gesture of remembrance his old ship adam heard an older voice say thass th lizard over to starboard my son last youll see of england for a while so make th most of it jago had handed him his boatcloak it was raining again but he had not felt it the same rain must be falling in falmouth on lowennas garden as close as they could be and she would know chain of command lieutenant mark vincent hesitated at the top of the ladder beneath the companion to give his eyes time to meet the glare on deck after the sheltered chartroom it was almost blinding the helmsman called sou by west sir steady as she goes probably to warn squire who had just taken over the forenoon watch that the first lieutenant had reappeared squire was talking to a midshipman walker who was writing on a slate tongue protruding from one corner of his mouth in concentration vincent waved and said carry on he was merely a visitor he walked to the lee side of the quarterdeck and stared at the gleaming expanse of sea empty as a desert the horizon unbroken by cloud or shadow he considered himself an experienced sailor and never took the sea and its moods for granted the last few days had tested those beliefs to the extreme the weather had worsened as soon as they had cleared the western approaches and left the land astern the wind had stayed in their favour but had often been too strong to spread more canvas and run before it four days of it this was the fifth since onward had weighed at plymouth he felt the planking beneath his shoes quite dry nowon the quarterdeck at least some of the newly joined hands must have been wondering what had made them quit their homes in the first place and not just the inexperienced he had heard julyan the master admit more than once on the fringe of biscay i thought we were going to lose our sticks vincent shaded his eyes and stared along the upper deck repairs were still being carried out the sailmakers crew huddled below the starboard gangway busily cutting and stitching a torn sail while a gunners mate was testing the breeching on one of the eighteenpounders splicing where necessary then it would be checked again before another drill trust and blame went hand in hand he looked up at the taut spread of canvas the captain had hinted that they would get the topgallant sails on her soon probably during this watch it was bolithos decision the nagging thought was always there suppose it was mine and how did bolitho really feel about leaving the land so soon after the nautilus mission and more importantly his bride vincent had remained with onward while her repairs were being completed in command and so unable to attend the wedding at falmouth but he had heard enough about it and the rest he could imagine lowenna was not someone you could easily forget ah i thought i would find you here mark always busy keeping us all afloat eh it was murray the surgeon so light on his feet like a dancer or a swordsman although he was neither as far as vincent knew outwardly easygoing and popular with most of the ships company which was rare enough in his profession for the most part surgeons were feared even hated butchers murray was smiling quizzically and if its not too late to say it a very happy new year to you they solemnly shook hands he had a grip like steel vincent thought murray turned to gaze abeam apparently untroubled by the hard sunlight he had pale blue eyes which seemed almost colourless in the glare and his profile was narrowfeatured with a prominent hooked nose where are we mark im damned if i know vincent had to smile rapierstraight that was murrays way in the wardroom and amidst the casual chatter and banter between various duties and watches he would always come directly to the point but his attention had been diverted as a seaman hurried by and the moment was past hows the knee slater the man stopped as if startled then he grinned good as new an thankee sir murray walked to the companion he had some notes to make and in any case vincent was already pointing out something to another working party the first lieutenant once more he thought of the seaman to whom he had just spokenslater murray had always had a good memory for names and was grateful for it some never seemed to acquire the ability never bothered or did not care but he knew from experience that it was often the only link they had slater had injured his knee in a fall during one of the sudden squalls off biscay it might have been a lot worse and he might not have recovered just a name even if you had to take off his leg midshipman huxley scuttled past him with a folded chart doubtless on some mission to see the captain another two weeks before landfall maybe more bolitho left nothing to chance murray paused at the ladder and looked up as he heard feet thudding across the deck above probably a marine he thought then someone shouted hes just gone below he waited suddenly tense and a pair of legs appeared on the ladder blotting out the glare beg pardon sir theres bin an accident in the galley i was told he fell silent as murray waved his hand ill fetch my bag it would only be a bruise or a burn but just in case he found that it amused him he was more like the captain than he had believed tobias julyan the sailing master watched as the captain who had been leaning over the chart table straightened his back and jabbed his brass dividers into a piece of cork it would prevent them sliding away into some hidden corner if onward was hit by another fierce squall adam said if the weather holds we should be able to fix our position a quick impetuous grin and our progress with more certainty julyan glanced around the small chartroom a world apart without it all the sweat and tears expended elsewhere would amount to nothing no matter what the old jacks liked to think this is the atlantic sir i think shes done us proud and so have you adam dragged the heavy log book into a shaft of sunlight and did not see julyans pleasure he turned a page the first day of the new year of it was a friday strange that so many sailors and not just the older ones regarded fridays as unlucky he had never discovered why luke jago had reminded him this morning as he had been finishing his shave they said i was born on a friday so that should tell us somethin jago seemed to live one day at a time always ready perhaps because he had no one and nothing to leave behind or come home to the sea and the navy were his life until the next horizon like the severed epaulette always ready adam heard a tap and the chartroom door opened a few inches he thought it would be vincent impatient to begin making more sail but julyan said your coxn sir he picked up some notes and pulled the door wide i shall be standing by sir the door closed behind him and jago stood with his back against it their eyes met and adam said quietly trouble luke a short fuse if you asks me capn he scowled someone a bit too handy with a blade in the galley of all places adam reached for his hat im going on deck jago watched him leave and swore silently bloody fridays hugh morgan the cabin servant heard the screen door slam shut and waited warily as the captain strode aft to the quarter morgan had served several captains and bolitho was the best so far old enough to have borne the full weight of responsibility young enough to consider those less fortunate and still finding their way but there were bad days too this was likely to be one of them new year or not can i fetch you something to eat sir youve touched nothing since they called all hands adam pushed himself away from the bench beneath the stern windows with their gleaming panorama of water greyer now than blue he said i apologise there was no need to bite your head off then im expecting the first lieutenant directly maybe the surgeon too the meal can wait he tossed his hat onto a chair and asked abruptly how well dyou know lord one of the cooks mates the one who was stabbed sir adam sat down as if something had been cut if morgan knew the whole ship would know morgan watched the signs it was bad all right brian lord good lad to all accounts the cook speaks well of him not too well of course adam smiled and felt his jaw crack you should be a politician morgan relaxed a little too honest sir adam looked astern again at the regular array of a following sea marked by the shiver and thud of the rudder at any other time he would have been satisfied proud instead he kept remembering the anger on jagos face he knew the course of events better than any one the man could have died but for murrays prompt action and could still die there had been blood everywhere the deck tilted suddenly and he saw morgan pivot round to stare at the pantry door behind him someone must have lost his balance there was an audible gasp and a sound of breaking glass morgan waited for a few more seconds and said not one of my best goblets i hope the door swung open the new mess boy was getting to his feet some shards of glass in his hands morgan said reprovingly theres clumsy you are boy like an ox in a chapel he was dangerously calm and his welsh accent was more pronounced adam reached out and took the boys arm watch your step my lad the surgeon has enough to do just now morgan shook his head this is my new helper sir chose him myself too he nudged the broken glass delicately with his shoe i am not usually so mistaken adam said to the boy whats your name the boy looked from him to morgan who repeated chose him myself sir from your own part of the world see the boy seemed to find his voice tregenza zur arthur tregenza from truro zur his round open face was a mass of freckles which matched his ginger hair it was a small thing adam thought not even worth his attention morgan would deal with it but for some reason it was important the boys first ship and from truro only a dozen miles from the old grey house in falmouth where she would be waiting wondering adam said you must tell me about yourself when we have more time but take care until you know onwards moods a little better she can be a lively ship when she chooses morgan was looking meaningly at the screen door and the boy retreated well leave you in peace sir maybe youll care to eat later thank you i would appreciate that morgan was opening the door even as the royal marine sentry was lifting his musket to rap on the grating interrupted he said awkwardly the first lieutenant sir morgan stood aside for vincent to pass and shut the door behind him vincent said i just left the surgeon sir he touched a stain on his sleeve lord has lost a deal of blood even now he broke off and added bitterly after all weve been through adam sat down again tell me mark in your own time vincent stared unblinkingly up at the skylight lord had been sent to the galley to fetch somethinghe doesnt remember what instead he found the manlamontstealing meat putting large pieces into a bag he was using one of the cooks own knives he looked across the cabin for the first time you could shave with one of them adam pictured the cook lynch who had played his fiddle as onward weighed anchor sharp knives meant less waste vincent held up his right forearm and ran a finger down it he cut lord from wrist to elbow somebody wrapped a shirt round it then the surgeon came and the one responsiblethis man lamont joined us at plymouth just before we left transfer from a ship awaiting overhaul or demolition able seaman ten years service it was all rather vague adam watched the sea catching the sun again a hard light with no hint of warmth lamont did you see him vincent looked past him as spray spattered across the glass i was off watch at the time sir but someone heard lord scream the bosun was the first to reach the galley and he called the surgeon otherwise a pause then as if to emphasise it aye i questioned lamont the masteratarms was also present lamont claimed it was selfdefense i cautioned him i knew you would want to know all the details you did right mark you can carry on with your routine until we learn something useful vincent picked up his hat i feel it was partly my fault sir i had no time to test lamonts worth when he was signed on the door closed and adam stood watching the sea once more prepared or resigned and with an overriding sense of disappointment he gazed around the cabin where he still sometimes relived the last fight the thunder and crash of cannon and the crack of muskets men calling out in pain or in rage helping one another dying all that and yet the barrier between himself and vincent remained an unseen enemy he thought of thomas herrick his uncles oldest and dearest friend and his words on one occasion command is complete or worthless the door creaked it was morgan i thought you called sir adam let his arms fall to his sides perhaps he had spoken aloud but he was ready the two midshipmen sat facing one another across the table around them their mess was quiet and deserted although not for much longer there had been a shrill of calls on deck and a smell of food if they needed reminding midshipmen never did david napier touched the bruise on the back of his hand left by a rope clumsily dragged when they had been shifting one of the boats on deck the salt air had made it sting like a burn one of the new men had been too eager or preoccupied midshipman huxley gestured with a spoon put some grease on it napier smiled wont get any sympathy will i if we lower the jollyboat later youd better stand clear you might lose the other one just words but they were friends and had been since they had joined onward together on the same day napier recovering from injuries and the loss in action of his last ship and simon huxley struggling to accept the suicide of his father following a courtmartial although he had been found not guilty and cleared of all blame it was a quiet unquestioning friendship neither ever tried to explain they only knew that it mattered dishes clattered nearby and somebody laughed huxley said i wonder if young lord is going to come through it it was on both their minds and probably everybody elses maybe even on the mans who had let the rope run out of control never saw a lot of him but i know he went out of his way to make a cake for jamie walkers thirteenth birthday huxley smiled on the day of the battle with nautilus i forget if we ever even tasted it what dyou think will happen about lord huxley lowered his voice confidentially ive been looking it up if the worst happens there will be a courtmartial there was one at portsmouth a few months ago someone was hanged a chair scraped back and midshipman charles hotham the senior of the sixstrong mess sat down noisily and glared at the empty plates i should damned well think so too dont know what the fleets coming to especially where meals are concerned they laughed it was the only way hotham was a clergymans son so was nelson he always proclaimed john radcliffe the newest member of the mess sat down muttering apologies for lateness the others were on duty hotham made a grand gesture to the hovering messman glasses today peter today of all days i think some of my wine he watched critically as it was being poured to our unfortunate shipmate napier hardly noticed the taste it was suddenly easy to see hotham like his father all in black even to the collar he glanced across at the scarred and sturdy desk they all shared when making their notes on navigation and seamanship in anticipation of the day of the board and when composing letters that might eventually reach england cornwall in his case would she even remember him or care she was an admirals daughter the admirals daughter he reached for his glass but peter the messman was already refilling it a dream then so be it elizabeth there were voices very low just outside the door and a moment later the messman was back surgeons still workin sir radcliffe stared at his wine untouched and the steaming tray suppose then he lurched to his feet and left the mess huxley looked over at napier with concern there was no answer adam bolitho paused as though to regain his balance although that was merely an excuse it was pitch dark after the gloom of the quarterdeck and strangely silent so that the ships own sounds seemed unnaturally loud and intrusive he had waited deliberately until after midnight when the watch had changed and most of onwards company were swinging in their hammocks and asleep if they were lucky he touched the timber it felt like ice and the white paint looked very fresh in the faint glare of a light this was pointless murray would be asleep too after what he had been struggling to do all day or still preparing his report despite all his brutal experience the scot was not the kind of man to dismiss it simply as his duty here even the smells were different the hemp and tar salt and canvas seemed miles away and clean adams foot brushed against something and he heard someone gulp and mutter it was a fold of the loose smock worn by one of murrays assistants his crew as he called them slumped in a trestle chair and already snoring again even in the feeble glow adam could see the telltale stains too many memories even the confined smells oils of thyme and lavender and mint and others less medicinal more sinister alcohol blood sickness and always the pain the fear the door was not completely shut in case of an emergency and it swung easily under his hand so that the light of a shuttered lantern seemed almost blinding nobody moved one man was slouched in a canvas seat a partly folded bandage in his lap his splinted leg propped on a chest one of the seamen who had been injured off biscay murray was beside the cot his back to the door stooped unmoving the inert body lying in his shadow he could have been asleep or dead adam looked down into the still face younger than he remembered eyes shut skin as white as the sheet that partly covered his bare shoulders then murray spoke softly without turning his head i knew youd come i felt it he moved his head slightly and adam saw that he was dabbing lords mouth with a rag and with his other hand was gripping lords free hand the right arm was stiff with linen bandages and protected by what appeared to be weighted pillows there were stained dressings on the deck and more piled in a keg nearby murray halfturned his hawkish profile and said quietly pass me that jug will you he bobbed his head with a little sarcastic smile if you please sir he released the hand he had been holding and lowered it to the cot and waited motionless then he said come on laddie once again eh adam almost held his breath it was over if i had kept away but the hand was moving hesitantly slowly then decisively toward murrays hairy outthrust one he grasped it and dabbed the mans mouth again i am here brian we are here the voice was very faint arm hurts murrays tousled hair fell over his forehead at least you can feel it thank god he lifted the sheet and listened to the heart before moistening the dry lips again adam could smell the brandy the surgeon was staring now at the glittering array of instruments nearby not this time as if he were speaking to himself or to death lieutenant hector monteith stood at the foot of the mizzen mast and glared around at the seamen already mustered by the quarterdavits to lower the jollyboat for towing astern take the strain turns for lowering his foot tapped impatiently as one man broke into a fit of coughing we dont have the rest of the forenoon scully then lower away the jollyboat maid of all work gave a jerk and began to move empty but for a man fore and aft to check the tackles always a lonely task at sea monteith bawled handsomely he moved to the side this is not a contest he saw the man in the boats bows hold up his fist avast lowering the boat had settled on the water lifting and falling easily on the frigates wash recall those men he glanced along the rank of seamen on the quarterdeck and knew the first lieutenant was on the opposite gangway watching him and dont forget a boat towing astern could save a life the seaman named scully who had coughed muttered so long as its not yours luke jago turned away from the boat tier where he had been changing the lashings on the gig his gig when they finally reached freetown the captain would want the gig no excuses jago had no complaints about that a manofwar was always judged by her boats and that was how it should be he saw monteith hands on hips overseeing the men mustered by the sloping davits the watch had almost run its course but monteith would not dismiss them until the stroke of eight bells he was the third lieutenant and a junior one at that with a face so youthful he might still have been a midshipman but he had all the makings of a hardhorse suppose he ever gained a command of his own god help his ships company jago thought he gripped the hammock nettings as the deck sloped suddenly and some loose tackle clattered against a hatch coaming on cue monteith snapped stow that properly and in a seamanlike manner logan the seaman answered just as sharply its lawrence sir but he hurried to obey jago thought of falmouth and the big grey house and the girl on the captains arm at the church all those people an i was a guest an more than that he had been recalling all the stories yarns he had shared with john allday sir richard bolithos old coxswain who had been with the admiral when he had been shot down aboard his flagship frobisher in allday was landlord of the old hyperion inn and had a charming wife to warm his bed and a daughter too everything but in many ways he was still the admirals coxswain and his heart was aboard frobisher even the fine model allday had been making of their old ship remained unfinished as if he was unwilling to break something between them some link to the past jago heard the shrill of a call and the cry echoed below deck up spirits and murmured but stand fast the holy ghost he had already caught the whiff of rum even in this keen atlantic air there were voices and he saw the first lieutenant stride across the quarterdeck not to speak with monteith but to attract the attention of an untidy figure in a linen smock one of the surgeons crew the man looked utterly drained and unsteady on his feet and had doubtless been working in the sickbay without sleep since the previous morning jock murray as he was known behind his back never seemed to spare himself nor those who shared his trade jago was too far away to hear what was being said but words were not necessary he saw vincent gesture to his right arm and the other mans drawn face clearing and breaking into a wan smile then his astonishment as vincent reached out and clapped him across the shoulder some seamen were stopping nearby as if to share it and one of them shouted to the working party near the quarterdavits who were still waiting to be dismissed only monteith remained alone and unaware that a mans life had been saved jago jumped down to the deck and took a couple of deep breaths but the pain was still there like a knot in his stomach a tot of grog might help why did he always think that it never had ah here you are luke it was sergeant fairfax his uniform a vivid scarlet amidst the shrouds and canvas they were friends and had served together in the past although jago could barely recall when or where fairfax rubbed his chin having reached a decision thought you might drop into the barracks directly i owe you a tot i seem to remember maybe a couple jago touched his arm and saw the fresh pipeclay drift from his belt later mebbee tom ill be with the capn fairfax knew him better than most except maybe bolitho he glanced over toward the cabin skylight so be it matey below in the great cabin adam bolitho sat his body at one with the motion of the ship a following sea weaving reflections across the deckhead like lively serpents astern and as far as any lookout could see the ocean was theirs empty not even a bird to give any hint of life but their own in the tall glass morgan had placed by his elbow the dark red wine was rising and falling so slowly hardly at all morgan had retreated to his pantry again and the door was partly closed with not a clink or a rattle to disturb his captain he had even sent his new recruit tregenza to another part of the ship for the same reason adam glanced at the chair which had been moved directly opposite this old bergere where gordon murray had almost fallen asleep after painstakingly taking his captain through the procedure by which he had saved lords life it had been a very close thing the blade had just missed severing the major artery and vein both of which branched through the inside arm and had that happened stitching the wound would have been impossible even in a hospital ashore murray had stifled another yawn and apologised even now one cannot be certain there is always the danger of infection but he had suddenly smiled however i am confident that given time hell be back in his galley wielding those knives hes a strong lad courageous too im quite proud of him adam had watched him swallow wine some of it had dripped over his chin like blood and were proud of you when i first saw the wound adam shook his head ill see that it goes in your report were privileged to have you among us he sipped his own wine now but it seemed metallic on his tongue he looked up taken off guard as feet thudded across the deck overhead in step marching marines morgan had materialised like a ghost and was picking up the empty glass later sir i shall he did not continue the door was open it was jago wearing his best jacket and with his hat squeezed under his arm he looked at adams uniform and then at the old sword which was lying across the table ready when you are capn adam picked up the sword jago was waiting to fasten it to his belt like others before him youll never know but the shrill of calls and hurrying feet stifled the rest clear lower deck all hands all hands lay aft to witness punishment it was now the witness lieutenant james squire leaned on the quarterdeck rail to ease his stiff shoulders four bells and still two more hours of the forenoon watch to complete he glanced at young midshipman walker who was sharing the watch and wondered what would have changed in the navy by the time hes my age he smiled probably nothing he saw some of the new hands clustered around the forward eighteenpounders while the gun captains took them through the drill loading and running out they were on the weather side and with onward leaning slightly to the wind they would find the guns needed all their strength maddock the gunner never spared any one where his broadside was concerned men working on or above deck had paused and were looking on some of them perhaps remembering their fight with nautilus and others like drummond the bosun further back still he had served at trafalgar aboard the mars in the thick of the action stand by together this time maddock had just taken over head on one side the deafness his only weakness after too many broadsides in the past but woe betide any one who tried to take advantage of that disability maddock could lipread from one end of the gun deck to the other several of the seamen working on deck were barefoot either to save shoe leather or to harden their soles for shrouds and ratlines a few would regret it but they must all feel the difference even the last to join at plymouth there was a suggestion of warmth under a clear sky and the bite had gone from the wind squires face cracked into a wry smile almost he knew that the midshipman had moved closer a bright lad eager to learn and not afraid to ask questions but it was not that if he leaned further over the rail he would see the large grating inboard of the nearest gun scrubbed almost white again and dried by the wind and sun where a man had been seized up in the presence of all the ships company and flogged midshipman walker was not yet fourteen but soon would be the same age as squire when he had joined his first ship in his two years aboard squire had witnessed two hundred floggings his captain had believed in discipline of the most ferocious kind he and others like him had contributed to the great fleet mutinies at the nore and spithead even as england had been living in daily fear of a french invasion since he had joined onward there had been only one flogging suspended halfway through before the punishment of the seaman lamont two days ago and lamont was lucky he would not be doing the tyburn jig when he reached port and higher authority you might become hardened to it but you never forgot squire thought of jago the captains coxswain a strong man and a loyal one but squire had seen him being washed down one day twisting his muscular body under a pump the scars of the cat were unmistakable jago had received a written pardon from an admiral and a sum of money in compensation amounting to a years pay and the officer who had ordered the unjustified punishment had paid for it with a courtmartial but jago would carry the scars to his grave squire had glimpsed his face as lamont was being flogged and wondered how he could remain so faithful to any captain after his own experience midshipman walker exclaimed suddenly i think he deserved it squire sighed out of the mouths of babes deck there every one even the helmsman looked up as the cry came from the foretopmast it seemed ages since the lookouts had sighted anything and this was certainly not land squire stared at the small silhouette who was signalling with his arm but he already knew the face and the name always reliable but he would need more than the naked eye he saw the midshipman reach for a telescope but took it from him and shook his head not this time bosuns mate aloft with you youll feel at ease up there it was tucker he took the telescope and held it to his eye briefly before slinging it across his shoulder starboard bow was all he said squire replied aye probably nothing or out of sight by now but tucker was already striding along the gangway as he must have done countless times in his service as a foretopman squire watched him until he had reached the shrouds and began to climb keep busy mind and body it helped squire had learned that for himself david tucker climbed steadily his eyes fixed on the foretop and the hard bellying curve of canvas he was conscious of the men by the guns heard maddocks voice as he repeated some instructions a few faces might have turned in the direction of the figure on the ratlines or maybe not what did he expect anger hostility certainly not sympathy he reached the foretop and pulled himself out and over the barricade his body hanging momentarily over the creaming water below dont look down they used to shout up at him in those early days now it was something he told others a seaman was splicing nearby and glanced at him only briefly as he passed as if he were a stranger only two days ago but he had relived every moment he should have been prepared harry drummond the bosun must have been warning him youve got your feet firmly on the first step of the ladder dave obey orders smartly an without question an you might go higher he had grinned like me tucker had witnessed more than a few floggings since he had joined his first ship as a mere boy the articles of war were read aloud by every captain no individual could plead ignorance of them but he could still feel the shock when the pipe had called all hands to witness punishment rowlatt the masteratarms had pulled him aside and handed him the familiar red baize bag containing the cat he could even have been smiling first time for everything my lad tucker realised he had reached the crosstrees almost without noticing the dangerous part of the climb he knew the lookout well they had often shared this precarious perch he came from york and tucker had always wanted to know how he had found his way into a kings ship he said now i remember when the capn gave you his own glass when you came aloft he nudged tuckers arm been a bad lad have you and laughed tucker trained the telescope on the rough bearing the sun lancing from the sea stinging and blurring his vision he knew the sun was not to blame and he was grateful beyond any words he focused the lens slowly his body timed to the movement of the mast which swayed as if completely separate from the hull beneath perhaps the lookout was mistaken or his eyes were dazzled from hours of staring at the empty sea in its everchanging moods tucker tensed and murmured got you but for the man from yorkshires keen eyesight they would have missed it altogether a small vessel possibly a schooner but now mastless and low in the water the only sign of movement the torn remnants of her sails he handed the telescope to the lookout there she is whats left of her abandoned the lookout passed the telescope back no boats on board tucker leaned over and looked at the deck below nobody appeared to be gazing up at the foremast now but squire would want to know and the captain he remembered the emotionless voice one dozen lashes how had he felt about it if he had felt anything he slung the telescope across his shoulder and dug his foot into the first ratline the lookout said thanks and lifted his hand dont lose any sleep something in his voice made tucker turn back the bastard deserved it lieutenant squire was waiting and listened to his report and the description of the abandoned vessel without interruption then said nothing we can do but the captain will need to know about it ill take you to him midshipman walker piped up hes coming now sir adam waited without comment until tucker had repeated his description and said well alter course and intercept it might tell us something squire bit his lip a habit only others noticed could be dark when we find her sir he glanced up at the masthead pendant if shes still afloat bolitho stared across the open sea and then back at him at least we will have tried he turned toward the companion chartroom tell the first lieutenant squire touched his hat and beckoned to midshipman walker you heard what the captain said boy so go to it he heard bolithos voice on the companion ladder speaking with the surgeon either about the wounded man or the one who had stabbed him all the same to a sawbones but only one man made the real decisions and he was doing it now adam bolitho walked across the quarterdeck and saw vincent lower his telescope and turn toward him beyond him and deceptively close was the disabled schooner sternon for the first time since the lookout had signalled for assistance vincent said shes called moonstone sir and grimaced whats left of her adam leaned his hip against the rail and steadied the telescope as he adjusted to the decks uneven motion and the plunging of the other vessel he could calm himself as he had often done just by touching the engraving his uncles telescope like the old sword in the great cabin below strength or envy maybe both moonstone by god shes been fired on vincent said you know her sir adam shifted the glass carefully faces and groups of sailors staring at the drifting schooner as many had been doing for most of the day some waiting for the bell to chime from the forecastle for the first dog watch and beyond them the sea without the bluster and occasional whitecaps but sullen almost breathing he glanced at the sky and at the trailing masthead pendant they could not delay much longer he thought of the sealed orders in the strongbox below the scarlet lettering with all despatch he looked directly at vincent but he knew monteith was hovering by the gangway waiting to take over the watch and already peering around as if to find something neglected and demanding his attention he was aware of jago too arms folded and staring not at the schooner but astern outwardly relaxed but to adam it was like a warning like the stabbing in the galley or the epaulette sliced away by the invisible marksmans shot he recalled vincents question moonstone yes three years ago when i was with unrivalled in these same waters or near enough he raised the telescope again more slowly focusing on the broken spars and splintered bulwark feeling it freetown the antislavery patrols moonstone was under admiralty warrant liaison between our flag officer and the shore authorities vincent was listening but his eyes never left the schooner perhaps knowing her name had given her an identity and made it personal shes going under adam looked at the sky the wind was dropping and there was a ridge of cloud now on a horizon which had been as sharp as steel he said well board her he heard eight bells ring out and the slow response of feet and voices as the watch was relieved vincent did not move even when monteith strode across the deck and touched his hat to him but with his eyes on his captain vincent looked toward the starboard gangway where squire was pointing at something aboard the drifting schooner shaping it with his strong hands mr squire sir it sounded so formal that at any other time adam beckoned to jago whose response was immediate no you go mark i need to know but its my watch sir adam touched his arm take the gig and a few extra hands the jollyboat has shipped some water by the look of it jago was beside him standin by capn adam looked up at the sky and the loosely flapping topsails with all despatch the wind was dropping and had already backed a little onward might easily lose the time she had gained after her rough passage from biscay and they would get no thanks from the admiral when they eventually reached freetown least of all for boarding a crippled vessel which would likely capsize and founder at any moment he gazed across the water the schooner was rolling steeply in each trough showing her copper and the splintered holes where shots had smashed into the hull others had brought down most of her spars and rigging moonstone must have been a fast sailer like most of her breed then why had she not spread her canvas and run he said at the first sign of trouble mark vincent looked at him and nodded slowly i know sir one hand for the king the falls were manned and the gig was already at deck level as vincent turned and said im taking napier then climbed down the quarter as the call came to lower away the gig veered away and adam heard jago order the bowman to cast off unsteadily at first but more strongly as the oarsmen lay back on their looms the gig was already pulling toward moonstone and was soon out of sight as jago steered around onwards stern to take advantage of her lee but not before adam had seen vincent halfstanding in the sternsheets and the white midshipmans patches on the thwart below him david napier had proved his worth and courage before this and had paid for it but was that the only reason for vincents choice lieutenant squire had joined adam by the compass box and asked how long sir we will reef tops ls directly he looked again at the listing schooner an hour no longer he had seen the clouds closer now tell the bosun to have the jollyboat hauled alongside and bailed out squire touched his hat and strode heavily away in the gig vincent reached out and gripped napiers shoulder to steady himself as the tiller went over for the final approach and felt him tense as if waiting for the impact or a challenge the bowmen were ready with two grapnels in case one fell short back water starboard jagos voice broke the silence as the gig nudged alongside the schooners hull and another grapnel was hurled from aft vincent had boarded a good many vessels on one mission or another especially in the early days leading up to the battle of lissa but someone else had been giving the orders now with the moonstones side looming over him small things stood out her gunports were closed and had been newly painted carronades eight or ten of them enough to deter other small craft or wouldbe boarders were unmarked strangely at odds with the battering on the opposite side which must have dismasted her and now the silence only the occasional creak of the hulls and the sluice of water between them he could even hear the oarsmens heavy breathing after their pull away from onwards side jago said loudly standin by sir vincent looked at the bulwark and wanted to lick his lips they felt like sand but he reached out and seized a fistful of the broken rigging that trailed above the sealed ports and called be ready they all knew what to do if not he felt his knee grate on something metal and the breeze on his face and he was standing on the other vessels deck in seconds the boarding party had fanned out on either side of him forward and aft but it had seemed an age while he was standing here alone and onward was in sight again unmoving above her own reflection vincent examined the schooners guns all secured for sea even a solitary swivel gun mounted near the wheel was still covered and the flag locker was tidily packed with bunting someone said must have taken em by surprise napier had come across the deck a long splinter of wood in his hand blood sir vincent took it from him its blood right enough must have been a lot of it too jago was on his knees by the shattered bulwark fired up from a boat alongside he frowned as the abandoned wheel jerked slightly as if to invisible hands and indicated the deck or from ere as th bastard stepped aboard vincent joined him then reached out and touched jagos sinewy arm it makes sense that was well said coxn no signals made no attempt to attack or repel boarders jago was still looking at vincents hand on his sleeve means they must have known each other he scowled they was friends napier looked back at onward she had turned slightly her sails aback and flapping napier could see the gilded figurehead of the boy with his trident and the dolphin where he had sat and yarned with midshipman huxley who had joined the ship with him and who had shared so much of the elation and the pain do we return to onward sir vincent was also looking toward the frigate well carry out a search as ordered but i dont like the look of those clouds he added sharply we cant take moonstone in tow shes sinking anyway or soon will if a squall blows up he tugged out his watch napier had seen it lying on the chart table several times but had never been able to read the inscription inside the guard one hour less if possible ill go aftyou check the crews quarters he looked at jago first sign of bad weather sound the alarm and well clear the ship something came into his mind and he smiled no heroics eh jago said what about the galley sir vincent turned with his hands on the fallen foremast no then more quietly i shall go there now might tell us something he tugged open a small hatchway you keep an eye on the deck and the boat there was no response your gig remember jago breathed out noisily waiting for two seamen to accompany the first lieutenant bloody officers but he said aloud watch yer step yell out if you need elp he tapped napiers arm as he had seen vincent do and grinned an dont make a meal of it two of the gigs crew one carrying an axe the other with a shuttered lantern followed napier past a gaping hold it must have been opened to search for something or to remove it it was unreal hard to believe the vessel was dead and yet at each step napier leaned over the coaming and peered down only to see his own reflection in the trapped water beneath him head and shoulders framed against the sky the water was swilling back and forth with each uneven roll not deep anyway he saw a narrow ladder and climbed onto it and called to the two seamen take a look at that other hatch keep together one of them waved the other bared his teeth in a grin then napier felt the deck under his shoes slippery gritty with dirt from some previous cargo he winced as the hull swayed over again and the trapped water swept around his ankles it shocked him like an icy touch he waited for his nerves to settle he heard another hatch cover being dragged aside then slammed shut again there were piles of canvas propped against one side of the hold shining faintly soaked through they appeared to have been properly stackedspare sails or awningsbut had been tossed aside as the schooner was dismasted and began to submit to the ocean more thuds further away now not that far he reassured himself moonstone was less than half the frigates length must have been a fine little ship under sail to command probably a twin of the one named pickle which had been sent by viceadmiral collingwood to carry the vital and terrible news to england after trafalgar the great victory overshadowed by nelsons death he must ask drummond the bosun about it some time it was strange but he still saw joshua guthrie in his mind onwards old bosun who had been killed he flinched as something fell and scraped across the deck above perhaps a broken spar or part of the foremast it was only a matter of time before she foundered but how much of that time did they have he saw some of the canvas lurch over heard somebody shout and his companion answer glass breaking as it fell to the deck then silence the hull swayed again and napier moved carefully along the side of the hold and waited for the deck to right itself it did not he shouted anything lucas and heard the muffled reply nuthin yet anxious even scared join the others and he heard the thud of feet a hatch slamming people had died and they might never discover how or why it was pointless to risk any more vincent would be ready to leave for his own reasons one of the carelessly tied bundles of canvas thudded against his legs he told himself to remain calm but it was like a shouted warning the time was now he turned to look for the ladder it was in shadow or perhaps the light was going anyway he recalled what vincent had said about the clouds one squall bursting over moonstones deck and she would be on her way to the bottom the fabric of his breeches caught on the edge of something that must have been shielded by the canvas and other debris a small door or screen where tools or tackle might be stowed for unloading cargo he called wait lucas but there was no answer what was the point anyway he felt the water swilling across his feet again it seemed deeper go now he had known fear in the past this was different he simply could not move the deck lurched again perhaps he cried out but there was only silence any second now and then he heard it at first he thought it was only in his mind the last cry like when audacity had gone down but then he heard it again a tapping a scraping hesitant but close human he was scrabbling against the little door now tugging at the rough clip leaving blood on the frame but feeling nothing only a wild desperation water was surging around his legs this could be the final plunge but it was all out of reach unreal only the faint sound was vital another coaming and he almost fell he tried to wedge the door open otherwise he would be in complete darkness there was very little light anyway more fallen canvas and coils of rope sodden papers floating like leaves clinging to his hands as he steadied himself the furtive scrabbling had stopped if it had ever existed maybe it was in an adjoining space or hold there was a muffled echo as if something had reverberated against the hull and he knew it was a shot from onward from another world the prearranged recall he pushed his shoulder against the door but it did not shift if only then he froze unable to think or breathe as something groped at his thigh and fastened to his wet clothing like a claw and it was alive he saw the face for the first time only the eyes catching the feeble light when the door moved slightly napier struggled to move closer until their faces were almost touching felt the shocked gasp of pain as he tried to push the debris away from the twisted limbs heard the ragged breathing the coat was torn and matted not only with water but with blood and napier could see the faint shine of gilt buttons when his hands fumbled against the icecold fingers he felt the pistol they still gripped it would never fire again napier leaned closer overwhelmed by the mans pain and the smell of the filth in which he had been sprawled how could he have hoped and lived so long after all he had seen and suffered the other hand fell against napiers wrist clutched it and for a few more seconds clung like iron knew youd come he coughed and swallowed then was silent again only the eyes seemed alive wild napier thought he heard a shout maybe the gig was about to cast off leave him he felt no fear he asked quietly how long have you and got no further feeling the hand move to his throat his face limp now but determined tell them matey an dont forget see he coughed blood but his fingers had tightened knew youd come see napier heard another spar slither across the deck but he did not move tell me the eyes were closed now but the voice seemed stronger how could that be i should have known but too late who did this napier felt the hand try to respond but it was still only the eyes were alive and the lips no quarter one by one but i knew youd come napier knew it was too late for both of them this was all they had left and he could not move soon now he felt the fingers tighten again remember the name tell them there was silence and napier heard another sound the trickle of water over the coaming lapping against their legs the face moved almost touching his he could feel the cold rasping breath ballantyne he was trying to squeeze his hand say it napier repeated ballantyne he felt the hand relax and knew that he was now alone there was a crash more loose gear falling in the hold and he stood waiting numbly for the end then he was gasping his mind reeling as the door was wrenched aside and he was being dragged clear of the floating debris luke jago exclaimed this is no place for you so out of it my lad napier was on his feet staring back jago was bending over the body the gilt buttons moving as he thrust his hand between them the eyes fixed and gazing across his shoulders gone poor devil he took napiers arm sharply and together they headed toward the ladder only then did napier realise that the water was around his knees what can i do jago stared up at the sky and the thickening layers of cloud and took a deep breath pray if you believes in it they were both on deck swaying together like two drunks recovering from a lively run ashore vincent was leaning against the bulwark alone with his back to the sea he snapped wed almost given you up and gestured briskly into the boat with you jago waited for them to climb down into the gig and followed the grapnels had already been removed and the bowmen were ready to cast off napier stared at the schooners side trying to marshal his thoughts shove off forrard out oars he could sense jagos nearness and rocklike calm as he took control of men and oars someone shouted shes goin lads napier saw moonstone start to turn on her side showing her scarred deck and the open hold where he would still be trapped but for jagos timely arrival one of the broken masts slid down the deck and he heard it crash against that same bulwark dragging tangled rigging and canvas after it he gripped his wrist and could still feel the dying mans desperation hear his voice the urgency and the despair the rudder squeaked and he twisted round to see jago swing the tiller bar eyes steady as he gauged the moment there was a rumble like distant thunder and sharper sounds as the hull continued to heel over toward them carronades which had not been fired in moonstones defense crashing free their great weight uncontrolled and speeding her last moments and suddenly she was gone the gig pitching only briefly as the wash subsided napier rubbed his eyes with the back of his hand when he looked again he saw onward her sails aback and livid against the low clouds waiting the ocean was deep here and in his mind he could see the schooner still on her way down into eternal darkness he gripped his wrist again and knew the memory would never leave him nor would he allow himself to forget it was a pledge dangerous rendezvous in cornwall it had been a hard winter so far but on this february morning the sky above falmouth was clear and sunlit at odds with further inland where the trees were still etched white with frost not much wind but what there was felt like a honed blade there were plenty of people about muffled up against the cold and the hardier types behaving as if it were a spring day a few all women waited by the fishermens wharf but most of the boats were at sea or empty alongside all the usual idlers waited on the waterfront passing the time of day or waiting to share a drink with friends a servant from the nearby inn had just been seen rolling an empty barrel across the courtyard a welcome signal to the onlookers there had not been much movement in the harbour or carrick roads but this day was different and they were discussing the newcomer critically a kings ship something of a rarity of late with the exception of revenue cutters and naval supply vessels many of the idlers were old sailors themselves discharged or thrown on the beach for a dozen different reasons many of them loudly proclaimed they were glad to be free of the navy and its harsh discipline or various officers they had served in the past bad food and poor pay and the constant risk of injury or death but they were usually the first on the waterfront whenever a sail was sighted she was a brig one of the navys maids of all work busier than ever now with so many of the heavier vessels being paid off or scrapped she was shortening sail as she turned slightly toward her anchorage tiny figures spread out along the upper yards of her two masts the canvas not even flapping as it caught the sunlight like her hull the sails shone like glass and were hardened with salt and ice a fine sight but to some of the old hands watching from the shore she meant hazards as well as beauty fisting and kicking the frozen canvas into submission so that it could be furled and reefed was dangerous enough but one slip and you would fall headlong onto the deck below or into the sea alongside where even if you could swim she was still turning her sails almost aback soon to be hidden by the old battery wall above the harbour only her masthead pendant showed to mark her anchorage one man who had brought a telescope had seen the new arrivals name and called out merlin but he was alone his friends had drifted away commander francis troubridge turned his back to the sun and stared at the land the nearness of it with the wind dropping to a light breeze the approach had seemed endless he would become used to it with time and more experience he had a good ships company some had served aboard merlin since she had first commissioned one hundred and thirty all told hard to believe he thought when you considered she was only one hundred and five feet in length teamwork and companionship were vital he looked at the houses one above another on the steep hillside but he could not see the church as he had the last time he had been in falmouth only three months ago so much had happened since he glanced forward where men were stowing away loose gear sliding down backstays racing one another to the deck a few were slower quietly cursing the scrapes and grazes inflicted by the frozen canvas which could tear out a mans fingernails no matter how experienced a sailor he was troubridge had come to know the names of most and remembered them something he had learned as a flag lieutenant when the admiral had always expected him to know everything that was over he was merlins captain now and she was his first command and to most of these men he was still a stranger it was up to him standin by sir he raised his hand above his head and heard the cry from the forecastle let go the splash of the anchor and the immediate response as the cable followed it men hastening it on its way and ready for any stoppages there were none he had been in command for almost a year and with previous experience mostly at sea he should have been used to it and prepared for anything but at moments like this it was always new different beyond pride if anything what troubridge felt was excitement all secure sir turpin his first lieutenant was a square muscular man who could move quickly when it suited him from watching the anchor drop from the cathead alert for any mishap then aft again just minutes later he was a born sailor with a strong weathered face and clear blue eyes that seemed to belong to someone else looking out through a mask at everything around him and now at his captain turpin had always served in small ships and had originally been promoted from the lower deck when troubridge had first stepped aboard turpin had conducted him over every inch of the ship pointing out every store and cabin space messdeck magazine even the galley proud even possessive he was about ten years older than his captain but if he cherished any resentment he had not revealed it merlins previous commanding officer had been put ashore taken suddenly ill with a fever he had picked up on the antislavery patrols he had since died but as is the way in the navy nobody now mentioned his name her second lieutenant john fairbrother was younger than troubridge and seemed to look upon merlin merely as a steppingstone to promotion the brig also carried a sailing master who like turpin was very experienced with smaller vessels and had served on three oceans and surprisingly for her size merlin boasted a surgeon edwin obrien although now with peace and the brig assigned to the channel fleet his might remain a minor role it might have been different on the slavery patrols or hunting pirates in the mediterranean where in a ship often sailing alone a surgeons skill was paramount the four of them made up merlins little wardroom she carried no midshipmen or royal marines and ceremonial was kept to a minimum turpin said we are here to await orders sir it sounded like a statement but troubridge had come to accept that the lieutenant hardly ever seemed to write anything down he carried everything in his head troubridge stared across the water and saw the church for the first time since that day the church of king charles the martyr where he had had the honour of taking the lovely lowenna up the aisle to become adam bolithos wife turpin broke into his dreamlike reminiscence with a blunt memories sir the blue eyes gave nothing away but no doubt he was remembering that the admiral had granted special leave so troubridge could attend the wedding he nodded yes good ones will you be going ashore sir were to remain here for five days as you know if nothing changes well take on board two admiralty officials like our last mission im afraid not very exciting turpin said sharply better n being laid up the slightest pause sir it was the first hint of envy and troubridge was surprised by it if only someone yelled boat headin our way sir turpin grunted mail boat see to it parker troubridge walked across the deck past the big double wheel and polished compass box and reached the side in time to see the mail boat already pulling away from the entry port somebody waving his arm and calling back to merlins side party a seaman was coiling some rope and avoided his eyes when troubridge moved past him maybe it was always like this adam bolitho had mentioned the loneliness of command trying to prepare him turpins shadow was beside him again only two letters sir dont know were here yet i reckon he thrust one out for you sir thank you troubridge walked into the shadow of the mast knowing turpin was watching him he broke the seal not a letter but a card undated he had never seen her handwriting so how could he have known it was from heri saw you anchor this morning welcome backvisit us if you canlowenna he walked back across the deck and gazed at the houses and the church tower she must have heard from someone maybe the coastguard that merlin was arriving in falmouth today and had made a visit to the headland or here to the waterfront to watch them anchor she might even be over there now he felt for the card again she was just being courteous and was probably always surrounded by friends troubridge replaced the card in its torn envelope and slid it into his pocket visit us what else could she have said if she only knew everything all right sir he waved and said something insignificant and turpin turned away to deal with a supply boat which was about to come alongside what he had hoped for even dreamed about and apparently she had thought about him too they were good friends for all sorts of reasons troubridge recalled exactly when he had wanted to tell her that he would always be ready to come to her if she were ever in need in the church that day before the ceremony he had got no further than if ever and she had touched his lips with her fingers scented with autumnal flowers i know and i thank you francis he had never forgotten the time he and adam bolitho had broken down the door of a studio and found lowenna standing over the man who had tried to rape her the gown ripped from her shoulders a brass candlestick poised over him i would have killed him and he had felt his own finger on the trigger of the pistol he was carrying he touched the card in his pocket like hearing her voice turpin had rejoined him can i do anything sir ill need a boat in half an hour im going ashore back before sunset send word to the revenue pier if you need me beforehand turpin glanced around conspiratorially as if someone might be listening somethin wrong sir troubridge was staring after the mail boat still pulling steadily toward the waterfront something personal i must leave a message and thank you mathias for your help turpins leathery face revealed surprise as well as concern at having been allowed to share something he sensed was private and also at the casual use of his first name then his face broke into a grin leave it with me sir he gestured to a bosuns mate and added quietly watch your back eh it was perhaps as close as they had ever been but it was a beginning he would go below and write a short note to have taken up to the big grey house after the flagship merlins cabin seemed small but it was a refuge and it was his turpin had probably used it himself while he was waiting for the new commanding officer or hoping for his own promotion watch your back but the immediate enemy was guilt troubridge wedged his elbow against the seat as the vehicle lurched into another deep rut hidden by one of the countless puddles left by heavy overnight rain everything seemed to have happened so quickly that his mind was still reluctant to cope a message in a strong scholarly hand which he guessed belonged to dan yovell the bolitho steward whom he had met several times had been brought out to merlin the boatman had departed without waiting for any response a carriage will be sent and despite the weather and the roads it was waiting for him on time another face he remembered young matthew the coachman who had driven them to the church that day young matthew because his father also matthew had been coachman at the estate before him his father had died long since but the nickname remained although he was probably the oldest man there the carriage was a landau new and beautifully sprung troubridge had seen some of them in london and his admiral and lady bethune had used one while in residence there the landau had twin hoods which folded right back and allowed the occupant to see and be seen if the weather was kind enough the hoods were made of greasy harnessleather which had a strong smell when wet like now once again he tried to grapple with his thoughts but events were now out of his hands there had also been a curt letter from the two admiralty officials their arrival would be a day later than expected sunday at noon equally curtly it had stressed no ceremonial he had expected turpin to be pleased about that but if anything he had taken it as an insult be different if we were a ship of the line with a guard of honour i suppose troubridge thought of it when he was leaving the ship the trill of calls turpin doffing his hat and the boat alongside oars tossed ready to carry him ashore would he ever become used to it take it for granted as his right he had heard adam bolitho say that if you did you were ready for the beach or burial once he had looked back at the brig rolling easily in the offshore wind small but able to give a good account of herself if challenged she carried sixteen big thirtytwo pounders eight of them carronades he had studied her figurehead oblivious to the stroke oarsman watching him the carver had produced a fine example of a merlin falcon wings spread beneath the bowsprit beak open and ready to pounce like a young eagle troubridge could understand and share turpins reaction to the message he saw two farm workers grin and wave mockingly as the landau splashed past them the same two had overtaken them earlier when the deeply rutted track had slowed the horses to a walking pace there were a few cottages now and he noticed that most of the frost had been melted by the rain two cows by a gate breath smoking and someone tying up dead branches squinting at the vehicle clattering past then around the side of a low hill the sea like water against a dam never far away and in the blood of the people who lived here the landau stopped and he heard young matthew speaking to his horses calming them as a heavy farm wagon splashed by wheels almost touching theirs greetings were exchanged but even here he had noticed that young matthew kept a musket close to hand he had said matteroffactly this is called hanger lane zur didnt get that name for nothin troubridge was unarmed this was cornwall he saw an inn lying back from the road the spaniards someone had mentioned it to him it had been thomas herrick sir richard bolithos oldest friend he was now rearadmiral retired he had shared the carriage too en route to the wedding herrick had stayed at the inn and had spoken well of it just as well it was the only accommodation around they were turning now and young matthew leaned over from his box and peered through the window i have to stop and pick up somethin zur his eyes crinkled bit too early when i came by this mornin two figures had already hurried from somewhere and young matthew waved to them he was no stranger here apparently he jumped down and stamped his boots on the cobbles horses can do with a drink too he opened the door and waited as troubridge stepped down wincing as the feeling returned to his legs and buttocks they roads do make a lot of folk seasick zur troubridge noticed his arm was near enough to assist if required and was reminded of his discreet understanding when the onearmed herrick had arrived at the church and the exchange of glances between the aging rearadmiral and the coachman appreciation maybe more than that i think you should step inside zur they always has a good blaze goin on days like this he looked at the sky and some rain spilled from his hat wind do have changed usve seen the worst of it he stumped beside troubridge to the door and called to someone else wont be long zur i hope troubridge paused inside the dark entrance to get his bearings the inn was old and had been added to and altered over the years perhaps bolithos had paused here over the centuries on their way to join a ship or return to one like me can i fetch ee somethin zur thank you no ill be going directly the inn servant wore an apron that touched the floor and had a feather duster protruding from his pocket like a tail then sit over ere and get yer blood movin again it was a highbacked seat almost opposite one of the fires young matthew was right and there was probably more than one good blaze going today he was aware of voices coming from a larger room close by maybe they were waiting for a local coach or had horses stabled here he realised that the man in the apron was hovering nearby and said perhaps i will have a drink something warm taken care of zur here in a trice troubridge relaxed slowly the heat was doing its work he felt as if he had just ended a watch on deck young matthew had thought of everything it was brandy with a measure of hot water he felt it sting his tongue and knew there was not much of the latter he would have to reward him in some way and yet not offend someone said that was the bolitho carriage just drove in homeward bound too must have been up an about bloody early i hear capn bolitho is at sea again a different voice but troubridge was now fully alert just got wed too what does she do with erself while es away there was a harsh laugh well you know what they say while the cats away the mice will play i could tell you things about that lady the speaker must have shaken his head no but not for much longer ill have her beggin for it two things happened at once troubridge was on his feet and across to the connecting doorway his eyes blazing shut your filthy mouth you drunken bastard or ill do it for you at the same instant a door from the kitchen opened unhurriedly and young matthew paused to put a covered basket on the floor by his feet ready when you are zur but he was looking at the loudmouth surprised to find you here mister flinders with all that work goin on at your estate he looked directly at troubridge and stooped to pick up his hat which had fallen when he had jumped to his feet finish your drink first zur troubridge stared at the other man flinders it meant nothing and quite suddenly he was icily calm as if he were watching the flash of gunfire and waiting for the fall of shot he picked up the glass and said ill share it and threw the contents in the other mans face then he unfastened his boatcloak and folded it over his arm replaced his hat and tugged it down over his forehead he could hear deep breathing and somebody retching in another part of the inn but still nobody uttered a word outside the rain appeared to have stopped so that the puddles in the innyard seemed to glitter like fragments of broken glass they walked to the landau without looking back and troubridge said abruptly thank you im sorry about the drink one of the horses shook its head and rattled its harness recognition or impatience young matthew patted its neck and ears as he passed and said easy trooper wem goin home now then he opened the door and looked at troubridge with only the hint of a smile what drink was that zur the road seemed in better condition hereabouts and the horses were soon trotting briskly and troubridge noted gratefully avoiding the ruts there were several people about and they overtook two farm workers plodding in the same direction surely not the same two when so much had happened and might have happened they had arrived the curved driveway and the imposing grey house exactly as he remembered them even the old weathervane with the silhouette of father time against the sky young matthews boots hit the ground as he jumped down from his box and others were appearing to hold the horses and take the basket from the spaniards or merely out of curiosity there was another vehicle on the driveway coachman and groom standing beside it obviously waiting to depart troubridge breathed out slowly for a moment but the doors had opened and he saw nancy lady roxby waiting to greet him her arms outstretched as he took off his hat and bowed over her hand she was smiling perhaps a little emotional as he stooped to kiss the hand and clasped him around the shoulders francis my dear welcome back she offered her cheek and added command suits you he must have glanced at the other carriage and she shrugged unexpected visitor just leavingat last then she took his arm and together they walked into the spacious hallway some features he did not remember most of it was like yesterday and nancy you could never forget no longer young she was sir richard bolithos sister but she had a beauty that never dimmed and a wit to match it she would deny both but as troubridge had seen for himself heads always turned when she passed come and talk to me francis the lady of the house will not be much longer she guided him into a large room that overlooked a garden and a line of leafless trees it was well furnished but his eyes were immediately drawn to a gilded harp which stood with a stool beside it he had heard about the harp and imagined it often when he turned nancy was seated on a couch looking up at him sit down francis she gestured to a chair get the chill out of your bones i know too well what that road is like he had not noticed how discreetly she had steered him toward the fire she was suddenly serious even angry one hand clenched into a small fist i heard you had words with our mr flinders this morning she did not wait for confirmation this is cornwall remember bad news rides a fast horse she pushed some hair from her forehead the gesture made her look even younger i was told that he works on the estate maam did work he was my steward she smiled thinly i gave him his marching orders this morning i came here to tell lowenna but the carriage had already gone to collect you otherwise she glanced at the windows well the gentleman is leaving about time too there was a tartness in her voice that reminded him strangely of her nephew adam bolitho troubridge heard the wheels on the driveway and someone calling out to the coachman i shall leave you both aloneyou must have so much to talk about i shall see you again presently i hope francis she broke off as the door swung open it was lowenna she exclaimed im so sorry to keep you waiting like this jenna told me you had arrived and in all that foul weather too and look at me troubridge took her hand and kissed it she was wearing a long informal gown tied about her waist with a ribbon sash oddly her feet were bare he simply wouldnt go so many questions she turned her eyes from nancy to troubridge how lovely to see you francis how long will you be in falmouth he felt he was the only one in the room she smiled again and touched her lips with her finger ssh i know youre not supposed to tell any one nancy looked at lowennas robe with what troubridge thought was disapproval did he lowenna laughed no he only wanted to see my shoulders to make a sketch or something she walked to the open fire and shivered come into the study francis theres a proper blaze there nervous excited shy he did not know her well enough to tell you dont know her at all she said i hated keeping you waiting she walked across the entrance hall her bare feet soundless on the cold floor and opened the library door that was samuel proctor sir samuel as he is now troubridge looked curiously around the big panelled room at dark portraits and paintings of ships menofwar in action he said ive seen some of his work fine pictures she turned and stood with her back to the fire smiling you are full of surprises francis he was a friend of my guardians or claims he was she bent down to pick up a piece of cloth before using it to cover another painting which stood against the bookcase that lined one wall he had already seen it the perfect body her long hair across one shoulder and the harp she was saying he painted lady hamilton poor emma she never lived to see it she looked up and into his eyes her chin lifted like that moment in the church pride or defiance he wants me to sit for him are you pleased honoured she touched his arm i want to hear about you francis your new ship everything and then she looked away just as suddenly i didnt want it to be like this i was told about this morning lady roxby she did not answer i had told young matthew to stop at the spaniards to collect some cheese they make their own and i remembered how you enjoyed it when you were last here she faced him again and he could see her breathing it was some filth about me wasnt it she reached out and touched his lips that intoxicating gesture i know elizabeth saw it before i did she said he was always watching she shuddered he said quietly i would have killed him she gazed at him her expression exactly as it had been captured in the painting she repeated slowly lovely to see you francis and drew in her breath as he put his arms around her dont im not made of stone but she could feel his hands on her back her spine and knew the gown had slipped from her left shoulder she tensed as he kissed it like a fantasy or a fever not the heat from the fire but their own she heard herself say stop and then in the next breath kiss me she was pressed against him their mouths making words impossible their tongues sealing their embrace he was kissing her shoulder again and she had felt his hand against her skin her breast they stood quite still their bodies a solitary shadow against the books somewhere a bell was ringing and there was a sound of hooves she buried her face against his shoulder a single horse but she could not move now a mans voice she did not recognise and a womans young jenna she stood back and covered her bare shoulder her gown was dishevelled and the ribbon sash unfastened he said let me but she could not look at him she opened the door and saw jenna standing with a man in uniform his boots and spurs caked with mud who is it jenna how could she sound so calm the girl bobbed her head courierfor the commander maam troubridge walked past her seeing the couriers eyes flick over his uniform before he handed him a sealed envelope he did not know the handwriting the seal was enough he said quietly i must return to the ship he did not even say my ship nancy was here now glancing from one to the other she had seen lowennas gown he hoped she could not imagine the rest troubridge said a change of plan my passengers are arriving a day earlier after all nancy said easily to the courier something hot to drink before you go why thankee m lady he clumped away lowenna said ill tell young matthew if i sent you with any one else hed never forgive me it was over and she thought she could hear harry flinders laughing flagship captain adam bolitho climbed from the companion and paused to prepare his eyes for the glare the morning watch was only an hour old but the sun reflected from the sea was almost blinding after the chartroom but for the angle it could have been noon a glance aloft to the masthead pendant no longer limp or curling above the canvas but streaming its full length pointing the way ahead the topsails too were responding again not full or straining like other times but answering well to wind and rudder will it last for four days the wind had been their enemy veering and backing or falling away altogether a mockery rather than a challenge hardly a watch passed without all hands being called as onward changed tack even during the night when even an experienced sailor is never at his best adam stared along the length of the ship and felt the wind slight as it was pressing the shirt against his back like the air his skin was already warm and clammy as jago had remarked over his razor best to keep dressed down while you can capn most of the men working on or above deck were stripped to the waist some badly burned by sun and wind and despite the early hour there were several of them loitering on the gangways peering ahead or pointing at the vast span of land that reached out on either bow as far as the eye could see at first only a long unwavering shadow unmoving beyond reach but now after two days of doubt and uncertainty it was reality measureless not merely land but a continent adam glanced at the sails again and thought he saw one of the topmen pointing at something grinning or swearing he could not tell but he felt it shared it at moments like this we are one company he knew that vincent was standing with his arms folded observing the men around the wheel and compass box it was his watch although he and his captain had met a few times when every one had been mustered for another alteration of course like strangers in the night this was different as first lieutenant vincent would be on his feet and dealing with everything from mooring the ship to any ceremonial required vincent turned now as someone gave a quiet cheer but seemed to visibly relax as men moved aside to let another find a place at the nettings it was the young assistant cook lord with one of the surgeons crew hovering at his side the bandages gleamed in the hot sunlight and adam could sense his surprise even confusion as the way was cleared for him there were grins and jokes too lord looked steadily at the land unable to respond perhaps the emotion was too much it was his first day on deck since the stabbing it gave vincent time to cross the quarterdeck and touch his hat to adam holding steady sir west nor west well anchor in the forenoon if this holds he glanced at the thin plume of greasy smoke from the galley funnel good thing we piped all hands an hour early adam smiled theyve done well he saw some of the first to be called appearing on deck yawning and looking curiously at the land as they began to stack their rolled hammocks in the nettings a bosuns mate making sure that there were no errors to spoil the array he added quietly and so have you mark vincent walked to the compass box and back and said only d you know the admiral at freetown sir adam saw a fish leap in the ships shadow not a shark this time he was still thinking of the stricken schooner moonstone maybe vincent was too rearadmiral langley only by name im afraid there have been several changes since i was last here to all accounts vincent nodded slowly theyll all be hungry for news wanting to know whats happening at home adam looked toward the spreading panorama of green and felt the sun on his neck like a hot breath and this was early news from home the admiral might be watching onward right now through his telescope if he allowed himself to appear so eager he thought of the sealed orders with all despatch and after their delivery what next take on supplies and fresh water and then back to plymouth he saw the cooks assistant looking at the galley funnel and the surgeons mate shaking his head not yet you didnt have to hear them speak he looked again most of the hammocks had been lashed and stowed and one of the last men to stand away from the nettings was throwing his head back and giving a huge yawn he froze as he realised that he was eye to eye with his captain adam raised a casual hand and smiled and saw the seaman abruptly bob his head before hurrying away the calls shrilled hands to breakfast and clean adam shaded his eyes and said you go below too mark well all be busy enough soon he saw vincent rub his chin and then nod thank you sir ill not take a moment if youre sure adam heard the companion close and walked to the quarterdeck rail gazing toward the shore even without a telescope he could see some small local vessels far away like dried leaves floating against the unmoving backdrop one day vincent would understand that at a moment like this a captain needed to be alone with his ship the two midshipmen stood side by side on the forecastle as the land now alive with detail continued to reach out and embrace the ship despite the sounds of spars and rigging which most sailors took for granted as part of their daily lives the silence was unnerving and a moment before someone had gasped with alarm as the first strokes of eight bells had sounded from the nearby belfrey david napier nudged his friends arm with his elbow and felt him respond lieutenant squire stood stolidly with his hands clasped behind him big feet apart watching the guardboat which had pulled out to greet onward on her final approach and had taken station directly ahead the wind had held after all but the pace seemed painfully slow under the lee of the land the gunner had already been on deck but no salute was required he had grinned theyre not out of their sacks yet even his voice had seemed louder than usual midshipman huxley murmured theres the flagship dave his britannic majestys ship medusa was a smart thirdrate a twodecker of seventyfour guns she did not compare with the massive ships of the line but here she seemed to dominate the anchorage most of the other vessels were much smaller cutters two brigantines and one schooner napier heard huxley mutter shes like he did not finish neither of them needed reminding especially napier the memory of moonstone still took him unawares in the night watches or when some casual remark brought some part of it back to life like now he looked aft and saw the first lieutenant standing by the captain pointing up at the topsail yards where seamen stood ready to shorten or make more sail if the wind roused itself or dropped altogether did vincent ever think about it that more could have been done if anything he had avoided mentioning it napier thought of the captain he had seen the sharks and signalled the recall immediately but for that he cupped his hands over his eyes and stared across the water toward medusa she was moored alongside a pier or wooden jetty the rearadmirals flag drooping from her mizzen and he could see a few figures working on deck and the sun reflecting on a telescope lieutenant squire said suddenly we shall rig windsls as soon as we anchor be like an oven tweendecks otherwise is that what the flagships doing sir that was huxley as serious as ever squire grunted not sure napier looked away from the slowmoving schooner maybe medusas preparing for sea somebody yelled from aft and squire strode to the side and gestured to some of the anchor party but he still managed to crack a grin if the flagship went to sea that whole bloody pier would collapse he clapped one of the seamen on the shoulder as he was gaping at the great anchor hanging from its cathead ready for a run ashore knocker or are you too young for it there were several raucous laughs and one of the younger seamen took up squires mood wot are the girls like ere sir squire looked at the two midshipmen and winked only one way to find out just as quickly he was serious again stand by forrard and warn the hands below napier saw the guardboat turning slightly oars motionless and someone holding up the blue flag he thought of the charts the countless pencilled calculations the hundreds of miles logged and recorded all culminating in this final position marked by a blue flag he nudged huxley again its probably still snowing in falmouth huxley gave a rare smile my father always said he stopped and withdrew into silence a habit napier had noticed that very first day when they had joined onward together he still recovering from the loss of his ship and huxley brooding over his fathers courtmartial and suicide he said gently tell me simon what did your father used to say and for a moment he thought he had broken an unspoken promise then huxley answered steadily my father said a good navigator measured distance by the number of ships biscuits consumed each day he faltered but he was smiling sorry about that and the smile remained napier stared up at the yards and the topmen spread out along them and guessed his newly promoted friend tucker would be watching them too lieutenant squire was saying quiet enough must all be asleep aboard the flagship he beckoned to napier my respects to the first lieutenant and tell him he stopped as another voice came from aft signal from flag sir captain repair on board let go squire leaned over the side as onwards anchor dropped from its cathead and felt the spray across his face like rain it was almost as cold on his heated skin mud and sand swirled to the surface as the cable took the strain he signalled to the quarterdeck and saw vincent acknowledge it it was over but squire knew from long experience that it was also just beginning attention on the upper deck face to starboard then the prolonged trill of calls in salute for the captain and seconds later or so it seemed the gig pulled smartly away from the side squire straightened his back automatically and felt napier move up beside him he saw the sun glinting on the oars and then on the captains gold epaulettes as he sat stiffly upright in the sternsheets he seemed to be looking up at onwards figurehead or the men on the forecastle maybe at napier it must be difficult for both of them captain and middy more than any one to show any sign of friendship or familiarity would be seen as favouritism or bias by those eager to seize on such things squire peered across at the flagship and thought he heard the blare of a trumpet neither captain was wasting any time at the gigs tiller luke jago watched the steady stroke of oars and waited for it to settle into a rhythm that satisfied him everything smart and clean the crew dressed in their chequered shirts and straw hats he envied them he was wearing his jacket with the gilt buttons and was already sweating badly he glanced at the captain in his best uniform even the proud epaulettes looked heavy on his shoulders jago stared past the stroke oarsmans head at the flagships mainmast alert for any drift that might require a shift of rudder there was none a good crew he grinned to himself an a good coxswain he thought of lieutenant monteith who had been pompously inspecting all the boats crews as soon as the anchor had hit the seabed always remember a ship is judged by her boats skill and smartness speak for themselves jago had heard a seaman mutter then let em but he had pretended not to hear the third lieutenant seemed to thrive on his unpopularity and jago suspected that it was not only with the lower deck he felt the captain shift his position and knew he was looking astern at his ship a strange feeling it always was adam bolitho shaded his eyes with one hand against the fierce glare reflecting from the anchorage he could still see the tiny figures working aloft on onwards upper yards ensuring all the sails were neatly furled to vincents satisfaction he half smiled and to his captains he tried not to pluck his damp shirt away from his skin it was the same one he had been wearing when they had begun the approach to freetown even his slight unsteadiness climbing down into the gig had warned him he would have to watch his step when he went ashore it would be the first time since plymouth he glanced at the stroke oarsman and saw him look away hurriedly and before that falmouth if only he looked ahead to the flagship medusa not unlike athena in which he had been bethunes flag captain smartly painted in her black and white livery and shining like glass in the glare all her gunports were open but without windsails hoisted there would be little ventilation between decks with the ship not even swinging at anchor maybe she was preparing for sea he dismissed the idea there were several lighters alongside one another and he could just see a small stage a flake hanging over the quarter probably so that some repairs could be carried out he murmured to jago weve done this a few times luke and his voice was almost lost in the regular creak of oars but jago never seemed to miss anything unless he wanted to he did not take his eyes from the approach he had seen a telescope or two being trained on his gig jago answered calmly be doin it when its your flag up there bein saluted capn he sounded completely serious the cry echoed across the water boat ahoy jago judged the moment then cupped his hands his elbow on the tillerbar onward adam felt the sword hilt pressing against his leg it had been polished by morgan the cabin servant and like his dress uniform coat had been waiting for him he had told himself that he must never take these small acts beyond the call of duty for granted too many were guilty of that oars adam shifted the sword again he had never forgotten the tale of a captain who had tripped over his own sword under similar circumstances and had fallen into the sea he had been a midshipman at the time and they had all laughed uproariously about it now the oars were tossed the bowmen ready to make fast as the flagships side loomed over them only one deck higher than onward but it seemed like a cliff there was the entry port with two sideboys waiting below it voices the sound of a solitary call then total silence adam stood up and half turned as jago handed him the sealed package he began to climb the orders pressed firmly beneath his arm and gripping a hand rope to steady himself one slip now and it would be the story of how adam bolitho fell into the sea at freetown but the smile eluded him he could smell food and recalled that he had not eaten since midnight he saw a line of feet and boots as wellroyal marinesand heard the sudden bark of commands he was still unused to these honours for himself then the piercing squeal of calls heels clicking together and the distant shouting of commands he stepped through the entry port and faced aft doffing his hat as the sounds of the salute died away a shaft of sunlight from the opposite side of the deck blinded him and the uniforms scarlet or blue like his own seemed to blur and merge he almost lost his balance but a hand reached out here let me take that and he heard what might have been a dry chuckle its safe with me captain adam bolitho adam saw the hand gripping his arm now strong and sunburned like the man so many memories crowding into seconds good and bad which neither time nor distance could dispel it was captain james tyacke who had done and given so much almost his life and who had become one of sir richard bolithos firmest friends as his flag captain in frobisher he had been with him when bolitho had fallen to a french marksman four years ago it was not possible tyacke was handing the sealed orders to a tall sergeant of marines guard em with your life right and the man smiled gravely as he saluted somewhere there was the pipe hands carry on with your work and tyacke was saying i hoped it was you as soon as i was told that onward was in sight but i wasnt sure till i saw you in the glass that you were still in command he gripped adams arm by god its good to see you come aft with me the admirals ashore but hell be back about noon a lieutenant was hovering by the gangway and tyacke paused to speak with him gesturing toward the entry port now deserted except for the watchkeepers and a sentry it was the first time adam had seen the scarred side of his face since he had stepped aboard maybe like most people he had been subconsciously avoiding it for both their sakes tyacke then a lieutenant had been wounded at aboukir baythe battle of the nile as it was officially called he had been stationed on the lower gundeck when an explosion had transformed the confined world of loadrun outfiresponge outreload into an inferno tyacke had lived many had not now only the overwhelming victory against the old enemy was remembered but james tyacke would never forget one side of what had been a handsome face was deeply tanned like the strong hands the other was lifeless like melted wax that his eye had survived was a miracle the devil with half a face the slavers used to call him he turned now and said ive sent word for your boats crew to be taken care of i see youve got the same fierce coxn glad about that they walked aft together then tyacke halted and gazed across the water toward the anchored frigate fine ship adam he softened the emphasis with a smile i envy you they walked on adam could feel his shoes sticking to the deckseams and it was still the forenoon he said i saw that you were lowering the windsls tyacke glanced at him but did not pause flagship adam the admiral considers em unsightly they reached the shade of the poop and adam saw two royal marines one a corporal checking the contents of a box he pitied them in their heavy uniforms but to be dressed otherwise would be unsightly too he guessed the corporal cleared his throat and said beg your pardon sir adam recognised him price ginger price am i right the corporal nodded and grinned momentarily at a loss for words then he said not quite so ginger now sir but i aint never forgotten the old unrivalled they were both gazing after the two captains as tyacke said quietly youre very like him y know adam he did not need to elaborate and adam was moved by it he had already noticed that the flag captains aiguillette tyacke wore was quite tarnished compared with the other lace on his uniform coat it might have been the same one he had been wearing on that fateful day the cabin door was closed behind them although adam had not noticed any one in attendance he must be more tired than he imagined tyacke turned framed against the broad stern windows and the sword too i want to hear all about you his eyes rested briefly on the sealed orders which had been laid on a table he must be wondering how they might affect the entire command or his own ship his life but all he said was from england then he smiled freely it does me good to see you againi cant tell you how much and i want to apologise for dragging you aboard when your anchord hardly touched the bottom i wanted to meet and talk with you before anybody else hauled you away youve been a flag captain yourselfyou wont need telling he unfastened his coat and slung it over the back of a chair gesturing for adam to do the same the admiral usually keeps to time so we have a while to ourselves adam hung his coat on another chair and loosened his sweatstained shirt then he unfastened his sword and hesitated as tyacke said here let me he held the sword with both hands for a long moment then drew the blade a few inches very slowly before snapping it into the sheath brings it all back adam the man too the scarred face softened at some private reminiscence equality dick god bless him the door opened and a man in a white jacket peered in at them seriously you called sir tyacke smiled no simpson but i will now and to adam suns over the yardarm dyou fancy a brandy with me thank you but as the door closed and the cabin servant departed adam said suppose the admiral arrives hes been ashore with some important officials tyacke winked i imagine theyll have shared a tot or two by this hour adam looked uneasily at the door the admiralis he easy to work with and tyacke grimaced under more like he loosened his neckcloth hes been in command for three months and i know him no better than the first day he laughed shortly except that hes always right youll know the situation someone shouted the sound muffled by deck and distance and followed by the regular thump of feet marines tyacke shrugged we have a lot of royals in freetown here aboard medusa too just in case as they say he leaned forward from his chair didnt someone tell me you were getting married he frowned dear old john allday i think it was when i was still a frigate captain like you till i was shifted to this he waved one arm around the spacious cabin im luckier than many i suppose but the door swung open and the servant came in quietly and set two crystal goblets down beside the sealed orders tyacke nodded thats excellent thank you the servant was hesitating and he said with a certain emphasis all for now simpson and when they were alone again heres to you and your lady when he put down the goblet it was empty then he said whats her name adam gazed past him lowenna it means joy in old cornish we were married at falmouth in november and he thought tyacke sighed thats a lovely name i gave up hope long ago he was touching the scarred side of his face a habit of which he was probably unaware but i didnt drag you from your own fine ship just to hear all my the door opened once more although there had been no knock it was a lieutenant one of the officers who had been with the side party when adam had climbed aboard sorry to disturb you sir but he glanced at the two coats draped casually over the chairs the admiral is on the jetty sir tyacke stood up without haste thanks martin ill do the same for you one day the lieutenant was hurrying from the cabin tyacke said dryly stand by to repel boarders and reached out to keep adam seated now we wait you do anyway then he was suddenly serious you dont know what this means to me adam he touched the sword again together and the door closed behind him adam refastened the sword and resumed his seat stretching his legs trying to relax no matter what others might think tyacke was quite alone he had asked about lowenna but what did he really feel envy or resentment on that last night adam had awakened reaching out for her and had seen her standing by the windows curtains wide moonlight like silver on her naked shoulders they had held one another again trying to delay the inevitable when the dawn came he had heard her say today the sea is my enemy he stared up at the same whitecoated servant had he touched his shoulder to awaken him was that possible he asked time to move simpson the man seemed surprised perhaps that the stranger had remembered his name or even cared to use it he said heard voices sir and jerked a thumb up at the deckhead best to be prepared adam stood up and tugged his collar into shape and paused as the servant said youve not had your drink sir the goblet was still full the brandy unmoving as if the flagship were firmly aground adam clapped his shoulder impetuously too late now i hope you can find a good home for it the man regarded him with disbelief for a second then grinned back as good as done an thank you captain footsteps outside the door it was the lieutenant again the one tyacke had called by his first name probably his first lieutenant adam patted his pockets and paused at the door to make certain he had forgotten nothing the goblet was already empty the lieutenant said the admiral is ready to receive you now sir wish me luck martin a royal marine sentry stamped his heels together and an orderly called captain bolitho sir medusas great cabin was not unlike that of any twodecker adam had known or bethunes flagship athena although most sailors would swear that no two ships were the same he had expected others to be present tyacke and perhaps a flag lieutenant or a clerk at least to take note of any exchange of views but there was nobody else and the cabin was dominated by its sole occupant rearadmiral giles langley was tall and squareshouldered thickset beneath his immaculate uniform his hair reflected now in the whitepainted deckhead was very fair and trimmed short in the style favoured by the younger breed of sea officer his eyes were in shadow and adam realised there was a curtain of some kind halfdrawn across the stern lights and windows but the smile was immediate and he thought sincere i regret the delay bolitho you must be feeling the strain after your long haul he gestured to a large table and a litter of papers and the package now sliced open there were pens and ink containers close by so he had not been alone until now he waved adam to a chair but walked restlessly to the curtain and twitched it slightly yours is a finelooking ship bolitho fast too it would seem he did not wait for an answer but for the weather he looked over his shoulder and the unfortunate moonstone diversion you would have arrived here even earlier eh in those few seconds adam saw that his eyes were blue and pale like glass langley shuffled some papers i read your report of course in the little time ive had since he did not finish instead he turned over a page boarding party with your own first lieutenant in charge the pale eyes lifted briefly good man is he hes been onwards first lieutenant since she commissioned sir not quite what i asked but no matter langley looked at him directly and there was only one survivor on board the master you thought did your lieutenant express any opinion that moonstone had been totally unprepared and had been fired on without warning she was already sinking when the boarding party reached her i signalled the recall when the weather deteriorated and was threatening my men langley nodded slowly the lone survivor was still alive at that time his fingers tapped the papers did your first lieutenant glean any information from him mr vincent was on deck when i made the recall signal it was one of my midshipmen who was speaking with him and who stayed with him until he died he was all but trapped himself the fingers rapped the papers again hardly an experienced witness bolitho adam met the pale eyes coldly i trust him sir langleys smile was almost gentle that is commendable too bolitho he was on his feet again you know my flag captain i understand a very capable officer i dont know how i would have coped when i was given this command without his knowledge and persistence a pity i could not he shrugged and the epaulettes glittered in a shaft of sunlight which had somehow penetrated the curtain adam had already noticed that langleys skin was quite pale with little hint of colour although tyacke had said he had become flag officer at freetown three months ago long enough to have felt the sun of africa langley said suddenly im glad to welcome you under my command albeit temporarily i have no doubt youll be eager to return to england without unnecessary delay he frowned as someone tapped at the door we will talk again possibly tomorrow i have heard a good deal about you and i shall discover what i can about moonstone and when i do the door opened and tyacke was standing outside his hat beneath his arm langley gave the gentle smile again right on time tyacke strode into the great cabin but perhaps because of the gloomy interior after the fierce sunlight on deck he did not appear to see adam as he passed a different lieutenant was waiting to escort adam to the entry port where the gig was waiting about time too he could almost hear jago saying it a squad of royal marines presented arms and officers saluted but there was no piping of the side as adam left the ship the admiral was in conference tyacke had kept his promise the gigs crew looked refreshed and rested and when jago stood in the sternsheets to greet him he could smell the rum then as the gig pulled out and away from medusas shadow adam suddenly got to his feet and gazed astern and he saluted not the flag this time but james tyacke brave and defiant and very much alone dont look down lieutenant mark vincent half closed his eyes against the sun as he watched yet another work boat pull away from onwards side and stifled a yawn it seemed he had been on his feet since they had anchored yesterday it felt longer fresh water food and general supplies all had to be checked and signed for and supervised in stowage by the master and the purser to their satisfaction or otherwise vincent did not have to turn his head to know that the windsails were barely moving they gave some relief between decks but not here he had already heard one working party complaining to the bosun about it in a few weeks time if were still in this godforsaken place you might have somethin to moan about drummond had laid his hand on the breech of the nearest eighteenpounder youll be able to fry an egg on this beauty and how long were they going to be here vincent looked across the water toward the flagship bolitho had reported to the admiral and delivered the despatches and vincent had seen the flag captain through a telescope for the first time he had felt both revulsion and pity at his hideous disfigurement suppose it had happened to me maybe james tyacke had obtained no higher command because of it despite everything he had done and this was the end of the road he heard lieutenant monteiths curt tone as he finished his instructions to the midshipmen on harbour routine vincent was the first lieutenant and could show no favour or prejudice toward any one they shared the same wardroom and at sea worked watch by watch but that was all and his dislike of the third lieutenant remained intense he was still ashamed that when monteith had been wounded during the fight with nautilus he had felt no sympathy only sorrow for those who had died he turned quickly as he heard the captains voice from the open skylight how must he feel being kept here awaiting orders and probably thinking all the time of the woman he had left behind in falmouth vincent himself had had only one serious affair which could have ended in disaster she had been a married woman and had proved an experienced lover but she was the wife of a senior officer a damned closerun thing he had never forgotten he almost smiled but ill wager she has drummond the bosun crossed the hot deck and touched his hat bout ready to secure sir still some new cordage to come aboard but the lads ave done well he assessed vincent making up his mind saint or tyrant the first lieutenant was neither drummond continued cautiously rearadmiral langley sir he did not look toward medusa i had a mate who served under im before e came ere he paused he had only known vincent since the old bosun had been killed and maybe vincent said testily come along man speak up e was commodore then sir used to carry out inspections no warning often with a newly joined ship vincent was staring at the open skylight well well i wonder if then the dark face lit with a grin thank you ill not forget this that would be all id need drummond hoped he masked his surprise it was taking him longer to understand the first lieutenant than he had expected when he had joined onward vincent could be strict but not aggressively so like some drummond had known and he was always ready to listen when advice was required but beyond that he seemed to remain aloof even in the wardroom from what drummond had heard this was a small thing but vincents gratitude was like a door opening close cooperation between first lieutenant and bosun was essential together they were the ship he had seen vincent look toward the cabin skylight only the captain was truly alone drummond glanced along the upper deck and was satisfied smart and tidy enough again for any admiral he looked at vincents profile edged with hard sunlight a strong face alert and intelligent it was said that he had been in line for command when onward had commissioned was he still thinking about that lost chance still hoping the hope might be in vain especially these days with the fleet being cut down he tugged out his silver call and held it in the palm of his hand where it looked no bigger than a toothpick just say the word mister vincent he saw vincent walking toward the companionway maybe to pass on to the captain the news about the admirals little foible monteiths sharp voice intruded into his thoughts impatient and sarcastic there would be no tears if he fell overboard one dark night and there was walker their youngest midshipman nodding obediently and repeating something for monteiths benefit while monteith stood hands behind his back feet flexing up and down in their brightly polished shoes i shall not ask you again mr walker drummond quickened his pace young walker might make a good officer one day given the right example to follow strange to realise that when he himself had been serving aboard the seventyfour gun mars at trafalgar in the thick of the fighting in which his own captain had been killed young walker would have only just been born if then it was a sobering thought he gritted his teeth and felt sand or dust grate between them but there seemed to be no wind to have carried it he licked his lips maybe cooler down in the mess he heard monteiths voice again rising almost to a scream so you think thats a joke do you made you smirk did it then go to the maintop and stay there until i recall you one of the seamen who was coiling some new rope nearby muttered poor little bastardll burn alive up there his friend saw drummond and spat bloody officers drummond heard both of them and was reminded of his own remark this godforsaken place now it was mocking him like the old warning stay out of it he saw the midshipman climbing slowly up the starboard ratlines slight body framed against the sky monteith had already disappeared no doubt to the cooler air of the wardroom where he would be having a wet before making someone elses life a misery drummond made his decision he took a water flask from behind the flag locker where it was kept hidden for the watchkeepers although everybody knew about it and strolled unhurriedly to the mainmast shrouds he stared across the water toward the flagship but nothing seemed to have changed no boats at or near the entry port but maybe there were some tied up against or beneath the pier obviously the admiral had more sense than to venture out in an open boat with the sun at its zenith he could feel his shirt clinging to his shoulders like a damp skin and the sweat already running down his ribs and hips a few faces turned curiously in his direction but just as quickly avoided his eyes he seized the ratlines in case i might find some more work for them to do he stared up at the maintop black against the burning sky he had been at sea all his life probably longer than any one else aboard except for a few like lieutenant squire and jago the captains coxswain he had never forgotten that one time when he had been ordered aloft by an officer not calm like today but in a raging gale with a full sea running he must have been about walkers age he had nearly fallen a few seconds a lifetime he could recall the comment by the tough hardbitten seaman who had saved his life when a bit of gold lace tells you to jump look first he had even been able to laugh about it he leaned back and began to climb he had the sun behind him but knew he needed to keep a sharp lookout when he reached the shade and comparative safety of the top he held his breath and halted as something struck his shoulder from above and bounced off the ratlines he did not need to look it was a shoe he wanted to call out to the boy but the distraction could be fatal walker was already climbing again in no time or so it seemed drummond had reached the futtock shrouds where it was necessary to rely on feet and hands to take the weight and to work your way out and around the fighting top before you could begin the next stage it was the mark of a good seaman drummond could feel his weight dragging at his fingers his shoes slipping on every ratline not like those early days hanging out over the sea never daring to look down he was pleased that he was not even breathless it would be something to tell them in the mess at the end of the day he had reached the barricade and gripped one of the iron mountings for a swivel gun to pull himself the last few feet he was slow when compared with the surefooted topmen who could make or shorten sail in minutes and seemingly without effort like young tucker his new mate a far cry from the poor frightened devils who used to be dragged aboard by ruthless press gangs never having set foot aboard ship before the midshipman was sitting on the edge of the lubbers hole to avoid the hazards of the futtock shrouds always risky but with monteith watching or yelling threats from below it was a wise precaution walker gazed up at him one leg dangling through the hole as he tried to fan his streaming face with his hat he said quietly i almost slipped he was shaking but trying to conceal it drummond knew the signs the boy was no coward he had proved that under the guns and when others were falling around him and when men had cheered him for his birthday while hell had been exploding across these same decks stay where you are drummond knelt beside him an take a swig of this he grinned and felt his jaw crack didnt do me no good neither he watched the boy swallow some of the water running down his chin and neck it would be stale after lying sealed up since since when but at this moment it would match the best wine in the fleet ill get someone to see you down to the deck a bowline round the waist would be a good idea walker seized his wrist and stared up at him imploringly no he faltered and tried again i dont want to let them think he stopped as drummond said dont you start givin me orders mister walker not yet anyways he attempted to shift his own position and felt the pain jab through his muscles he looked across the anchorage to give them both time to recover an entire area was filled with lifeless abandoned vessels masts and yards awry untended awaiting sale or disposal elsewhere maddock the gunner had told him that most of them had been part of the trade slavers which had been caught by some of the patrols before or after they had attempted to break out and escape why any one would want to use one of them after what they had done was hard to imagine they should burn the bloody lot of em their crews too he said now walker had managed to lean on his elbows the leg still dangling toward the deck below you feelin any better walker did not reply directly what is that boat doing there amongst them drummond wiped his eyes and squinted then he gripped walkers bony shoulder nothin wrong with your eyesight thank god he gestured through the lubbers hole were goin down now nice an easy one step at a time see walker nodded like a puppet but lieutenant monteith ordered me to drummond peered down at the deck nothing had changed a royal marine was walking slowly along the starboard gangway keeping pace with a small craft paddling a few yards away from the frigates side a normal precaution it was common enough for a wouldbe thief to slip aboard through one of the open ports if nobody was watching everybody else would be looking at the flagship as i was he said never mind that i want you to find the first lieutenant an dont take no from any one walker had lowered his legs one foot shoeless over the edge of the platform what shall i tell him he sounded calmer now under control but drummond wanted to be sure just keep with me an dont look down right he glanced toward the rank of lifeless vessels he had had only a brief glimpse of it but it was still fixed in his mind a longboat doublebanked two oarsmen on each thwart pulling steadily even unhurriedly beyond the shabby prizes he replied tell im the admiral is in sight he caught walkers arm and grinned dont stop for nobody he watched the midshipman jump down to the deck pause and tear off his remaining shoe before hurrying aft someone shouted after him perhaps monteith but he did not stop or turn back drummond followed easily and wedged the empty water flask behind the flag locker until the next time young walker would remember today and be proud drummond moistened his call with the tip of his tongue to hell with monteith after the uncertainty which had followed walkers breathless arrival at the door of the captains quarters the speed with which the actual event unfolded was almost a relief a cry from the lookout boat ahoy and the formal response magnified by a speakingtrumpet flagmedusa left nobody in doubt adam bolitho watched the admirals barge turning to moor alongside the double line of oars rising together bowmen poised and ready to hook on even at this distance he could sense the strain and effort after their long pull as a diversion chests heaving faces shining with sweat jago would be observing critically and would have a few things to say afterwards about it adam had seen vincent pass drummond the bosun on the way to their stations for such an event saw the nod and the answering grin like a couple of conspirators the barges coxswain was on his feet now hat in hand two lieutenants one obviously remaining in charge also standing and saluting and rearadmiral giles langleys pallid face turned up toward the entry port where the sideboys were waiting complete with white gloves to offer assistance langley ignored both and seized a hand rope still looking up at the motionless ensign langley was not lightly built but he seemed untroubled by the climb from his barge or the stamp of boots and attendant squeal of calls as he stepped aboard one of the other officers his flag lieutenant followed at a discreet distance stifffaced accustomed to such ceremonial langley waited for the calls to fall silent and the muskets to slap into position then he smiled and raised his hat as he faced aft it was more of a gesture than a salute he thrust out his hand to adam i said we should meet today and with a curt nod this is flags he did not offer a name the lieutenant was obviously used to that too langley waved his hand expansively would you steer the course captain bolitho its not every day he allowed the phrase to dangle perhaps a habit perhaps for effect adam strode aft looking for flaws the lieutenants and senior warrant officers waiting on the quarterdeck and most of the duty watch mustered below the boat tier the uniforms of a sweating squad of royal marines a vivid splash of colour amidships a midshipman stood stiffly by each gangway in case of any urgent message or change of procedure he thought of midshipman walker and the quiet determination with which he had bluffed his way past the cabin sentry and vincent usually so loath to reveal any emotion he had gripped the startled boys hand and shaken it fiercely i dont care what you were doing up there walkeryou came to me good man vincent was here now much more contained watching a bosuns mate clearing a section of the deck of spare hands who were still in working rig or stripped to the waist in the heat he murmured to adam i told the barge crew they could stand easy aboard us while they were waiting adam remembered tyacke offering the same courtesy to onwards boats crew the lieutenant declined sir he said he was told to stand by the admiral turned lightly for a man of his girth there was obviously nothing wrong with his hearing my barge crew they do nothing else all day mister he cocked his head vincent correct and without pausing i shall want to talk to you about the moonstone affair before the day is out you were the boarding officer when the last survivor was discovered the flag lieutenant leaned forward and interjected it was not lieutenant vincent who found him sir he was consulting an open notebook langley stared coldly beyond him i wasnt aware that i was asking you adam said i should have explained sir and langley gave him the now familiar humourless smile you did i believe then he said abruptly may we pause bolitho adam saw vincent give an almost imperceptible nod and hurry aft langley was looking at the windsails might be a little cooler belowand we can talk he turned just as swiftly and beckoned to midshipman huxley and who are you adam saw the flag lieutenant open his mouth and close it again huxley sir oh i thought perhaps he seemed about to walk on toward a line of seamen but stopped and swung round again huxley i trust not related to he left the rest unspoken but it was enough huxleys face had closed and adam saw his fist clench before he thrust it out of sight he said i think i am very fortunate in onwards midshipmen sir langley pulled out a large handkerchief and dabbed his mouth well time will tell as every captain must know he looked aft again i think ive shown the flag enough for the moment he waited for vincent to present himself you may carry on now lieutenant a smart ship are you satisfied vincent answered without hesitation ready for sea sir langley stepped into the shade with obvious relief remarking as it should be they reached the cabin where the screen door was already open the royal marine sentry at attention his eyes fixed discreetly on some point above the admirals epaulette the flag lieutenant had his little book open again but langley snapped not now flags that can wait inside the great cabin it seemed cool after the upper deck the stern windows were open and an unfinished letter on adams small desk was stirring slightly in the breeze langley strode across the cabin and tossed his hat onto a chair ducking his head his fair hair almost touching the deckhead this takes me back he did not elaborate then he saw the bergere facing astern in the place of honour as jago always called it langley lowered himself into it slowly and carefully while his aide hovered nearby he stretched his legs more like it eh he patted the arms of the chair and turned his pale eyes on adam this could tell a few tales ill wager adam smiled to himself the flag lieutenant had probably recorded all the details in his little book it belonged to my uncle sir guessed as much langley nodded and stroked the worn leather sir richard i am honoured a pause i know that captain tyacke served under him and was with him at the end he brushed something imaginary off his sleeve but trying to get him to talk about their service together is like getting blood out of a stone adam saw the pantry door move an inch hugh morgan was standing by may i offer you some wine sir im not sure about the time but you must have been on the move for most of the day langley pouted and said genially not over yet either never is he leaned further back in the chair anything will be more than welcome bolitho he gazed out of the stern windows his pale eyes shaded by the overhang of the poop i often wonder what our people in london actually know of our problems out here they worry about slavery even though all the major powers are doing their utmost to stamp it out he wagged a finger there will always be men willing or reckless enough to continue in the trade as long as the prize outweighs the risk given time i might suggest he fell silent as morgan glided into the cabin he could move like a shadow when required langley appraised the two expensive goblets i could become too comfortable in your company i fear feet thudded across the deck above and as if to a signal the flag lieutenant rose and hurried to close the skylight langley said just a precaution bolitho busy ears y know adam sipped his wine langleys glass was being refilled the flag lieutenants remained untouched langley said ive looked into the moonstones unexpected he lifted a finger and of course tragic loss she had been in our service under charter or direct warrant for some years patrol and liaison work and more recently transporting some natives rescued or freed from slavery and landing them close to their place of origin where and if it was considered safe in some cases not so easy as it sounds he leaned forward as if to confide something moonstone had seen better days but for your sighting and boarding her it might all still remain a mystery she had been fired on and there were no survivors save one yes i read your report pirates slavers we might never know for certain and there were sharks in the area he glanced at the screen door which was now shut and toward the pantry he said slowly there have been many changes here since i took command and more since you were last here inunrivalled wasnt it power to the victor is that what they call it beginnings of empire and we are a part of it he banged his hands on the arms of the chair like it or not he stood up and walked to the stern bench as if to peer out at the anchorage improve communications but cut the costs a constant demand from their lordships and from government if only they knew or understood he turned away from the light there is a new settlement to the south of us with its own governor and a local militia to save money adam said yes i know it is on the latest chart new haven langley betrayed surprise for the first time well it may be a part of empire perhaps but this is still africa for gods sake just as quickly he was calm again the pale eyes steady im sending you there to meet the new governor since he has not seen fit to offer me an invitation moonstone was under charter to him more than once he will want to know what happened to her and when he comes to me in the future the silence was significant he gestured to his flag lieutenant who immediately handed him a folded sheet of official stationery all the necessary details are here if the wind allows i want you to get under way tomorrow make a signal to confirm it langley turned to his wearylooking aide once more before that i want to speak to the officer who was mentioned in the captains report midshipman napier sir if that is agreeable to you bolitho adam scarcely heard him even the writing on the page seemed blurred i would like to be present sir good thinking he might forget something or close up like an oyster it happens at that age adam folded the paper only the new governors name stood out it was ballantyne the name david napier would never forget nor shall i david napier stepped into the midshipmens berth and stared around blankly it was empty and somehow spacious his home and hiding place since he had first joined the ship along with simon huxley always full of noisy conversation argument and laughter there were just six members of the mess but it usually sounded like three times as many the only sound now was the faint clink of crockery from the pantry where the messman was either putting aside the dishes from breakfast or preparing the next offering from the galley and it was stuffy and humid airless after the upper deck the windsails had been lowered and stowed but from ladders and gangways you could see the flag and masthead pendant flapping and hear the rattle and slap of rigging as if onward were eager to leave we are sailing today even the ship felt different alive again after stagnation he opened his little locker and folded the unfinished letter carefully before putting it away dear elizabeth no my dear he should just forget her she had probably put him out of her mind as soon as he had left the house there were some casks of wine secured in one corner of the mess in fact every spare space in the hull seemed to be packed with extra stores of one sort or another how long did they expect to be away and to what purpose he heard running feet the sound of something heavy being dragged across the deck above and a yelp from somebody who was not fast enough it would be soon now unless there was another mixup over the orders he sat down deep in thought recalling his unexpected summons to rearadmiral langley in the great cabin the admiral relaxed even casual but always maintaining a certain distance and not merely because of his splendid uniform and gleaming epaulettes sometimes interrupting napier in the middle of a sentence to fire a question or clarify a point with his crushedlooking flag lieutenant but the captain had been there also a shadow against the stern windows saying little unless in response to some comment from langley mostly the questions had centred upon moonstone and the boarding party and those final moments and you were alone with the last survivor how long was that did he tell you his name what manner of man was he where would you say he came from looking back it had been more an interrogation than an interview what did he say was that all he said was there anything else of significance and you left moonstone with the others when the order to abandon was given bolitho had spoken before napier could answer he was trapped between decks some loose gear had blocked his escape but others freed him napier heard himself say it was jago the captains coxn sir he had been angry remembering huxleys face his despair after the admiral had called to him and then brushed him so curtly aside and remembering langley in the captains cabin lounging in that same old chair to which when napier had been wounded and unable to walk they had carried him and the captain had held him giving him strength and courage it was like sacrilege napier had remained standing throughout the interview the old pain reawakening in his leg as if to goad him langley had got to his feet and remarked dismissively you did your best mr napier a pity that we are still in the dark it was over napier had only spoken to the captain very briefly since then after the admiral had finally returned to his flagship he had been delivering a message from the purser he had been about to walk away when the captain had called him by name im proud of you david then the purser himself had appeared and the contact was broken all done in ere sir it was the messman think i eard th pipe he did not wait for a reply but napier had long since learned that cooks and messmen usually knew what was happening before any one else he glanced at his locker hesitated and took out the letter his thoughts scattered as the order was piped along the deck faint at first but as it reached hatch or companion it was loud and clear all hands all hands take station for leaving harbour the admiral had decided proceed when ready no mercy adam bolitho entered his cabin and walked aft to the stern windows which were now leaning slightly to larboard not much but after their slow departure from freetown it was like a reward he leaned on the bench seat and peered down at the water below one of the cutters was towing astern to keep her tightly sealed after baking beside her twin on the tier he saw the boat yawing occasionally from side to side as if attempting to overtake her parent ship but they were making progress if only the wind would hold he opened his shirt and loosened the sleeves it was almost cool in the great cabin or seemed so after the small chartroom where he had been comparing notes with julyan the master in there it had been like an oven julyan had sounded optimistic even cheerful winds holding not much but if we keep this up we should sight the approaches day after tomorrow some of his confidence had faded as the rudder had quivered noisily like something shaking the keel adam rubbed his chin even so three days to make one hundred miles onward was used to something better he smiled to himself he must be getting like julyan with his quaint remarks they had been studying the most recent chart when the master had said seriously if all the sea ran dry right this minute onward would be perched on the edge of a great valley hills to larboard and a bottomless pit to starboard it was a warning any sailor would be insane to ignore they had plenty of sea room but vincent already had the leadsmen selected to stand by for immediate soundings if the chart proved incorrect to go from no bottom to only a few fathoms beneath the keel was not unknown the pantry door opened and morgan looked in questioningly may i and when he nodded call me when he glanced at adams seagoing coat which was lying untidily across a chair i can give that a shamperup in the meantime sir he went out the coat hanging over his shoulder like a faded banner adam sighed morgan always seemed to know what was coming he walked across to the old chair and stroked the worn leather how many times he thought of the admiral what was in those secret orders had they really required the fastest available frigate perhaps the only available frigate he recalled that final signal proceed when ready which midshipman hotham had reported as soon as it had broken from medusas yard langley must have gone ashore soon afterwards to one of his interminable conferences because after onwards anchor had broken free and they were eventually clearing the harbour another signal had been sighted it read simply until the next time it must have been from tyacke he moved to his small desk and halfopened the drawer where the letter lay when would it be finished when might she eventually read it he heard the royal marine clear his throat and call lieutenant monteith sir four bells chimed faintly above the other sounds last dog watch monteith would arrive flushed and breathless apologising even though he was exactly on time the thought irritated adam although he knew he was being unfair he looked up at the skylight remembering how the admirals flag lieutenant had so carefully closed it monteith strode into the cabin his hat tucked beneath one arm i do apologise sir i was needed up forrard but when i told them he seemed surprised when adam interrupted him briskly waving him toward a chair never mind youre here now and this wont take long he crossed the cabin feeling monteiths eyes on his back and sat behind the desk as third lieutenant you have the training and the welfare of our midshipmen in your care some are experienced up to a certain level a few are on the first step we all go through it and you will recall the pitfalls and misunderstandings yourself onward being your first ship as a commissioned officer monteith sat bolt upright in the chair hands folded across his hat i have always tried to maintain a code of conduct and discipline sir if any one has claimed otherwise i must dispute it something fell on the deck overhead and there was a gust of laughter adam said quietly whatever we believe or expect todays midshipmen are tomorrows navy loyalty and obedience are essential monteith licked his lips and nodded eyes fixed on adams face i know that sir adam glanced at the papers on his desk weighed down with a piece of polished coral there was scarcely any movement but onward was responding he looked directly at monteith responsibility extends in both directions by example and by trust midshipman or captain monteith said i was doing what i considered my duty sir very soon now i will be required to write a report on each of them as laid down in standing orders i am aware of that he heard hushed voices beyond the screen door possibly morgan trying to think of some way to interrupt this interview it was a waste of time in any case monteith would never change unless he was threatened the rap on the door came as a relief for both of them it was radcliffe breathless as if he had run all the way from the quarterdeck his eyes flickered in monteiths direction and then he deliberately looked away lieutenant squires respects sir he screwed up his sunburned face as if to recall every word a sail has been sighted fine on the starboard bow steering west he added importantly too far off to distinguish but fresh lookouts have gone aloft adam saw it in his mind a ship crossing ahead of them where from where bound any alteration of course would be pointless especially now like the sun in these latitudes darkness would come quickly like a cloak tell mr squire that ill come on deck directly he turned to reach for the old telescope as the midshipman scurried from the cabin monteith was on his feet standing stiffly he looked absurdly young like a midshipman himself i have always tried to do my duty sir adam brushed past him i rely upon it he had failed but by the time he had reached the quarterdeck he had almost dismissed monteith from his thoughts he looked up at the sails feeling the warm air on his shoulders the wind what there was of it was still holding but the canvas was barely moving squire was waiting with a telescope beneath his own arm ive sent midshipman hotham aloft sir any one who can read and send signals as well as he does might see what others miss adam moved toward the small group around the wheel and one of the helmsmen called instantly south by east sir vincent was here now and adam saw him pausing to flick some crumbs from his shirt he stared abeam at the endless barrier of land like the edge of their world bleached and almost colourless under the glaring sun it was closer now less than five miles away when the daylight was gone it would be dangerous to tack any nearer the other vessel would be out of sight by now heading into the great ocean as if reading his thoughts vincent said probably seeking more sea room adam hardly heard him he said im going up he knew squire in particular was staring at him as he slung the telescope across his shoulder i wouldnt have called you sir but adam looked up at the maintop thinking of walker ordered aloft by monteith as a punishment and beginning this unforeseen chain of events he saw jago standing with drummond the bosun arms folded and sensed his disapproval he gripped the ratlines and started to climb the sun burned his back and the cordage felt as if it had been lying across a stove he glanced abeam again pausing to wipe the sweat from his eyes with the back of his wrist they had the sea to themselves as far as he could see in any direction he had reached the maintop and saw midshipman hotham lower his own telescope at his captains untidy arrival there were two other lookouts with him one of them tucker the new bosuns mate hotham said the other vessel is almost out of sight sir he tapped his telescope twomasted probably a brig local maybe he reached out as if to emphasise the point and stopped himself but was unable to hide his excitement but over there sir he pointed toward the uneven coastline flashes sir thought the sun was playing tricks on me but they were flashes tucker said i saw em too sir hotham rushed on ignoring the interruption on an off like sunlight reflected from a mirror or a piece of glass but then it stopped or was lost in the inshore mist but i did see it adam rested his knee against the barricade and felt the whole mainmast shivering against him and the keel beneath that his ship he focused the glass and saw the nearest land spring into detail the curve of the next spur of headland and after that he thought of the sailing master beside him in the airless chartroom as they had transferred their calculations to the new chart he had marked this same thrust of headland not much but still dangerous for any vessel so close inshore the most recent chart had shown a tiny landmark which had not been on the previous version a mission of some kind either religious or simply supplying aid or sustenance to any trader or sailor who might venture ashore in this godforsaken place it could certainly be used as a guide tucker said slowly maybe it was hidden in the mist sir adam closed the telescope not mist this time its smoke he looked at hotham again flashes youre certain of it the midshipman hesitated but only for a moment ive seen the army making signals like that im certain sir adam started to climb down a clergymans son what would his father say if he could see him now but no matter what he thinks he saw it is my decision vincent was waiting his face full of questions adam said we will hold our present course until sunset then i intend to come about and close inshore he looked at him directly and anchor landing party sir at first light weather permitting as if he were thinking aloud two boats the cutter towing astern and the gig easier any sign of trouble vincent said well be ready sir adam gripped his arm not this time mark i need you here with me remember the ship comes first he looked toward squire who had not moved since he had watched his captain scrambling aloft join me in the cabin both of you and ill explain what i have in mind only then did he release vincents arm as he walked toward the companion he could hear the low murmur of their voices what was there to discuss right or wrong it was decided landing party mustered and standing by sir vincents voice was clipped and formal loud in the uncanny silence adam waited for his eyesight to adjust to the darkness on deck even vincents face was barely visible he had stolen a few precious minutes to revisit the chartroom there was only a small shaded light above the chart table just enough and no more the order to darken ship had been piped at sunset when onward had altered course and headed toward the original sighting and the masteratarms and ships corporal had maintained a regular patrol above and between decks to make certain it was carried out they had anchored and the silence was unnerving even the sound of the cable running free had seemed dangerously loud and the leadsmans regular chant as they approached the inshore waters seemed to invite discovery it was the middle watch almost over now adam stared through the darkness toward the land imagining he could smell it but he knew it was about two miles distant if his calculations and julyans were correct the sailing master had seemed satisfied by guess and by god as he had put it the cutter and gig were moored alongside it would be a long pull for the oarsmen with extra men and weapons adding to the weight squire would be in command not an easy man to know but he was brave reliable and popular his experience as a masters mate ashore and afloat in a surveying vessel taking part in sir alfred bishops expedition made him the obvious choice his service throughout the expedition had gained him a commendation from the great man himself and a promotion to commissioned rank which still seemed to surprise him he would be leading in the cutter which mounted a swivel in the bows as additional protection with the gig staying as close astern as possible if squire ran aground on a sandbar before reaching a suitable beach the gig could tow or kedge him free monteith would be in charge of that there was no alternative it might all prove to be a mistake and a waste of time and rearadmiral langley would not be pleased about that two midshipmen were also among the landing party huxley and david napier requested by squire because he had worked alongside both of them while anchoring and getting under way adam had mixed feelings about napier experienced yes but it was too soon after the moonstone affair but any exclusion would be seen as favouritism and napier would be the first to protest many of onwards company had been standing by for most of the night some may have snatched a catnap curled up against a gun or in some corner of the hull waiting for the call no hammocks had left their nettings in case of some emergency when all hands might be needed a sudden shift of wind or the leadsmans cry warning of unexpected shallows like the edge of julyans great valley adam thought they were ready it was now vincent had reported that there had been no shortage of volunteers but squire had only chosen a few extra men including a squad of royal marines adam could still hear the disappointment and see it on lieutenant sinclairs face when he had been told that he was staying aboard and sergeant fairfax would be in charge of the lobsters he glanced toward the land very faintly visible now darker than the sky and the air was still cool but in another hour less he felt something like a shiver and repressed it he said quietly so lets be about it shall we he had gone over it in his mind again and again weapons powder and shot a days ration of food and water bandages he heard a few hushed voices a slap on the back even a quick laugh the gig cast off first oars moving slowly to carry her clear of the side jago was at the tiller not a volunteer he had insisted napier was with him monteiths decision next the cutter muffled oars taking the strain the coxswain the usual manfitzgerald a true patlander as jago called himwaving to someone still invisible in the darkness his loose white shirt was ghostlike against the black water it would be jagos guide as he was following astern vincent said ive doubled the lookouts and the anchor watch is standing by now all we can do adam looked up at the sky which seemed lighter although that was impossible and considered vincents voice efficient but envious when he looked again the two boats had disappeared and he felt vincent move toward the side like me he wants to be with them david napier crouched in the gigs sternsheets and watched the regular thrust and heave of the stroke oarsman slower than usual but very steady with extra hands aboard there was scarcely room to move he eased his injured leg as much as he could at least that was not playing up monteith was sitting beside him shifting occasionally to peer around the oarsmen as if in search of the cutter it was rarely visible except for a phosphorescent splash of oars and the pale blur of fitzgeralds shirt once he snapped look out were losing her and jago had broken his silence ive got her the barest pause sir napier could feel spray splashing across his legs as the oars dipped steeply into the swell like tropical rain how much worse it must be in the cutter with a much heavier load to carry he had seen the swivel gun mounted in the bows but had heard sergeant fairfax say theres another one to take its place if need be he had even chuckled no time to load an prime if we have to fire no wonder the cutter had displayed so little freeboard squire must be thinking of that right now in this deeper swell napier shifted again and felt the curved hangers hilt rub against his thigh the gunner had issued it to him when the landing party had been arming blades freshly sharpened on a grindstone like nautilus like moonstone the gunner had watched him unbuckle his dirk take this boy you might need something stronger than that dolittle sword today he looked toward the shore and tried to see it in his mind the sky was lighter but only slightly like the edge of a frayed curtain there should be a small spur of headland to starboard if the cutter was on course and a beach which might still surprise them he would talk it all over later with huxley who was up there with squire it was hard to determine what they had in common except for the unbreakable bond of friendship which neither of them had ever questioned jago said curtly alterin course to starboard monteith almost stood up but seemed to change his mind are you certain jago either did not hear him or ignored him napier offered i can still see the coxns shirt sir he sensed that jago had leaned across the tillerbar and guessed he was grinning or swearing under his breath they had hardly spoken since the hands had been mustered for this adventure as lieutenant squire had called it any trouble you keep with me that was all but from luke jago it was everything oars the blades rose dripping on either side while the gig swayed and slowed almost to a halt jago said cutters run aground he stood one hand on the tiller got clear again give way together the stroke oarsman gripped his loom and leaned back and in those few seconds napier was able to see the gleam of a medallion as it swung freely across his shirt the features of the men around him were faintly visible for the first time since they had cast off a bosuns mate named sinden muttered not much bloody longer monteith rapped out silence in the boat and did not see sindens gesture behind his back napier seemed to have lost track of time it was measured by each thrash of oars and the surge against the hull the occasional heavy breathing when jago called for a brief pause if they were overhauling the cutter napier stared past the oarsmen and saw the land not high ground but a ragged barrier of trees oars jago had turned his head either to look or listen monteith said sharply i gave no order jago did not move mr squire just made a signal were arrived sir with the oars stilled napier thought he could hear the murmur of sea against beach then the silence was completely shattered as some of the cutters crew and passengers splashed over the side in readiness to haul their boat to safety it was not simply a landfall the place seemed to be reaching out as if to encircle them he told himself that would change when true daylight showed itself monteith got to his feet and peered toward the land fitzgeralds shirt the signal had vanished he said stand by to clear the boat he clambered over a thwart but jago reached out and restrained napier not yet monteith did not wait and jumped or fell into chestdeep water jago said calmly give the officer a hand lads then clear the boat sinden take charge up yonder it seemed to take an age before both boats were safely hauled ashore but the oarblades were still dripping when squire was satisfied he stood with his back to the sea and waited for a sodden monteith and the two midshipmen to join him to sergeant fairfax he said as planned have your lads take cover weapons uncocked remember and fairfax responded with a touch of outraged dignity they are royals sir but he hurried away and his white belt was soon hidden squire said when it gets lighter well move inshore theres a small cove beyond those trees he grinned or should be he touched monteiths wet sleeve never mind sunll be up soon they all tensed as a flock of birds broke from the undergrowth and rose flapping and crying toward the sea squire said we dont need an audience someone laughed quietly jago had joined them his broadbladed cutlass casually over his shoulder he gestured in the same direction th mission must be over there as well he did not look at monteith huxley was gazing after the disturbed birds as they circled and then vanished against the sea he whispered to napier i have to stay with the boats dave im sorry youre stuck with him no name was necessary squire was elaborating on his plan we can make our way along the shore now it shouldnt take long well know better once we fix our position more exactly if he was grinning it remained invisible in the dimness before dawn and the ship will be able to see us he turned abruptly lightly for a man of his powerful build what is it a seaman said i kin smell smoke sir burning squire sniffed audibly i can too he looked at monteith well separate here hector he waved to the bosuns mate probably nothing but well find out monteith loosened his belt if you ask me no one did napier turned to follow he had never heard any one address the third lieutenant by his first name before hector coming from any one else he froze it was a scream terrified or in pain a woman and then utter silence he felt someone brush past him and knew it was jago best keep on the move sir itll be sunup in no time an well be sittin ducks monteith was staring down at the beach as if to look for squires party but they had already disappeared toward the higher ground napier looked at the nearest ridge of trees no longer a black formless mass but taking shape against the sky he had been holding his breath since the scream and drew it in sharply at what might have been a sudden gleam but it was the first hint of sunlight he felt his shoe catch on some fallen frond and heard it crackle underfoot he said i agree with jago sir monteith swung round dont you dare to give me instructions when i need advice from you there was a solitary tree directly ahead of them the uppermost branches a green pattern against the sky the lower still in deep shadow but the shadow was moving down jago seemed to lunge into the shadow even as he sent monteith sprawling napier felt his strength and fury as he thrust him aside and saw the blaze of metal as the great blade flashed between them then jago recovered his own balance and hacked again at the writhing figure on the ground then very deliberately he reached down to hoist the lieutenant to his feet easy does it sir as monteith stood gazing at the body he added quietly thats stopped im farting in church monteith said nothing and looked ready to vomit as jago stooped and wiped his blade on the dead mans clothing too close for my likin jago touched napiers arm youre doin well mr napier napier wiped his mouth on his cuff in the strengthening light he could see their attackers curved blade in the sand the severed hand still gripping it thanks too little but it was all he could manage the shot that followed was not close but on this tiny beach it could have been a thunderclap shouts and the sound of running feet bodies stumbling and crashing through and into the undergrowth and a second shot a solitary authoritative voice rang out it could have been on the quarterdeck of some flagship or the barracks square at plymouth royal marines fix bayonets the familiar rasp of steel advance sergeant fairfaxs squad of volunteers sounded like a regiment squire strode toward them and nodded briefly to monteith who was biting his lip took em by surprise wont give em the chance to draw a second breath he clapped monteith on the shoulder bloody well done but he was looking at jago then he said quietly lost one im afraid seaman mcneil a good lad one of the best napier could remember his face he had been aboard onward when she had first commissioned squire seemed to square his shoulders well take him back with us he looked around at their faces be ready and no quarter right napier gripped the unfamiliar hanger and followed squire onto firmer ground monteith had stopped to examine his pistol which had dropped to the sand when jago had pushed him aside saving his life at any second napier expected another challenge or more shots the sound of their feet trampling over the rough ground sounded deafening and once again the bright birds broke cover noisily and scattered throughout the trees he looked back but the two boats were out of sight he thought of huxley and the two men with the swivel gun alone now except for the dead mcneil he saw squire raise his hanger and gesture toward a gap in the trees where the gleam of blue water was sharpedged in the dawn be still sergeant fairfax had appeared from nowhere his uniform blazing against the undergrowth he dropped to one knee musket raised and unmoving napier looked around nervously there was nothing even the sea was out of sight then he heard it like ragged breathing someone gasping louder now he could scarcely hear the click of fairfaxs musket the unsteady breathing stopped instantly squire said halt or we fire he did not raise his voice but it seemed to hang in the humid air like an echo no no the voice was closer unsteady dont shoot im only the rest was lost as something fell heavily amid the scrub silence again then somebody behind napier murmured speaks english thank god sergeant fairfax snapped stay where you are and stood slowly but his musket and fixed bayonet did not waver easy i said napier heard squire mutter something as he got to his feet pistol drawn and ready and saw jago step into a flickering patch of sunlight his cutlass at his side he spoke slowly calmly come ere matey his hand moved slightly toward his belt nice an easy now napier saw squire move fully into the filtered sunlight and come face to face with the shadowy figure greyhaired gaunt in patched clothing eyes wide as two more marines appeared behind him one called nobody else up there sarnt but they kept their eyes fixed on the stranger jago held out his hand the musket eh napier saw the mans confusion but he did not resist as jago took the musket and said empty never been fired by the look of it squire cleared his throat where are you from he must have seen the bulging eyes fixed on the uniforms as more of fairfaxs men emerged from cover we are your friends monteith said how can we trust him if i had my way the ragged figure did not seem to hear him i have work at mission they are always good there they help others he covered his face with one hand he was trembling there was shooting and a fire squire moved closer and halted as the other man cowered away from him napier did not move dared not the man seemed to be english a sailor perhaps or had been until something had brought him to the mission the voice faltered on remembering maybe reliving all gone now a ship he repeated all gone now it looks like were too late squire sounded angry with himself the captain will be wondering what the hells happening the stranger was staring at napier fixedly as if he were seeing a vision you are young i remember when i he reached out as if to grasp his hand or arm jago murmured easy does it matey and his fingers flexed on his cutlass where do you come from i told you th mission a spark of impatience or sudden determination but he did not look away from napier i will take you show you squire opened his mouth as if to countermand it then he said very softly its not an order david well be with you napier did not trust himself to answer men had already died and for what he looked steadily at the ragged man and tried to shut his mind to everything else he said simply show me they turned toward the wash of dawn sweeping the eastern sky and he imagined he could feel its growing heat on his face for a moment longer he thought the man had not heard him but then they were walking together side by side and he heard him utter one word home in a few seconds they were completely alone or so it felt every so often he glimpsed blue water between the trees but if he looked back over his shoulder the beach and the distant ship were invisible at any moment he had to control his thoughts fear was always the enemy time and distance meant nothing when had he last been able to sleep without the picture of the stricken schooner in his mind the feel of a dying mans grip on his wrists he said conversationally my home is in cornwall do you know it no answer but the bony hand dragged at his arm this way out of nowhere a pair of giant rocks appeared long fallen from the hillside and it was as if he had been cut off from every hope of aid separated even the sounds of their feet across loose branches the whine of insects their own breathing seemed louder in the stillness his mind was screaming they were alone any minute now he tripped and felt the bony steadying hand heard the whispering voice look yonder and carefully david napier stood very still unable to accept that they had arrived so suddenly like a great curtain being dragged aside light and colour replacing the shadows and pitfalls of the jungle a small cove shaped like a horseshoe beneath a hill the twin of the one behind them and beyond the ocean and here was the mission or what remained of it small buildings no more than crude shacks and a main structure which had once been painted white as a simple landmark for passing vessels it was charred beyond recognition and the smell was sickening he realised he was alone he swung round and tried to tug the hanger from his belt a trap a betrayal but he knew it was neither he could not take his eyes from the smoking buildings and a painted sign he could not read from here which was surmounted by a wooden crucifix flaking in the sun the ragged man had returned others are following i tell them to wait napier imagined squires reaction he would soon close in he asked all gone from here they came to rob and steal need stores for voyage to carry slaves the gaunt shoulders lifted the ship sailed but some of them stayed here it has happened before napier thought of the shots and the scream is any one alive the man did not reply immediately but was staring like napier at the charred building mister dundas is a strong man fine man he shuddered man of god he straightened and seemed to compose himself then he touched napiers forearm as if to lead him we will go down your comrades will wait no longer he gave a ghostly smile david they left the shelter of the trees and walked down through trampled grass toward the mission napier stayed close beside him suppose the man was completely mad or driven beyond reason by what he had seen or imagined there was a body lying against a length of fence a black man shot in the face one fist still gripping an axe napier heard the flies buzzing as they passed i was afraid i ran away when they attacked the mission i came to find you i saw you land napier looked at the heavy door of a single structure separate from the burned remains of other buildings a chapel of sorts a notice was displayed nearby with the same name william dundas and a few lines of scripture in english the door was badly damaged and scarred by several shots there was complete silence napier said you brought me i only hope and the grip tightened on his arm i deserted them i must do it the mans eyes were running in the drifting smoke or they were tears then he walked up to the door and shouted ahoy its wolsey i am with friends the navy napier watched him twisting his head in all directions screwing a corner of his coat into a tight ball his composure gone to his relief he saw bayonets glinting beyond the broken fence and patches of scarlet moving and here came jago grimfaced lifting one hand as he strode toward the building napier heard the first tentative scrape of metal and the heavytimbered door was opened wide the interior was completely dark pierced here and there by thin beams of light through what must be shutters or other defenses napier stood with his back to the sun every instinct warning him that he was a perfect target but unable to move a few figures staggered or pushed others aside to reach the door natives perhaps workers at the mission and several children running out into the sunlight and huddling together hiding their faces as they were confronted by seamen and marines but many of the others inside did not move nor would they napier felt squires heavy hand on his shoulder as he brushed past well done david your guide kept his word he waved toward his men otherwise it was a grim sight some had crawled here for help or to die others seemed too dazed to understand what was happening in a corner of the chapel a white woman knelt on the floor a greyhaired man propped against her napier dropped to his knees beside them and tried to take the weight from her but she pushed him away struggling and hitting him with her fists screaming dont touch me i cant she broke off in a fit of coughing napier put his arm around her shoulders conscious only of her rage and fear she was wearing a loose white garment that might have been a mans shirt and her arms and legs were bare he knew that she wore little else he felt the weight lifted clear and heard someone mutter es dead poor bastard the woman began to struggle again her nails reaching for his face my father not dead men were making their way deeper into the building more light guiding them as shutters and doors were forced open the woman was quite still now in napiers arms and was staring into his face there was a bruise on her cheek and a wound across her neck there had been a lot of blood too hers she said suddenly where were you her voice was taut like a knifeedge the bare arms and legs were very tanned and she was english he said quietly we came as soon as we knew and tightened his grip again as something dropped and broke and a man swore angry or unnerved she had dark hair loose and tangled but when he moved to push it back from her face he felt her flinch as if expecting a blow pain or worse but the eyes remained unnaturally steady fixed on his face wolsey found you he came back hes here with me he stroked the hair from her face and she did not resist this time i should have known been ready but they never gave us a chance my father tried she seemed to shiver he always believed a shadow loomed over them it was squire his eyes everywhere wary but very calm well soon have you out of here my dear he crouched unhurriedly and took one of her limp hands our doctor will soon have you as right as rain she began to protest but he continued you must be mr dundass daughter he was turning over her wrist revealing the deep rope burns she appeared to have been cruelly tied and dragged well take care of you he released her hand quite gently so what do we call you she moved her head stiffly and her eyes left napiers to focus on squires face claire dundas squire looked over his shoulder frowning at the interruption as monteith appeared and stood framed in the doorway all mustered he looked at the greyhaired man lying dead on a frayed carpet sergeant fairfax reports that the intruders have gone squire hid his impatience and what do you say he did not wait for an answer but rose and peeled off his uniform coat here my dear a bit too hot for later but you put it on now eh she stood swaying on her feet and when she obediently held out her arms napier saw another wound on her naked shoulder she had been bitten she tugged the coat around her until the lapels overlapped her slim body without taking his eyes from her squire said im sending jago with the gig and mcneil tell the captain bosuns chair hell know what to do the girl called claire said dully mcneil a scottish name squire looked back at the dead man on the floor yes like dundas napier reached for her arm come outside with me he saw her turn toward her fathers body and squire said gently ill take care of him for you she attempted to pull away and almost fell napier took her hand again but he was looking at squire so familiar and easygoing a true sailor he thought he was far more than that sergeant fairfax was waiting with two of his marines a length of shutter carried between them fairfax touched his hat ready for the lady when you give the word sir fairfax was a senior sergeant and had never given up the hope of promotion he watched them lifting the young woman onto a layer of blankets he had seen plenty of people in shock during times of war on land and at sea most of them recovered there was little alternative in the navy much less in the corps the marines were lifting their makeshift litter and carrying it with care the woman partly shrouded by the lieutenants coat she was staring up at the sky heedless of the burning sun there was blood on one bare ankle but she was safe fairfax kicked bitterly at a loose stone safe how could she feel safe after what she must have endured he shouted come on then we dont have all day to find them boats he saw one of the seamen glare at him and was glad he heard a shout and saw midshipman david napier waving from a gap in the trees nothing more was needed the ship was in sight their part in this venture was over squire was standing beside the woman now speaking with her even as she dragged her hand from his sergeant fairfax knew from hard experience that it was only just beginning not a race lieutenant mark vincent turned away from the group of men around the wheel as he heard the captains voice or perhaps someone had prodded him warningly he must have been half asleep on his feet he touched his hat south by east sir full and by adam walked to the compass box but did not consult it instead he stared up at the spread of canvas almost fully braced to contain the wind and hold onward on course the wind had backed slightly so that the deck was tilting to leeward but only enough to allow them to gain more sea room he looked at the masthead pendant it was streaming although the air across his neck was clammy he looked at the foredeck seeing it as it had been a few hours before boats being hoisted exhausted sailors being lifted bodily over the side too weary or subdued to respond to their welcome hard to believe they had watched those same two boats vanish into the darkness before dawn this very day he recalled the gig returning from the beach and jagos grim description of the sequence of events and later when the bosuns chair had been hoisted aboard the girl in squires coat losing her selfcontrol as hands had reached out to carry her below murray the surgeon had been with her from the first someone had asked jago if he wanted anything and he had retorted just get me away from that hellhole he spoke for all of them adam gazed forward along the full length of his ship beyond the quarterdeck rail every space seemed to be full of silent people vincent said quietly as ordered sir lower deck cleared adam nodded better now than later he moved to the centre of the rail and felt for the small prayer book inside his coat it would be pitch black within a couple of hours the sea was darker almost bronze toward the horizon and the land was already losing shape and definition he could see the bosun with some of his men on the larboard gangway bareheaded and looking aft toward their captain and the two flagdraped corpses adam thought of the dead mans daughter lying down below at this moment would she ever be allowed to forget let alone forgive he knew squire was standing close by and monteith the latter strangely withdrawn since he had climbed aboard david napier seemed composed enough another shadow merged with adams own he knew it was jago they had shaken hands when he had returned with the gig and the news jago had gauged the moment as usual youll be needin a shave eh capn but the strain was very evident squire had described jago in stronger terms he was like the rock of gibraltar right from when we cast off jago murmured got the book capn adam glanced at him and smiled thank you he pulled it out of his pocket all those other times faces memories pain he heard vincent call uncover most of them had already removed their hats others were still halfdressed from working ship getting onward under way again he thought again of the girl named claire she was about the same age as lowenna it never left him how it must have been for the one he loved in spite of the silence the ship became a part of it the sound of the wind canvas loose tackle but adams voice carried and every word was clearthe days of men are but as grassfor he flourisheth as a flower of the field united again all six of onwards midshipmen were mustered on the larboard side of the quarterdeck with hotham the senior in charge he was finding it difficult not to look around as he listened to the captains voice speaking the familiar words it was unusual to see the entire ships company gathered together all at once except when they were at action stations or on occasions like this which fortunately were rare faces he knew well others hardly at all voices and accents from every part of britain when he wrote to his father he would attempt to describe his emotions before and after he had sighted the flashing reflection which in turn had caused the captain to alter course and send a landing party to investigate people had died as a result including one of their own and hotham felt a deep sense of guilt because of it if he had kept quiet would they still be alive would it have made any difference and there was an intense pride rivalling the uneasy guilt from the moment the boats had cast off and pulled away into darkness an eternity before sunrise or so it had seemed he charles hotham clergymans son had been appointed acting lieutenant until the two lieutenants who had gone with the boats returned he had not been called upon to perform any duty which was foreign to him and those around him had barely noticed his temporary promotion but he had felt it the weight of honour and responsibility and he still did hotham looked around at his fellow midshipmen some of whom looked even younger without their hats radcliffe their newest member had already shown his disrespect by offering a sweeping bow and addressing him as sir but one day maybe soon he might be summoned to face the boardthe inquisition as they called itand gain the glittering prize of promotion a commission the events of this day might just tip the balance in his favour david napier was standing nearby huxley beside him napier could see the captains dark hair catching the last of the bronze sunlight as he looked keenly across the crowded deck and the full length of the ship he was holding the prayer book and speaking the words but napier had not seen him consult it napier did not look toward the land it was shadowed by the twilight and he wanted to shut it out of his mind and never see it again but he knew he never would small stark pictures burned like flames in the darkness of his thoughts jago pushing monteith off balance and hacking down the attacker in the shadows but it was my life he was saving and the strange ragged man named wolsey who had risked everything to come to them for help and had chosen a midshipman to be his companion even to the mission mission of death and yet just when the boats were about to leave the beach and return to onward shining on the clean sea in the sunlight like a perfect symbol wolsey had turned and disappeared back to the mission his only home lieutenant squire was standing on the gangway perhaps he had asked to perform this duty for a second or so their eyes met like that final moment of decisionwe commend unto thy hands of mercy most mercifulfather the souls of these our brothers departed and wecommit their bodies to the deep the combined shrill of calls broke the stillness and squire dropped his hand the signal for which the burial party had been waiting napier heard an improvised grating being raised and tilted and then a second and when he looked again the flags were empty and rippling in the light wind it was over a solitary call followed he knew it was drummond the bosun carry on some of the men on deck were going below to their messes others seemed reluctant to leave and stood in silence by the same gangway squire glanced down at his own uniform he was wearing his best coat at odds with his breeches which were still badly stained from the ordeal ashore maybe there was a tailor at freetown where he could replace the coat used to cover the missionarys daughter he looked toward an open hatch she might have heard the brief ceremony despite her pain and hideous memories and understood that they were honouring the dead in the navys way our way he thought of the old coat again and knew he would never discard it nor would he forget her there were only two lanterns burning in the great cabin but compared with the complete darkness of the previous night it seemed like broad daylight adam bolitho could see himself mirrored in the stern windows among the familiar items of furniture old friends in this sanctuary he was very tired drained but his mind refused to relax he thought of the entire ship in darkness when they had come about to head for that littleknown beach where they had landed the boats stealth had seemed impossible even the small compass light shaded though it was had seemed as blinding as a beacon astern now the sea was black only the reflections in the saltstained glass seemed real he braced his legs as the deck tilted slightly perhaps the wind had freshened although he doubted it there was an empty plate and a wine glass on the table he could scarcely remember anything about either except for morgans persistence and concern tomorrow unless the wind and weather turned against them they should sight their new landfall around noon julyan was optimistic but even he had seemed subdued after the sea burials maybe he was like his captain no matter how many you witnessed each one seemed like the first he made an effort to concentrate it would mean anchoring and the depths in this area were uncertain as the approaches to freetown must have been years ago tomorrow he would finish writing his report when his mind was clear again he thought of the seaman who had gone over the side mcneil he had always seemed in good spirits one of squires men his entry would be the briefest dd dischargeddead he felt the air stir slightly as the door opened and knew it was jago apart from cabin servants he was the only one never announced by the royal marine sentry jago closed the screen door behind him and looked at him questioningly i was told you wanted to see me capn he jerked a thumb in the direction of the sleeping cabin thought youd be countin sheep by now adam gestured to a chair well all be busy enough tomorrow theres something i want to discuss to ask before i write my report for the admiral jago sat down on the edge of the chair eyes expressionless he said i see you didnt call me for a shave capn and rubbed his own jaw needs a trained fist adam had cut himself even the hand guiding the razor had been weary but he knew that jago was ahead of him i heard what you did ashore luke it was what ive come to expect of you jago leaned forward in the chair and adam could see the strain as well as the strength the man who should hate and offer no loyalty to any officer an official pardon could never wipe away the scars mental or physical of an unjust flogging jago said i think i knows what you mean to ask capn a road weve been down afore as i recalls then he smiled for the first time since returning aboard remember what i said when we went over to th flagship i wants to see your flag up there at the mastead when im an admirals coxswain then if you offers me promotion it was a broad grin now time to ask me again adam shook his head you deserve it jago turned as if he had heard something and said quietly an so do you capn there was a tap at the door surgeon sir morgan was halfway there muttering dont they realise weve not had a moment and sighed as adam said i was expecting him then give my coxn a wet will you murray stalked into the cabin very hawkish and alive i apologise for keeping you waiting sir i was not sure and i still am not he was wearing one of his stained surgery smocks adam said how is she recovering its still too early to judge but shes young and shes strong given time murray held up his hands and stared at them these are supposed to heal but every time i touch her she must relive the ordeal beaten into submission abused and violated the damage to her mind may never mend he looked up his eyes calm again i told her that you wished to visit her im sorry its taken so long ill be guided by you the last thing i want is to jeopardise her recovery the cabin skylight was still open and they heard someone call out and laugh murray said curtly the best sound ive heard since we upanchored jago said ill wait here capn and picked up adams coat from a chair and held it out for him so shell know murray opened the door shes in my cabin impatient or apprehensive it was hard to know adam had already heard about the cabin vincent had told him it would be quieter safer one of murrays loblolly boys was sitting outside and he got to his feet as they appeared in the narrow passageway murrays cabin adjoined the sick berth but was not a part of it murray murmured something and the man shook his head we cannot stay too long murray paused she may have changed her mind he regarded adam steadily trust me he opened the door there was one small light but like the sick quarters everything was painted white it was enough she was lying on a cot covered by a sheet which she was holding closely beneath her chin one arm was bare the linen bandage around her wrist livid against her tanned skin hiding the rope burns where she had been tied and dragged she turned her head toward the door eyes open and unblinking murray said ive brought the captain to see you claire remember how we talked about it only a short visit then perhaps youll go to sleep she turned her head away slightly her profile in shadow murray repeated captain bolitho he commands here her lips moved as if they were forming the name but her eyes were shut adam saw the dark hair was clinging to the pillow still damp it had been washed and on the one visible hand the nails were clean when he had seen her carried aboard they had been black with dried blood probably from the face of one of her attackers she said bolyetho her eyes were open again i wanted to see you there was another pauseto thank you he said you would come adam glanced at murray and saw his almost imperceptible nod she was talking about her father she tried to twist her head to gaze at him again but pain seemed to prevent it the sheet had slipped from her shoulder where he saw another bandage bless you for what you did i know you gave him to the sea hell be safe there murrays eyes told adam that it was time to leave she reached out suddenly as if to seek his hand and he clasped it instinctively murray did not protest she said thank you captain bolitho i shall never forget a tear ran unheeded over her cheek or forgive adam stood up gently releasing her fingers and saw her grope for his hand again try to rest claire we shall anchor tomorrow and then her fingers gripped his with unexpected strength no the damp hair spilled across his sleeve no not there later murray took the hand and felt the pulse discreetly she must rest now and when he had pulled the door to behind them im glad you came and so is she they stood in the passageway and murray lowered his voice she wants to remain aboard with us until we return to freetown she has friends there that was as much information as she gave me adam said send somebody to call me if i can help and looked at murray directly at any time the surgeon touched his forehead sketching a salute but it was more than that aye aye sir his cabin door was still partly open and murray thought he heard her call out a little more strongly now he turned but the passageway was empty bolitho had gone on deck and not aft to his own quarters he was the captain again squire closed the telescope and slung it over his shoulder with the sun almost directly overhead and the heat oppressive it was hard to concentrate and he was boneweary after the bustle and excitement of their final approach and anchoring off new haven the ship seemed strangely still and quiet it was the afternoon watch but except for those required on duty most of onwards people were asleep and deserved it there was a lingering aroma of rum in the air an extra tot from the captain his way of saying thank you squire thought probably why bolitho had gone immediately ashore to pay his respects to the governor while his gigs crew were still smart and sober onward had anchored a cables length from the elbow of land julyan had described which shielded the anchorage beyond it had been an unusual experience with the sun so intense and the inshore water so clear it was possible to see the frigates shadow fulllength as she passed over some of the sandbars squire moved into the welcome shadow of the mizzen mast and glanced at the wheel it gave some hint of the current jerking slightly as if controlled by invisible helmsmen the anchorage was like a millpond and seemed a safe mooring but he knew two rivers converged here and emptied into the sea when the rains came it must be a real challenge for any master he had seen a few boats paddling out to investigate the frigate one or two coming close enough for those aboard to wave or hold up baskets of goods for sale or barterpottery vegetables and carvings for the most part but they kept their distance discouraged by seamen or marines stationed at intervals along either side bolitho had made it quite clear no one was to be allowed aboard this was an official visit and squire had seen the sealed package handed down to the gig before it had shoved off greetings from the admiral at freetown although squire had heard there was no love lost between rearadmiral langley and the governor here no doubt langley would be more concerned by onwards failure to appear within the time expected and if not his flag lieutenant would soon remind him if he valued his own future he felt his shoe stick to the deck seam the ship had been washed from beakhead to counter when they had altered course to enter the anchorage now even the scuppers were as dry as tinder he heard footsteps and turned to see the surgeon crossing the deck toward him avoiding the softened seams im afraid the captains still ashore doc not returning till the last dog as far as we know is something wrong murray was hatless and holding one hand across his eyes to shield them from the sun but the strain seemed to have fallen from his long face like a cloud this time its you i came to find he glanced incuriously toward the shore as if he had not seen it before experience or instinct i often ask myself where do we draw the line he turned his back on the land dismissing it she wants to see you although at this stage it might destroy any progress she has made such as it is squire said uncertainly i didnt realise she knew my name she did not but her description was enough murray paused will you see her it might do more harm than good squire muttered i dont know after what she went through and said nothing for a moment recalling her anguish and the brief moment of peace and communion when he had given her his coat to hide her shame from those trying to help her it might bring it all back when she sees me murray shrugged i dont know what the purser will say but i raided his slopchest for some clothing not what she has been used to but its fresh and clean it might make a difference squire waved to lieutenant sinclair who was speaking to some of his marines bob call me if im neededand indicated the surgeonyou know where ill be sinclair raised a hand and squire thought he had forgiven him for choosing his sergeant for the landing party instead it was cooler below deck but not much despite the hastily rigged windsails squire hardly noticed claire dundas might be feeling stronger safer but one sight of him and it could all be torn apart they reached the cabin door and murray exchanged a few words with one of his assistants who was rolling and repacking bandages like those they had carried in the cutter then to squire he said not too long and dont touch her before tapping at the door claire me again squire still hesitated for a moment he thought murray had left another one of his assistants here while he was on deck she was dressed in white the shirt probably a midshipmans fastened to her throat and breeches which had clearly been taken from the slopchest she was sitting upright in murrays armchair facing the door murray said dont keep the lieutenant too long claire hell be wanted on deck shortly and gestured to another chair call me if you require anything i have to pull out someones toothbut it will not take long it sounded like a warning to squire she said it was good of you to come and turned to watch murray depart he left the door open a lock of dark hair fell aside slightly and squire saw the bruise on her forehead i wanted to see you ive been wondering about you ever since he said nothing more recalling murrays warning you look wonderful he moved to the other chair and saw she was staring at the door again this was a mistake he had wanted to tell her he had thought of nothing else since she had been carried aboard she said softly i wanted to see you to explain her eyes were restless flickering around the cabin to thank you she looked at him suddenly after the way i treated you and the risks you took for us for me squire stood up and saw her tense as he took a small package from his pocket i wanted to bring you this he opened it carefully not looking at her perhaps he had already made things worse it was in my old coat he laid the bracelet on the table beside her i thought you might be looking for it she reached out her lips moving but he heard no words her hand faltered i thought theyd taken it then she shook her head heedless of the hair falling over her face no i remember putting it in your coat when you tried to help me she fumbled with the bracelet he gave it to me she was sobbing harshly but there were no tears squire wanted to help her but he heard the surgeons warning she was fumbling at her cuffs one after the other and he saw the thick bandages around her wrists he said carefully i can put it in the strongbox until she stared at him with that unnerving directness you keep it for me it will be safe with you she thrust the hair from her face until i leave the shiplieutenant squire she laid the unfastened bracelet on the table and he could see her shoulders beginning to quiver what do your friends call you friends he wanted to smile make a joke of it but nothing would come jamie she touched the bracelet and almost dropped it instinctively squire did not move but the restraint cost him more than murray would ever guess he felt her fingers on his as she laid the bracelet across his callused palm the door was slightly ajar and murrays voice said from beyond it i think youre needed on deck he came in glancing somewhere between them and its time you had a rest young lady he was holding a pair of felt slippers but first try these on for size tilley the sailmaker made a few alterations i made a sketch for him she leaned down and slid one onto her bare foot how wonderful please thank him for me will you she picked up the second slipper they were the kind worn by powdermonkeys whenever they were ordered to the magazine maddock the gunner was never without a pair himself to forget could invite disaster where one spark from the sole of an ordinary shoe might explode into an inferno she touched her cheek with the back of her hand so kind i dont know what to say murray turned and deliberately slipped his arm through squires but did not look at him weve not forgotten what it feels like to be young have we a warning between friends murray wanted to stop him from making a fool of himself before it was too late squire said if im wanted on deck but could not help looking back ill put the bracelet in the strongbox just in case she stared at him and nodded slowly i understand she did not smile thank you lieutenant like a door being slammed shut adam bolitho shifted slightly on the hot thwart to gaze at the full expanse of the anchorage as the gig pulled past the headland plenty of eyes must have observed onwards slow and cautious approach he had seen sunlight blinking from telescopes ashore and afloat most of the way a longboat had come out to meet them perhaps surprised that onward did not anchor closer to the shore with its scattering of buildings and long ungainly pier the boat had signalled for them to follow a uniformed figure standing to wave aside any dugout that hovered too closely the main fortification was timberbuilt with a stockade and a battery of small cannon in stark contrast the flag that flew above them making a brilliant splash of colour was the same as the one hoisted at onwards own jackstaff when her anchor had been secured maybe freetown had begun like this and other footholds in wilderness that rearadmiral langley would dismiss as the encroachment of empire jago said es turnin capn the other boat was losing way its oars in confusion the man in uniform was on his feet again bowing and baring his teeth in a grin at one end of the pier were more uniforms and barebacked figures who were apparently repairing the lower structure close to the water adam said you must stay in the boat this time im afraid he glanced along the slowmoving looms at the faces he knew so well ill send word if im delayed he felt the body beside him stir suddenly he had almost forgotten that monteith was aboard tense his sword gripped between his knees still going over the events at the mission doubts fears it was not possible to tell yet jago called oars he may have glanced at monteith but he did not wait monteith was after all in charge of the gig for this formal visit when he had been piped over the side one of the duty watch had slipped and allowed a coil of rope to fall across the gangway at any other time monteith would have yelled at him and for far less whatever it was it must have happened ashore squire had said nothing and jago would keep it to himself as usual unless the oars were inboard the bowmen hooked onto the pier another uniformed figure was peering down at them head and shoulders silhouetted against the sky adam stood up and reached for the thick envelope the reason for this visit he looked at jago remember what we talked about eh and jagos tanned face broke into a grin ol john allday would never forgive me capn some of the barebacked men on the lower pier had stopped work to look down at the gig and the newcomers there was a shout and the sharp crack of a whip the onlookers vanished adam glanced at monteith who had not moved ready he did not wait for an answer monteith was probably recalling their talk leadership by example he stared up at the pier angry with himself so do it he climbed up into the sunlight and felt the wood still wet under his hands it must have been scrubbed in readiness for their arrival monteith was close behind him perhaps relieved to be away from the gig which must be the key to whatever memories were remaining in his mind adam straightened as he was confronted by a stocky man in an unfamiliar green uniform the new haven militia a smart salute and a voice as english as one of his own seamens barked on behalf of the governor sir i am to bid you welcome he waited for monteith to join them if you will step this way sir adam looked back at the gig and saw jago nod that was all they walked along the pier some of the timber was scarred and wellused other sections looked freshly laid across from the anchorage there were low sheds along the distant waterfront slipways for building and launching coastal craft in a few years time this might become another freetown he quickened his pace their guide was keeping well ahead of them perhaps deliberately there were others working beneath the pier a guard too with a whip dangling across his shoulder the guide said felons sir and almost smirked no different from england they had reached the main building like the pier it must have seen faces from every part of the world your boats crew sir theyll not be coming ashore will they i dont intend to keep them waiting it came out more sharply than he had intended and adam saw the man flinch perhaps monteith was not the only one if youll come this way sir the guide broke off obviously disconcerted as someone stepped from the shadow of the broad entrance and came striding toward them my apologies sir duncani brought them along the pier adam was not sure what he had been expecting but sir duncan ballantyne was not it tall and lean he strode toward them both hands outstretched i should have sent one of our boats and not forced you to drag all the way along that relic he grasped adams hand and shook it vigorously apparently untroubled by the sun in his eyes captain bolitho he nodded toward the water and his majestys ship onwarda frigate no less we are indeed honoured ballantyne slipped his arm familiarly through adams something to kill our thirst would be in order he paused to say something to one of his men and adam took the opportunity to study him more closely the eyes were and the hair had once been as dark as his own he was said to be sixty years old but he had the bearing and agility of one much younger he was casually but adam guessed expensively dressed in riding breeches with tall boots that shone like glass and a silk cravat tucked into a matching shirt but the face told another story deeply tanned dominated by a strong nose and a beard neatly trimmed to contain the grey a face it would be impossible to forget it reminded him of some of the old paintings he had studied as a boy portraits of those who had defeated the armada ballantyne glanced casually at monteith you are welcome too of course you can amuse yourself while we talk and to adam something tells me that your visit will be a short one he took his arm again maybe next time eh inside the building he turned to face them i heard about the mission and i have sent some men to investigate the matter i knew william dundas of course not well but as much as he would allow his kind are always at risk as im sure you know he pushed open another door here it was cooler and a long bamboomounted fan was moving slowly back and forth on the ceiling ballantyne sat down and waved adam to another chair he said news travels fast in these parts and stamped one booted foot by horse and by coaster he waited while a black servant knelt to tug off his boots adam held out the envelope i was told to give this to you personally sir duncan and ballantyne wagged a finger at him not here together plain duncan will do well enough he laughed im not even used to the title myself yet he was turning over the envelope i can guess the contents for an admiral and the like freetown has become a steppingstone the silken shoulders lifted in a shrug to promotion or oblivion he leaned forward as another african entered carrying a silver tray and a pair of glasses the servant must have caught his foot on the carpet and the glasses clinked dangerously easy trusty take your time adam realised that he was quite young perhaps the same age as david napier he was nodding and smiling now the glasses safely deposited on a heartshaped wooden table an older man brought the wine adam rubbed his forehead he was still tired he had not even noticed monteith being shown to another adjoining room ballantyne sipped the wine slowly fair enough under the circumstances when they were alone again adam said how did he come by a name like trusty and for a moment he thought ballantyne would choke on his wine he laughed and dabbed his mouth hes a good fellow obedient loyal and usually careful he recovered i gave him the name trusty was my little pony given me by my old father when i was a lad i never forgot him i probably couldnt pronounce his real name even if i knew it adam had noticed how trusty had watched ballantynes mouth and monteiths too as he had left the room can he neither hear nor speak ballantyne was studying his glass he was involved in some kind of family feud in a village not far from here from which i rescued him he seemed to recall the question i believe him to be deaf and they tore out his tongue he turned frowning as someone else appeared in the doorway then he rose and strode across to him what is it now the newcomer was in uniform and adam thought senior to the man who had met them on the pier he could not hear what was being said but ballantyne was obviously displeased of course i have not forgotten i have been busy too and then no the captain will not be involved he waited for the door to close i sometimes have to ask myself then he smiled i must leave you and change he looked down at his immaculate breeches into something more formal i am required to attend an execution no time to show you the welcome i would have wished adam saw the boy trusty hurrying to find monteith responding to some signal from his master perhaps ballantyne really had forgotten his grisly appointment but it seemed unlikely he was regarding the empty glasses on the table and the admirals sealed envelope still unopened beside them i cant tell you how much i regret this interruption he tapped the envelope i shall of course reply to this when i have given it some thought he paused rivalry is no bad thing it can often be the spur when one is needed he reached out and took adams hands in a grip like iron meeting you albeit briefly has meant so very much to me i hope it will not be long before we greet one another again this is not a race were on the same journey he laughed given the chance they walked out into the sunlight and adam was surprised to see that the gig had moved to a smaller jetty almost hidden by the line of guns ballantyne said i sent word to your crew one walk along our pier is enough for anybody next time adam remember adam walked slowly toward the jetty strangely unwilling to leave without understanding why so many questions remained unanswered and he knew they were both to blame monteith hurried from somewhere to join him he sounded out of breath only just told you were leaving sir adam shaded his eyes to gaze up at the flag again and beyond to the clouds gathering on the horizon a chance not to be missed for several reasons we will upanchor directly and be clear of the land before dark he could still hear ballantynes words this is not a race he had known of william dundass death at the mission but had not mentioned his daughter claire neither did i he stared across the burning water and saw onward for the first time he must find time to prepare himself langley would want all the details and the results if any and his impressions of sir duncan ballantyne too more formally dressed as he watched an execution jago was on his feet hat in hand the gigs crew sitting with their arms folded he swore under his breath as monteith hesitated and almost stumbled while he moved aside for the captain didnt he know after all this time that a captain was always the last to enter and the first to leave his boat maybe hed been having a few too many wets ashore not likely a real drink might kill him but he forgot monteith as he watched bolitho pause and look back at the thatched building with the flag flying above it they had been together longer than many he thought back over their talk about promotion a conversation they had had more than once and about the life they shared luke jago was sharing it now he could see it on the captains face like all those other times out oars adam turned toward him until their eyes met another bloody friday jago thought justice or revenge hugh morgan the cabin servant lurked behind his pantry door and watched his captains shadow move past pacing toward the stern windows again after all their months together he thought he knew most of bolithos moods with onward cleared for action and shuddering to the crash and thunder of a broadside or reeling through a storm in biscay or the western approaches or simply waiting like this on edge without knowing why they had entered harbour quite early in the forenoon watch with all the usual bustle and what seemed conflicting orders to the stamp of feet and sound of gear being hauled across the deck above and other shouted demands now it was afternoon and would soon be the first dog watch morgans ears recorded these things without careful attention they were part of his daily life he had been on deck when they had entered harbour the experience was always different even the harbour itself and the anchorage seemed larger than when they had left it for the outpost optimistically called new haven he had already heard several of the sailors suggesting other less pleasant names for it the guardboat had guided them to their new anchorage closer to the moored flagship medusa morgan had heard luke jago remark that it would be harder for the admiral to launch another surprise attack without being spotted by the duty watch he had said a few other things too less polite jago might be a brave and loyal friend to his captain but he would never be asked to wait and serve at the table the officer in the guardboat had apparently brought word from the flagship requesting bolithos presence aboard during the afternoon watch the admiral was otherwise engaged with important visitors he clucked with disapproval what did the admiral think he was saying the landing party the slaughter at the mission the sea burials and the captain was still waiting dress uniform coat folded over a chair sword and belt lying across the bergere where the admiral had sprawled during his visit ill wager his servant could tell a few tales if he ever got the chance the shadow stopped moving and morgan opened the pantry door can i tempt you with something sir a glass maybe adam shook his head although he appeared more relaxed i expect the admiral is reading my report unless the officer of the guard dropped it overboard morgan sniffed and brushed some invisible dust off the small desk more likely the admiral was still enjoying a lavish meal with his guests morgan had made a habit of studying the various officers he had served over the years and considered himself to be quite an expert at it when he had been on the quarterdeck briefly this morning it had been a case in point a new frigate was anchored in onwards previous place a fifthrate of thirtyeight guns so new in fact that she was not yet fully registered in the navy list described only as portsmouth building her name zealous was shining in the early sunlight he had heard bolitho say a fine command for somebody a lucky man whoever he is julyan the sailing master was more outspoken as usual has a friendly hand on his shoulder if you ask me morgan had seen the first lieutenants face at that moment clearly recalling how close he might have come to being given command of onward adam walked to the centre of the cabin and glanced up at the partly opened skylight he could smell fresh paint one of the cutters was being freshened up after running aground during the landing drummond the bosun silencing a few audible grumbles with keep you out of trouble for a bit longer eh so unlike new haven here the local boats pulled and paddled as close to the warships as they dared displaying their wares and offering their services in a couple of craft each with the sternsheets protected by screens there had been women reclining and smiling drummond had said youll get more than a smile if you take a run ashore with any of that lot adam had reached the stern windows again and stared across the water toward the other frigate to casual onlookers she might appear a twin of onward he could remember morgan called the surgeon sir the sentry was holding the screen door wide open and adam could see members of a working party lingering and watching as murray took the young womans hand to guide her over the coaming murray said i was just told sir and stood aside for her to enter the cabin otherwise i would have waited adam held out his hands a boat has arrived for you i sent word earlier he felt her hands close around his they were warm now but she was shivering it is what you wanted isnt it she nodded slowly the hair on her forehead parting to reveal the bruise it is for the best my friends there will expect it after that i will have to make plans he walked with her to the stern i am waiting to present myself to the admiral otherwise id escort you in person she gazed unblinkingly at the waterfront and the buildings shimmering in the heat i can see the parent mission from here my father was once she did not finish it so goodbye captain bolitho i will not forget you or your men morgan stood by the screen door blocking it and muttering angrily to someone outside then he turned and said apologetically the ladys boat is alongside sir he peered around is there anything i can do she was about to say something then her expression changed my bracelet your lieutenant found it and put it in the strongbox she unfastened her cuff and touched the bandage all my worldly goods they walked away from the cabin toward the shaft of sunlight streaming down the companion ladder adam offered his arm but she said i can manage captain then she twisted round toward him one day the silence was intense as if the ship was holding her breath she smiled i am ready drummond was here now his silver call swinging from his neck sorry sir took me all aback adam was still not accustomed to him as bosun but it was rare to see drummond disconcerted by anything or any one they climbed into the light where some of the senior hands had formed an impromptu guard of honour to the gangway and a bosuns chair had been rigged by the entry port somebody ran from the opposite side and slithered to a halt it was midshipman hotham a signal slate wedged beneath one arm he could barely take his eyes from the girl in sailors garb signal from flag sir captain to repair on board he swallowed shall i acknowledge sir nobody moved and adam heard the newly arrived boat being warped closer alongside he took her arm and turned her toward the watching faces he said quietly let him wait someone had climbed up from the boat and was holding out some sort of afternoon shawl and a widebrimmed straw hat with ribbons claire spoke to him by name as she tied the ribbons beneath her chin she waved the shawl aside i feel more suited to this thank you she was still smiling but very close to breaking down vicary the purser pushed some seamen aside and held out a small package from the strongbox maam he smiled also which was rare for him i was asked to make certain you received it she said nothing gazing past him toward the boat tier squire was standing there with his working party all of whom were waiting simply to see her depart adam knew it was as near as squire would come and that murray was hovering watchfully and yet it was as if they were alone together she unwrapped the bracelet and held it as though for squire to see then she kissed it and put it inside her midshipmans shirt two seamen helped her climb into the bosuns chair others seized the tackle and waited for the order to hoist a voice yelled hoarsely give er a cheer onwards we dont want er to go the response was immediate and deafening even the cook and his helpers emerged from cover and were waving and shouting with the rest adam felt her gripping his arm as if unable to break the final contact her dark eyes were filling her face across the water men aboard the new frigate had manned the side to join in the farewell although they could not have understood it she said i pray that if we meet again she could not continue but pulled adams hand to her mouth and kissed it then she waved at the upturned faces and tensed holding tightly as drummond shouted easy lads hoist away her shadow crossed the hammock nettings and dipped slowly over the side only then did murray speak a brave young woman she wasnt expecting a farewell like that i shall join her now but he lingered watching the men beginning to disperse some still peering down at the boat with its insignia a blue osprey painted on either bow some of them had already seen it at the smouldering mission amidst its grisly remains i shall miss her and thats the truth murray strode toward the entry port without looking back vincent had climbed onto the gangway and beyond him adam could see the royal marine guard and side party already in position when you are ready sir morgan had brought the sword and helped him to adjust it his face troubled routine was taking over again and most of the decks were clear adam glanced aft where squire was now standing alone looking toward the shore once he raised his arm as if to wave but let it fall back to his side her boat was well clear by now and adam saw murray sitting beside her in the sternsheets she did not turn her head he walked toward the entry port where drummond and his mates were waiting calls moistened and poised attention on the upper deck adam returned the salutes and raised his hat to the flag as he went down the side where jago had moored the gig without wasting a moment always with one eye on the flagship busy day capn and not over yet but adams eyes were still on the other boat even as it disappeared beyond a clutter of moored barges jago waited until he was seated before adding warily shell be lookin for justice i reckon his words were almost lost in the ripple of movement beneath the gig but moments like these were never shared and the captain knew it he realised that adam had turned to face him and his voice was cold and calm if she were my girl only revenge would suffice welcome back captain bolitho the flag lieutenant touched his hat as adam walked away from medusas entry port and the stamp and shrill of salutes the first lieutenant was in charge and had explained that captain tyacke was escorting the admirals visitors ashore he seemed surprised and pleased that adam had remembered his name when they had only met once and very briefly the flag lieutenant turned aft and said we have all been extremely busy one bell chimed from the forecastle the admiral will receive you now they had reached the shadow of the poop when he added suddenly i watched you enter harbour and anchor today it was later than expected of course adam retorted we were quite busy too it must have taken more out of him than he knew forgive me no reason to bite your head off the lieutenant said with dignity i was going to say sir that i read your report it made me very proud two royal marines snapped to attention one shouting captain bolitho sir the flag lieutenant murmured i shall be close by if im needed sir and effaced himself a servant adam did not recognise opened the screen door to the great cabin and he saw rearadmiral giles langley sprawled in a deep leather chair beneath the skylight his heavy coat with the gold epaulettes tossed across a cabinet and his discarded shoes even further away as if he had kicked them off langley did not stand up instead he waved languidly toward another chair and said come and take the weight off your feet bolitho he patted the front of his own straining waistcoat grinning not that you need to by the look of it he snapped his fingers a glass for the captain and laughed but broke off in a fit of coughing an another for me i deserve it adam looked around the cabin it was much as he remembered it but the stern windows were not now hidden by curtains and the sun reflecting from the anchorage seemed dazzling langleys fair hair had been neatly trimmed and was even shorter than on the previous visit and his eyes were gleaming like blue glass in the glare the servant had been carrying out a wastebasket the contents of which might have been bottles langley and his guests had not been too busy with affairs to enjoy themselves langley patted the arms of his chair what dyou think of this beauty got the idea after visiting onward his mood changed just as quickly i read your report of course just as well i sent you down there otherwise it might have taken months before the facts became known he frowned so deeply that his eyes almost vanished and the missionarys daughter ashore now recovering he did not wait for an answer a habit of his apparently probably never will he dabbed his eyes there to help others but when they need it this is too often their reward she is at the osprey mission sir hmph best solution a civil matter as far as were concerned our work is still at the sharp end he heaved himself abruptly from his new chair and took several deep breaths and you spoke with sir duncan ballantyne he moved to the broad stern windows and leaned against a frame gave nothing away i take it hes sent some of his militia to the mission until yes yes but whats he like friend or foe or just another opportunist lining his pockets under the kings protection the servant padded softly back into the cabin and placed two crystal goblets on a table langley turned sharply over here man and adam could see the sweat shining on his forehead the servant was filling the glasses brandy he had smelled it as soon as the door had opened for him you can leave it langleys mood seemed to change again and he waved his goblet expansively toward the harbour what d you think of that new frigate eh a damn fine sight especially these days his first command too some of the brandy was running down his wrist staining his sleeve tyacke was probably used to this sort of behaviour he could cope with just about everything adam said who is her captain sir langley shrugged vaguely somebody called de vere george de vere know him there was an admiral de vere but langley snorted with laughter his uncle no less fair sailing for some eh he swung round angrily and snapped what is it now dammit you dont buy a dog and bark yourself do you it was the flag lieutenant i am very sorry sir i didnt mean to interrupt well you have whats so important this time he attempted to thrust his foot into one of the shoes and almost lost his balance the flag lieutenant said onwards surgeon is come aboard sir he did not take his eyes off the admiral but he was speaking to adam he wishes to see the captain langley grunted sawbones i hate em then he waved dismissively well send him in murray stepped into the cabin and bowed ever so slightly my apologies sir he was looking at adam i thought it might be urgent sir i gathered that langley had picked up a telescope and was training it toward something on the frigates quarter murray said in a low voice we had almost reached the osprey stairs when he paused as the telescope stopped moving i thought she was having a relapse i had to restrain her he glanced at langleys powerful shoulders framed against the restless water she had seen a ship she seemed to recognise said it had been near the mission its here now langley lowered the telescope shes quite sure of that women often make mistakes about he snapped the telescope shut and strode across the cabin dundass daughter where is she now murray said with me sir langley sat down well that will have all the tongues wagging i was careful sir but langley was already on his feet again and shes the only available witness he returned to the quarter windows today of all bloody days he turned his face in shadow she will have to identify the vessel herself murray said curtly i am not at all certain we can ask that of her langley snapped dont ask tell her and looked up at the skylight suddenly calm again you are my senior captain bolitho until james tyacke returns and you are directly involved in any case his mouth moved in what might have been a smile but adam could not see the expression in his eyes i leave it in your hands but this is not a battle remember i shall send word sir the flag lieutenant followed them from the cabin still glancing nervously over his shoulder adam said i shall want my gig and to murray i am sorry you had to endure that murray walked lightly keeping pace his hawkish profile withdrawn i am still not convinced i doubt she would have been mistaken so lets find out shall we medusas first lieutenant was waiting for them on deck your gig is here sir and to murray the schooner you were asking about is the delfim came in yesterday taking on cargo he looked toward the flag lieutenant who was still hovering nearby as if listening for a summons from aft adam saw jago standing in the gig two of his crew holding the hull steady the first lieutenant added delfim is under portuguese colours sir he shaded his eyes to look across the water at onward do you need some extra hands adam shook his head time might be getting short he was thinking aloud a few spare cutlasses would be welcome good as done sir he gestured to a bosuns mate what about the young lady adam said im afraid shes a part of it and looked over at the gig once more claire was sitting in the sternsheets the widebrimmed hat obscuring her face she could have been an ordinary passenger even the oarsmen were sitting on their thwarts apparently unconcerned watch your step sir the officer of the guard will be doing his rounds in the last dog adam walked to the side i hope it wont come to that nobody moved as he climbed down the side there was no ceremonial this time murray followed him into the boat and sat beside claire dundas i am not in favour of her coming to confront these people the widebrimmed hat turned slightly i want to be with you she said dont you see adam leaned over but did not touch her she was very calm even her breathing was controlled he said trust me and thought he saw jago nod trust us they were moving and faces were watching them from the flagships open gunports men stopping work on the forecastle to saunter alongside keeping pace until the gig gathered speed it had to be now few secrets in a busy harbour could be kept for long the girl reached out and laid her open hand flat on murrays arm if he covered it with his own and said only when they were pulling abeam of some moored lighters and there was the delfim lying alongside another landingstage she was a topsail schooner which properly handled could give a larger vessel even a frigate a run for her money the small figurehead the girl must have seen and remembered was a leaping dolphin like a miniature replica of onwards own a barebacked figure was stooping beneath the foremast polishing something that occasionally caught the sunlight he did not look at the gig some tackle was already coiled nearby the loading or unloading was finished adam stared along the boat watching the regular stroke of oars the familiar faces looking aft but somehow avoiding his eyes jago said theyve got a brow lowered capn larboard side forrard adam glanced at the tapering bowsprit and the gleam of water between hull and scarred timbers he snapped now jago was ready swinging the tillerbar hard over before easing it against his hip his eyes fixed on the narrowing gap ahead boat yer oars he swore under his breath stand by to fend off forrard but for some it was already too late an oar blade splintered before it could be withdrawn and one of the bowmen was struck by his loom as it jammed in its rowlock and was sent sprawling adam clambered over the side and steadied himself against the end of the brow a grapnel slithered past him but held fast as the seamen hurried to join him each one snatching a cutlass as he jumped ashore one man stayed in the gig with murray and the girl there were shouts and the sounds of running feet and adam saw men coming from aft something slithered over the side a boathook or boarding pike it was gone adam reached the top of the brow and heard someone yell in english its the navy fer christs sake others had appeared on deck staring at the sailors and the bared cutlasses and one said what is the meaning of this adam rested his hand on his undrawn sword are you the master the man shook his head staring at adams uniform noting his rank bosun he waved vaguely at his men an most of them are portuguese he folded his arms this vessel is registered as such then he twisted round as he noticed the three people still in the gig whats all this a joke or somethin jago called in position capn the bosun said hoarsely youre goin to be real sorry for this captain i command here the newcomer had appeared through a hatch half dressed with a towel hanging carelessly around his neck he was pulling it slowly up and down i am pecco his eyes flicked around at the armed seamen arthur pecco and who might you be may i ask a full captain no less he did not wait for a reply i know this intrusion is your right and i understand in these difficult times we have finished loading he shrugged coconut oil you can look for yourselves if you must but i am about to step ashore we sail tomorrow he made a crude gesture at one of the crew dont stand there dreaming miguel work adam said i wish to see your charts and the log adam heard murray clear his throat and when he had adams attention he gave an imperceptible shake of the head the girl had boarded also and was standing a pace behind him gazing fixedly at the schooners master so if you will excuse me captain i have work to do he grinned and dabbed his cheek with the towel there was a trace of blood on it like facing an enemy adam thought out of nowhere gunports open ready to fire and in his mind he saw luke jago razor poised for the muchneeded shave he said did your man have a beard claire what the bloody hell are you saying ill see you broken for this jago was there keep yer mouth shut mister pecco the girls voice was very quiet but not subdued yes its him i should have known immediately what is she saying it was almost a scream adam put out his hand protectively but she was very calm and her eyes remained on pecco she said softly i remember the beard how could i forget her fingers were unfastening the buttons of her shirt and before adam or murray could stop her she had dragged it down over her shoulders and turned them toward him i felt it when you did this to me she tore the dressing away so that the scars seemed raw and untreated where she had been bitten she was saying almost to herself he was the first she did not look down as murray gently fastened her shirt then he watched the others adam said sharply search him he beckoned to one of his men take a message to the officer of the guard jago said here now by the sound of it capn there was a jacket in his hand but he was holding up a medallion on a thin chain yours missy she snatched it and pressed it to her lips my fathers the delfims master tried to push one of the seamen aside youll never prove a charge of slavery against me jago seized his arm and twisted it behind him no need matey youll swing for murder murray had managed to pacify the girl and had seated her on a hatch cover he pulled a flask from his pocket and said against doctors orders but it will help there were more shouts as booted feet thudded across the brow and onto the deck marines murray said ill take you to the mission claire its safe now she was staring at the scarlet uniforms as they hurried past and whispered wheres the one you call jamie then she collapsed adam saw murray supporting her head on his folded coat while he murmured and stroked the hair gently from her face up to us now sir and adam heard the voice in his mind respond it is up to me captain james tyacke waited for his cabin door to close then seized adams hand and shook it warmly i hate to drag you aboard at this hour ive only just returned myself he strode to the stern windows and stared across the water it was still broad daylight but darkness came suddenly and they both knew that all the lanterns would be burning within the hour in another part of the flagships hull someone was singing in time to the scrape of a violin tyacke said to the window our lord and master has gone ashore again i dont know where the man finds the strength and faced adam once more i heard about this proposed passage in delfim i think youve done more than enough already he half smiled i wish i was going with you adam said quietly ive chosen some good hands and im leaving my first lieutenant to carry the load vincent a good fellow adam recalled vincents expression when he had been told he was far from pleased youll take extra care i hope tyacke might have been thinking aloud that poor woman you rescuedis she reliable adam thought of her confrontation with pecco if that was his real name the naked courage in her face i trust her tyacke looked at him keenly eyes very blue in the ruined face ill make damn sure no unauthorised vessel leaves harbour before or when you do he tugged out his watch and opened its cover meanwhile ill be right here then youve been a flag captain yourself so i dont have to remind you if you do the right thing your superiors will get the credit if you fail youll take the blame he closed the watch gently and held it for a moment a gift from sir richard bless him they walked to the door together it was time adam said and these important guests of the admirals hard going was it tyacke was feeling his pocket as if to ensure that the watch was secure guests useless popinjays as far as hes concerned only one of them matters just between ourselves he paused ill leave you here then seemed to recall what he had been about to say the honourable sir charles godden no less i see youve heard of him adam said nothing well hes now become head of the first lords advisory staff member of parliament as well so our lord and master may have other things on his mind it was like hearing duncan ballantynes own words promotion or oblivion adam clipped the sword to his belt and said sir richard is still with both of us he was suddenly impatient to begin blade to blade lieutenant james squire stifled a curse as he stubbed his foot against an iron ringbolt by the time they all became used to the commandeered schooner the whole affair would be over he tugged down his hat to shade his eyes from the reflected glare and examined her critically she was about eighty feet in length and twenty at her beam he stifled a yawn and it was not even the forenoon watch they had cast off at an hour most landsmen would still consider the dead of night even the sounds had seemed louder squealing blocks and muffled oaths as they edged away from other sleeping vessels and hoisted the big gaffheaded mainsail it had taken time as all but a handful of delfims original crew were ashore under lock and key culprits or hostages their fate would be decided later he tried not to look at the schooners master standing beside bolitho and an armed seaman another footstep interrupted his thoughts this time it was murray the surgeon they had all been too busy to speak much but squire had asked him about claire dundas murray had evaded the question saying only in good hands or a very brave young woman in other words nothing it was one of the seamen who had described the moment when pecco had been identified as the man who had gone to the mission and raped her like a wild beast bolitho had not mentioned it he was embarking on a chance operation which might prove either dangerous or complete folly squire unslung the telescope from his shoulder and trained it toward the coast in the far distance an uneven panorama of green and brown with the hint of misty grey further inland that might have been a mountain ridge and to starboard the endless ocean he saw some of onwards seamen resetting staysail and jib christie a senior gunners mate shouted move yer bloody selves gawd elp us if we runs into some real sailors it was oddly reassuring to hear them laugh he looked at the compass beneath the sails shadow one of peccos men was at the spokes and bolitho and tozer masters mate were comparing notes he thought again about the mission the girl struggling in his arms her shock and incredulity when he had wrapped his coat around her she must have been expecting another assault jago appeared in an open hatchway grinning and hitting a metal basin with a ladle up spirits lads an even wider grin stand fast the oly ghost the ageold signal for a rum issue but it could still bring some smiles squire saw some of them lift their tots like salutes as bolitho walked past them but what was he thinking did he fear failure or personal loss or death and what of his lovely young wife i need you in the chart space james his tanned face relaxed into a smile or should i say jamie later squire was still remembering it with a mixture of embarrassment and pride no wonder men would follow their captain to the gates of hell so would i luke jago leaned against the bulwark chatting idly to the gunners mate crouched beside one of the delfims stocky twelvepounders she mounted eight of them all carronades four on either side in these waters every vessel needed some kind of protection if the worst happened and it was certainly possible jago was past being surprised by anything christie glanced up at him quizzically load em with canister the capn says close action d you reckon jago swore and slapped an insect crawling across his bare arm catch bloody fever more like ted christie looked toward one of the main hatch covers i went below with mr squire shes bigger than she looks mixed cargo passengers mebbeeor slaves he lowered his voice what d you think luke jago watched the schooners master pecco being taken forward under arms id trust a rat from the bilges more n that scumbag he touched the hilt of his heavy cutlass one sign o treachery an e gets it first then the sharks can ave im christie grinned glad youre on our side then he murmured heads up it was lieutenant sinclair who with twenty of onwards royal marines had been ferried aboard at nightfall he looked like a stranger in a grubby shirt without his scarlet coat and smart crossbelt but somehow he was still a royal marine he seemed preoccupied in making sure that his men were as comfortable as they could be below deck and they obviously respected him jago shook his head as an officer sinclair glanced at the nearest twelvepounder and said casually if we get that close ill be relying on our bayonets he sounded almost unconcerned not much of a choice matey jago thought sourly sinclair was saying well be tipping some of the cargo over the side soon give us a bit more freeboard well need it when we move closer inshore he strode away smartly not a bad fellow christie said and paused they chorused together for a lobster a voice or perhaps a touch on his outthrust arm and adam bolitho was instantly awake he did not recall the moment he had fallen asleep so many times so many different ships faces demands it seemed completely dark then he realised that the only lantern was closeshuttered and what light remained was partly hidden by the figure bending over him it was murray his hawkish face in shadow he said only squire said to call you sir adam cleared his throat it was painfully dry thank you doc all quiet it was something to say to give himself time while the shipboard sounds and movements brought him back to reality and purpose the chair in which he had fallen asleep was as hard as iron but sleep was necessary for him and for those who might have to depend on his ability when the time came today murray said no trouble sir but trust would be something else again adams eyes flicked around the boxlike cabin the chart space where pecco the schooners master lived his solitary life adam had examined the available charts and the crude map pecco had drawn for him like a flaw in the coastline with a protective scattering of tiny islets that might spell disaster for any larger vessel or complete stranger he had discussed his final plans with squire and tozer the masters mate pecco insisted he knew nothing about any slavers only that he had heard it was a regular and safe rendezvous for several of them he had offered the information as if bargaining for his own security but would be doomed anyway if the slavers or those who controlled them ever learned of it adam said i have no choice but trust has to play its part im afraid murray straightened up and reached for his familiar satchel ill be ready captain he moved away out of the lantern light and halted seventyodd years ago my grandfathers trusted in loyalty and obedience at culloden the door creaked open and jago peered in at them standin by he glanced at the uniform coat which was hanging from the deckhead not this time eh capn adam faced him they might have been alone together the marines squatting outside the cabin invisible dont you ever change luke he picked up his sword and added curtly be ready with the flag he felt his way to the ladder and opened the hatch the sky was still black so that the tall spread of canvas stood out like wings against a sprinkling of pale stars there was no moon the compass light was tiny but by its faint light adam saw the faces turn toward him as he appeared on deck all the previous day from the moment they had cleared the approaches to freetown they had sighted no other vessel large or small somewhere far astern was a brigantine named peterel but captain tyacke had made sure no other ship would leave harbour in an attempt to overtake this schooner to divert it or warn others of their intention within the hour the dawn would show another empty sea and a stretch of coast unknown except to the few who had braved it some of them to their cost squire called hoarsely sou west by south sir steady she goes but it sounded like a question adam plucked the shirt away from his skin it felt clammy almost cold bring our prisoner on deck he walked a few paces to the side and stared toward a mass of land darker than the darkness one of the islets he had checked and checked again with the masters mate breathing down his neck they had no option a straightforward and safe approach would be seen immediately by any vessel anchored there even delfims master seemed uncertain he looked along the deck faintly visible now in the first paleness of the coming day a few dark shapes were standing or sitting in readiness to shorten sail to alter course and if so ordered to fight all carronades loaded sir canister that was christie gunners mate one of the shadows he heard squire clear his throat as he stood beside the compass box keeping his distance or unwilling to distract him he looked toward the land again and thought he could see it lying like an unbroken barrier beyond the finshaped jib i am here captain are you ready pecco moved closer to the compass and tapped it with his knuckles adam thought he saw one of the nearby seamen reach out as if to prevent him pecco said i gave my word captain will you give yours any aid you give will be made clear in my report pecco breathed out slowly then i must take the helm captain i have the feel of her adam could sense both squire and tozer watching him their lives too were at stake he saw pecco look up at the canvas still taut despite the nearness of land and heard him say quietly i had no part in the killings at the mission he might have shrugged and the woman maybe i had a few drinks too many at least she is alive he eased the wheel to starboard and leaned forward to watch the compass south southwest he lifted his eyes briefly from the compass and seemed to grimace not an easy passage the canvas reacted very slightly until the schooner was back on course the sound was not loud enough to muffle a metallic click as the armed seaman cocked his musket deep ten the call came from forward as one of onwards best leadsmen took his first sounding he barely raised his voice but in the tense silence it was as if he had shouted pecco muttered you take no chances captain adam gazed up at the masthead beyond the tattered portuguese flag and saw the first hint of blue it was unnerving with the sky almost hidden by the land as it crept out of the dimness like a groping arm or a trap if the wind holds captain we might need to shorten sail we must alter course very soon now we will sight a wreck to larboard pecco even sounded as if he were smiling if some fool has not removed it by the mark seven adam remembered other times in other ships when he had seen the vessels own shadow passing over the seabed not merely a warning but a threat he could sense the others moving closer even murray watching and recalling his own retort about loyalty and culloden by the mark five the leadsman was wasting no time skilled enough to make an underhand swing with his leadandline he was feeling his way thirty feet beneath the keel and the next cry and now captain the wheel was turning steadily to larboard as if they were steering headlong toward solid ground adam tried to see the chart in his mind and remember the sketches made by the man who was at the wheel beside him he had nothing more to lose but his life he swung round as the wheel began to turn faster pecco was using all his strength there was a glint of light from the compass box then like a curtain being dragged aside the sun was upon them pecco shouted now and tozer joined him adding his weight and experience as the spokes were dragged in the opposite direction there in the sun between mainland and islet was the shining curve of the channel the tall sails hardly appeared to shift a squarerigger would have been hard aground by now adam heard jago urging more hands to trim the staysail and jib and as they ran to obey some fell headlong over yet another unfamiliar obstacle pecco steadied the wheel and looked up at the flag never easy then his eyes met adams i know what you thought it was in my heart he watched tozer take over the wheel and added simply remember that when the time comes adam trained his telescope on the widening stretch of water directly ahead he did not recall having picked it up and was disconcerted by the surprising heat of the metal and the dryness of his throat pecco was clinging to a backstay his face devoid of expression neither guilt nor triumph and there fine on the larboard bow was the wreck it must have caught fire before running aground in the shallows it lay like a blackened carcass the timbers like charred ribs nobody spoke or moved as they glided past and when the leadsman called from the forecastle it seemed an intrusion an deep ten they were through undetected and ahead was the sheltered inlet it needed skill and strong nerves but there always had to be a first time adam raised the telescope again and saw the nearest beach leap into focus in the lens some ragged undergrowth almost to the waters edge in places elsewhere pebbles washed white by sun and salt his grip tightened two canoes pulled well clear of the water furrows in the sand where they had been dragged ashore recently seen them afore capn it was jago powerful arms crossed but fingers still close to the cutlass the canoes were typical of those used to ferry wretched captives from stream or beach to the ship destined to carry them into slavery adam could never understand how so many survived slavers were known to sail from this coastline to destinations as far away as cuba and brazil it was inhuman beyond belief pecco said suddenly another two miles maybe less he spread his hands there may be nothing to discover jago murmured then pray you bastard squire strode aft i have two good lookouts aloft and both boats ready for lowering theres not much else adams expression silenced him if i should fall he said squire said only then ill be lying there beside you they both looked in the direction of the forecastle as the leadsman completed another sounding by the mark it was as far as he got the explosion was more like an echo than gunfire and for a few seconds adam was reminded of the early fogwarnings the maroons he used to hear as a child in cornwall local fishermen always claimed they did more harm than good squire exclaimed so much for trust and was reaching for his pistol even as adam stepped between him and pecco who was cupping his hands around his eyes and shaking his head in protest no no not us captain lookouts in the hills he gestured wildly if a trap was intended they would have been waiting in the channel now his eyes were fixed on the barrel of squires pistol i tell the truth adam said slowly another ship my guess is shes captain tyackes brigantine a few more seconds while he groped for the name the peterel squire uncocked his pistol and thrust it into his belt he said not looking at pecco your lucky day pecco said i have done all i can he pushed past two seamen and vomited in the scuppers adam swallowed and looked away forcing himself to concentrate on the strip of headland which was tilting toward a widening expanse of water beyond the jib warn all hands below jago said done capn aside to the gunners mate he added softly now or never eh ted after the slow and torturous passage pastand sometimes amongthe offshore islets their arrival was startling in its suddenness from delfims deck the anchorage was a lagoon as large as an enclosed lake but from the yards and upper shrouds the keeneyed lookouts could see the final outcroppings of land and beyond like a bluegrey barrier the great ocean once lying here a ship would be invisible to any passing patrol or casual trader in the strengthening sunlight the water seemed calm and unmoving but the sails were taut and straining and the tattered portuguese flag was streaming adam moved a few paces away from the wheel and trained his telescope across and ahead of their course individual faces stood out gazing at the islets or beyond at the green mass of the mainland one frowning in concentration or apprehension another with lips pursed in a silent whistle men he had grown to know and understand who trusted him because they had no choice and the doubts which always remained in close company the ambush when you least expected it like his own if i should fall who else would these men look to he thought again of his uncle sir richard bolitho his last words on that fateful day we always knew his coxswain john allday had heard him and james tyacke had written it in the flagships log immediately after the action we always knew he wiped his smarting eye with the back of his hand and focused again and for a moment imagined his mind was too strained to concentrate a ship was almost broadsideon filling and overlapping the field of view stark against a backdrop of trees and a narrow strip of beach he held his breath and steadied the glass he was not mistaken some of the trees merged with the ship loose branches which were lashed to her yards and shrouds a simple camouflage but enough to confuse even the most experienced lookout aboard a passing manofwar or the brigantine peterel which tyacke had sent to offer support if required he held out the telescope to squire we were right he heard him adjusting the glass but held the image in his mind the crude but effective disguise some fronds and loose fragments in the water alongside drifting slowly clear or already snared by her anchor cable she was preparing to get under way to escape she was a big schooner threemasted unusual in these waters and she looked almost cumbersome in this confined anchorage but once out on the ocean and under full sail she would soon show her paces adam peered at the compass and saw tozer give him an assertive nod very calm julyan would be proud of him squire said shes moored from aft too not enough room to swing adam took the telescope still warm from squires grip no more time the big schooners stem and foremast loomed into view there were men hurrying about her deck and the anchor cable was already bartaut and possibly moving someone running across the forecastle slithered to a halt peering toward delfim which would be fully visible by now a flash of light and another telescopes being trained but little else tozer muttered they know this ship right enough adam turned as a seaman shouted what th hell stop him pecco ignored the muskets as he ran to the side and yelled no stop luis and something in portuguese one of delfims crew had broken free and was waving his arms and shouting until a sailor leaped from behind the capstan belaying pin swinging like a club and brought him down pecco stood looking at the man sprawling by his feet you were wrong adam trained his telescope on the other schooner once more there were men already aloft on the yards and others manning the braces as if nothing untoward had happened but the main deck was not cleared for sea even as he watched he saw naked bodies africans scrambling up from holds and hatchways some driven by whips and blows others clinging to one another with terror squire exclaimed slaves the bastard what better cover then their anchors hove short sir he glanced bitterly at the compass those scum know we cant open fire with all those poor devils as targets adam looked at the sails and the vessel anchored across the gleam of open water beyond the last islet and once able to make full sail he said clear lower deck and saw jago watching him waiting as if he knew run up the colours he moved closer to the wheel even as a call shrilled from below delfims deck as if she were indeed a kings ship shes upanchored sir adam had already seen the big schooners topsails come alive a long masthead pendant reaching out like a lance there was a bang and the deck quivered under his feet do we fight em sir adam glanced at pecco stand by were going to board them right now more shots and he saw that the slavers topmen had been joined by others with muskets he felt a few of the balls hitting the deck jagged splinters lifting like quills as seamen and marines ducked for cover he knew the gunners mate was crouching by the forward carronade never taking his eyes from him even as someone cried out and fell nearby and remained there motionless adam shouted full elevation christie knock out all the quoins and saw him nod teeth bared in concentration without the wedgeshaped quoins beneath their breeches the stocky twelvepounders should rake the rigging and yards leaving the hostages untouched the first carronade responded instantly bringing down most of the remaining branches and foliage and blasting away some of the shrouds three bodies fell to the deck below or into the water alongside pecco face desperate was hauling down the portuguese flag flinching as the second carronade fired and ripped into the big schooners topsails between shots they could hear the shouts and screams of the slaves who had been herded between forecastle and mainmast then they were silent shock or disbelief and perhaps the sight of the white ensign and whatever it might mean to them adam felt a shot hammer into the planking near him but he did not move nothing else mattered now wheel hard astarboard stand to lads it seemed to take an age but he knew it was only seconds before the bows began to respond until delfims bowsprit and jibboom were swinging toward and across the slavers taut canvas more shots but haphazard or perhaps they were firing on the slaves squire yelled ready lads grapnels forrard adam gestured to tozer who had been joined by two more seamen at the wheel helm alee he reached out and seized a stay bracing himself for the collision but it was more of an embrace a splintering crash as the jibboom and bowsprit drove through the other ships shrouds like a giant lance and the final shuddering impact as the bows of both locked together vague figures had become the enemy yelling and screaming some falling into the sea between the hulls escaping one fate for another as some of the released slaves began to shout even cheer adam heard lieutenant sinclairs voice even above the noise breathless after running with his men to the point of impact royal marines stand to ready to fire adam drew his sword and shouted boarders away as he jumped onto a broken grating and across a huge tangle of canvas he felt someone reach out and prevent him falling he did not turn to look but knew it was jago knew his cutlass and the smell of the last wet on his breath he stared up and behind him at a line of royal marines heads and shoulders and trained muskets some had even found time to don their scarlet tunics although most were hatless seamen were swarming up to join him cutlasses and boarding pikes dispelling any doubt or argument there was another deafening shot and an instant response of shouts and cries from slaves and captors alike he heard squires powerful voice and tozers he must have just left the wheel squire climbed over a shattered spar and stood by him breathing heavily that was the ships master killed himself the bastard he was trying to sheathe his sword but there was blood on the blade and it refused to budge a few scattered shots followed and then as if to some invisible signal weapons were clattering across the deck and some of the slavers crew were running toward them as if to seek protection from the advancing line of scarlet and blue with squire beside him and jago at his back adam made his way toward the poop at the foot of the mizzen mast jago shouted a moment capn his voice seemed very loud as if all movement had stopped adam handed his sword to a grinning seaman and thrust his arms into the sleeves of his coat which jago must have had slung over his shoulder despite the chaos surrounding them a few more weapons fell and someone nearby was murmuring maybe praying in portuguese a man who might have been the schooners secondincommand was offering the hilt of his sword and gesticulating toward his captains corpse sprawled near the big double wheel a pistol still gripped in his hand he had no face adam looked away as someone grasped his arm he saw jagos sudden defensive movement then he lowered his cutlass and said lucky it was you my son it was a young african boy naked but for a ragged shirt staring up at adam or his uniform with wide eyes there were bloody welts on his arms where he had been chained or beaten adam felt the heavy silence around him as he reached down to clasp the boys shoulder like trusty the one without a tongue in the unreal stillness they all heard the distant cry from one of squires handpicked lookouts who must have watched the boarding and its aftermath from aloft unable to help or take part squire lifted his stained blade and signalled toward the overlapping masts hes sighted the peterel sir they were no longer alone adam heard a groan and saw the surgeon bandaging a marines bloody head he had not known that murray had followed him aboard the marine a corporal saw his captain watching and tried to grin then he died adam heard the two hulls creaking together and the clatter of untended tackle it was over so many times he steeled himself whats the bill squire regarded him steadily five sir he saw murray hold up his free hand six he gave their names knowing his captain would be seeing each face adam stared up at the shotholes in the topsails overhead the dark stains left by canister he said they did well tell lieutenant sinclair and stopped as squire shook his head hes dead sir they just told me adam walked to the side and looked down at the swirling arrowhead of water with its litter of branches and one corpse caught among them squire glanced over at the crowd of captives separated by a thin line of marines then he asked quietly when peterel is within signalling distance he felt adams hand close on his arm there was blood on it make to peterel adam hesitated strain or emotion this was not the time welcome mission successful we will proceed when ready together squire had found a slate somewhere and was deliberately repeating the signal but adam was gazing at a body covered by canvas a pair of polished boots protruding gleaming in the sunlight the cost of freedom he reached out to stop squire but he had gone and the blood remained sunset harry drummond climbed through onwards main hatchway and paused to clear his mind most of the routine work had been completed during the forenoon watch and with a heavy meal under his belt a doze in the mess would have been welcome but as bosun he needed to be seen and heard as he had learned the hard way he wiped his mouth with the back of his hand and stifled a yawn too much grog but it was tilley the sailmakers birthdayas good an excuse as any he glanced up at the shrouds and stays the neatly furled sails gleaming in the sun unmoving like the flags and masthead pendant as for the ship herself she could have been aground he looked aft but the quarterdeck appeared to be empty not for long vincent temporarily in command never seemed to rest from his extra duties maybe he did not know how was he still brooding about how nearly he had been given command dead mens shoes close by at her own anchorage was the new frigate zealous her captains first command young too from what drummond had heard that would be lying heavily on vincents mind he shook himself tasting the grog again he saw a seaman standing by an upturned boat which had been propped over some old canvas to protect the deck it was the gig and drummond had been thinking about luke jago and wondering how he was faring aboard the little schooner as one of the captains prize crew a hard man to know unless he let the barriers fall but drummond had not forgotten that when he had been appointed replacing the bosun who had been killed jago had been the first to befriend him they never discussed it but there it was he saw the same seaman now cleaning a brush and found himself smiling the old jacks yardstick if it moves salute it if it doesnt paint it he heard voices one of the gun captains giving instructions to some of the new hands making sweeping gestures and ducking beside an eighteenpounder he was probably describing the clash with nautilus hardly a battle if he had been at trafalgar drummond shaded his eyes and looked over at the flagship his own ship mars had been in the thick of the action her decks smeared with blood the enemy sometimes broadside to broadside even their captain had fallen beheaded by a french ball he was suddenly angry and could not contain it he shouted winning are we but he was immediately ashamed of himself he turned as a shadow fell across the deck it was maddock the gunner and he was smiling we were all like that when we were young so long ago i can hardly remember drummond saw the familiar felt slippers tucked in maddocks belt he was on his way to the magazine nobody would bother him there strangers and visitors to their small mess hardly ever realised maddock was so hard of hearing he had even made a short and witty speech today to mark the sailmakers birthday and got through it without interruption he said now i just met the first lieutenant harry i think he wants to see you when youre free drummond laughed his moment of temper forgotten that means now maddock yawned too it must be contagious hes in the cabin getting a bit of peace while he still can drummond knew there were only two possible reasons with squire sinclair of the royal marines and murray the surgeon all away in delfim the wardroom would be a place to avoid julyan the master was ashore dealing with some new navigational aids and vicary the purser was dull to say the least that left lieutenant monteith that was reason enough a marine strode toward them and clicked his heels together beg pardon sir but the first lieutenant maddock held up his hand and grinned you were right harry he meant now lieutenant mark vincent loosened his coat and walked through the great cabin to the stern windows even with windsails rigged and most hatches and doors opened it seemed airless and the anchorage was still the reflected glare painfully bright there was an occasional sound or sensation around or beneath him and in his minds eye he could place and define it he knew every part of onward possibly better than any one except her builder something fell on deck and he heard the royal marine sentry outside the screen door move away to investigate then somebody laughed and was hissed into silence again he glanced at the neat pile of papers brought for his signature by prior the captains clerk quiet and confident and for all vincent knew watching him and making comparisons he sat down abruptly and tried to relax but he was not tired which surprised him for an entire week the ship had been under his command and as a result he had shared every watch with monteith and julyan keenly supported by midshipman hotham who had once more been appointed temporary acting lieutenant vincent saw a jug of water on the little desk the surface was barely moving suppose he shut his mind to it every day had been full dealing with the ships routine and the harbour requirements and formalities discipline and defaulters but only a few of the latter they knew him too well by now he had even met the new frigates captain when he had gone aboard zealous with some local information more out of curiosity than anything else pleasant enough and friendly up to a point but the courtesy of the visit had not been returned he was young younger than vincent and the significance had been obvious to them both he was on his feet again pacing the pantry door was shut but he knew morgan was not far away a good man none better he put that too from his mind he had selected hugh morgan himself for the position of captains servant even before onward had been fully commissioned even then i was behaving like a captain he pushed at the other narrow door until it was half open bolithos sleeping cabin was almost boxlike but at least it was his own he looked at the portrait that always hung there seen only by morgan and a few interlopers like me andromeda awaiting her own sacrifice to the sea monster he reached out and lightly touched the canvas as guilty as a schoolboy what must she have felt as she had posed for it what did she think now with adam bolitho away at sea not knowing he was closing the door flushed and unsettled as morgan padded past with an armful of clean shirts hell be back soon sir he did not move will you be dining with any guests here tonight sir there was a tap on the screen door morgan tutted never any peace officer of the guard sir morgan was laying the shirts carefully on the seat of the bergere then he looked up staring at the door hes back he hurried to open it but halted as the air seemed to quiver to a dull boom vincents eyes remained on the officer in the doorway a lieutenant like himself it was the signal from the headland he turned without speaking and looked for the last time at the cabin like a dream it was over midshipman david napier walked across the quarterdeck gazing at the anchorage there were still a few lights showing ashore and on vessels at anchor but that would soon change all hands had been called at dawn and the air was still fresh and cool the decks wet underfoot washed down by seamen half asleep as hammocks were being stacked in the nettings still warm from their bodies the midshipmens berth had been like a furnace in the night despite the open ports and hatches napier saw someone stooping over coiled rope and grinned it was his friend tucker the bosuns mate this makes a change they both looked toward the as yet invisible headland napier said bit of a breeze now that will help them every one was thinking the same how soon what was the cost when you fought together as one company it was different fighting guns or the sea itself tucker murmured stand by it was lieutenant monteith peering around at the men working below the braced yards and furled sails which were already sharpening against a clear sky he saw tucker and snapped ill need you to chase up the jollyboats crew in case he did not finish but beckoned imperiously to napier and i want a few words with you he gestured even the flagships not wide awake yet tucker said can i send the men under punishment to breakfast sir ask the masteratarms i cant deal with everything napier followed the lieutenant down to the wardroom it was deserted the table laid for one person a messman was collecting the empty dishes he stopped as monteith said another cup berry the last one was stonecold the man nodded and hurried away monteith sat down and wiped his face with a handkerchief you have to watch some people all the time napier glanced around lieutenant vincent must still be in the great cabin but did he ever sleep even during the night he had heard him about sometimes just prowling along a gangway or the main deck he had always liked the first lieutenant strict when necessary but he was fair and always ready to listen unlike some monteith was saying as you probably know i am writing your monthly report im afraid its something we all have to go through he shifted in the chair and gazed at him you must have learned a good deal by now he ticked each point off on a finger your previous experience when audacity was lost in battle then aboard this ship he gave what might have been a smile and with me and our landing party i shall put that in my report of course napier felt his leg beginning to throb not like those early days he will always have a limp but monteith although aware of his discomfort did not ask him to sit down monteith leaned back expansively you have a good relationship with the captain i believe he waved any response aside it can be a hurdle of course but in your case it must offer reassurance surely he turned abruptly toward the door what is it now then waved at the table hot this time i trust berry the messman said nothing he had heard it all before monteith sipped the coffee and collected himself i expect you told captain bolitho of our experiences at the mission eh a close thing i expect he was worried about you but as you were with me he broke off what the hell is it now berry might have shrugged somebody left a message for you sir he pulled an envelope from his apron and you didnt see who it was mustve been while i was fetching your breakfast sir monteith snatched the envelope from him i shall speak to the first lieutenant about this a fine shaft of sunlight had driven the last shadows from the wardroom and napier could see the envelope trembling in monteiths fingers with his name and rank printed in bold letters across it shall i carry on sir monteith glared at him i havent finished yet he tore open the envelope if this is some sort of joke he shook it angrily over the table and for a few seconds nothing happened there was no letter or note enclosed as if from another world they heard the shrill of calls and the cry clear lower deck all hands muster by divisions the waiting was over napier held his breath and watched something drift slowly from the torn envelope until it landed on the table it was a white feather midshipman charles hotham was about to raise his telescope again but changed his mind as he heard lieutenant monteith come to stand beside him on the quarterdeck a moment earlier with all hands hurrying to their various stations he might not have noticed but he could hear the sharp uneven breathing as if monteith had been running or was agitated about something he knew monteith had been in the wardroom which was no distance away where hotham assumed he had been complaining to david napier about something monteith made a point of it if and when the time came for hotham to leave onward for his own promotion he would miss monteith least of all and would that day soon come he tried not to hope too much being made acting lieutenant even if temporarily must count for something he smiled especially as he had to suffer for it from the other young members of his mess he heard the murmur of voices from the assembled figures on the main deck excitement anxiety or both monteith said silence on deck but without his usual irritation hotham glanced at him curiously and saw that he was looking at the shore or perhaps in the direction of the flagship and that a crumpled handkerchief was dangling loosely from a pocket although monteith prided himself on his appearance and was always quick to point out any failure to measure up as he put it among the midshipmen he saw the royal marines paraded in a small section by the starboard gangway sergeant fairfax stiffbacked in command they would be at full strength again when the prize crew returned unless hotham tried to close his mind to the possibility like the illfated mission when his own sighting of that crude distress signal had begun a chain of events none of them could have anticipated and some had died because of it and because of him he adjusted his telescope hurriedly although there was no need he saw vincent now standing by the quarterdeck rail hands clasped behind his back julyan the sailing master stood nearby but alone hotham breathed out slowly and raised his telescope a big east indiaman had anchored two days ago to land a mixed cargo but was said to be leaving today he felt himself tense as he saw the sleek bows of the brigantine listed as peterel begin to pass her still not much wind but enough to fill her sails which were very clean and bright in the morning sunlight by moving the glass he could just see the topmasts of the schooner about which they had been told earlier anchored where she would not impede incoming vessels or those wishing to leave like john companys big ship and to put her under closer guard hotham looked toward the flagship unwilling to take his eyes from the new arrivals even for a few moments medusa had hoisted an affirmative to a brief signal from the brigantine which was hidden by the set of her canvas he tried to ease his grip on the telescope there was the renegade schooner no more than a cable astern of the small manofwar he watched the hull and rigging leap into life holding his breath as the deck moved slightly beneath his feet waiting for the image to settle faces people he knew he could hear their voices in his mind hastily sewn patches on some of the sails scars on the hull splinters untended and out of reach and above it all a large white ensign he lowered the telescope it had misted over to his annoyance the sun or his eagerness to see every detail then he saw adam bolitho standing beside the wheel another officer who could only be squire close by hotham jammed the telescope under his arm and wiped his eyes with the back of a sunburned hand it was not mist on the lens he heard someone call give em a cheer lads it was probably tobias julyan shouting from the heart then another voice sharper vincent the first lieutenant belay that stand fast and uncover hotham reached for his own hat but he had just removed it to wave with every one else when he saw that the clean white ensign aboard the schooner had been lowered to halfmast then he could see more clearly every sense sharpened there was another ensign spread on the schooners deck not large enough to hide the bodies of men who would never see another dawn the heavy silence was shattered as sergeant fairfax broke ranks and marched to the side where he halted and threw up a smart salute there were no words but he was speaking for all of them luke jago felt himself tense as the first heavingline lifted from delfims low forecastle but fell short splashing into the water too soon too eager the same jetty they had left only a week or so ago seemed crammed with people black and white while others had climbed on the roofs of nearby buildings some waving others watching in total silence a second seaman was standing by with a line coiled and ready then jago saw a uniformed figure reach out and take it from him it was squire his eyes met jagos and there was a brief smile squire had not forgotten nor would he the line snaked over and was seized by many willing hands taking the strain of the main cable still only a reflection they had anchored overnight but they had been kept busy with boats arriving from shore and more marines sent to take custody of the delfims crew and tend to the immediate needs of the freed slaves their own prize crew had been reunited with their mates he did not look at the dead men partly covered by the ensign jago could not remember when he had last been able to rest let alone sleep he had always prided himself that he could do either standing on his feet but after this this mornings move to enter harbour had kept all of them hopping past a big indiaman her company preparing for sea but still waving as the smart little peterel had cleared the way then coming abeam of the flagship her decks lined officers saluting sailors and royal marines at attention and from somewhere the local garrison probably a trumpet sounding paying its respects other more painful moments remained uppermost in his mind when the fighting had ended he had seen the gunners mate looking across the deck his eyes finding his friend the masters mate his face had said it all and a tough seaman one of onwards topmen kneeling beside a mate who was now a corpse lying under the ensign it was done until the next time try and keep still will you jago saw the surgeon crouching by a man who had been injured by a wood splinter who was now trying to rise and join the others standing by for going alongside the sawbones had been kept busier than most of them he thought and had not escaped wounding himself one wrist was bandaged and murray looked unusually dishevelled and impatient as he was attempting to examine his patient jago watched the strip of water narrowing as more muscle was lent to the mooring ropes and the furled canvas cast shadows across the upturned faces he recalled the moment when he had steered his gig toward their first encounter with delfim and the impact of the girl showing her scars to the portuguese master and identifying him as her assailant had she seen them enter harbour this time he wondered he turned abruptly not troubling to shade his eyes from the glare and saw onward her decks were full but those waiting were silent thankful to see them back again trying not to show it a sailors pretense he heard a telescope snap shut and someone mutter i can see mister bloody monteith as large as life bin makin jacks life a misery while he was playin top dog another voice dont know is arse from is elbow not loud but enough for jago to hear it maybe monteith had always been like that jago had known other young gentlemen who had shown their true colours after taking the first vital step from white tabs to wardroom he thought of midshipman hotham acting lieutenant during this brief and bitter operation clergymans son or not how would he perform when the time came he heard tozer the masters mate call out something and saw him standing with bolitho and gesturing toward the jetty there was more activity men clearing a space for any one who had been hurt and for the dead he recalled bolithos face when he had told them he was taking the dead men back to freetown for burial foreign soil no matter what the charts might call it but jago knew the real reason they had given their best and paid for it and they would not be left to share the same ground as scum like slavers there was other movement now seamen and marines forcing a passage through the linehandling party and onlookers presumably for somebody important he felt the instinctive resentment soften slightly as he recognized the upright figure of james tyacke the flag captain a good one to all accounts for an officer jago realised that bolitho was looking directly at him like those other times good and bad moments of pride and fear fury and compassion and he felt his hand lift in their private salute he watched the flag captain pulling himself aboard and waving aside all attempts at formality much as old john allday had described him as if he sensed jagos scrutiny tyacke paused and looked across at him the terrible disfigurement pitilessly revealed by the reflected glare there might have been only the two of them kept your eye on him for me did you jago knew i could rely on you then tyacke strode across the remaining few yards and grasped bolithos hands in both his own christie the gunners mate nudged jago in the ribs ill stand right next to you lukey when im lookin for promotion jago felt the deck shudder as delfim nudged alongside and her moorings were secured and as if to some signal hesitant at first a burst of cheering spread across the whole anchorage he was thankful for the noise tyackes obvious sincerity had left him at a loss for words he heard the squeak of halliards and knew the ensign had been rehoisted to its peak they were back it was the way of sailors and he heard squire calling for himuntil the next time adam bolitho stood alone by the delfims taffrail and gazed along the deserted deck he could still feel the warmth and intensity of tyackes greeting and it had moved him deeply he knew that squire was waiting for him to leave with the last of the prize crew but the schooner already felt empty dead she would remain under guard to await auction or the breakers yard with those others he had seen across the anchorage even the jetty was empty he had waited until the dead seamen and marines had been carried ashore somebody had even folded the spare ensign and left it beneath the mizzen a reminder if one was needed tyacke probably knew him better than many and had kept his questions to a minimum letting him do the talking phase by phase they had seen pecco delfims master taken ashore under guard to be detained separately from the other prisoners adam had described their difficult approach to the rendezvous with the slaver and how pecco could have betrayed them at any moment tyacke had said only im not sure how his loyalty will be valued by higher authority adam i gave him my word adam came out of his thoughts as he heard squires heavy tread across the splintered decking the boats are here to take us across to he seemed to hesitate onward it was rare for squire to show emotion i was glad to have you with me james ive said as much in my report squire walked beside him past the abandoned wheel and said quietly surely youre not expected to visit the flagship when youve only just he broke off as adam grasped his sleeve not until tomorrow forenoon james the admiral is being most considerate squire stopped near the capstan and looked up at the ensign which seemed particularly vivid against the clear sky shall i haul down the colours sir for a moment he thought his question had gone unheard or that bolitho was still preoccupied with something else but when he turned and faced him adams dark eyes were unwavering in the hot sunlight at sunset when the flags of all our ships are lowered he stared across the water squire thought toward his own command then it will be up to us as they made toward the waiting boats squire was still sharing the moment it was not a threat it was a promise adam waited for the screen door to close behind him and the sentry to resume his place outside before walking aft to the stern windows an hour or more had passed since he had climbed aboard and his mind was still dazed by the reception calls shrilling faces eager or apprehensive impetuous handshakes all order and discipline momentarily forgotten but now he was feeling the aftermath and for the first time he was alone even the cabin seemed different unfamiliar but that was all part of it it was in fact exactly as he had left it and had seen it in his mind in those rare moments of peace the strangeness was within himself he stood for a moment beneath the skylight and felt the warm air on his face there was an unmoving shadow across itanother sentry overhead to ensure that the captain was not disturbed he leaned on the bench and stared through the glass the jetty and the schooner were hidden from here he should be glad he stretched his arms until his hands jarred against a deckhead beam when had he last slept he stared at the coat flung carelessly across a chair he could not remember having dragged it off had morgan been here he would have folded it with care he felt his mouth crack into a smile morgan was here doubtless sealed in his pantry and listening for every sound adam looked at the old bergere in shadow now if he sat down now it would finish him he moved restlessly to the desk and pulled out its smaller less comfortable chair feeling his chin scrape against his neckcloth but the effort of enduring a shave even under jagos skilled hand was too much for him and god knew luke jago needed rest more than most he was probably on his back right now the strain and sudden death safely stowed away under the hatches of his mind and likely with a few wets to help and squire too with the prize crew but with sinclair gone it would be different in the wardroom he gripped the edge of the desk staring with burning eyes at the opened letter her letter tyacke had handed it to him when they had met instead of leaving it for the mail boat to deliver later or maybe he had come simply to reassure himself that onwards captain was not one of those lying covered by the ensign and tomorrow they would be buried someone would remember them adam spread the letter on the desk but could not focus on the words he had already read it in minutes snatched between one duty and another all the demands which had awaited him on board he had even found time to call young david and tell him elizabeth had asked to be remembered to him just a brief contact captain with midshipman he felt the hot air stir against his skin and heard the quiet welsh voice shall i fetch another brandy sir adam saw morgans eyes flicker to the discarded coat probably noting his unshaven face as well another he said morgan smiled gently with all respect sir i think you should try to sleep a while not yet i must wait until sunset then you didnt ask for that hugh forgive me he smiled so i will have some more brandy and thank you the door closed and he tried to focus on the writing hearing her voice in the words my own darling adam i am lying with you nowjust reach out for me later when hugh morgan returned to the great cabin under protest to report that sunset had been piped he found his captain asleep across the desk the brandy untouched he thought of the lovely girl in the painting in the adjoining cabin flaunting herself as his old mother in wales would have called it and aloud he said quietly not for a while yet captain we need you right now voice from the past adam bolitho walked out on to the dusty road and heard the graveyard gates clang shut behind him he had already noticed that they had not been painted for a long time and were showing rust he looked toward the harbour and the tight cluster of masts a few moving taking advantage of a slight but steady breeze others anchored or alongside their work done for the day beyond the sheds and slipways he could see the flagships masts and spars rising above the rest with all her canvas furled and still no unsightly windsails to offend the admiral he knew it was wrong but he was glad to be alone if only for a short while the burial service had been brief almost impersonal but how could it be otherwise it had been conducted by a senior chaplain with a hollow monotonous voice but in fairness he had known none of the men being buried this day how could he faces in battle or laughing together at some wellworn sailors joke or seen across the table for promotion or punishment his men who had followed him and obeyed without question and had paid the price their personal possessions would be collected and auctioned the wardroom too would donate something as usual time and distance were the enemy how long would it be before their relatives and loved ones were told what if it had been me how would lowenna have been told a courier or some local authority maybe an incoming ship or by the official letter the secretary of the admiralty regrets to inform you he stopped and looked down at his feet they were covered with mud and some of it had spattered his stockings the ground had been soaked with water before the burial to the point of being almost awash the gravediggers would have been helpless otherwise the sunbaked earth was like rock the sight of his shoes transported him to somewhere else a world away cornwall and the coast he knew so well walking along one of those narrow country lanes after a downpour where you could still smell among the fragrance of the fields the sea and taste its salt on your mouth when you spoke or laughed with the woman you loved he was conscious of the clipclop of hooves and the scrape of wheels and realised he had been hearing them for some time beyond his thoughts he moved to the side of the road but the vehicle was slowing stopping well met captain bolitho for a moment i thought i had taken the wrong turning it was a small carriage drawn by two horses probably because of the steeper inclines of the road and despite the familiarity of the greeting the face staring from the open window was that of a stranger lean and narrow with deepset eyes the hair completely grey the voice confident and cultured i understand youre heading for the harbour the door creaked open im going that way please join me adam shook his head i cannot my shoes are the man pushed the door back as far as it would go and held up one of his feet mine too but im glad i was there and adam remembered seeing him in the graveyard almost hidden among the officials and visitors but somehow remaining remote apart from them all he thrust out a hand as hard and lean as himself im godden by the way he smiled and seemed younger i was hoping to meet you but time ran out today changed that he slid across the bench seat so that adam could climb in beside him the coachman who had jumped down to hold the horses was waiting silently carry on toby the carriage turned back on to the road and adams mind groped with the sudden shift of events the man sitting beside him was not merely godden he was the honourable sir charles godden the admirals important guest who had had every one on the move since his arrival in freetown godden said i have been hearing quite a lot about you captain bolitho this recent venture must seem a reward for all the work supported by rearadmiral langley and his staff do you see any end to the slave trade in view it is illegal in most countries but the business goes on although the admiral seems to think it is already in decline almost finished except in name adam hesitated this meeting was no accident and it was more than a mere courtesy he said carefully there are always men willing to take the risk if the money is ready and sufficient slaves are being taken from these shores as far away as brazil and cuba despite the efforts of the patrols and the threat of punishment if caught he stared through the window next to him even so diplomatic a comment sounded disloyal against the code of duty and loyalty as a sea officer godden said politics and the navy have much in common and tapped some dried mud from his shoe robert walpole is regarded as britains first true prime minister he paused except by the irish of course he became serious again walpole was a man i would have dearly liked to know we could all still learn from his example his family motto for instance the part i remember is fari quae sentias he twisted round and gripped adams arm speak as you feel he rapped the inside of the roof here toby the carriage juddered to a halt dust settling around it in a yellow cloud godden turned easily in his seat his eyes in shadow i know a good deal about you and i have learned more since i arrived here he seemed to sense a challenge and added not from staff officers he tapped his chest or politicians like me but from ordinary decent men like the ones you lead who trust you adam opened the door and said sharply and who die because of me he stepped down into the road so that medusa seemed to be towering over him solid real they shook hands but only their eyes spoke then adam turned toward the steps to the jetty his arrival would already have been reported i should have walked but the words were still ringing in his mind speak as you feel lieutenant james squire halted in a patch of shade by an unfinished wall and looked across the graveyard deserted after the orderly departure of the uniforms and the local people who had occupied most of the spare ground watching curiously now it was over the graves neatly marked and numbered to await the stone or wooden crosses he stretched and felt his tendons crack by which time onward should be at sea again never look back he had seen a lot of good men die over his years at sea and a few he still remembered he heard two of the gravediggers talking to one another one of them smoking a wellused pipe to them it was just a job of work and rightly so he felt in his pocket to ensure he had the signed papers bolitho had told him to collect while he was reporting to the admiral he felt his sunburned face crease into a frown the admiral should have been the first here to show his respect gratitude he thought of luke jago and what he might have said that will be the bloody day he glanced down at his shoes the mud had dried on them like iron he recalled that the senior chaplain had been careful to stand on a rug throughout the service he thought by contrast of the sea burials the captain speaking the familiar words he turned caught offguard by a womans voice over here if youre certain two of them one who was still pointing toward the graves dressed in a white cape like a nun or a medical attendant roundfaced smiling tolerantly the other was claire dundas her arms were full of blossoms a splash of colour against her plain gown her companion was carrying a kind of frame of neatly tied canes claire looked across directly at him her face partly hidden by flowers i thought we were too late squire heard the other woman say dont forget claire dear the doctor wants to see you on the hour the girl ignored her i saw you sail into harbour she did not look at him i had a telescope squire strode across the uneven ground and reached without thinking for her hand the blossoms remained between them like a barrier she said quietly i prayed for you and gazed away almost guiltily for all of you i havent forgotten i was hoping to see you somehow squire broke off awkwardly and touched the ribbon around the flowers these are fine are they lilies she smiled for the first time perhaps with relief that he had changed the subject no only vines bleeding heart theyre called here she shook them gently and only then looked at him they will not last long but i just thought she did not go on he knew he was staring at her but could not help himself as if the woman in white and the gravediggers were invisible remembering how she had struggled and fought to free herself as he had tried to carry her to safety her nakedness scarcely covered by his uniform coat he could see the scar on her wrist fading but still visible enough to remind her and although she had arranged her hair differently he could still see the dark bruise on her forehead he said i must see you not here he took her wrist and felt her tense not like this claire the other voice intruded we really must leave now they will be expecting you he released her wrist and stooped to pick up some of the vines which had dropped between them ive been so worried about you he looked up into her face in shadow against the clear sky she said you saved my life she broke off and took a few paces as if to join her companion i will never forget jamie squire watched them leave she did not look back and the vines lay where they had fallen a voice muttered ere sir ill put em on show and there was an intake of breath as squire thrust some coins into his fist it must have been more than he realised it was over it had never begun rowlatt the masteratarms watched impatiently as the harbour launch thrust away from onwards side and headed toward the shore faster this time having unloaded the seamen and marines from the funeral muster then he strode aft toward the quarterdeck where the first lieutenant was inspecting an unexpected delivery of pursers stores so much for a day of mourning rowlatt waited for the lieutenant to look up from the cargo list and touched his hat vincent was probably glad of the interruption pinchgut vicary as the purser was known was not the liveliest company on any day all aboard mr squire is returning with the guardboat sir vincent made a noncommittal noise squire must have remained to the end while the captain presented himself as ordered to the admiral he yawned irritated that he was too tired to control it but he knew there was a deeper reason it was envy he saw midshipman walker loitering gazing intently at a small boat pulling unnecessarily close along the larboard side a royal marine was keeping pace with it on the gangway but when he waved for the helmsman to stand clear he was given a huge grin and a display of cheap ornaments vincent glanced at the nearest pile of stores that must be stowed away without delay mr walker find some spare hands he saw him hurry away walker must have had his hair cut it made him look younger than ever thirteen or was he fourteen now the boy who had been forever seasick even in a flat calm the other midshipmen had tired of making jokes about it and of cleaning him up now it was unknown rowlatt asked th capn siris he due back on board soon vincent nodded rowlatt always had a reason he was never lacking when it came to discipline and routine a first lieutenants right arm and usually hated because of it i want a close watch kept he gestured in the direction of the flagship hell want some rest after all this rowlatt said nothing and he thought and so shall i vincent thought longingly of the wardroom but if he went below now he swung round startled as the cry came from forward boat ahoy rowlatt snapped must be a mistake sir but the reply was clear enough aye aye a visitor an officer vincent swore under his breath who the hell midshipman walker hurried over holding a telescope outstretched and vincent took it calm once more he should have known he trained the glass with care the fixed grin of the wouldbe trader leaping out at him until he found the other boat bows on filling the lens one of medusas own gigs the flagships distinctive markings unmistakable in the sunlight and one passenger wearing the scarlet uniform of the royal marines more to the point there was a pile of kit in the sternsheets some of it personal images of the wardroom flooded vincents mind again and the habits and characters of the men who lived there robert sinclair had been buried today no time wasted this must be his replacement arriving he saw the newcomer being met at the entry port by monteith who had appeared a few seconds earlier and who was now directing him aft sergeant fairfax was nearby but keeping his distance his life too would now be changed the first few moments were always the worst the marine a lieutenant strode aft his eyes not leaving vincent until he had halted smartly and saluted an open youthful face the hair beneath his hat fair and neatly trimmed the scarlet uniform was wellcut but looser than some as if he had lost weight since he had last visited a tailor the sword too was wellworn even tarnished he was older than he looked vincent thought he returned the salute about my age lieutenant devereux sir come aboard to join regret the delay all boats in use he held out the familiar stamped and sealed envelope good or bad a new beginning vincent offered his free hand im the senior here welcome aboard the smile like the handshake was firm but unconsciously so not done to make an impression the captain is not aboard at present but you probably know that devereux nodded and winced slightly touching his face i know sir i caught sight of him just before i came over vincent waited giving himself time the gesture had drawn his attention to a deep scar on the left side of devereuxs face not large but deadly an inch or less above the jawbone devereux said lightly suns a little hotter than usual but the smile was gone vincent said did you get that out here and devereux lowered his hand noback home in chatham as it happens vincent gazed along the main deck where a few men were still clearing up from the days work i hope she was worth it devereux looked at him in silence then said abruptly i thought so his jaw lifted so that the scar seemed to speak for him it was selfdefense of course vincent touched his arm ill have your kit taken below he glanced at the official envelope paul isnt it he gestured toward the companion ladder ill show you our quarters the formalities must wait until the captain returns even now he could feel the stab of resentment the flag lieutenant paused outside medusas great cabin as adam wiped the last of the dried mud from his shoes on to a rope mat dont trouble yourself about that sir youre here thats the main thing he nodded to a royal marine sentry and added in an undertone he will see you now once through the screen door the cabin was much as adam remembered it well furnished spotless and somehow unlivedin at the far end in the centre of the broad stern windows rearadmiral giles langley stood with his back to the gleaming panorama of water and moored vessels his fair hair almost touching the deckhead as adam walked aft langley seemed to come to life and strode to meet him good to see you again bolitho only sorry i had to drag you aboard without giving you time to breathe he gripped adams outstretched hand and stared intensely at him his pale eyes unblinking you look damn well despite it all proud of you then pity i couldnt have joined you at the sad but necessary ceremony he waved vaguely around the cabin im sure you understood he waited as a servant darted forward and moved his chair away from a shaft of sunlight so that was what was different the curtains which had covered the stern windows obscuring the impressive view of freetown were gone perhaps the admiral had become more accustomed to the searing light and the climate they sat facing one another a small table between them while the servant spoke to someone else in hiding beyond the same door there was a clink of glasses and adam found time to wonder what was keeping him alert and for what langley said bluntly i hear you fell in with sir charles godden apparently he was at the funeral service sir although he did not announce himself langley smiled coldly he was in a carriage but i doubt it was by coincidence not in his nature he turned his head and rapped out i shall send word if i need you flags adam had not realised that langleys aide was still in the cabin no wonder he looked so hunted and where was tyacke langley asked just as brusquely what did you make of godden and did not wait for an answer had everybody jumping here from the minute he stepped ashore he and his little group of croniestheyve done well for themselves i cant even guess what the bill will come to and he was here looking for ways to save money he laughed almost jovially but his eyes were very keen well did he impress you a few minutes beside someone in a carriage you had never met before or are likely to meet again i think he was sincereeven eager to learn how we feel about our role here langley snapped his finger and thumb what were costing his precious government more likely better friend than foe in my opinion he leaned over and tapped the little table dont take all day man adam could smell the brandy from where he was sitting langley took out a handkerchief and dabbed his face but hes nobodys fool i can see why hes got where he is knows about our antislavery patrols and the results good or bad knows of our cooperation with the shipowners and traders here he winked or lack of same he shifted in his chair as the servant approached with a tray and a full decanter and two fresh glasses there were wet rings on the tray left by previous ones langley said not sorry to see him go now we might get some results he lifted his glass he knew a little too much about you anyway adam felt the brandy sear his tongue not from me sir no no had it all written down for gods sake langley laughed again and nearly dropped his glass it was empty he asked a lot of questions about he snapped his fingers again ballantyne and his affairs at new haven another carpet knight eh he grinned and touched his lips and you did not hear that the servant was refilling the glasses his features expressionless he was probably used to this behaviour but adam had never seen langley like this it was more than relief langley was saying what now flags i thought i made it clear he wiped his face with the handkerchief not time already the flag lieutenant closed his little book colonel whitehead from the garrison is due to arrive shortly sir you said slipped my mind dammit he looked at adam and shrugged had to see you first bolitho weve both been through it of late the pale eyes flickered around the cabin they all like to visit the flagship makes em feel important another servant had appeared carrying langleys cocked hat and sword but he was pushed rudely aside as the admiral strode toward the quarter gallery langley paused and rubbed his hands together must clean up and pump the bilges before they arrive not much longer eh flags the door slammed behind him adam thought he looked as if he were going to vomit the lieutenant waited for the servant to lay hat and sword on the bench beneath the stern windows and leave before saying quietly medusa is being paid off the wellthumbed notebook had fallen to the deck but he did not seem to notice finished adam was on his feet his mind quite clear like all those other ships he had seen in harbours at home some with famous names legends and remembered not only by those who had served and fought in them at the saintes and camperdown at the nile and copenhagen and at trafalgar now awaiting that final voyage he walked slowly aft from here he could see the berth where the delfim had been moored when rearadmiral giles langley had dissociated himself from the plan to seek out the slavers lair for which he had since taken the credit and what about tyacke he turned and faced the flag lieutenant who was glancing around the cabin as if he had never seen it before langley had left even this to him there were voices beyond the screen door laughter the visitors makes em feel important not any more he shook the flag lieutenants hand let me know if thank you sir ill signal for your boat adam thought of jago and said hell be here waiting the door had opened a few inches and he could see the red coats of the visitors the scarlet of the sentry jago would know already and by tomorrow everybody would he left the cabin noticing that the notebook still lay where it had fallen the flag lieutenant said i will tender your apology but the cabin was empty pride and envy luke jago wiped his gleaming razor and held it to the light before laying it on a tray feel better capn ready for a new day he watched with approval as adam stretched his arms and nodded it was early with the morning watch still in force adam felt the deck move slightly and saw jagos razor slide across the tray onward was coming alive again the pantry door was closed but he knew that morgan was not far away like the rest of them waiting jago said meetin at eight bells capn ill be standin by just in case he did not go on he did not need to adam glanced aft toward the stern windows remembering the flag lieutenant breaking the news as if he were personally to blame he said does every one know about medusa you did probably before me jago said only there ave been a few whispers of late naval stores an then i eard tell of it from a fellow in the riggers crew he shrugged no secrets last long in this mans navy well luke until its official aye aye capn not a word adam turned toward the harbour again small wavelets cruising ahead of the breeze seabirds rising and screeching in protest the flags on other vessels moored or at anchor were no longer listless but streaming out to a steady northwesterly like an omen he felt his senses quicken will you ever lose it ready for sea but when he walked back across the cabin his hand briefly unconsciously touching the old chair jago had seen it plenty of times like old mates he waited for the moment what will become of capn tyacke and when adam did not answer he thought he had gone too far but adam faced him eventually he is still the flag captain an important post ashore or afloat they must take that into consideration he heard the distant chime almost lost in the murmur of tackle and loose rigging eight bells he straightened his back and said briskly to jago at least its not friday jago heard the door open and close the stamp of the royal marine sentrys boots a different sentry in the time he had been here it was now the forenoon watch he smiled to himself not friday only bolitho would remember his coxswains old superstition the skylight was partly open and he heard the pipe being repeated along the deck hands to quarters clean guns he muttered aloud you just give the word capn well scupper em even walking the short distance to the wardroom on the deck immediately beneath his own cabin adam was aware of the unusual stillness the squeak of gun trucks very audible as an eighteenpounder was manhandled for inspection and cleaning with only an occasional shouted instruction but the forenoon was usually the busiest time in a ship of war especially at anchor he knew it was largely imagination but the feeling persisted the deck tilted slightly and shuddered in for a blow he could almost hear julyan saying it a seaman on his knees polishing some brass scrambled to his feet as his captain approached hesitated and then ventured mornin sir adam nodded looks good savage it was an easy name to remember and the courtesy mattered some officers even captains never cared until they were in trouble he saw vincent waiting by the wardroom entrance perhaps he thought this meeting was a waste of time he might be right the wardroom was unusually crowded apart from the officers and senior warrant officers all the other warrants seemed to be present the specialists or the backbone as adam had heard his uncle describe them the bosun and the gunner tilley the sailmaker and the cooper and of course hall the carpenter bent almost double because of his height the tallest man in the ship probably anywhere and one midshipman hotham the senior that had been vincents idea they were all seated adam was the visitor here vincent said all present sir except the surgeon hes still ashore i knew that but thank you he looked around at the array of faces i expect most of you know or might have suspected that medusa our flagship is being paid off he saw a few quick startled glances but no real surprise she will lie in ordinary until her fate is decided he noticed lieutenant squire shaking his head perhaps thinking of some particular ship in the past at the end of the line adam continued our patrols will proceed as ordered but more and smaller ships will be needed he paused and officers to command them he saw devereux their new royal marine turn as prior the clerk bent to recover a few pages of his carefully written notes which had fallen to the floor like dried leaves adam had met devereux only briefly when vincent had introduced him for what he called the formalities and had liked what he saw keen intelligent and open even if he had been sent to onward under something of a cloud when he had asked devereux if he were disturbed by the transfer from a seventyfour to a frigate he had seemed unable to contain himself on the contrary sir i feel alive again vincent had remarked with an odd sarcasm thanks to your predecessor although minutes earlier he had been making the newcomer welcome adam heard the brief rumble of trucks directly overhead in the great cabin and could imagine morgan anxiously watching every move as an eighteenpounder was checked at least here in the wardroom one deck lower they were spared the presence of guns he reached for his hat and said we have a fine ship someone gave a cheer but was drowned out as harry drummond the bosun lurched to his feet sending his chair crashing behind him an weve got a fine captain they were all standing now some taking up the cheer as the door closed behind him adam stood quite still for how long he did not know the same seaman was nearby now leaning on a broom i should not have insisted on coming these same men trusted me and some have paid dearly for it a few minutes later vincent joined him it was quiet again i was wondering about cordage supplies sir their eyes met captain and first lieutenant once more adam thought of vincents own words the ship comes first he was wrong what the hell vincent was staring at the ladder there were muffled shouts and feet thudding on deck a boat coming alongside and making heavy weather of it and here came walker their youngest midshipman almost falling as he slithered to a halt officer of the guard sir he held out a thick envelope for you sir adam took it the familiar buff colour his own name and rank in perfect script walker puffed importantly it needs the captains signature vincent snapped we know that adam said thank you mr walker and smiled at the boy you must take more exercise onward is too confined for you the wardroom door was open and prior was waiting patiently with a pen and an ink container between his prominent teeth was a paperknife nothing ever seemed to catch him unawares like the burial service at sea or the articles of war adam knew these words by heart being in all respects ready for sea midshipman walker still panting had brought a stool from somewhere and was looking on wideeyed as adam leaned down with the pen and signed his name vincent said ill give it to the officer of the guard sir but it sounded like a question adam blew on the ink to dry it sailing orders he folded the main section and thrust it inside his coat the day after tomorrow weather permitting he moved toward the ladder i shall give it to him myself the wardroom door was still open but there was not a sound to be heard vincent repeated day after tomorrow sir adam wanted to smile jago for one would not be surprised it was a friday we will talk soon he paused with one foot on the ladder the flag captain will be sailing with us lieutenant james squire stood by the forecastle in the eyes of the ship and gazed down at the anchor cable he had done this too many times to remember but the moment never failed to impress him standing like this with his back turned on the remainder of the ship sharing it only with the figurehead and his outthrust trident most people even those who thought they knew him well might be surprised by the intensity of his emotions he could feel the deck stirring under his feet and the breeze was strong and steady enough to create little waves beneath the stem as if onward were eager and already under way he should be used to it but this time it felt different and knowing why was no help he turned almost reluctantly and looked along the full length of the ship men being mustered in readiness for putting to sea senior hands checking names others facing aft toward the quarterdeck and the capstan unmanned as yet twelve bars like the spokes of a wheel twelve men to each bar he had known times when it had taken more when wind and sea had joined to fight them before the anchor had broken free squire saw the small knot of people near the big double wheel vincent pointing at something and julyan the master nodding as if in agreement and along the upper deck and gangways a midshipman standing sturdily here and there to relay messages or chase up stragglers if an order was not obeyed promptly he glanced over at his own two particular young gentlemen napier and simon huxley they had become part of his team in more ways than one like the seamen around them who knew exactly how far they could go before squire had to put an edge to his voice all in all a good crew to control although squire would never have told them so the captain was nowhere in sight probably still in his cabin making sure he had forgotten nothing before the flag captain came aboard a senior officer and the admirals right hand squire had come up the hard way and still nurtured many of the grudges and prejudices of the lower deck onward had swung to her anchor and the flagship was almost hidden by canvas and rigging maybe the day of the liner had come to an end the old jacks scoffed about it but when medusa was paid off sir midshipman huxley was gesturing interrupting the disturbing thoughts boat leaving the flagship sir he was a youth who rarely smiled but he was a close friend of napiers and squire was oddly proud of them both he looked away abruptly and saw the sudden bustle and excitement as the call was piped to muster all hands the flag captain was cutting it fine he thought sailing time was set for noon he had seen lynch the cook leave his galley a while back his old fiddle halfhidden by his apron ready to get these feet stamping around the capstan while he still had the taste of rum on his lips to inspire him squire walked deliberately to the opposite side of the deck knowing from experience that the older hands always watched him at this critical moment in case he revealed any uncertainty he half smiled panic rather the other anchor was catted but ready to let go if there was a sudden emergency none so far but there was always a first time more shouts the side party at their stations now to receive the flag captain even above that he could hear lieutenant monteith venting his impatience on someone in the afterguard and saw two of his own men exchange grimaces he could hardly blame them the wardroom was a small private world or should be but as far as squire was concerned monteith was still a stranger maybe monteith had changed in some way since the landing party or is it me attention on deck face to starboard squire could hear the steady beat of oars doublebanked although the boat was hidden by onwards side the captain would already be there to greet his superior but it went deeper than that there was friendship as well as a mutual respect you could feel it when you saw them together bolitho of course was much younger than tyacke and he had never been a diplomat and found it harder to disguise his true feelings when he was under pressure like that moment when he had turned and said simply to squire if i should fall and squire remembered his own reply spoken without hesitation he stared aft again to gauge how much longer but onward had swung slightly at her anchor and instead of moored harbour craft he could now see two large buildings one with a long balcony the osprey mission would claire see onward when she weighed would she care now all she wanted was to forget but life had to be faced again and lived no matter what and he would only be a painful reminder like the scars on her skin and her memory he knew that he was biting his lip a habit he had sworn to conquer and bellowed stand by lads he saw midshipman napier reach over to touch his friends arm it was all still an adventure at their age another voice harry drummond the bosun man the capstan jump to it and the squeak of halliards as the jack was lowered for good or ill the waiting was over heave me bullies heave more men running to throw their weight on the capstan bars and a few marines piling arms in case their strength too would be required squire found himself holding his breath until after what seemed like an age he heard the first metallic click from the capstan as the pawls began to move the cable looked bartaut shining like metal as it took the full strain vincents voice rang out clear and final hands aloft loose topsls despite the orderly confusion squire could hear the cooks fiddle and his foot stamping timeon richmond hill there lives a lassmore bright than mayday morn the sun was behind squire and he took a moment to look aloft where the topmen were already spacing themselves along the yards like puppets against the sky skill and experience the true seamen in any manofwar but for every one of them there was always a first time too and squire had never forgotten the sight of the deck or the sea swaying so far beneath him and the flick of a starter across his backside if he was slow about it the capstan was moving steadily and he thought maybe a little faster and onward had swung in response to wind and current the mission was hidden the guardboat was pulling away someone waving from the sternsheets he heard one of his own men mutter a joke and laugh as if completely untroubled onward would stir any mans heart when she spread her canvas and the anchor was catted just a few feet from his vantage point and claire might be watching remembering squire studied the cable again and the swirling traces of mud and sand in the water stand by he saw napier turn toward him and for a moment thought he had spoken her name aloud he jabbed napiers shoulder pass the word larboard quarter he knew huxley had been watching the procedure closely perhaps imagining himself in his own ship one day like his father up and down sir hove short if the water was clear enough onwards great shadow would be visible right now reaching for her own anchor click click click squire stared aft again and saw the men on deck peering up at the yards others ready at the braces like a familiar pattern but as always the captain stood alone slower now some of the waiting marines had squeezed themselves into the revolving wheel of seamen one of the scarlet uniforms was the new officer devereux squire had met him only briefly it would take time he was young he smiled of course he held up his arm and saw vincents immediate acknowledgment anchors aweigh adam bolitho listened to the capstan and felt the deck shudder beneath his feet as the anchor broke free of the ground two helmsmen were at the wheel and donlevy the quartermaster was standing by as he had been since all hands had been piped julyan the masterold jolly as he was called behind his backwas not far away one of his mates beside him slate and pencil poised for anything that might need recording in the log or on a chart the shrouds and stays trembled and rattled as the first canvas broke and filled at the yards and again the deck quivered as if other hands were trying to control the rudder adam was standing in the shadow of the mizzen just paces abaft the wheel and without the sun in his eyes could see the full length of the ship squire and his men in the bows watching for the first sign of the anchorring the jewsharp as it was known breaking the surface so that it could be catted and made secure more men being sent to the braces to lend their strength and heave the great yards further round until each sail was fullbellied and stiff in the wind a few men slipping in the struggle with wind and sea to the landsman or casual onlooker it must appear utter confusion until order was finally restored topsails set and the unruly jib trimmed and sharp like the fin of a shark adam watched the shore moving now as onward gathered way and the two hills which had become familiar essential landmarks for this final run to the headland and beyond to the open sea he leaned back now gazing at the spread of canvas above the masthead pendant stiff as a lance in the wind some topmen were making a lashing secure or waving to others on the foretop apparently indifferent to the distance from the deck the shudder again the rudder taking charge anchors secured sir vincent was watching critically as the capstan bars were stowed away adam thought he heard jagos voice above the thud of canvas and the chorus of rigging he was standing near the boat tier kicking a wedge like a gunquoin into place to make them more secure for sea he seemed to feel adams eyes on him and twisted round to give his little gesture like a private signal so many times fall out the anchor party more voices now the nippers youngsters who would be joining others stowing the incoming cable after they had scrubbed every fathom of it adam beckoned to midshipman hotham who was standing by the flaglocker a telescope over his shoulder hotham said no signal sir only the acknowledgment to mine he almost blushed ours sir adam levelled the glass but regretted it in the short time since they had upanchored the bearing and distance had completely changed the flagship now seemed bowson her masts in line and her figurehead unusually bright in the sunlight her pendant was still flying but her ensign was obscured by the high poop no boats alongside and nobody on deck as onward had passed a ship already dead he thought of the flag lieutenant finished he handed back the telescope and wondered why he had left his own in the great cabin beneath his feet he glanced at the skylight covered now by a heavy grating as a precaution while getting under way in case something should fall from aloft easier than cutting new glass he had heard hall the carpenter remark but he was thinking of tyacke they had scarcely spoken since he had climbed aboard there had been only a quick firm handshake and an apology for his abrupt arrival then he had made a point of going straight below where morgan would make certain he was not disturbed if that was possible in any manofwar preparing for sea adam knew it was why he had left the old telescope there tyacke was probably focusing it even now watching the harbour opening out headlands sliding aside for their departure or looking astern at medusa southwestbysouth sir julyan was by the compass box his lips pursed in a silent whistle full an bye adam looked up at the yards braced hard round sails firm but not flapping or losing the wind the ship was performing well the topmen or those on the lee gangway could be looking down at their own reflections by now and unless he felt his mouth soften into a smile unless was every captains sheetanchor he thought again of tyacke when they had last spoken the only other sound had been the first clink of the capstan were going to new haven he had paused regarding adam searchingly you already knew didnt you adam had answered i guessed tyacke had shaken his head theres a hell of a lot of sir richard in you adam and im bloody glad of it he had still been smiling when the cabin door had closed but what was tyacke thinking now alone with his memories a born sailor and an officer of distinction the devil with half a face he turned as he heard monteiths voice not for the first time since the capstan had been manned what d you mean you didnt understand are you so stupid do i have to say everything twice adam knew vincent was watching so much had happened men had died and he had blamed himself but he was proud too of them the responsibility is mine he looked toward the land again and did not need a glass to see that the two hills were beginning to overlap soon now they would alter course and with the wind in their favour make more sail a lot of the canvas was still new untried he had heard julyan say thatll shake the gum out of em he saw the surgeon by one of the guns pausing to speak with squire gesturing at the headland different worlds but they seemed firm friends now three bells rang out from the forecastle as onward altered course one and a half hours exactly since the anchor had been secured to squires satisfaction into the deeper stronger swell of open water with a temporary standeasy as a hasty meal was arranged for most of the ships company the welcome aroma of rum reaching even the great cabin when adam quit the quarterdeck for the first time after the sun and reflected glare the cabin seemed almost dark but the grating had been removed from the skylight and tyacke was sitting at the table a folio of papers and an enlarged section of chart pressed under one elbow he seemed about to stand but changed his mind as the deck tilted suddenly in time with the shudder from the rudder getting lively eh adam sat opposite him and heard the pantry door creak hugh morgan was on his toes as always ill get the tgallants on her when i have more searoom sir tyacke made to lift his hand but put it back down immediately as some of his papers began to follow onwards motion no formality adamnot here anyway his blue eyes moved briefly around the cabin with an expression adam could not determine im only a passenger this time the admirals errand boy he had twisted round in his chair to look at the spraydappled glass nothing like it is there adam noticed that the old telescope was wedged in the bench seat within reach he said quietly you could have stayed on deck with me and tyacke shook his head laughing not likelyits bad enough with one captain at a time i should know he looked up as something fell on the deck overhead and there was a shout and the thud of bare feet as men ran to respond when he looked back at adam he seemed calm even relaxed as im sure you know there is no love lost between rearadmiral langley and sir duncan ballantyne at new haven your visit was overshadowed by that bloody business at the mission but for your action i dont know how we would have found out the truth he touched the papers the schooner you discovered and captured gave us a few clues she was once a privateer then she was taken by the french almost at the close of the war then sold and bought by a yard in england she ended up here in africa as a slaver adam remembered the hazardous passage in the delfim the warning maroon he said new haven is the key somebody must know tyacke smiled faintly so that his scars seemed more livid the carpet knight we have no proof tyacke stretched his arms and some of his papers slid to the deck then well find some and for a second adam saw the devil with half a face more feared than any other by the slavers tomorrow first thing i want to go over the charts with you and any one else you care to call i have some instructions from the admiral for ballantyne he broke off just as abruptly and gave adam the piercing stare again what did you make of our honourable guest by the way adam heard more running feet then silence vincent could cope was probably enjoying it in fact i had the impression he had already made up his mind tyacke nodded slowly his eyes steady as i said earlier so like sir richard and i agree the pantry door opened an inch may i bring some wine sir or a little something from the cask tyacke looked at his papers and shook his head not for me later mebbee he grinned if im asked that is he looked over at adam these are your quarters after all yours too adam gestured to the highbacked bergere i shall be there until were well clear of local craft he stood up he had heard footsteps outside the screen door but now there was a tap on the door midshipman of the watch sir it was napier droplets of spray glittering on his sleeves first lieutenants respects sir their eyes met requests permission to loose tgallants adam saw morgan bringing his hat tyacke was quite still watching them he touched the boys arm how are you david so formal withdrawn how it had to be my compliments to the first lieutenant i shall come now but napier had already hurried on ahead having glimpsed something in the flag captains scarred face and holding the knowledge to himself like a secret understanding and regret a strange sadness and envy survival the two captains stood side by side at the chart table while the ship seemed to quieten around them it was the forenoon watch their first at sea at moments like this adam felt as though his senses were still on deck or in some obscure part of onwards hull where someone or something was related to certain sounds or movements the morning watchkeepers groping their way below for a hurried meal and stowing their hammocks in the nettings probably not long before all hands were piped to make or reef more sail the wind had remained steady and fairly strong and men working aloft had to be doubly careful but spirits were high with the ship alive and responding well to her helm he felt the table press into his hip then withdraw as if onward were holding her breath before the next plunge he was conscious of tyackes silent concentration broken only when he scribbled a note on the pad at his elbow or used a glass to magnifiy tiny print or some diagram julyan had already provided tyacke said as if thinking aloud its just as well that youve visited new haven before and smiled without looking up so have i unofficially adam heard squires strong voice from the quarterdeck officer of the watch doing what he enjoyed most holding the ship in his hands for him it had been a long journey vincent would be snatching some breakfast before taking over matters of discipline and routine tyacke was saying the admiral wanted ballantyne to maintain complete records of every vessel cargo and owner using the harbour and approaches he smiled sarcastically to save us money adam shook his head one day maybe if new haven ever becomes another freetown tyacke said shortly not in our lifetime julyan interjected will you excuse me sir i believe i need my other log and slipped out closing the door behind him tyacke seemed to relax visibly now we can talk they both knew julyan had left deliberately tyacke tapped the chart theres too much money invested in slavery to expect a few laws and some keen patrols to put a stop to it ive tried to explain this to our admiral he wont listen of course all he can see is the next step up his personal ladderand soon he thinks he stared around the small chartroom as if he felt trapped by it its all ive heard since he hoisted his flag over medusa i hope they appreciate it at the bloody admiralty or wherever they decide these things he touched julyans old octant which the master liked to keep on display to hell with it i shouldnt let it scupper me like thisin front of you of all people adam touched his arm ill not forget and smiled did you manage to get any sleep surprisingly the scarred face lightened into a broad grin a damn sight better than you ill wager that chair was empty every time i woke up then he glanced toward the door hes coming back thinks hes given us long enough to trade secrets when julyan entered with a new chart folded beneath his arm he found both of them joking and very much at ease as he had intended one captain was enough lieutenant mark vincent sat at one end of the table and flattened out the list reminding him of several outstanding tasks not that there were many he tried to be certain of that wherever possible he had been on deck in charge of the morning watch and was still feeling the strain of a first night at sea after a long spell at anchor men working in the darkness falling over their own feet waiting for the dawn he pushed a plate aside but could hardly remember what the messman had offered him the wardroom was empty which was the way he liked it while he was sorting out his tasks and duties at sea again but for how long onward had left england on a mission and that was completed so why the delay chasing slavers was not work for a fine frigate like this one he tried to smother another yawn the captain wanted the gun crews to exercise action today either to reassure or impress their senior passenger and the purser had asked for some stores to be shifted again the man always seemed to have something stowed in the wrong place and never made the discovery until after they had weighed anchor vincent thought of the frigate zealous which they had left riding untroubled at her anchor her captain was apparently too new and inexperienced to be entrusted with a passenger like tyacke but how else would he gain the necessary confidence he knew he was being intolerant unfair to a complete stranger but after this what would follow for him he swung round in the chair and saw monteith hovering by the door i was told that you wanted to see me monteiths eyes flickered toward the other door which was swinging half open vincent said curtly theres nobody in there and looked at his watch which was lying on the table beside his list youre with a working party up forrard arent you monteith had his head on one side an irritating habit vincent always tried to ignore i left them with full instructions its not the first time ive told them what i expect when im needed elsewhere vincent leaned back in his chair and attempted to appear in command he should be used to monteith by now and immune to him they shared the daily routine in harbour and in action and they shared the only escape this wardroom he said i know you better than most of the hands you deal with harsh perhaps unfair treatment of men in front of their messmates can easily rebound on the one in authority and at the wrong time i dont want to make an issue of it monteith seemed to draw himself up with a cocky indignation has the captain said as much if so id like vincent slapped the table between us but the captain isnt deaf or blind so get a grip on your temper when youre handling the people monteith retorted i hope i know my duty mister vincent the door clicked open and one of the messmen entered with a bucket vincent stood abruptly and snapped and so do i mr monteith he realised too late that he was standing with his fist raised his limbs adjusting independently to the motion of the hull but it was a moment he would always remember like those other times monteith mouth half open for another outburst the messman still holding the bucket his eyes fixed on the two lieutenants wind and sea sails and rigging the sound might have gone unheard gunfire he said perhaps he was mistaken then he thought he heard someone shout a young voice a midshipmans but it reminded him of his early days at sea and the battle of lissa the last major seafight of the war vincent had never forgotten it or his captain william hoste who at the age of twelve had served under nelson in his famous agamemnon hoste had once complimented vincent on his attention to detail he snatched up his little list and said ill see you on deck on the upper deck the hot wind was almost refreshing after the sealed wardroom the watchkeepers were at their stations and working parties including monteiths were going about their various tasks without any visible excitement vincent quickened his pace rebuttoning his coat when he saw bolitho and the flag captain together near the wheel squire was close by gesturing up at the masthead the two captains turned as vincent joined the group by the wheel and tyacke said you heard it too eh he stared aloft good lookouts but nothing reported drummond the bosun said quickly ive put young tucker at the fore and to tyacke one of my mates sir used to be our best topman not much escapes his eye adam moved away a few paces im sorry you were disturbed mark he looked along the deck to where monteith had just reappeared and was standing with his back to them a heavier hand might still be required there but it would not be vincents decision tyacke said i know of two other patrol vessels on this stretch endeavour and challenger both brigantines vincent said automatically commander mason challenger a good man by all accounts tyacke nodded its only a matter of time he did not explain and adam had seen how hard it was for him to remain detached from any plan that might have been decided adam unslung his telescope and walked to the side despite the steady wind and occasional bursts of spray over the deck his shoes were sticking to the seams in the heat he levelled the glass and focused it but it was the same unending coastline monotonous like a solid bank of motionless cloud the edge of julyans invisible valley he licked his lips they tasted like dried leather excuse me sir it was maddock the gunner shading his eyes with his hat to peer up at squire we was supposed to exercise the gun crews this forenoon vincent interrupted ill have it piped when he got no further there were more shots hurried and in rapid succession adam tried to see it in his mind a brigantine but no return fire and the echoes were lost almost immediately in the slap and boom of canvas and the thud of onwards rudder shaking the trunk old sailors called it drummond called nothing in sight sir with the others tyacke was staring up at the maintop and then toward the land everybodys staying well clear today better maintain our course until he turned to look at adam and saw the flash reflected in his eyes several seconds seemed to pass before they heard the explosion like a clap of thunder then nothing not even an echo adam said midshipman hotham will go aloft and speak with the lookouts he saw napier watching you too and their eyes met easy does it tyacke moved to the compass box and glanced up at the masthead pendant i suggest you carry on with your gunnery exercise he walked to the side if its proof we need well have it soon enough david napier climbed into the shrouds and steadied his feet on the ratlines to get his balance the tar on the rough cordage heated by the sun felt as if it were still fresh he began to climb but not before he had seen more figures crowding on deck some peering at the land or the empty horizon to starboard he had also seen his friend simon huxley beside the quartermaster on the quarterdeck ready to pass any new orders along the gangway a walking speakingtrumpet a role all the midshipmen hated a ship had been blown up how or why they must discover i am not afraid the thought reassured him like a hand on the shoulder squire stood watching the two climbing midshipmen until they were hidden by the curve of the main topsail and those few seamen still working aloft the wind had remained steady and the motion seemed easier after the last alteration of course they were now steering due south he walked to the quarterdeck rail and stared along the ships length from the visible cathead where he had seen the anchor made fast to the place where he now stood on watch and in command unless anything else happened the captain had gone below to the chartroom with his senior officer leaving squire with just a nod the words call me had not needed to be spoken unlike some captains he had known he thought he looked toward the land hard to believe anything had happened to rouse onward to this state of tension and readiness a few shots and then the flash the explosion it might have been something ashore but his ears were trained to such things but where how he saw vincent by the fore hatch some seamen gathered nearby gun captains and quarter gunners who were each responsible for the responses and efficiency of four of the eighteenpounders onwards teeth any moment now and they would exercise action and this time it would have a stronger significance for all concerned monteith was walking aft apparently deep in thought he had been below with vincent when the first shots had been heard squire did not know the reason but could guess he closed his mind to it despite his age and seniority he still felt like a stranger in the wardroom he walked to the side and gazed at the sea creaming away from the quarter except at times like this when the ship was his he blinked as a bird seemed to drop from nowhere hit the water and rise immediately a catch in its beak like a sliver of silver hell be eating that ashore while were still pounding along out here murray was so light on his feet squire had not heard him crossing the deck the surgeon was in uniform but carrying one of his familiar smocks over his arm squire said dryly always prepared arent you the hawklike profile was surveying the deck they say sound moves faster over water than land he faced squire ive been wanting to talk with you james but i was ashore most of the time before we sailed he paused and i gave my word you see you saw claire i had a feeling about it ever since he waited until a seaman coiling a halliard over his arm passed without appearing to see them ive been thinking about her quite a lot murray repeated i gave my word he crossed himself with his free hand and gave a thin smile until we sailed at least she didnt want you to concern yourself then with a touch of impatience its for your own good man shes still reliving her experiences thats only too common in my experience although in my profession we tend to underestimate the damage to the mind he fell silent as a bosuns mate walked toward the fore hatch moistening his silver call with his tongue then he said am i wrong about this jamie squire said staring at the sea i have nothing to offer her then looked steadily at murray but ive never felt like this about any woman he shrugged trying to dismiss it ill probably never see her again anyway murray gripped his wrist with surprising strength i hope you do for both your sakes whatever else he might have said was interrupted by the shrill of the call all hands all hands to exercise action murray turned to leave the quarterdeck the white smock streaming from his arm but he paused long enough to watch the gun crews running to their stations each man no doubt thinking that the next time would be in deadly earnest he had seen too much of it and there was always the bloody aftermath he looked aft again but squire was by the compass box calling to the two helmsmen where he belonged murray thought above all of them david napier climbed into the foretop and paused to regain his breath he had already visited the maintop and had left midshipman hotham with another lookout tucker greeted him with a grin and a thumbsup too much good food david and napier loosened his shirt not as young as i was david they both laughed napier looked across the larboard bow balanced and shading his eyes against the fierce glare it was an exciting sensation this towering structure of masts spars and canvas all quivering with power he could recall when he had been too scared to release his grip let alone dare to look down at the ship beneath him he asked are you settled now tucker shrugged now an then i find meself looking up at the tgallant yards an further napier felt the barricade press into his hip as the mast leaned over again thinking of hotham who had already been appointed acting lieutenant more than once he would be the next to confront the inquisition and at some time in the future with luck it would be his own turn once it had seemed impossible he had not even dared to imagine it he felt himself smile back in those days when bolithos cousin elizabeth had called him his captains servant he realised that tucker had said something and must have repeated it he was suddenly tense could i use your glass tucker pushed some hair from his eyes and seemed oblivious to the deck and the sea far beneath him napier watched his profile as he adjusted the telescope with strong fingers pausing only to murmur not a patch on sir richards old glass eh dave but he was not smiling tucker handed the telescope back to napier i wasnt sure its still too far napier steadied the glass and knew tucker was waiting for his reaction he could see nothing but the glare like metal on the water and the constant change of colour and movement the swell steep and angry in the steady wind there was nothing solid nothing you could describe or recognise only flotsam fragments driven by wind and tide it might have covered several miles but it had once been a living vessel ill tell him he was halfway into the lubbers hole when tucker called out slow down we dont want to lose you napier hesitated one foot dangling in the air i want the captain to know you saw it first he knew tucker was still gazing after him as his feet found the first ratline he was not even breathless when he completed his descent and scrambled onto the starboard gangway the picture in his mind was as vivid as the moment he had seen it the gun drill had stopped or been curtailed but most of the crew were still at their stations those on the starboard side looked up as his shadow passed and their upturned faces were full of questions napier knew the first lieutenant was there but avoided him and kept his eyes on the quarterdeck at the end of the gangway his pace steady and unhurried something he had learned from experience they were all there as if they had not moved in all the time he had been crouched high above them the captain came to meet him the others remaining grouped near the compass and wheel d you need time for a second wind david he said it kindly turning him a little away from the others napier felt a shiver run through his body although the sun was hot across his shoulders he said wreckage sir and gestured ahead and saw some seamen turn to scan the empty horizon on either bow sir pieces no part of ship we could recognise he faltered realising that another shadow had joined theirs it was the flag captain he swallowed hard but straightened his back in response as tyacke smiled and said dont stop mr napier ive heard every word so far and averted his face slightly as if he knew that the scars were disturbing napier the boy gulped and pressed on the lookout david tucker saw it first sir even without a glass he knew tyacke said a good man i hear napier saw drummond the bosun who was standing with the others give him a quick nod i told you so napier went on a small vessel sir and fell silent as tyacke turned back and seemed to measure his response perhaps we must do more than hope he gazed at the sea indifferent to the metallic glare the wreckage lies across our course he looked up at the masthead pendant an hour two at the most adam nodded aware that vincent had come aft to join them even men off watch or excused from deck duty seemed to have gathered and the cook with one of his assistants was peering out from the galley hatch probably wondering if it would interrupt his schedule lieutenant devereux was in animated conversation with sergeant fairfax breaking down the inevitable barrier of his predecessors death he could sense tyackes mind working his patience perhaps running out adam said we shall shorten sail but hold this course until we can discover more evidence it was enough for the moment they all had plenty to think about he looked down over the quarterdeck and saw jago leaning against the boat tier well need a boat if we find anything almost as if jago had put the thought into his mind he turned back as vincent said i should like to take the boat sir i shall remember that when the time comes mark he glanced up at the taut canvas but shorten sail when youve mustered the hands vincent half smiled aye aye sir adam saw midshipman huxley leading napier to the companion tyacke must have already slipped away unseen to the great cabin they had not spoken of it but tyacke must be wondering what the admiral would have in store for him when they eventually returned to freetown and after that it was as if the whole ship had been waiting for the word drummond did not need to use his call hands aloft move yourselves there squire stood beside the wheel and listened to the squeal of tackles as the gig was lowered from the quarter davits it was never an easy task with the ship at sea after first manhandling it from the tier below the quarterdeck and he could hear one of the helmsmens heavy breathing as he fought to hold the helm steady and the compass under control under reefed topsails and jib onward was a different creature her performance sluggish at the mercy of the wind instead of commanding it jago looked up waiting as vincent judged the right moment before clambering down to join him someone called hope they got strong arms luke itll be a hard pull julyan was standing by and squire heard him mutter hope they have strong stomachs more likely squire stared from bow to bow feeling the deck shudder to the surge and plunge of the rudder the gig was moving away clear of the quarter oars already lowered and motionless like wings it was not a light boat but it seemed to move like a leaf on a millrace and yet jago remained on his feet his hand on the tiller vincent was squatting in the sternsheets hatless and shielding his eyes from the spray now being thrown up by the blades a few strokes while the gig pulled clear and there were already fragments of wood badly charred being carried between them further away there were larger pieces which must have been blown from the hull by the explosion a hatch cover a few broken gratings and farther still a piece of spar a small vessel then maybe a cutter or schooner he tensed as something gleamed through the swell and vanished a shark vincent might have seen it he would not need reminding of the last time when he had boarded the sinking abandoned moonstone jago had been with him then and napier also like a pattern for the events that followed he heard the captains voice clear and unhurried tell mr monteith to put more men larboard side forrard a pause you do it sinden someone shouted from the gangway nearby squire knew it was midshipman walker their youngest and no stranger to action or to danger but his cry was like that of a girl men were already running to the side one carrying a grapnel and line it was a corpse but someone must have secured him alive to the hatch cover after the explosion where the shark had reached him a terrible death squire heard the captain cross to the opposite side of the quarterdeck and thought he heard julyans voice perhaps asking a question and the reply no well alter course when im satisfied not before it seemed an eternity the sea was almost empty again it was only one mans decision suppose it was mine he thought of vincent the expression on his face when he had volunteered for the boat party he would never admit defeat he turned as a shout rang through the chorus of sounds from loose canvas and shrouds deck there it was midshipman hotham still in the maintop with his big signals telescope the sun had shifted or was hidden by a partly reefed sail adam stared up at the arm pointing from the top and trained his own glass on the same bearing a mistake perhaps or vincent signalling to admit failure and request support for his exhausted oarsmen adam tried again waiting for the gig to reappear the swell was deep enough to hide it completely he held his breath and watched the one upright figure then he lowered the telescope and said quietly theyve found somebody alive give way together jago lurched against the tiller bar keeping his balance as the oars brought the gig under control it took all their skill and strength to do it with the sea rising and sliding away on either beam as if to swallow them the gig carried two extra men standing in the bows with boathooks to fend off any floating debris that might impede the stroke or damage the hull they had both struggled aft to help haul the survivor inboard and now he was lying in the sternsheets his shoulders propped against vincent the first lieutenants breeches were soaked with blood he was gulping air unsteadily sometimes rasping and shuddering as if losing the fight the stroke oarsman gasped dont give up matey and jago glared at him save yer breath or youll be the next jago stared at the man they had found clinging face down to a piece of framework the sort used to separate cargo in a small vessels hold it had been intact not even scorched he watched vincent unfastening the sodden coat it was green like the uniforms of the private army as he had heard one of the marines call it which he had seen during their visit to new haven he scowled who the hell had given it a name like that he recalled the brief gunfire and later that one godawful explosion nothing made sense someone said pity our doc aint with us vincent did not look up but snapped so pull harder he could do no better out here jago would have smiled at any other time bloody officers but he reached down from the tillerbar and gripped the hand which had suddenly returned to life weak at first as if unable or unwilling to find hope and icecold although the thwarts and bottom boards were bonedry in the sun the eyes were suddenly wide open unblinking and jago tightened his grip steady as she goes matey just a bit longer he had seen a lot of men fighting for life in all the years he had served at sea and had watched plenty of them give up the eyes were still on his not fear it was disbelief vincent dragged his hand into the sunlight some dried blood but nothing much he spoke softly his voice almost drowned by the creak and thud of oars broken ribs the explosion he glanced at the oars slowing now the breathing was louder as soon as we get him aboard he did not finish knowing the man was trying to turn his head to look at his face or perhaps the uniform vincent leaned over him there was more blood on his own white breeches were taking you to safety try to rest youre among friends now jago eased the tiller yet again and watched onward as she appeared to lengthen across the gigs stem there would be many helping hands once he had managed to work his way alongside without much of a lurch he thought of vincent strict but fair not a hardhorse like some he tried to smile like most but the smile did not come he eyed the masts the poop the big ensign streaming from the gaff above closer now men on the gangway some running tackle being hoisted as a further guide where the surgeon would be waiting bows onward was reaching out to receive them with extra ladders and rope fenders to cushion the impact as he guided the final few strokes of the sweating oarsmen onward was rolling reefed sails still holding the wind showing her copper one minute and then the reflection of her gunports as she dipped toward him jago shut everything else from his mind conscious of the mans grip on his ankle as he was trying to keep his balance and fix the moment nothing else could interfere vincent was calming the survivor and he was suddenly silent as if he thought he had imagined the ship so close jago shouted oars and as the blades lifted and steadied showering spray over the men beneath he was unsettled by the silence a heaving line snaked out of nowhere and was seized by one of the bowmen vincent must have stumbled or been taken unawares by the motion the rescued man had dragged himself on to his knees and was staring up at jago as he eased the tiller for the impact his voice was cracked strangled but as the stroke oarsman came to jagos aid he began shouting at the top of his voice it was garbled meaningless then he stared directly into jagos eyes again as if he was judging the moment holding him jago could not look away a voice not much different from his own loud and very distinct but only one word mutiny his eyes were still wide open but he was dead it was not dark in the cabin but it seemed almost gloomy after the activity on deck adam stood by the stern windows his hand on the bench feeling the motion the regular thud of the rudder the sea was streaked with gold the last sunlight and there seemed no horizon behind him tyacke was sitting at the little desk his shoeless feet protruding into a slanting patch of coppery light someone was hammering overhead but otherwise the ship noises seemed very subdued tyacke said suddenly tomorrow then and adam nodded at this rate some time in the afternoon maybe later if the wind drops inshore he could picture the chart in his mind he glanced at the bergere and dismissed the idea if he gave in now it would take another explosion to wake him he had been on deck again a moment ago almost deserted but for the watchkeepers and a few anonymous figures sitting by the guns or looking at the sea alongside and the canvaswrapped body beside one of the eighteenpounders not for burial this time tyacke had remarked theyll want to know to be sure it was curt but it made sense he had struggled to his feet now and was looking for his shoes your coxn jagohe did well today i told him so adam heard the pantry door open perhaps an inch he recalled jagos face as tyacke had spoken to him and something else vincent had said nothing to him he could imagine jagos voice bloody officers and the surgeon who had been waiting to examine the dead man when he was hoisted aboard when murray had made his report his hands red from scrubbing he had said simply i dont know how he managed to stay alive tyacke had replied only but now we know why he was looking toward the pantry door now and raised his voice a little a lifetime ago somebody suggested that a drink maybe two might be forthcoming morgan padded softly to the table and put two glasses within reach frowning and tutting as the deck tilted and the rudder groaned in protest they each took a glass and morgan filled them without spilling a drop murmuring your health gentlemen tyacke drank deeply and gestured to morgan to refill his glass and said almost wistfully like old times sir richard bolithos flag captain would never forget seek and destroy adam bolitho paused near the top of the companion ladder to prepare himself he felt the air on his face cool and refreshing stirring the folds of his clean shirt the coolness would be brief the morning watch was only an hour old the ship almost quiet except for sounds which like his own breathing were too familiar to notice it had been a moonless night so that the stars had seemed exceptionally bright paving the sky from horizon to horizon he thought he had slept reasonably well in the bergere with his feet propped on a stool which morgan must have put there but he had heard tyacke cry out during the night somebodys name a womans but the sleeping cabin door had remained closed and he had heard nothing more he braced his shoulders and mounted the last of the steps it was always like this at the end of a passage you could feel the nearness of land even imagine you could smell it and there was always the doubt the uncertainty he touched his chin and smiled ruefully he had shaved himself not as well as jago would have but if anybody needed rest now it was his coxswain figures were already turning toward him as he stepped on to the quarterdeck his white shirt would have been like a beacon in the dimness before dawn and he had always hated stealth unlike a few officers he could have named vincent had the watch and was standing by the compass box its tiny flame reflecting in his eyes he said winds eased a bit sir but i thought id wait for some light before sending the hands aloft to spread more sail besides its better to see than be seen i agree adam looked at the spread of canvas which seemed to contain their world the sea on either beam was still black vincent hesitated can we expect trouble when we make a landfall sir adam rested both hands on the quarterdeck rail and looked toward the forecastle beyond the pale stretch of deck there was little to see the vague shadows of hatches and the regular black shapes which were the breeches of the guns and now an occasional spectre of spray rising then fading above a gangway his brain was shaking off any lingering desire for sleep he faced vincent and said i think we always have to expect trouble mark especially after what you discovered he saw him glance in the direction of the guns where the canvaswrapped body was stowed as soon as we call hands and its safe enough i want topchains hoisted and rigged at the yards vincent showed his teeth thought you might sir if were called on to fight there could be casualties enough without falling spars adding to the bill adam almost smiled no doubt the admiral would describe them as unsightly vincent gestured toward the sea surely theyd never dare fire on a kings ship somebody called out and another hurried to obey but adam was reminded of tyackes comment when they had been alone together our flag flies in many lands but not always by invitation to most of them were still the invaders there was a sudden metallic clatter forward followed by a familiar bout of coughing the cook was already up and about and no matter what might lie ahead for him the galley came first vincent said he was on deck when i took over the watch who needs the sandglass lynch had spent most of his life at sea in one kind of ship or another at the first hint of danger the galley fires would be doused to avoid any accident but lynch liked to have enough food prepared and ready for the return of what he called kinder times vincent turned away to watch a seaman running across the deck but he was lost in the predawn shadows when the flag captain visits the governor he paused if he does will he be taking the gig adam said only you are ahead of me mark and thought vincent might have shrugged a cutter might be a better choice sir good thinking a cutter can mount a swivel if need be better safe than swamped they both laughed and a seaman who was taking a mouthful of water from the readyuse cask looked up and muttered not a care in th bloody world adam walked slowly aft past the men at the wheel and tozer the masters mate who had been with him in delfims prize crew here it was deserted only a small part of the ship the sea astern still in darkness in another hour or so all hands would be piped and the land would lie ahead like a barrier he slipped his hand inside his shirt and gripped the ribbon a little worn now and fraying but hers a precious moment captain sir it was over harry drummond paused by the boat tier and stooped to pick up a piece of codline before tucking it into his belt it would probably not be needed but as onwards bosun and even long before he had learned to make use of almost everything the miles of standing and running rigging the massive cables now stowed and drying below deck were his responsibility he smiled to himself and felt his mouth crack next to the first lieutenant of course he stood in the shade beneath the braced canvas and stared disapprovingly at the topchains on the upper yards necessary maybe but unseamanlike they had rigged them just in time too the ship had altered course again and the yards were hardbraced to a landsman she would appear to be almost foreandaft but every sail was firm and filled a few seamen were still working aloft bodies halfnaked in the sun some might be sorry afterwards it was going to be one of the hottest days yet drummond looked at the land again but there had been no change it reached from bow to bow in an endless green barrier without shape or identity otherwise the sea was empty no local craft hugging the coast for convenience nor blackbirder making a run for it with rumours of a manofwar in the area drummond thought of the drifting wreckage and the human remains followed always by those accursed sharks and his eyes rested briefly on the canvaswrapped corpse near one of the guns who would know or care better to have put him over the side like the others he looked at the land again unless the wind picked up theyd be lucky to anchor much before dusk he had seen the captain with julyan the master comparing notes on the quarterdeck and the flag captain had shown himself a couple of times too a finelooking man or had been he saw luke jago climb from the fore hatch his old cutlass beneath his arm taking no chances eh luke it was somehow reassuring to see him like this apparently unmoved by his experience amidst that grisly flotsam but who could tell jago gave nothing away he was peering up at the taut canvas pity we cant make more sail and drummond nodded sagely they dont want any one to sight us too soon i reckon they turned as several loud clangs seemed to shake the deck beneath their feet jago said theyll bloody well ear us before that there were shouts and the din stopped it was one of the gunners armourers hammering something on the anvil the watch below had yelled their protests eating what might be their last meal before they were called to quarters with a tot for good measure drummond said not many captains would care that much luke he could share things like that with the burly coxswain inscrutable though jago often was they had little in common except the ship and their friendship which had only begun when drummond had joined onward to replace the dead bosun but the navy was like that sometimes there was no reason to consider a man a good mate but it was a fact then he added hastily ill shove off now one of your young gentlemens approaching it was napier unexpectedly jago said stay will you drummond shrugged you got the tiller luke napier slowed down and halted by the stand of boarding pikes at the foot of the mainmast he had already recognized the old cutlass despite its scabbard the same one which had saved his life aboard the sinking moonstone he was saying rather shyly i wanted to see you when you have a moment maybe later when a voice echoed along the deck bosun pause bosun drummond raised his fist and bellowed comin sir and added quietly id better go mister bloody monteith needs me he grinned defiantly at napier and strode away jago saw the boys eyes on his hand as he closed it gently around his forearm ive been wanting the grip tightened very slightly i think i knows what you want to say one day when youre a capn with your own ship an all the men to fetch an carry for you youll remember the bad old days with us eh sir well thatll keep him quiet for a bit drummond was back and somehow he knew they were both glad of the interruption adam bolitho walked into the great cabin and closed the screen door behind him this sanctuary was always the same and yet he never took it for granted more spacious even bare without those familiar articles which had already been safely stowed away hugh morgan gestured to the chair and the sword lying across it ive given it a proper polish sir adam nodded but he was looking at the sleeping cabin door i just wanted a moment with him morgan lowered his voice captain tyacke is almost done sir then ill clear the space as usual adam continued on his way aft and gazed at the sea the changing colour almost gentle after the pitiless glare on deck he touched the chair alone now and facing astern even the little desk had been taken away with his most recent letter halffinished in one of the drawers morgan murmured if you would care for something before later maybe he listened to the rudder and the regular clatter of rigging the motion was uneven erratic and had been since the change of tack tyackes leather satchel was lying on the bench seat beneath the stern windows where he must have used the old telescope to look back at his flagshipperhaps for the last time if the breakers men were waiting in the wings the thought made him look away from the sea and around the dim cabin again suppose it was onward ah there you are adam i was just coming to have a few words adam had been half expecting it but it still came as a surprise tyacke was in full uniform even to the tarnished gold aiguillette fastened across his breast he said no more signs of trouble then good he had not waited for an answer adam watched him walk to the bench seat and lean on it while he peered down into the water below the counter ill have the cutter lowered when were more in the lee of the land a good boats crew but he said it as if his mind were elsewhere something i wanted to ask you the scarred face turned the seas light reflecting across it id like one of your experienced midshipmen to go with me he can take care of the admirals instructions one hand moved dismissively not your signals middyhes acting lieutenant if you need one i thought young napier would fill the bill after what ive seen of him he looked up as a call shrilled somewhere and feet responded across the deck with your consent of course in the seconds before adam could answer tyacke had walked over to the bergere and was gazing down at the sword as if he wanted to touch it he said only equality dick and the blue eyes came up steadily and held adams adam said ill do all i can morgan interjected sharply i think you are wanted on deck sir he was for the most part a warmhearted person but as adam strode past him on his way to the door he saw morgan regarding tyacke with something like hatred vincent was waiting by the companionway i thought you should know sir he glanced past him as if he expected to see tyacke close on his heels masthead reported another sail same course as ours but small hard to identify may be one of those brigantines the flag captain mentioned adam opened his telescope and climbed into the nettings there was mist nearer the coast and the vessel was directly sternon all sails set but scarcely visible overwhelmed by the solid mass of land reaching out on either bow as if waiting to ensnare them you may be right mark but shes well ahead of us warn the lookouts to report any change of bearing he knew the others near and around the wheel were trying to hear what was being said he jumped down to the deck and saw that the second cutter had already been moved to the quarterdavits ready for lowering well lower the cutter when we clear the point closer for the oarsmen but room enough for us if we need to change tack in a hurry vincent said im told that midshipman napier is going with the flag captain sir he hurried on hes young but i daresay experienced enough he should be safe enough in the same boat as captain tyacke he turned away as julyan appeared on the quarterdeck the master is about to rig a dogvane sir close inshore it can detect any change of wind quicker than anything he swears by them but adam was looking at the empty cutter and vincent tried to imagine what he was thinking it was the right decision but would i have made it lieutenant james squire leaned over the quarterdeck bulwark observing the cutters slow progress down onwards side always an anxious time in the open sea in case something vital was left behind or forgotten he had hoisted and lowered boats countless times during his years at sea but there was always the possibility of some potentially fatal oversight he watched for the cutters shadow as it rose and fell beneath the keel handsomely does it too soon and the boat might overturn when it hit the water too late and avast lowering squire looked up briefly at the outthrust spur of land saw some tiny whitepainted hut or beacon perched at the seaward end closer now but it would still be a strong pull for the cutters crew doublebanked or not he had done it a few times himself pass me the glass he had to repeat it midshipman huxley was paying more attention to the cutter no doubt too busy thinking about his friend napier going ashore with captain tyacke a few more turns and the cutter was pitching and plunging alongside some of her crew already securing equipment while trying to keep their balance fitzgerald her coxswain peering critically across the span of open water to the unmoving layer of mist above which was a tiny patch of colour the union jack squire turned as someone muttered a warning heads up captain james tyacke walked to the quarterdeck rail and stood in silence studying the land squire was aware of the effect of the uniform and saw it in the faces of the seamen around him perhaps by that gesture the day had suddenly acquired new meaning and purpose in their eyes he heard vincent call ill have the cutter brought to the entry port sir and saw tyacke shake his head take too long he might have smiled but there was another emotion in his eyes man the boat fitzgerald touched his hat and ran to the ladder which had been lowered soon after all hands had been called tyacke waited until the cutter was fully manned two seamen to each thwart and a swivel gun at the stem only then did he turn and extend his hand to adam bolitho vincent was watching the masthead pendant and the rebellious flapping of canvas impatient to bring the ship under command again once the cutter had pulled clear adam returned the handshake strong and uncompromising like the man there was no more time adam said only signal if you need us tyacke gazed up at the ensign curling easily against the clear sky his blue eyes almost colourless in the fierce light i hope he released his grip until we meet again adam he turned abruptly and climbed down into the cutter and seconds later or so it seemed it appeared well clear of onwards side unhurriedly all oars pulling as one adam remained by the rail and watched their progress as the ship came alive around and above him her canvas filling and resumed her course then he walked slowly across the deck with the wind in his face julyans dogvane was fluttering from a halfpike mounted in the weather shrouds his own battle ensign perhaps he heard vincent call to one of his leadsmen already stationed in the chains for the approach their landmark that tiny distant flag heard the splash and the leadsmans chant no bottom sir they were ready he looked again but the cutter had disappeared steady lads easy does it fitzgerald was half crouched half standing at the cutters tiller staring over the twin banks of oarsmen at the outthrust spur of land it was just for something to say and he knew it was because of his passenger his crew were all skilled seamen they would not be here otherwise even the midshipman with the satchel wedged between his knees was not one of those iknowbest types he had met in the past god help poor jack when they walked their own quarterdecks he felt spray on his mouth as the strokeoar leaned away from him again the cutter was answering well despite carrying a few extra bodies two marines in the bows as well as a man with a boats leadandline although it was not needed yet you could see the bottom through the clear water even dark patches of weed coming alive with the current as the oars dug deep on either beam they were all armed cutlasses stacked beneath the thwarts and the marines already sweating heavily in their scarlet uniforms were in charge of the swivel gun which was concealed by a canvas hood fitzgerald eased the tiller again and fixed his eyes on the faroff flag the union jack the same flag they saw hoisted or lowered every day of their lives but out here it seemed alien out of place deeper water now steadier in some way david napier felt the salt spray splashing over the gunwale and soaking his legs he tried not to look into the faces of the oarsmen as they lay back on their looms following the strokeoar measuring every breath he had seen their eyes staring astern after they had cast off from the frigates side and was glad his back was turned he had never found leaving the comparative safety of the ship an easy moment and captain tyacke had scarcely spoken since his agile climb down into the boat apart from exchanging a few words with the coxswain and with one of the marines a corporal who had just been transferred from the flagship the corporal had apparently once served with captain bolitho napier felt himself frowning and not merely because of the brutal sunlight trying to remember everything he had been told concerning his duty with the flag captain there had been a few slaps on the back from the others sly comments of another step up the ladder and a handshake from simon huxley but no words and he had heard the captain say watch yourselves lads but napier knew bolitho had been speaking to him tyacke half turned suddenly almost startling him and said theres a pier and a smaller jetty well be directed to one or the other his face was slightly averted the disfigurement hidden and napier imagined he could feel his own injury the limp which he had beaten he pressed his leg hard against the satchel oars another heave then the blades paused dripping like wings as fitzgerald said easy now lads and then i heard shots sor the corporal confirmed it muskets sir tyacke said fiercely carry on may be upriver or further inland we dont have time to hang fire at this stage the oars picked up the stroke and the cutter gathered way once more napier watched the land falling away to reveal the entrance to a natural harbour the anchorage beyond was still half hidden by the headland no place to venture after dark there were two small boats fishing craft moored to a ramshackle trestle and a few birds which took off as the cutter turned slightly to starboard where the outgoing current confronted and contested an ocean napier thought of jago and his efforts to talk to him always a barrier and yet theres the pier sir tyacke straightened his back and said sardonically what no red carpet laid out for us and grinned as if it reminded him of someone fitzgerald leaned closer murmuring lucky we didnt bring the corpse with us tyacke said pull to the next part and looked down at the satchel im not waiting for they all ducked instinctively as the air quivered to a drawnout explosion he shouted next jetty he stared across the looms and braced shoulders stand by with the swivel but the gingerhaired corporal had already removed the hood and was training the muzzle beyond the pier napier slung the satchel across his shoulder ears still throbbing from the explosion smoke and grit between his teeth he heard tyacke calling out to the cutters crew stand by lads but very calmly one hand resting on his sword hilt a grapnel had been thrown on to the low jetty and a few men almost fell as they came alongside metal clattering as they seized their cutlasses a couple of them dragged muskets from beneath the thwarts clear the boat but napier hung back as if he were unable to move he felt tyackes hand lightly on his arm was conscious of his voice quiet and compelling almost matteroffact ready david and his own answer aye ready sir they were ashore but the union jack had vanished aboard onward the musket shots had passed almost unheard except by a few men on watch in the tops and even then they were nearly lost in the usual chorus of shipboard noises one man raised the alarm then the full impact of the explosion rolled against the hull given extra power by the echo reverberating from the backdrop of high ground adam stood by the rail gazing the full length of his command seeing men off watch coming up from their messes some still chewing the remains of a hurried meal others working on or above the decks had fallen silent looking aft toward the quarterdeck only midshipman hotham spoke his signals telescope was still trained on the shore theyve lowered the jack sir adam watched the great arrowhead of blue water and the overlapping humps of land that guarded the harbour entrance he sensed vincent and squire standing somewhere behind him and others near the wheel waiting perhaps dreading jagos shadow merged with his own across the deck and he heard the steady breathing then he lifted his arms and felt the coxswain clip the old sword into place it was like a signal beat to quarters and clear for action no quarter vincent faced aft and touched his hat onward cleared for action sir adam returned his salute and stood looking along the length of the upper deck vincents formal use of the ships name seemed to make it more personal immediate he had already seen maddock the gunner on his way to the semidarkness of the magazine his felt slippers gripped in one hand appearing to glance briefly at the guns with a word or a nod to each crew his head was as usual cocked to one side in case the deafness caused him to miss something which in maddocks case was unlikely these were his men every day of their lives they carried out countless tasks to keep the ship alive and running but in the end this was their purpose to work and fight these guns if necessary to die doing it they often discussed it even joked about it on messdecks and in wardroom alike but now the ship was quiet waiting vincent said they knocked two minutes off the time sir it was meant to break the tension but his face remained drawn and adam thought he was in need of a good sleep adam looked up as the topsails flapped untidily before filling once more the land still seemed a long way away but it was having its effect like a giant barrier he touched the telescope he had borrowed but changed his mind load when youre ready as planned not a race vincent was already gesturing to a bosuns mate but dont run out he moved nearer to the wheel where tobias julyan was comparing notes with tozer his mate julyan peered up at the masthead pendant and pursed his lips well be losing a knot or two when we change tack next time sir tozer ventured the last time afore we enter harbour sir adam turned and saw the leadsman in the chains hauling in his line his mouth soundlessly forming the soundings then he shouted by the mark ten julyan grinned no wonder its a long haul ten fathoms sixty feet onward drew three fathoms the second leadsman was already leaning against his apron and lowering his own lead in readiness they were feeling their way like a blind man tapping along an unfamiliar street adam said part of your valley julyan nodded feeling the pocket where he kept his bulky notebook dont want to scrape off her barnacles just yet sir deep nine julyan licked his lips i think ill keep my mouth shut surprisingly one of the helmsmen laughed the rest was drowned by the rumble of gun trucks as breechings were cast off and the eighteenpounders were manhandled inboard and loaded under the watchful eye of every senior hand adam saw the fists raised as each crew finished but the guns were not run out he looked up at the tops where royal marines stripped of their bright coats were already lying or crouching with muskets or manning the swivel guns they would be feeling the full heat of the sun up there adam walked to the side of the quarterdeck and touched one of the blunt carronades as he passed hot as if it had just been fired and already loaded each round packed with castiron balls in tiers and deadly metal disks at short range they could transform a crowded deck into a slaughterhouse he unslung the telescope and trained it abeam and felt the metal sear his fingers towards and across the harbour entrance like the impression on the chart hacked out of the african coastline as julyan had described it he imagined the governors building the line of cannon and the flag not a lot of room to manoeuvre but compared with portsmouth harbour where ships of the line were expected to enter and depart at the drop of a signal new haven seemed spacious and quiet vincent said shall i shorten sail sir he had moved to join him perhaps so the others would not be concerned by any apparent lastminute hesitation and so they might adam looked briefly at the feathered windvane were going in and the boats cast them adrift adam glanced down at the boat tier if boats were kept aboard during a fight their flying splinters caused more casualties he had seen it often enough even as a midshipman like david he shut his mind to it hold your course mark be ready to run out their eyes met then fire when i give the word by th mark seven captain james tyacke paused at the top of a steep slope and leaned against a pile of freshly cut timber he sensed that the cutters crew had also stopped and were watching him or peering up and around at the bare headland there was not only timber but piles of bricks either to extend the pier or the gun emplacements most of which faced the harbour entrance or the open sea the musket fire and the single explosion had demonstrated more clearly than anything that the threat was coming from the opposite direction he tugged at his coat and drew a long slow breath he was sweating strongly the uniform had been a gesture he was paying for it now he could see the flagstaff clearly against the sky and some of the buildings also he could even see that the flag halliard was lifting and trailing slightly in the hot wind which fitzgerald had already noted with his keen and younger eyes not lowered it had been cut perhaps the governor ballantyne had already sighted onward and was attempting to warn her fitzgerald said heads down lads but keep your eyes open calmly enough but there was an edge to his words he was looking down toward the jetty and pier and the sea beyond a sailors instinct napier was squatting on a slab of rock the satchel between his feet he looked up and found tyackes eyes on him and smiled it was time to move their arrival must have been seen tyacke fought the desire to turn and stare back at the sea suppose something had made adam change his mind who would dispute it or blame him fitzgerald stood up and eased his shoulders i was thinkin sor there was a faint click and he froze and another voice murmured still someones comin tyacke groped for his sword hilt but let his hand fall if he had led them into a trap it was already too late he called stand fast and gestured to napier you with me he stared past the others at the litter of building gear and beyond like a skeleton against the hillside a partly demolished barn with a rusting horseshoe nailed on a post an unavoidable delay captain tyacke but you are welcome beyond words it was a deep authoritative voice and for a moment seemed to come from nowhere or the ground itself tyacke had on two occasions seen but never met sir duncan ballantyne but he was as he remembered and as adam bolitho had described a face from the armada even to the neatly trimmed beard showing grey now against darkly tanned skin he strode toward them frowning with a faint disapproval as one of the seamen released the hammer of his musket he said calmly my own men were watching you as well two or three heads appeared as he spoke and tyacke saw the gleam of weapons he took the proferred hand strong but the palm was smooth a gentleman tyacke said controlling the urge to touch his scars how did you know my name ballantyne smiled diplomatically i know of only one flag captain his dark eyes rested on napier a younger blood too i am honoured he gestured toward the building with its empty flag mast come he was coatless but tyacke noted the finely made shirt and white breeches obviously expensive as were the black riding boots their polish gleaming beneath the inevitable coating of dust about sixty years of age according to flags notebook without the beard he would seem younger guilty he thought youre as guilty as hell and one day ill prove it ballantyne had stopped and was pointing back at the water i see that you were taking no chances either he laughed the corporal was standing bareheaded behind his swivel gun his hair in the sunlight blazing almost as brightly as his uniform tyacke found that he had fallen into step beside ballantyne corporal price would have known that at this range and bearing the swivel gun would have been an indiscriminate killer your men can rest a while ballantyne waved toward the nearest building i can offer you something to quench your thirst again the quick quizzical glance but we are under siege at present herei will show you something he halted again your ship is under sail then who commands her captain adam bolitho i understood that you had already met him the tanned hand was on tyackes sleeve bolitho must be gods will he repeated the name as if his mind was elsewhere a fine young man but a certain sadness in him too i felt they had reached the gateway to a circular courtyard cobbled and probably built by slaves common enough in new haven or whatever it had originally been called but tyacke noticed none of it across the courtyard before him was the mast the severed halliard still catching the breeze from the sea a man lay dead at the foot of the mast but one hand was still moving firmly grasping the halliard the same green uniform but with a piece of scarlet bunting which tyacke had at first taken for blood wrapped around his neck like a scarf ballantyne kicked a loose stone across the yard until it rolled against the corpse he said so that they can tell the difference he turned back toward tyacke his eyes filling his face mutineers rebels call them what you will they are still traitors he walked on and although tyacke was a tall man he had to quicken his pace to keep up with him he thought he had seen some human shadows through a colonnade as if there were others watching perhaps waiting to remove the dead intruder now they were on another side of the building on a terrace overlooking the next stretch of anchorage there were a few small vessels obviously derelict or abandoned and beyond the full panorama of hills tyacke kept walking toward the low wall but stopped when ballantyne touched his sleeve no further captain we are possibly out of range here but why take the risk as if in response there was a dull bang probably a musket but no hint of any fall of shot ballantyne said calmly we are the ones under siege we can withstand any frontal attack by those scum but we are cut off from our supply routes his hand indicated the terrace this place was built to defend others he had taken tyackes arm again look yonder captain perhaps the fight is already lost tyacke shaded his eyes with his hat to gaze across the glittering breadth of new haven there was wreckage clinging to a long sandbar and smaller fragments still breaking away beneath a layer of fine smoke like mist tyacke recognised the shape of the vessels hull and the gleam of blue paint which he knew had only recently been applied now a total wreck mastless and abandoned if any one had lived long enough to escape he said quietly endeavour one of my patrols there were more shots no closer even haphazard as if they were being held in check then he said we picked up one of your men that was how we knew about the mutiny he dragged out a crumpled piece of paper and flattened it on a bench away from the wall it was badly stained with smoke and dried blood ballantyne stared at it and nodded slowly several times john staples acting bosun a good man i should have seen it coming he swung round and exclaimed ill not go under without a fight damn their bloody eyes it was strange to see him suddenly defeated tyacke felt someone beside him it was david napier holding a telescope which must have been concealed in the satchel i didnt know you had that with you the captain told me to bring it in case we might need it napiers chin lifted and he sounded very young do we sir like a hand on the shoulder tyacke swung toward the harbour entrance his mind suddenly iceclear a single shot one of the deaf gunners specials the signal onward was on the way no matter what he took the old telescope with its finely engraved inscription and opened it carefully almost reverently bolithos telescope like those other times napier watched him conscious of the sudden silence around them what can i do sir tyacke answered without hesitation fetch our flag from the cutter tell fitzgerald to run it up to the masthead he broke off his mind too full to continue he did not even hear napier say ill do it myself tyacke was watching the picture in the powerful lens acquire shape and significance like seashells caught in the reflected glare onwards topsails he hardly recognised his own voice sir duncan youre not alone any more adam bolitho stood at the quarterdeck rail one hand resting lightly on the smooth wood which seemed to burn beneath the sun it helped him to remain in the same place where he could see and be seen when every urge and instinct dictated that he should be on the move it was quiet the shipboard noises muffled perhaps by their slow progress the most persistent sound came from an almost constant alteration of helm the creak of the big double wheel or a sharp correction from quartermaster or helmsman a glance aloft and the loosely flapping topsails and listless pendant told their own story the nearness of land without moving adam had watched the rugged coastline creeping out on either bow as if onward were intent on running ashore he could sense the readiness among the men around him extra hands now at braces and halliards a few wearing bandages even those from the sick quarters were not spared and the men at the guns some peering at the land visible now on both sides or looking aft waiting was the worst part by the mark seven adam watched the leadsman hauling in his line his bare shoulders wet with spray he tried to recall the chart and julyans crude but accurate copy holding steady he glanced at the tiny white shape on the nearest elbow of land soon after this more soundings would be necessary a splash and a brief flurry of smoke the last of the galley fire he saw a seaman climbing aloft carrying a container of water and watched by the nearest gun crews all their mouths were as dry as dust but the plight of the marines the marksmen sprawled in the tops must be far worse he saw lieutenant devereux talking to two of his men by the fore hatch in full uniform sword gleaming at his side the duelling sword adam wondered devereux was smiling and so were his men he heard vincent speak to the quartermaster before joining him at the rail good thing we didnt lower the boats after all sir we dont need another anchor he seemed calm enough but his voice was edged with the usual impatience a first lieutenants lot adam had not forgotten what it was like vincent looked sharply along the deck as somebody gave a wild cheer what the hell but others had joined in gun crews peering or climbing on to their gangways even individuals calling from yards or shrouds luke jago shouted up from the boat tier theyve run up the flag capn adam reached instinctively for his telescope then remembered our flag he saw a seaman turn toward him grinning perhaps he had spoken aloud he walked to the side and lifted his hat to the shore someone called out wreckage larboard bow sir vincent said ill be up forrard sir and i shall be here mark the cheering had stopped there were more shots but it was impossible to judge the bearing or distance like the wind it was playing tricks adam stared at the headland again the ensign was very clear now a twin of the one above the poop midshipman hotham offered him the big signals telescope theyre on the wall sir adam trained it carefully and waited for the crisscross of rigging to dissolve away there were faces on the first stretch of the battery wall and somebody was waving perhaps cheering as onward came past wellsited guns were a ships worst enemy apart from fire he moved the glass again and saw vincents face pass blurred and barely recognisable squire would be on his way aft to relieve him both good officers but any newcomer might think they scarcely knew each other the telescope steadied finding the range a few boats huddled together a shed and part of a slipway then a cluster of ragged trees adam tensed someone running he heard squires heavy breathing beside him but did not lower the telescope what do you make of it james squire wiped the sweat from his cheek with the back of his hand i think the attackers must be on this side sir a few marksmen maybe but until they can a jagged ridge of spray rose and fell interrupting him maybe only one gun but properly laid and trained all it would take to slow or disable them while stronger forces were summoned adam said run out he did not even hear the pipe only the chorus of gunports being hoisted open showing her teeth ready sir onward was heeling slightly her topsails clutching and holding the offshore wind but still no target he could hear a few curses and thumps from the gun deck as quoins were forced beneath the breeches to depress some of the guns still further someone yelled from forward as a boat under oars pulled strongly from a tiny cove which had been concealed by rushes or tall grass adam steadied the glass again and felt himself flinch as several flashes spurted from the boats gunwale as you bear he saw the nearest gun captain crouching over his breech one hand raised ready to jump clear fire only four guns could be brought to bear at this range one would have been enough the boat had taken a direct hit amidships shattered as if by a giants axe eventually it settled and was already drifting abeam planking broken oars and a bare mast and bodies musket shots but only a few until sergeant fairfaxs powerful voice brought another fusillade gone soft have you what d you think theyd do to you the firing began again green uniforms with scarlet scarves life or death the guns had hardly finished reloading when lookouts sighted more wreckage the remains of a small vessel probably one of tyackes brigantines aground on a sandbar she had been hit at pointblank range adam stared at the other shore but the battery wall was now out of sight only part of the nearby settlement was still in view and it looked deserted abandoned waiting to accept the victors perhaps it must have seen many over the centuries squire said heavily the brigantine was ahead of us sir it took more than a few shots to do that to her adam strode to the compass and wheel but ignored both looking at the masthead pendant and then at the masters dogvane it was holding up well in spite of its frail cluster of cork and feathers he saw julyan watching him through the receding gunsmoke he might even have smiled he said almost to himself while we are here theyre trapped theres only one way to escape another gun but further away no fall of shot sea against land he thought suddenly of the battle of algiers some three years ago when pellew now lord exmouth had won a resounding victory over combined land and sea forces he could remember his own surprise and pride when he had read the admirals comment in the aftermath of his victory he had described adam bolitho as a born frigate captain from englands greatest it was praise indeed a cry from the forecastle more wreckageahead sir julyan murmured soon now i think he did not finish this was as far as a vessel of any size could reach and retain room to tack or come about any one else could come overland or upstream as had happened during the attack on the mssion adam looked along the deck at the gun crews baking in the sun lookouts cupping hands around their eyes midshipmen sweating and watching the land everything and the leadsmans chant deep six he thought of vincent up there in the eyes of the ship where their figurehead the boy with his trident and riding a dolphin was pointing the way the ship comes first if onward dropped anchor to avoid running aground she would become a sitting target to be destroyed by guns from the shore or by waterborne explosives he saw more pieces of wreckage drifting past part of a topmast lifting above the rest like a charred crucifix stand by to come about warn all hands men running answering the shrill of calls some already perched on the yards high above the guns and their motionless crews adam saw that even the cooks and messmen were adding their weight to the braces he thought with a sudden strange apprehension of tyacke and napier where were they now he looked again for the flag even though he knew it was out of sight julyan lowered his eyes watering from staring at the suns path like tears give the word sir belay that it was squire his head thrown back to stare up at the braced topsails even as adam came striding toward the compass foretop sir midshipman hotham had also heard the lookouts cry and although he felt a little lost without the signals telescope he could see this in his mind like a signal enemy in sight adam lowered the telescope and felt someone take it from him the image was imprinted on his brain the ship almost bowson sails fully braced a big schooner threemasted he thought even larger than the slaver they had taken as a prize he watched closely they would meet and pass in half an hour at this rate less the stranger would be armed but no match for a frigate the other one will try to slip past us adam looked away from the pyramid of pale canvas it was another midshipman simon huxley waiting to act as a walking speakingtrumpet his eyes were fixed on the approaching schooner ready sir julyan anxious fretting over the delay adam shook his head maintain course and to the quarterdeck at large hold your fire he had the telescope again but did not recall having taken it from hotham suppose i am mistaken on the larboard bow about half a mile and looking as if she were sailing on dry land an easy error of judgment at this range and across the hard glare of the anchorage a trick to lead onward into the shallows julyan had warned him but he did not need it the smaller vessel another schooner was not trying to slip past while the others faced and fought his shirt was clinging to his body but it felt cold like the dead steady from the corner of his eye he saw faces peering up at him from the nearest eighteenpounder he stared through the shrouds and ratlines keeping his eyes on the schooner as if she were snared in a net there should be uncertainty doubt even a consciousness of failure there was none more shots closer now and he heard even felt the deck shake as some found their mark marksmen in the tops were firing too although at this range it would have little effect he thought he heard jagos voice calling to some of the afterguard youll soon know so watch yer front somebody was questioning why onward was turning away from a challenge and allowing an enemy to escape julyan called ready when you give the word sir he was calm enough he had no choice adam gripped the rail with both hands and watched the smaller schooners masts begin to turn in line her canvas in confusion for the first time from habit he reached for the telescope he had lost count of the times but this time he did not need it those same sails were all aback now the hull heeling slightly without purpose he knew squire was beside him sharing it in his own fashion he spoke for him theyve got boats in the water abandoning ship adam laid his sword flat along the rail he did not remember having drawn it he said the schooner open fire someone shouted what about the boats sir adam did not look up at the masthead pendant there was no time left he thought he heard vincent directing the forward guns he lifted his sword and knew each gun captain was watching staring aft eyes fixed on the blade the sword flashed down every gun on the larboard quarter must have fired simultaneously even as their recoil was halted the halfnaked crews were already sponging out and ramming home the next charge selecting another ball from the nearest shotgarland as the thunder of the broadside rolled away the gun captains were yelling to each other some coughing as the gunsmoke streamed through the open ports adam heard monteith almost shrill above the noise calling someones name then a seaman running perhaps in answer another rattle of musket fire closer now shots hitting the hull or slapping through the canvas overhead the running man swung round as if taken by surprise then he fell a few paces from the nearest gun crew adam forced himself to look away to turn his eyes toward the approaching ship nothing else must distract or concern him the masthead lookouts and vincent up forward would have an unbroken view two ships onwards bowsprit pointing directly at her enemys jib the shooting was almost continuous now and the royal marines were firing with regular precision as if on a range at any moment onwards bowchasers would come to bear then her carronades he tore his eyes away to look for the abandoned schooner that too had been a ruse without regard for their own lives the schooner was heeling over toward him her deck splintered another splash through the clinging smoke and she was mastless somebody cried out near or far he was beyond understanding as if all the air had been forced punched out of his lungs or his ears were covered by unseen hands how long maybe only a split second and then came the explosion he felt spray across his face as fragments hit the sea almost alongside something striking the deck with a shower of sparks as his hearing returned he became aware of the shouts and the clank of pumps spilling water over the sundried planking the smaller schooner had vanished some of her remains were coming to the surface they had misjudged onwards change of direction even the schooners crew had not escaped vincent was waving perhaps shouting to confirm his readiness a drop of the hand and a ninepounder responded from the forecastle the smoke was fanning away as one of the carronades shook the hull julyan was shouting now and adam saw him gesture toward the big schooner theyre cutting it fine sir he stared down at his own arm which was smeared with blood then seemed to shrug casually adam had seen the gesture so often in the chartroom when dealing with a problem which he usually managed to solve the big schooner had altered course again if she drew closer to the other shore she still might reach the open sea they were still firing and her upper deck seemed to be full of uniforms the schooner was the transport they were the main force so far and mutiny was a contagious disease it could soon spread he winced as the second carronade fired its deadly charge across the other vessels forecastle he did not need a telescope to see the splinters flying men scattering like rags under a full charge of grape helm hard over adam saw squire turn from the compass box and nod he was biting his lip but onward was answering slowly there was an extra helmsman at the wheel one already lay dead near squires feet squire saw midshipman huxley duck by the bulwark as more shots hammered into the deck he caught his attention and called keep on the move then swore under his breath as a splinter sprang from the deck within inches of his own foot adam watched the great arrowhead of water between the two ships in a few minutes they would be carried further apart he picked up his sword and heard some of the seamen calling out to one another he felt a shot hit and ricochet from one of the eighteenpounders one of the crew leaning on his rammer did not move he was still gazing aft at his captain more shouts this time from the foremast the upper yard the royal had been damaged or dislodged by the explosion and some men were up there in the thick of it the topchains were holding but even as he watched one of the tiny figures threw up his hands and fell adam raised his sword and looked again toward the big schooner there was a lull in the gunfire and many voices suddenly merging there must be hundreds on board outnumbering onwards company at least two to one fists were raised and he thought he saw the lens of a telescope flash in the smoky sunlight either watching the sword or taking aim he shouted full broadside together the sword was at his side but he was gripping it with all his strength a moment later onwards entire broadside fired as one fourteen eighteenpounders and anything else that can strike a match as the old gunners used to say like thunder but no longer at any distance first lieutenant wants you now it was a call for the speakingtrumpet and adam saw young huxley come to life and call out to a bosuns mate before running toward the larboard gangway a smokegrimed face peered up from the deck dont ye spoil that fine uniform sir huxley glanced down and might have smiled then he collapsed before any one could reach him he was dead midshipman hotham saw him fall but he was needed elsewhere but still he hesitated one hand in his pocket feeling for the little crucifix he always kept there which nobody else knew about dear god please receive the soul of simon huxley now he was reunited with his father ready sir the next broadside was slowly more patiently aimed for another moment adam thought that they were overhauling their enemy her foremast was down and with its broken shrouds and rigging was pointing toward them like a bridge hardly any part of her side seemed to have escaped cannon or small arms fire and even without a glass the carnage on deck was terrible to see adam unclenched his fists even the scuppers were trailing patterns of blood as if the schooner herself was bleeding to death and the angle of the remaining masts had changed julyan exclaimed shes hard aground and then looking over at adam as soon as we can sir he fell silent as the bosun crossed the quarterdeck picking his way past the dead and the injured drummond cleared his throat he had been shouting and running from one emergency to another for what seemed hours and there was a gash in his sleeve a wound he could not remember receiving another inch and he would have been dead he had adams attention now theyve run up a white flag sir ill need a boarding party then we will anchor and he saw julyan nod satisfied jago was nearby and adam felt his lips crack when he tried to smile at him this was no victory to be proud of but few were jago said only youll be needin the gig capn the governor must be informed jago peered around for some of his crew if they were still alive adam stood a moment his hand resting on a jagged splinter the anger returned and swept through him and he welcomed the strength it gave him but first i will go around our ship vincent had come aft eyes redrimmed from smoke and strain as two seamen were dragging the dead helmsman away from the wheel what if they renege on the truce sir adam walked past him touching his arm briefly as he did so he could see huxleys body which had been moved to clear the gangway for the passage of messages he knew vincent was blaming himself and that was why his question was doubly important he said quietly then every gun no quarter midshipman david napier sat in the cutters sternsheets and tried not to listen to the regular creak of oars as they pulled away from the land he could not recall when he had last been able to sleep but he knew if he was offered the finest bed in the world right now it would still be denied him the journey from shore to ship was much less in distance than when they had set off to meet the governor but already it seemed very long tyacke was sitting beside him and the same stroke oarsman faced him eyes barely moving as he lay back on his loom for every stroke napier could see onwards masts and loosely furled sails directly ahead and the flag so vivid in the pale light it was dawn he glanced down at his hands clenched so tightly that the knuckles were white beneath the tanned skin this would pass it had to it was seeing the flag that brought it all back to him as if it had just happened stark and brutal he had hoisted the ensign on the flagmast where he had seen the dead mutineer when onward had made her appearance and engaged a small vessel which had proved to be the decoy he had climbed on to the roof of a low outbuilding to watch the frigate pass the main anchorage something had made him turn some sound or sense of warning even as he had turned there had been two shots so close they could have been a single blast he had lost his balance and fallen but not before he had seen the sprawled body of the governors servant a black youth around his own age he had tried to warn him but had been unable to shout because he had no tongue he had been killed by the ball intended for napier the second shot had cut down the attacker whose scarlet scarf spoke for itself the governor had been there almost immediately on his knees holding the boys hands in his calling him trusty napier shifted on the hard thwart and kept his eyes on the frigate he could see some of the damage now the scars and the gaps in the rigging men were already working aloft fresh canvas overlapping flapping in the offshore breeze he had heard the hammering and other sounds during the night his mind flooding with images of the faces he knew he had twisted his leg when he fell it had saved his life but he was already struggling to overcome it as he had before like the moment when he had been about to climb into the cutter and the gingerhaired corporal price still hatless had tried to assist him he had done enough but when adam had tried to make price climb aboard ahead of napier he had declined you know what they say about us royals sir the first to land napier had finished it for him and the last to leave somehow they had both managed to laugh tyacke was shading his eyes and looking toward the ship although there was no fierce sunlight at this hour he said when we get back to freetown ill soon have her looking as smart as paint again napier watched the masts rising above them faces on the gangway and peering down from the yards as the cutter came alongside he recognised most of them even at a distance but he did not see the one he expected and somehow he must have known tyacke was patting his pockets ill be sending onward home after this not before time david napier straightened his hat and watched the oars being tossed sideboys already waiting to receive the cutter alongside the captain was at the entry port his hand raised napier stood up carefully and waited for the flag captain to leave the boat ahead of him going home now it had a new and precious meaning epilogue it was around noon when hm schooner druid entered falmouth and finally moored alongside after her short passage from plymouth a few hours but to adam bolitho it had seemed endless he had hoped to hire a carriage if only to lessen the formality after leaving onward in the dockyard as he had on his previous return but he had been warned that the roads might be treacherous even impassable as there was snow in the west country snow after the long haul from freetown it seemed unbelievable the schooners master had told him more than once that his command one of the fleets hardworked couriers covered more seamiles per year than any proud ship of the line especially he added these days adam dismissed it stepping ashore the frozen ground seemed to move beneath his feet and every impression seemed blurred and dreamlike at least in a vehicle he could have slept or would he so many memories freetown but before that the sea burials voices faces he had come to know and they him the bill as vincent termed it twelve killed most by musket fire two more had died later despite murrays unfailing attention most of the other casualties should recover but they would not soon forget that brief ferocity or their escape from their intended fate small stark images had stayed with him even aboard the little druid with her talkative master and her own sounds and busy routine in freetown when some extra hands had come aboard to help remove or replace damaged rigging and had been gazing around at the damage he had heard monteith exclaim we showed them midshipman hotham had turned his back in contempt or disgust at any other time monteith would have reacted very differently but he had hurried below without a word and onward was once again in the hands of the dockyard there had been no serious damage to her hull and most of the standing and running rigging had been put to rights at freetown he stood breathing the cold air his mind lingering on the one moment above all that he would never forget neither would captain james tyacke the flag lieutenant had hardly been able to contain his excitement and delight when he had announced to both of them that rearadmiral langley had sailed for england having been suddenly recalled adam remembered ballantynes terse summingup at their first meeting promotion or oblivion tyackes expression had become one of utter disbelief when the lieutenant had pointed to the rearadmirals flag it was now tyackes own adam halted and looked back along the jetty the schooners crew were already taking on stores and perhaps new passengers napier was looking eagerly toward the town but caught his eye and gave him a smile recovering still recalling the last moments the handshakes embarrassed grins or blunt relief at being alive each time it was always different for the survivors he turned back and saw her standing near the carriage he had known would be here she was wearing a fulllength cloak her head covered by a fleecy hood which fell back as she ran toward him young matthew turned away to calm the horses and was able to yawn hugely without showing it they had been waiting here since dawn or so it felt and his feet were frozen but this made it all worthwhile adam held her tightly but felt her flinch as something shrieked from the harbour had he turned he would have seen clouds of vapour rising like smoke from one of the new and experimental paddlesteamers lowenna pressed her cold cheek against his and murmured a new navy adam he knew david napier was looking across the harbour his face alight with interest his not mine she said take us home and saw young matthew open the carriage door if ever but she stopped and said nothing more that was yesterday alexander kent is the pen name of british author douglas reeman reeman joined the
