marion lennox a royal proposition to david who took my heart to paris chapter one alastair i know you and belle are planning to marry but you must marry pennyrose first silence marguerite de castaliae looked as unruffled as if shed just talked of the weather but alastair and belle were staring at her as if shed dropped a bomb what are you saying it was alastair who first found his voice his serene highness alastair prince de castaliae dug his hands deep into the pockets of his faded jeans his dark eyes closed what now he didnt need his mother making crazy propositions not when he had so much else to think of if this inheritance didnt go through the village faced ruin after months of effort hed found no way to save it his own fortune couldnt save this place nothing could today hed reached a final joyless decision hed been up since dawn inspecting the cattle with stock agents working out how much theyd make at market hed come in to make a final bleak phone call to his accountants theyd given him their verdict and it was all looking futile the banks would never finance such a venture the estate would have to be sold so alastair was exhausted and he didnt need this marry someone else thats ridiculous its not ridiculous his mother was wearing her imabouttosolveallyourproblems smile my dear you do want to be a prince she was probing fishing for a reaction she found it no alastair turned to stare out the window over the castles lush gardens to the river beyond no he said again his voice was surer still and there was revulsion in his tone it was louis who was supposed to inherit all this not me but louis is dead dear marguerite reminded him and i wont even pretend im sorry because he would have made a very bad prince if hed inherited it was his right to inherit he drank that right away his mother retorted he was a wastrel and a fool and now hes dead so now the title is yours and the responsibilities i never wanted it but its yours for the taking marguerites gaze shifted from her son to her future daughterinlaw and her probing eyes were thoughtful if you want it badly enough she said gently and if belle wants it her voice became questioning again id imagine belle would rather like to own this castle and be your princess belle doesnt care about titles alastair said shortly just as i dont marguerite wasnt as sure of that as her son was but she kept her face deliberately expressionless this tiny castaliae principality tucked between france and the rest of europe might be a very small player on the world stage but it was a lovely place to liveand maybe a wonderful place to rule wealth and position might very well appeal to belle she thought but shed have to use other ways to persuade her son alastair the people here need you she told him the country is depending on you weve been over this yes dear but youre not listening if you dont inherit theres no one else to take it on these were hard facts to be faced and the sooner her son faced them the better if you dont accept it the estate will be carved up and the title will disappear she told him most of the people whove lived here all their lives will face losing their own homes then the village houses will be bought by holidaymakers wholl only live here for three or four weekends a year no said alastair outraged of course not none of us want that she was getting through all she could see of her son was his strongly muscled back but it was expressive enough alastair had been brought up to accept responsibility marguerite had every hope that hed accept it now despite belle or even with belles assistance alastair was a good son she thought fondly a son to be proud of until his recent involvement with belle alastair de castaliae had been considered to be one of europes most eligible bachelors well why not of royal blood and with an inherited fortune hed been attractive even as a child time had added to his good looks until at thirtytwo his motherand a fair percentage of the principalitys female populationconsidered him perfectly splendid the tragedy in his background did nothing to lessen his appeal in fact the distance hed placed between himself and the rest of the world since lissas death had seemed only to make him more desirable and he was desirable his mother decided trying to look at him without bias alastair was six feet two in his socksand his muscled taut and tanned frame made him seem even taller he was smoulderingly dark his jet black hair his crinkling brown eyes and his wide white smile had made many a girls heart melt just as his fathers smile had melted her own heart all those years ago sternly marguerite blinked back unexpected tears and returned to the job at hand emotion wasnt any use here it wouldnt convince alastairhed held himself emotionally distant after lissa diedand she was almost convinced that belle didnt have any emotion to play with its only for a year whats only for a year alastair turned back to face his mother his brow drawn heavily over his deepset eyes you sound as if you have this whole thing arranged well i do she said apologetically someone has to think of the future youve been so involved getting the estate back into working ordermaking sure all the workers are paid organising the rebuilding of the stonework doing all the work caused by two such sudden deathsthat you havent had time to look at the whole picture so if youll only listen im listening it was the best she could hope for but he was still glowering and all she could do was explain our problems are all caused by louiss father changing the inheritance she told him louiss dissolute ways were giving him nightmares so he put in the clause i know this of course he knew after all louis had bleated to him of it often enough and the clause was the nub of his problems now alastairs brow descended even further it decreed that louis marry a woman of unimpeachable virtue or he couldnt inherit yes marguerite tried very hard not to look at belle what she was about to say now wouldnt be easy alastair already understood about the clausebut did belle your uncle couldnt predict that louis would end up in the grave three months after his own death and now its left us in a mess because the clause applies to anyone inheriting the titlewhich includes you silence then contrary to what the lawyers are saying alastair said softly in a voice that sounded almost dangerous belle is a woman of unimpeachable virtue no dear shes not marguerite refused to be silenced there was no easy way to say this but both belle and alastair had to face it shed been saving it for when alastair saw how bleak his position was and that time was now you know it or you wouldnt be spending all this time with the accountants she went on the lawyers are all of the same opinion your cousins are prepared to take legal action to see that the estates sold and divided and if you marry belle thats exactly what will happen just because belles been married before and also because shes had affairs ever since she was a teenager marguerite did look at belle now and her tone softened im sorry my dear she told her but its time for plain speaking go right ahead belle told her alastairs companion sat with her hands loosely clasped on her elegantly crossed knees she was wearing a chic black dress her silkstockinged legs looked as if they went on for ever and her expression rather than seeming offended seemed coolly calculating she tilted her head causing her sleek bob of auburn hair to glint in the sunlight it made a striking impression and she knew it so im not a woman of unimpeachable virtue fine dont mind me i do mind you dear marguerite said apologetically but the cousins have been digging up dirt i gather you had an affair with a married man when his wife was pregnant belles beautiful face shuttered down at that that was ten years ago its hardly relevant the lawyers say it is and it means that if alastair marries you he cant inherit which is damnable alastair snapped and his mother nodded in agreement but her face didnt look hopeless yes dear it is damnable but its also avoidable im marrying belle but if you waited for a little no just a moment belle rose stretched catlike and crossed to where alastair was standing and as she did his mother had to acknowledge why her son had been attracted to her falling in love had never been an issue for alastair not after lissa however hed rarely been without a beautiful companion and belle was certainly beautiful she was magnificently groomed and chic and incredibly feminine she spoke three languages which in this tiny border principality was a huge advantage and her social skills were polished to perfection even in alastairs present occupation as a paris architect shed be a hostess to be proud of belle was sleek and feline and clever and shed spent a lot of effort persuading alastair that marriage could suit them both for maybe the hundredth time marguerite wondered how she could get on with such a daughterinlaw but belle wasnt thinking of marriage nowat least not her own not yet she laid one beautifully manicured finger on alastairs arm and turned to face marguerite her intelligence focussed tell us your plan she said softly and with a stab of triumph marguerite realised just how hungry for the title this woman was shed thought that she would be married to alastair while he worked as a paris architect belle would have had wealth and position but here was the chance of more with the death of louiswith the chance of inheriting this magnificent estatecame the title of prince and princess and money to keep them in unimaginable luxury for the rest of their lives it was a windfall belle would reach out and grasp with both hands if she could but the old mans will stood between them a woman of unimpeachable virtue tell us your plan belle said again and it was as much as marguerite could do not to sigh with relief she sat back and closed her eyes for one millisecondto give her enough space to gather her thoughts then she started pennyrose she said whos pennyrose alastair demanded the woman you need to marry for a year pennyrose oshea settled the final stone into the dirt with a satisfied slap great finished it had taken her all morning to choose the slabs that would be the foundation of her wall it was immensely satisfying work and pennyrose was satisfied she was also extremely hot midday had arrived without her realising she put up a hand to wipe sweat from her face and felt ingrained dirt smudge thickly across her cheek urk a beauty queen she wasnt never mind it was good honest dirt she thought happily she was doing what she wanted to do and by evening shed be even dirtier also shed have the next layer of stones complete building walls designed to last a thousand years might not be everyones cup of tea but it was hers and she loved it pennyrose she looked up to find her boss waving to her from the other end of the wall was he reminding her of lunch that was strange bert didnt usually remind his workers it was time to knock off but she rose gratefully to her feet but he wasnt reminding her of lunch youre wanted he told her thumbing toward the castle by them indoors what you heard what i said berts weatherworn face creased even further with a puzzlement that matched hers someone came out just now and said could we send you inside pronto theres no mistake they want me to go inside pennyrose stared at her boss in disbelief and then stared down at herself she was wearing begrimed overalls her shoulderlength chestnut curls were twisted into a knot under her filthy cap and every inch of her was covered with dust she grimaced why they sent a message saying they want to see you and thats all i know her boss said patiently youre kidding she glanced up at the forbidding ancestral home where those whod issued the summons were hidden they can see me by looking out their windows she told her boss and she grinned that way i wont besmirch their ancestral floors dont be clever lass bert normally the kindest of bosses was perturbed and it showed i dont know what they want and i cant say i like it do you want me to come in with you yeah take him with you pennyrose one of the lads called the whole stonewalling team was fascinated at this unexpected twist of events and the cheekiest of the men came to his own conclusion maybe the new prince has decided to increase his harem or maybe that other onewhats her name belle maybe she thinks our pennyrose is prettier and shes decided to tear her eyes out another added and his comment was greeted by hoots of laughter the entire team was in on the conversation now they were all male mostly a lot older than pennyrose and concern for their protégée was behind their goodnatured banter how would they know our pennyrose is prettier we only see her for five minutes every morning before the dust settles back one demanded she is pretty though the first lad said stubbornly real pretty if the prince saw her without her dirt well he hasnt his mother has not without her dirt and anyway whats that got to do with the price of eggs no lass bert cut across the banter and his eyes were still troubled seriously theyve asked to see you you spoke to the old lady didnt you you didnt say anything to upset her no pennyrose wiped filthy hands on her overalls thinking fast at least i dont think so pennyrose had arrived at the castle with the team of yorkshire stonewallers six weeks ago and shed had her hands full ever since there was so much to be done after years of neglect the west farmyard walls had almost entirely collapsed and if they werent mended soon the north and south walls would do the same so she hadnt had time for socialising the only contact shed had with the titled landholders had been a conversation with the castles elderly mistress marguerite had been out walking and had come across a stooped figure sorting stones good heavens its a girl the woman had said startled and pennyrose had chuckled shed deferentially hauled off her cap letting her curls tumble to her shoulders yes maam youre part of the stonewalling team the woman had demanded her amazement deepening and rose had smiled and once more agreed thats right but the teams from yorkshire and im not from yorkshire now how did i guess that where are you from australia australia the womans eyes had still been creased in astonishment why on earth are you here im working with the best stonewallers in the world pennyrose had told her not without pride im gaining my masterwallers certificate and when im finished training i can go home and demand my price then pennyrose had looked up at the castle where the soft gold sandstone turrets and battlements shone in all their glory as theyd shone for almost a thousand years her green eyes had twinkled in appreciation of the beauty around her its great work shed said softly it almost makes up for having to work in the shadow of rickety old shanties like this the woman laughed seeming genuinely amused she stayed for some time seemingly intrigued by pennyroses work her questions were gently probing but maybe it was her right to probe the background of workers on her sons estate pennyrose thought no more of it and when the woman left she felt as if shed made a new friend but now had she taken her joking seriously was she about to send a message through pennyrose that the team was no longer required help do you want me to come in with you bert asked again her worry mirrored in his eyes this was an important job and both of them knew there was a lot at stake not that i think you have any need to worry but i cant think of any reason theyd want you theyre hardly likely to toss me into the oubliette for insubordination have you been insubordinate only a little bit she confessed with a rueful smile not very much he groaned well dont be now get in there and grovel and only say nice things about your boss thats me remember pennyrose had never been reluctant to give a bit of cheek and bert shook his head at her know your place girl and short of letting the prince have his wicked way with you agree to anything i can always back out later he meant he could always dismiss her she thought her laughter fading if it was a choice of pennyrose or the team it had to be the team maybe she had been too cheeky was the aristocracy so sensitive heavens why didnt she learn to keep her mouth shut still if damage had been done it was she whod have to undo it if im not back in a week demand entry to the dungeons she said more lightly than she felt she looked down at her grimy self and thought of what she was facing you really mean go right now i mean go right now bert said heavily thats what the aristocracy wants so thats what the aristocracy gets they were waiting pennyrose walked up through the terraced gardens toward the main castle entrance and found the head gardener waiting they walked into the courtyard where a butler was waiting in turn he gave her a wintry smile turned and led her into the house and what a house the castle had been built in the twelfth century and maintained by fastidious owners ever since castaliae was one of the few countries in the world where the royal family had never deviated from direct succession it had led to a certain simplicitythe family were the de castaliaes the estate was castaliae and so was the country it was confusing maybe but it certainly must make ordering letterheads easier pennyrose had decided when shed first learned about the place and now looking around the ancestral home of the countrys rulers she saw other advantages of continuous succession the halls were filled with exquisite furniture gathered over a thousand years the walls were hung with fabulous tapestries and the whole place was filled with light and colour from a building designed far in advance of its time every south face had been used to effectno one here had worried about window taxesand sunlight streamed in everywhere the castaliae family had been known to sit on the fence for all the castles history pennyrose knew the independence of this tiny principality was a tribute to the political savvy of its royal family pennyrose glanced about her with awe as she was led from room to room for a twentysixyearold australian this was new and wonderful indeed she almost forgot to be nervous almost she remembered again the moment she entered the great hall they were waiting for her she knew them by sight marguerite of course the new princes elderly mother she was the woman whod spoken to her in the garden and her smile was warm and welcoming then there was belle although it wasnt official rumour had it that she was engaged to be married to the prince she was a cold fish the boys had decided but it didnt stop them admiring her good points she might be a cold fish but she was a very beautiful cold fish belle didnt move from her seat now and she certainly didnt smile and of course there was alastair alastair de castaliae his serene highness they said if he could figure out the inheritance hiccups and why shouldnt he be the prince she thought he certainly had the look of it he might be dressed for farmwork now in an ancient pair of moleskins and a shirt that was grubby and frayed at the cuffs but he was still dropdead gorgeous with a smile to die for mmm he was smiling nowsort ofas he rose to greet her it was a smile that stilled her nerves and caught her attention as nothing else could what a smile and what a well what a man pennyrose had never had time to play round with the opposite sex but a lack of time had never stopped her appreciating what was in front of her and this one was worth appreciating he was tall lean and hardmuscled with long long legs and and she wasnt a schoolgirl she reminded herself sharply she was twentysix years old and she had too many responsibilities to be distracted by any man much less royalty so with an effort she pulled her attention away from thoughts which were totally out of place what on earth did they want the prince gorgeous as he was was looking at her like he wasnt seeing her belle was watching her with a calculating expression pennyrose didnt like it was only marguerite who was smiling as if she meant it pennyrose how lovely will you sit down sit good grief she looked at the plush cream settee and fought a desire to giggle umim afraid id leave a signature she said and received a swift appraising look from alastair for her pains if its all right with you maam im just as happy standing if youd just tell me what you want ill be off before i spread dirt everywhere but we need to get to know you alastair said in a voice that sounded as if he didnt believe what he was saying pennyrose shook her head shed hauled off her cap before shed come inside so her curls bounced around her shoulders and dust floated free you dont need to get to know me and im not dressed for socialising ok she was being blunt but she was at a disadvantage and she didnt like it belle was looking at her like she was some sort of interesting insect and kowtowing to those higher up the aristocratic ladder had never come naturally to pennyrose just for a minute alastairs voice was strained to breaking point and she cast him an unsure glance what was wrong with the man my boss can tell you about me she said discouragingly or are you intending to get to know the whole team better that made an interesting plan but it didnt make her smile she felt more and more like an insect brought in as part of a collection and she didnt like the feeling one bit no but marguerite started lets just tell her what we want alastair said heavily dont confuse her any further his eyes hadnt left pennyroses face and they didnt leave it now he seemed nice pennyrose thought inconsequentially he also seemed exhausted strained to the limit but still very very nice his voice was deep and grave and soft and he sounded as if he was concerned for her his english was excellentwell it would be as his mother was english it was only his words that were troubled ill come to the point he told her speaking slowly as if measuring each word what my mother wishes to knowwhat we all wish to knowis whether or not you can be persuaded to marry me for a long long moment nothing stirred she stared at them in turn taking in each of their faces all of them lookedfor heavens sake they looked as if they were serious you have to be joking she said at last and it was as much as she could do to find her voice her words came out a sort of highpitched squeak she coughed and tried again i meanyou are joking right im not joking the look of strain on his face intensified would i joke about something so serious yeah right her eyes narrowed did you say marry i said marry then youre either having a laugh at my expense or youre all about in the head she said bluntly either way i dont think i should stay she gave them a last wild look iill see myself out shall i she didnt wait for an answer she took herself out of the door and out of the castle without a backward glance chapter two the prince found pennyrose an hour later when shed been persuaded against her better judgement to go back to work she was sorting stones and alastair came up behind her so suddenly that she missed a couple of heartbeats as before his voice was deep and soft and calmas if nothing lay between them at all why do they call you pennyrose why not just penelope or penny or even rose as a question it was harmless enough but the situation was ludicrous she caught her breath regretted her missed heartbeatswhile this man was around she needed all the heartbeats she could getsat back on her heels and glared the fact that his shirt was open at the throat and the sun was shining on the wispy curls on his chest didnt help at all good grief cut it out she told herself put your hormones on the back burner bert says im not to fraternise with the upper classes any more she said frankly youve had your joke if you want something else ask bert go away already she could see her boss rising from where hed been working hed been disbelieving when shed told him what had happened and then hed been furious its their idea of a sick joke hed said its too bad were not back in england where i can have a word with the union but they werent back in england they were in this tiny principality where normal rules didnt apply and if bert wanted to keep his team employed he had to bite his tongue and tell her to get on with stonewalling as if nothing had happened theyre paying excellent rates lass hed told her the best and weve gone to a lot of expense to get over here we put up with it if we can for the good of the team but youre not to go near them again just keep working and forget it so shed agreed it had been a big thing for bert to take on a female apprentice and she wanted to make it as troublefree for him as possible but now this creep wouldnt leave her alone go away she said again and turned back to her stones she concentrated fiercely on fitting a neat wedge between two blocks and refused to look at him thankfully she heard berts heavy footsteps and then her bosss yorkshire accent id be grateful if you could speak through me if you have anything to say to the workers sir berts words were deferential enough but his tone was pure bulldog she risked a glance up and to her surprise she saw alastair raking his fingers through his ruffled black hair it was a gesture that made him seem almost as bewildered as she was and it was gesture that suddenly made him seem much less of a princeand much more human and much morehormoneconfusing get back to work she told herself fiercely turning back to her illfitting stone forget your stupid hormones and dont look again i need to speak to penny pennyrose isnt speaking to you shes heard what you have to say and it doesnt make sense so leave the lass be im not offering her any indecent proposals if you were id take my team and walk off your land right now bert told him money or no money pennyrose is a good lass and a damned fine worker and i wont have her badgered wow under her cap she felt her ears go pink with pleasure praise from bert was hard to earn and valued for what it was shed worked hard to get this far and for bert to offer to withdraw his team on her behalf goodness but alastair was still trying to speak i dont look what is it you want bert said exasperated youve upset the lass youve upset me if you have anything reasonable to say then say it now in front of pennyrose clear the air like and then we can say no and get on with our work i hope you wont say no bert was getting angrier by the minute well what is it as i said i want to marry pennyrose alastair told him putting his hands up as if to deflect the storm of protest he knew bert was capable of i want to marry her for a year as a business proposition nothing more the silence went on for several moments pennyrose stayed crouched by her stones she wouldnt look up but her fingers had ceased even trying to fit her rocks together this was crazy she left the answering to bert because she couldnt think of a thing to say even the normally voluble bert was having trouble where im from bert said at last in a voice that sounded as if hed been winded people dont take brides as business propositions they take brides for life his belligerent jaw jutted forward and just the one of them at that the locals say youre engaged to some woman up in the house well then you hang onto her and leave our pennyrose alone bigamy is something i dont hold with and never shall and if you so much as come near our lass this isnt bigamy look i dont know what your rules are i imagine my rules are exactly the same as yours alastair said wearily and once again his fingers raked his hair he looked like he was finding this impossible im not intending to marry twice ornot at once this was getting crazier and crazier what we want here bert said conversationally and speaking to the world in general is a straitjacket anyone got one amazingly it was pennyrose who came to the princes defence that last gesture of his had got to her for some reason this didnt seem like someone making indecent propositions this seemed like a man at the end of his tether give him a break bert she rose and shrugged off some dirt then she stood back so there was distanceand bertbetween them but her eyes met alastairs and held and her chin tilted this was the look she used when she was meeting trouble head on and she had a feeling she was meeting it now this mans trouble let him say what he wants she told her boss he isnt making sense but we might as well listen the silence stretched out under the afternoon sun and in the stillness pennyrose was aware that alastairs gaze never left hers their eyes were locked and it was as if there were questions being askedand answeredwithout words being spoken and whatever the questions were her answers must have satisfied him because he gave a slight nod as if hed come to a final decision some of the confusion left his face it could work what could work bert asked belligerently and pennyrose laid a hand on her bosss arm let him say and he did im serious he said at last his eyes still fixed on hers i dont have a choice if i dont marry a lady of unimpeachable virtue this entire estate will be split i dont understand bert told him its the terms of the old princes will alastair said wearily if i dont make such a marriage then the estate will be sold and no matter how i look at it theres no way i can buy it god knows ive tried every way over the past couple of months but the things impossible id assume the castle itself will go to the government and be opened to the public as a tourist venue but the acreage around here will be split up bert frowned but he wasnt too surprised hed heard the rumours and the village thats the hard part alastair told him its the reason im considering such a marriage there are over a hundred families living around the estate all of those homes will have to be sold and the cousins who stand to inherit stipulate that theyll be sold on the open market he paused and gazed around him over the river banks to the village beyond i guess youve realised by now how desirable this place is it was the castaliae estate contained a fairytale village built on the cliffs of one of the most picturesque rivers in the world but it still wasnt making sense bert was still confused so bert demanded so theyll be sold for a fortune alastair said simply we know that its already happened to villages like ours that havent been protected by one landlord the locals are well enough off but theyre not so wealthy that they can match the prices of city dwellers and overseas interests he sighed his gaze returning from the faroff village to the girl before him now he was talking directly to her if i cant save it the village will be deserted in winter and filled with wealthy tourists and designer shops in the summer the locals will have to move away they cant bear it and i cant bear it so im asking you pennyrose to marry me if youll have me more silence pennyroses gaze didnt waver she took him in not just his amazing good looks but the grubbiness of his clotheshe wasnt nearly as dirty as she was but he obviously hadnt had time to change since hed been out working with his farm manager this morningthe tension of his stance and the dark shadows under his eyes he looked like a man close to breaking point then finally she allowed herself to look around at the land he was talking of this estate went on for ever the castle itself was built into the cliff overlooking the river and at the base of the cliff was a tiny village pennyrose was boarding with a family there and they thought of this man as their landlord but this was indeed a fairytale village with its soft sandstone buildings set into the cliffs on the gently flowing river alastair was right tourists would outbid any villagers for their homes and if he couldnt bear to have the villagers evicted she could understand why not its a stupid clause she said at last and alastair nodded it is my uncle put it in place because my cousin waswild what it did was to stop louis marrying at all and then louis died just three months after his father so why dont you just do what louis did not marry it seemed a reasonable solution surely the gorgeous belle could be talked into being a mistress onlywith so much money at stake i cant inherit unless i marry but louis inherited alastair shook his head and the impression of weariness intensified louis never formally inherited and the cousins started legal action to recover the property his death forestalled that and legal opinion is that the estate and the title is now mineas long as i do marry as long as i do what louis didnt andyour belles not a lady of virtue bert butted in he had things in his stride herealmost his fierce intelligence was working overtime no belles a wonderful woman alastair said quickly but there areshadowsin her past id imagine there might be berts team had little time for a woman theyd decided from the first was prone to giving herself airs on the first few days of working here thered been a wall collapse on one of the men belle had been seen at the window watching but hadnt enquired as to the state of steves health or even sent down to ask whether she should contact an ambulance with bert carrying a cellphone her disinterest had been a minor enough offence and hadnt mattered but it had rankled what bert said slowly his eyes moving from pennyrose to alastair and back again what makes you think our lass here is any different virtuewise that is hey pennyrose said shocked into comment can we leave my virtue out of it well thats it we cant alastair said heavily my mother i might have known shed come into it somewhere bert seemed to be almost enjoying himself now he had the solid workmans view of the aristocracy and he didnt mind this mans discomfort now theres a lady of virtue marguerite when shed heard of the same accident a day later had been horrified and had sent every possible comfort to steve settled into the local hospital with a broken foot steve had appreciated the attention very much indeed and so had his mates on his behalf my mothers a lady who thinks ahead alastair told them while ive been seeing to the everyday running of the estate and trying to figure out financial ways of saving it shes been figuring out the only logical way which is marrying pennyrose for a year but like i said its a business proposition alastair spread his hands i know this sounds intrusive but my mother had pennyroses background checked shes employed investigators and theres now little she doesnt know in every respect this is the sort of woman i need he paused and then said in a softer tone avoiding pennyroses eye my mother also says she badly needs money it had stopped being even remotely amusing pennyroses colour mounted to a fiery crimson and she took a step back investigators my circumstances are none of your business she snapped how dare you but bert was looking back and forth at the pair of them it seems to me the conversations getting private he said it seems to me the conversation is over she flung back and bert nodded yeah ok but the mans right youre strapped for cash girl and you know it it was bert who organised a huge percentage of her wages to be sent back to australia she kept so little for herself that hed been horrified maybe its like the man saysyou need to listen to his proposition berts sunburned face creased in resigned amusement now what i suggest is what you suggested first and send for a straitjacket she said through gritted teeth but bert shook his head no the mans got a problem and its a real one im seeing it now i dont say his solution will work but you could do worse than to listen to what hes proposing he glanced at his watch so its two oclock we knock off at four when we do you go down to the village pennyrose get yourself washed and into something decent and you he turned and poked a finger into alastairs chest you take her out to dinner properly pick her up at her lodgings at six and do the thing in style i dont need alastair started but bert was on a roll you ask a lady to marry you you do it properly i dont want pennyrose tried but the stubby finger was pointed at her in turn give the man a chance you can always refuse and thatll be the end of it you made me listen to him now you do the same if he badgers you after tonight hell answer to me bert no argument bert said hed wavered but now his decision was made it was time to get on with what he was here forstonewalling everything else was a nuisance thats my final word he turned back to alastair now you get back to your castle where you belong and you girl get back to sorting your stones theres to be no more talk of marriage before tonight bert i cant go out with this man you can bert said heavily and the amusement was suddenly gone from his voice this is the man whos paying us girl and hes in trouble you made me listen to him well i have you can put the good of the team before everything for the moment and give him a fair hearing thats all i ask and thats all i ask alastair said his calm brown eyes resting on her face in a message of reassurance which was all very well she thought wildly as she sent him a savage glance reassure all you like marriage the man was seriously nuts six oclock then he said youre staying with the berics ill collect you there how do you know where im staying i know all about you then you know what im about to say to your crazy proposition she flung at him no and no and no just listen ill listen and then ill say no chapter three the man who called for pennyrose four hours later was the same manbut only just madame beric opened the front door quivering in excitement pennyrose didnt blame her she was waiting in the kitchen trying not to quiver herself and when alastair was ushered in she failed she definitely quivered whew this was cinderella stuff and where was her fairy godmother when she was needed shed put on her only dress that was halfway decenta white sundress with tiny shoulder straps that was more useful for a day off than for a dinner date shed washed and brushed her curls until they shone but that was as much as shed done there wasnt anything else to do she wore no adornment how could she she didnt have any adornment or any cosmetics in fact her entire outfit was worth peanuts alastair on the other hand was wearing a formal suit that must have cost a mint it was deep black italian made and fitted perfectly the black was lightened by the brilliance of his crisp white shirt and the slash of a crimson silk tie his normally ruffled black curls had been groomed into submission there was a faint aroma of very expensive aftershave about him and he looked every inch a man of the world unlike pennyrose who had the look of a woman whod appreciate diving into a small dark cupboard there wasnt a small dark cupboard available and alastairs dark eyes were twinkling in amusement good grief she could see why belle wanted him in fact she could see why any woman would want him you look beautiful he told her his wide smile taking in her discomfort and reacting with sympathy if she could have known it he was also reacting with truth she did look lovely alastair acknowledged as he took in her simple appearance money made little difference when it came to pure beauty her glossy chestnut curls tumbled about her shoulders her face glowed with health and humour her green eyes were edged with tiny crinkling laughter lines and her diminutive figure was well suited by the simplicity of her dress she was five feet four and beautiful whatever she was wearing but pennyrose couldnt tell what he was thinking and the thoughts that were whirling around in her head were very different she was about as far from his beautiful belle as any woman was likely to be she thought bitterly she wore little makeup her nose had the temerity to sport freckles and as for her hands belles hands would be flawlessof course theyd be groomed for wearing fabulous jewellery and doing little else pennyroses hands had been put to hard physical work from the time she could first remember and it showed alastair reached out for her hand in greeting and she felt him stiffen as he came into contact with the roughened skin he looked down involuntarily her hands were worn and calloused they were cinderella hands and no fairy godmother could have altered them in time for a date with a handsome prince she saw his face changetwistin a halfmocking smile it is true he said slowly inspecting her fingers in a way that made her attempt to haul her hands out of reach but he held on and kept inspecting what my mother said about you is right she was thoroughly flustered by his words and the feel of her hand in his i have no idea what your mother said she snapped hauling free her fingers but if its that i have no time for nonsense then yes its the truth so can we get this dinner over and be done with it you sound like you arent looking forward to it im not but in fact that was a lie there were few village families prepared to take in lodgers so pennyrose had had to be grateful for what shed been able to find madame beric was a kindly enough soul but she was a gifted watercolour artist with little time for anything else her cooking was therefore appalling pennyrose was now up to turnip soup version thirtyfour and burned turnip soup version thirtyfour at that where are we going she asked despite herself and alastairs face creased again into one of his blindingly attractive smiles lilies of course he said softly where else does a man take a woman when hes asking her to marry him its the best and tonight only the best will do it was a twentyminute journeytwenty minutes while pennyrose sat in stunned silence in the passenger seat of alastairs car a ferrari of course shed never been near such a car in her life alastairs shabby clothes of earlier had been token workmanlike apparel she thought resentfully no wonder her hands fascinated him he wouldnt know what it was to work hard with his hands everything about this man screamed money and now he wanted more and he was prepared to marry a stranger to get it maybe that was unfair she acknowledged maybe it was true that he was concerned about the villagers she glanced across at him as they pulled to a halt in the restaurant car park and found that he was twisting to survey her with the same intensity she was using on him their gazes met she flushed and turned away you dont approve of me do you he asked cautiously and she bit her lip im not here to make a judgement she said at last im here because my boss told me to be here and to eat a wonderful dinner there was that she had the grace to concede the point and her lips gave an involuntary twitch into a smile umok my mother says you know what it is to be hungry that comment killed her smiling urge she returned to glaring shoved the car door open and then stood and waited for him to get out and lock his damned expensive car i said the wrong thing he said ruefully as they turned toward the restaurant my stomach is my business she said with dignity i guess it is she said nothingjust concentrated on where they were going damn him he had her right off balance and she didnt know how to deal with it somehow she just had to get this over with concentrate on dinner luckily lilies was worth concentration the restaurant was built into the parapets of another mediaeval castle well why not this was fairytale country with castles here to spare but there were modern touches a lift swept them to the rooftop where the restaurant was situated among the battlements floortoceiling windows were now installed where archers had once stood to protect their fortressand pennyrose saw the view and gasped in delight shed been trying to disregard alastairs disturbing presence until now but the view made her almost forget him almost well almost a little bit focus on the view she told herself and what a view it was as if they were perched in an eagles nest high over the river below were river plains golden with buttercups and inhabited by placidly grazing cattle at every turn of the river were more ruins more castles and more more stone what are you thinking alastair asked watching her with bemused interest im thinking she said slowly and paused yes that theres a lifetime of work for me in this country she managed and his eyebrows shot to his hairline what on earth stonewalling she breathed look at it out thereall those stones all those crumbling walls just waiting for repair he shook his head i dont believe this what dont you believe that hed taken a woman out to dinnerand she was talking about stone umstone walls are just stone walls he managed and she gazed at him as if hed just uttered a profanity thats like saying every house is just a house and they say youre a wellrespected architect is that what you believe i no he was flummoxed this woman was like no woman hed ever dated well there you go then she smirked i rest my case he grinned they were being led to a discreet table tucked into a niche where all they had for company was the view ok he conceded but but i never thought id be wining and dining a woman whod look at rock and gasp she gave him a look of gentle mockery surely not you must be using the wrong rock have you tried diamonds he cast her an amused glanceshe certainly was differentbut then was distracted by the need to order champagne pennyrose didnt protest she could count the times shed tasted champagne on one finger she cast another long look out over the valley she gazed around her again at the opulent restaurant settingand she decided there and then that she wasnt about to let scruples get in the way of a very good dinner and alastair saw it youre intending to milk this for everything its worth he said dryly and she had the grace to blush umyes because because i shouldnt be here i have no intention of agreeing to any crazy marriage proposal but as you say ive been hungry she beamed abandoning herself to enjoyment and gave a small bounce on the beautifully padded chair wow this looks like a very nice place to eat he was fascinated shed bounced shed definitely bounced what she demanded seeing his expression what did i do wrong nothing i just said it looks a great place to eat he took a deep breath that miss oshea is an understatement can i interest you in some snails you can interest me in anything thats not turnip soup she said and received another startled look thats what the berics live on she explained she shook her head every night msieur beric sits down to turnip soup and every night he finishes it looks up and tells his wife it was delicious so she makes it the next night and if she doesnt he gets all disappointed she grinned so you see why i finally agreed to eat with you despite disapproving of me her smile widened despite that he paused but he had to ask why why what why do you disapprove of me because youre a prince and im a worker she said frankly cinderella was a fairy story it doesnt happen in real life it might oh yeah it was a gentle jeer even cinderellas prince didnt propose marriage just for a year alastair thought that through and disagreed her guy had his deadlines too he told her semiseriously like midnight seeing carriages turn to pumpkins just as the going gets romantic might put a man right off his stride id imagine it might she said faintly so cinderellas beloved had to work fast he paused again and then his smile died as i do if you want to be prince no alastair shook his head the champagne arrived there was a moments silence while the bubbles were poured and he waited until shed taken her first gorgeous sip he waited for her verdict and he got it yum she said and he smiled at her pleasure yum it was a word belle hadnt used in her life but he couldnt afford to be distracted by this strange cinderella his mother had found for him he had this one meal to persuade her and he already knew persuasion would take some doing i really dont want to be a prince he said and his eyes met hers over the glass will you believe that um she took another cautious sip and made her decision no he had to make her believe otherwise nothing would make sense fame he said slowly isnt all its cracked up to be this principality is small but as the eldestindeed onlymale of the royal family the spotlight is now on me theres a population of a tiny country waiting to see what i do he motioned out the window to the tiny holdings scattered along the river there are so many families whose lives depend on my choiceand your choice too dont you dare try to blackmail me she snapped suddenly angry and his expression softened no i wont but according to my mother our needs mesh she glared some more i dont understand a year as my wife would set you up for life i dont need to be set up you can barely afford to eat now he pointed out michael is still at secondary school and he wants to be an engineer how are you going to afford three of them at university she placed her champagne glass carefully down on the table all of a sudden the bubbles tasted like vinegar you really have pried my mother has on my behalf his calm gaze met hers and his hands reached out across the table and took hers she didnt pull back he looked down at those workworn hands and his mouth twisted into the mocking smile she was starting to know well you want a résumé of all my mother found out about you no i because i intend to give it to you he shook his head at her indignant protest released her hands and sat back assessing his eyes rested on hers like she was an enigma he was still trying to figure out your mother was an invalid he started watching her face she had multiple sclerosis she should never have had one child let alone four but your father was desperate for a son after three daughters she finally died giving birth to michael that was when you were ten i dont im saying this no matter how much you interrupt he continued so you may as well listen and make sure i have it right we wouldnt like to make any mistakes here of course not she said bitterly and alastair smiled very wise so what did you have a father whos a farmer and an expert stonewaller but who coped with his wifes illness by turning to the bottle he held his hand up as pennyrose made an involuntary protest and she subsided reluctantly and a mother who depended on her eldest daughter for everything and then your mother died his voice softened still further which left you at ten caring for heather six elizabeth four and michael who was newborn and a herd of dairy cows and a father who drank himself stupid every night leaving everything else to you i dont welfare nearly stepped in he went on the whole district was concerned my mothers investigators had no trouble finding people who remembered gossip about your family i gather you came within an inch of being put into care but for you i didnt but he was brooking no interruptions like cinderellas prince he was working to a deadline you worked your butt off he told her you came home from school every night and you milked you got up at dawn and did the same the neighbours knew and were horrified but you wouldnt have it any other way and when welfare tried to step in they were met by a little girl whose temper matched that of any adult leave us alone you said well survive and somehow you did until you could leave school at fifteen and work full time on the farm yes but but it wasnt much easier then was it pennyrose he said gently because your father drank any profits and you had your work cut out keeping bread on the table when your father got drunk one night and smashed his car into a tree things might have been easier if the younger children had left school but you wouldnt let them of course not theyre so clever she said desperately all of them heather wants so much to be a doctor like you elizabeth wants architecture she flashed him a wintry smile and somehow you already know that michael longs for engineering youre supporting two at university now and one at school how are you going to do more they have parttime jobs they help not enough its two more years until heather finishes and michaels major expenses havent started youre up to your ears in debt already i dont need to listen to this no but you should alastair said ruthlessly you cant do it youve come to europe because the pays better with a great exchange rate you can send more money home but theres an end to it you cant stretch your debts any further i must she said in a small voice and his hand came back across the table and caught hers you need a life too theyre great kids her green eyes sparked with anger weve talked it through as soon as michaels finished its my turn thats when i can start enjoying myself oh great in six years more how much more turnip soup pennyrose how long before theyre selfsupporting and you have your debts paid off i want them to have the best she said stubbornly they shouldnt suffer because my father because your father didnt face his responsibilities alastairs voice gentled you face yours though dont you and i do too thats what this is all about facing responsibilities thats why im asking you to marry me it could help us both i dont no dont say anything he smiled at her a smile that lit his face and took the heaviness away from her heart first lets eat a very good dinner and tell me tell you what she was thoroughly flustered you already know everything i dont know this what why do they call you pennyrose she didnt answer him until shed demolished the first course her snails were magnificent morsels of taste sensation shed never tasted anything so delicious in her life and in a way it was time out her whole attention had to be on conquering the tricky silver tongs and tiny forkand on not missing a drop of the gorgeous juice she finally finished and looked up to find alastair watching her the look on his face was strange as if he couldnt believe she was real oh what she said crossly have i made a faux pas on the contrary you managed beautifully he told her just a hint of a smile lingering in his voice in fact i dont think ive ever enjoyed watching someone eating snails more he left her to make of that what she liked and then pressed home his question for the third time before our next distraction comes foods not a distraction she retorted what a thing to say ok i was brought up wrong he admitted i could have had snails for breakfast if id wanted but i do want to know you know everything not this so pay more money to your private investigators my mother asked them he confessed but apart from knowing your full name is penelope rose oshea so thats why im called pennyrose no he shook his head itd explain penny or rose but i hate penny alastairs face was thoughtful watching hers i see you do why dont you call yourself penelope then im not much into that either would you like to explain my she caught herself no this was none of his business it was no ones business but then she looked at him again and he looked gravely back and she thought he does want to know for whatever reason hes really interested in me the thought was so novel she could hardly believe it talking about herself was something she never did but suddenly she couldnt resist telling him just once my father called me penelope she began he insisted i was called that after a greataunt so shed leave us money but she never did and my father hated the name because of it and i think she took a deep breath i think my father hated me thats a fair indictment of your father she shook her head maybe i dont blame him i was his conscience you see she told him from the time my mother died i badgered him all dad wanted was to drink himself into oblivion and i wouldnt let him how did you stop him she shrugged it was never easy id steal money from his wallet to feed the kids so when he went to the pub he didnt have enough a great little thiefthats me or id wake him up sometimes her voice faltered as she tried to continue when i was ill or when the milking got too much for me id sometimes be able to shame him into helping and i badgered him into teaching me to build stone fences he had to work a bit to get money to drink so hed take on a stonewalling job and there id be watching because it meant money id help all i could id have thought alastair said thoughtfully his eyes resting on hers that hed have been grateful he wasnt there was no question of that he called me penelope hed put on this dreadful voice and hed say to the kids penelope says we have to do this penelope says theres not enough to eat she broke off hed tell the kids it was my fault they were hungrybecause id taken his money sometimes it was as if i had another kid to look after but he was my father i couldnt stop him hating me the only way i could get through to him was to threaten to come into the pub and tell his drinking mates how much wed had to eat that week you didnt alastair said awed and she managed a smile you have no idea what you can do when youre desperate only thenafter the first time i threatened that he started calling me penny instead of penelope he said i was constantly grubbing for money so i might as well be named for it i hated that too so behind his back the kids started calling me pennyrose i see and its sort of stuck she told him and maybe it fits me penelope rose is on my passport and job application but when i got the job with bert they said i was such a twobit thing theyd call me pennyrose she smiled cos i surely wasnt a twobob rose there was silence as he took that on board the waiter came and cleared their plates but still alastair didnt speak i dont think youre a twobob rose either he said at last and he couldnt quite keep the emotion out of his voice he looked at her across the table and he couldnt believe what he was seeing all this his mother had told him her background but until now it had hardly seemed true i dont think youre a twobob rose either he repeated i refuse to call you penny or penelope i think youre a rose and a millionpound rose at that a princess rose you deserve it and marriage to me might just make sure that you get it from this time on his voice caught with sudden unexpected emotion from this time on youre rose rose dont you like it yeah but it doesnt sound like me she grinned it sounds too dignified you can live up to your name yeah right if you want to the main course arrived then giving them welcome time out pennyroseor just rosewas never going to be distracted from food like this not for all the princes in the world before her was roast duckling snow peas and crispy roast potatoes served with a jus that made her mouth water before she even saw it pennyrosecumrose forgot all about dignity and concentrated on what was important which was a novelty in itself to alastair he wasnt accustomed to taking a woman out to dinner and having all her attention focussed on the food he sat and watched bemused waiting for the moment when shed scraped her plate clean and then turned back to more mundane questions like marriage proposals she turned straight back to practicalities i can see you have a problem marrying belle she said at last popping a final snow pea into her mouth and savouring it with regret that it was the last but why did you choose me as an alternative id imagine there must be lots of nice virtuous girls in your principality um yes he seemed discomfited and she pressed home her point so why did you choose to investigate my background you were my mothers choice oh right and you always do what your mother tells you he grinned always why dont i believe you in this instance i think shes done very well but why me she pressed again he hesitated but decided he might as well be honest because youre australian she frowned at that youll have to explain at the end of our marriage he told her playing with the cutlery still lying on the table youll need to walk away i dont want television and newspapermen in your face for the rest of your life id imagine you dont want that either no she said startled this marriage will create publicity he paused you know ive been engaged to be married before i did know that she said a trace of sympathy entering her voice this man stood to inherit the rulership of this tiny country and you couldnt cross the border without hearing the gossip her name was lissa and she was killed in a car crash three years ago with my father id heard that as well her face softened still further im sorry he shrugged off her sympathy he didnt need it he just needed to make her see why it mattered then maybe youll understand why i dont want to get emotionally involved again hence belle she nodded wisely thinking of what the gossip columnists said about alastairs companion i can see that too he heard the gentle criticismthe same concern that came from his mother when she asked whether he was sure he was doing the right thingand it stung belle will make me a very good wife im sure she will his eyes narrowed but pennyroses face was cordiality itself apart from the virtue bit she added thats hard to be hit now for flings you had in your youth so she cocked her head youre not in love with belle im not in love with anyone no she was like a brightly inquisitive sparrow he thought impossible to take offence at but she was insistent she was still waiting no im not in love with anyone he repeated stiffly after lissa its impossible lissa was some lady we were second cousins and we grew up together he told her his voice softening we were the best of friends he received a probing look as pennyrose thought this through so youre thirtytwo now and you didnt get engaged until three years ago they say youd only just become engaged when she was killed and you and lissa were friends for years she paused and thought it through some more then after years of friendship passion suddenly overtook you so you decided to marry he frowned at that and fingered his wineglass sending shards of candlelight glistening through the burgundy aged almost thirty we realised how good friendship could be so you werent in love with lissa either his face darkened i loved lissa and from the way hed said it she was sure it was the truth but maybe he hadnt loved her as a man could love a woman oras shed always hoped a man could love a woman for heavens sake what would she know she thought suddenly maybe what she was thinking of was a romantic dream it was a dream shed always had at the back of her mind but still just a dream for all that she could hardly probe any further down that road but there was still something not quite right she sipped her wine and wrinkled her freckled nose and belle she pressed shes a friend too not like lissa was but alastair hesitated but this was a major commitment he was asking of this woman and it was important for him to be honest he knew that if she agreed she had to know exactly what she was letting herself in for belles an interior decoratora partner with my paris architectural firm she knows what i expect in a woman she entertains my clients magnificently and she doesnt interfere with my need for privacy your need for privacy thats a wonderful basis for a marriagei dont think her words were out before she could hide the revulsion in her voice and he heard it his brows snapped down in anger privacy and mutual support is all either belle or i need ii understand pennyrose did too and the thought made a shudder run down her spine he saw and his frown deepened even further youre cold how could i be cold it was the most beautiful spring evening but his concern was warming she thought nice so let me get this right she continued you want me to play the fairytale princess for a year then at the end of it to calmly apply for a divorce hitch up my socks and walk out of here leaving you to belle i wouldnt have put it quite like that but yes that sums it up and belle pennyrose toyed with her wineglass how does she feel about it if it were me she said carefully i wouldnt be happy about seeing my fiancé marry someone else first in fact she added honestly itd be pistols at dawn if anyone made the attempt he smiled at the image thats hardly sensible and belles sensible i told you she understands that the needs of the country have to come first i see or she saw enough to make her shiver again but she needed to concentrate on her own role not belles future one is this really going to be ok she asked will the lawyers be happy with a twelvemonth marriage the inheritance doesnt say how long i have to stay married legal opinion is that if the marriage doesnt last a year then annulment rather than divorce could be considered and it could risk the inheritance but if it lasts a year then you and belle can be safe as prince and princess and live happily ever after she nodded wiselybut there was something else niggling her something else that needed asking and there was no easy way to ask it umhow do you know im unimpeachably virtuous she demanded he looked across at her startled and then he grinned the investigators say youve never had a boyfriend according to my mother you havent had time gee thanks it does make things easier he told her and your maturity helps if i marry a woman whos not mature then i risk her falling falling for you theres not much chance of that happening he said bluntly not with the way i feel about marriage but falling for the trappings of the position what makes you think i wont youre a pragmatist he replied my mother says so and im starting to accept that shes right you do what you need to do to survive he grinned again besides youre australian if the worst comes to the worst after twelve months i can kick you out of the country but i dont think ill need to do that youll be wanting to get back to your sisters and brother and youll have your fee now they were getting down to business my fee she said faintly the thought suddenly seemed repugnant but according to alastair and his mother she was a pragmatist so shed just better school her features into interest and behave like one a virtuous pragmatist it sounded like something to take for constipation or she grinned maybe it sounded more like someone who played very boring music get a grip she told herself was it the champagne that was going to her head whatwhat exactly were you thinking of as a fee she asked unsteadily and he nodded as if hed expected the question he was certainly preparedand then some my accountant suggests an allowance of ten thousand english pounds per week over and above expenses for the entire time were married and a further one million pounds settlement at the time of the divorce shed raised her wineglass to her lips shed taken a sipbut the wine didnt go down she choked and choked again and finally alastair came around to thump her shoulders the feel of his hand on the bare skin of her back did nothing at all to help her composure by the time shed finished coughing she was bright pink and thoroughly flustered im sorry she gasped at last i thought you saida million pounds i did plus the rest thats ridiculous she was almost angry no im rich already i might not have enough to buy the estate at the values tourists would put on it but if i inherit ill have more money than i know what to do with my lawyers say that if im not generous i could face a lawsuit later i dont want that and my mother says you deserve this windfall and im starting to believe that shes right and she still couldnt take it in belle agrees to it belles the woman i want with me long term he said slowly after losing lissa i dont want anyone or anything making emotional demands belles a wonderful partner and she understands she understands what little you want of her pennyrose nodded though the thought of the marriage he was contemplating made her feel dreadful and she understands me she sees you as a necessary evil gee thanks say nothing of it he smiled his dangerous coaxing smile that had her halfinclined to agree just so she could see it once more he was still standing looking down at her and his very closeness was unnerving the whole situation was unnerving and there were things she didnt understand lots of things id imagine as a prince yours would be a very public wedding she said slowly yes itll need to be then how will your people take it she went on thinking it through as she spoke when i disappear after twelve months my people are pragmatists he said like yourself theres discontent now because the succession is at risk even though my engagement to belle hasnt been official the gossip columnists have voiced rumours and disapprove they know about the inheritance and they want the principality to continue our marriage will dispel that worry but she was no longer listening shed been caught by a word a very major word succession she almost choked again hey you dont want me to have a baby do you she demanded and alastair smiled drat how could she concentrate when he smiled like that but she must concentrate theres no stipulation about babies in the old princes will and now he was laughing at her no i think belle and i can manage that eventually that fits in the category of what an elegant hostess does pennyrose enquired politely and his smile faded theres no need to be impertinent her equilibrium almost restored she managed a chuckle as alastair finally sank down again into his chair im sorry but im always impertinent you should know that if you intend marrying me then you will marry me she put up a hand im thinking about it nothing more thats all i ask how long do i have to make up my mind until coffee he told her and her equilibrium disappeared all over again help if you dont agree i need to find someone else he said apologetically and pragmatic single women of unimpeachable virtue are a bit thin on the ground pennyrose was fighting for composure i guess you could always put an advertisement in the international press wantedprincess for a year i imagine youd be swamped by callers maybe i would be he smiled faintly but i cant do that why not this marriage he said slowly has to appear real to appease the cousins and the lawyers thats right but she thought this through bert and the team already know itd be a marriage of convenience he shrugged a marriage of convenience doesnt necessarily mean its not a real marriage royal marriages have been just that for thousands of years but advertising seems a bit over the top and i cant publicly stipulate a time frame im running a fine legal line you certainly are she glanced up at him and then away again he was starting to disconcert her he was speaking of business he was planning out his whole lifefirst with her and then belleas if he was planning a commercial venture the thought left her feeling almost ill what a waste she thought suddenly arranged marriages might be what was expected of royalty but with alastairs wonderful smile and his caring natureand his money and his castle he was some catch he was some prince that wasnt the way to think she told herself hastily alastair was planning this as a business proposition and so must she a million pounds she murmured forcing her thoughts sideways and letting herself dwell on what that could mean a million do you have any idea how tempting that sort of money is for a girl like me i can imagine alastair smiled at her across the table and she had to give herself the same businessonly lecture shed given herself thirty seconds ago it was either that or go take a cold shower but he didnt seem to notice maybe he had that effect on all women youd never have to work again he was saying his words startled her breaking through her fog of masculine awareness of alastair awareness not work pennyrose frowned i wouldnt know how to not work you could learn he said gently during your year as a princess oh right just swan around adjusting my tiara and polishing my throne i dont think so youd be a figurehead a figurehead who still has to get herself a master stonewaller certificate im not going home without it he stared at her you wont need to stonewall a million pounds will set you up for life she looked blankly at him as if he were speaking some foreign language but i like stonewalling you couldnt possibly stonewall as my wife if you stuck me in a castle on a velvet cushion id go into a decline she said and then she chuckled or id cause trouble i just know i would id be sticking my nose into all sorts of things that dont concern me you need to accept me as a stonewalling bride or not at all wordless he sat back and stared some more finally he reached across and lifted her fingers again gazing down at her callouses and scratches left from the days work you dont want to leave all this a stonewaller is what i am she said simply she took a deep breath trying to make him see alastair money would be very nicebecause of my sisters and my brotherbut at the end of the year ive no intention of becoming your pensioner for the rest of my life theres a lot of women whod jump at the chance im not a lot of women i can see that he laid her hand down on the table butif you dont agree to marry me theres many families here wholl lose their homes thats the only reason im listening we could make it work pennyrose hesitated youd want a fairytale wedding lace and chariots and archbishops and the whole catastrophe maybe not archbishops if were making vows we dont intend to keep id prefer not to do it in a church the church here is tiny so that can be our excuse but otherwise yes pretty much the whole catastrophe and he sounded suddenly as unsure as she felt they were hurtling into this together and in truth it scared them both she stared at him and she saw his uncertaintyand his need for some reason his hesitancy reassured her as did his decision not to use a church his scruples were the same as hers youd have to fly my sisters and brother over to watch she told him slowly and for the first time she sounded as if she was starting to think of this marriage as a serious possibility theyd never forgive me if i didnt include them and if they dont see it for themselves theyll never believe its real alastair didnt hesitate i can do that of course and she bit her lip stared at the table for a while and then raised her eyes to meet his there was something else she had to be sure of and this was major it really is business only you wouldnt come near me as a wife i mean her face turned pink umthered be separate bedrooms there are royal precedents for such arrangements he grinned relaxing a little the marriage suite in the castle is two bedrooms with a dressing room in between how very romantic and locked doors of course he said gravely because youre a lady of unimpeachable virtue im not infringing on belles domain her mind was working in overdrive this was going to be hard but it had to be said speaking of belle alastair shell have to go she hesitated trying to think of an alternative but there wasnt one with belle included in the arrangement the marriage idea was preposterous for the full twelve months of our marriage belle will need to stay away from the castle i cant play the part of your wife if you have a mistress in the same house id feel like belle was watching me daggers drawn for the whole year id hate it shed hate it so her troubled eyes managed a twinkle i need to put my wifely foot down alastair thought that through it was a reasonable request sort of belle would resent it he thought but on reflection pennyrose was right the whole sham marriage could well founder if she stayed finally he nodded agreed and i can keep on stonewalling with bert that wasnt as easy thatll raise eyebrows princesses dont stonewall this one does she told him or its no deal ill be your parttime princess and you can be my parttime prince but from eight to four its off with the tiara and on with the overalls you can lock the gates so theres nobody to see me do it apart from bert and the guys bert already knows what the deal is hell keep his mouth shut and the men think im eccentric anyway you cant keep stonewalling he said faintly looking again at her hands you cant want to i can and i do she leaned forward trying to make him understand alastair will you continue to be an architect as well as a prince that was different yes but but nothing ive spent years learning how to stonewall im good at what i do and it took years of negotiating before i got bert to employ me hes giving me the chance of being a master waller im not about to give that chance up now with the money youll earn you wont need to be a master waller like you wont need to be an architect but you wont stop but pennyrose shook her head refusing to be swayed but nothing theres no negotiating on this one i can use your money for the kids education and i cant tell you how much of a relief that will be but afterwards ill put what remains into a nice little pension plan for when my fingers get too feeble to wiggle copestones itll be some pension plan and very nice itll be too she chuckled and her green eyes met his and held you are serious about all this there was only one reply to that alastair had no choice i am serious butyou do have reservations and he had to be truthful again i do well so have i she told him but if the choice is for michael not to go to university and for your villagers to lose their homes i think we could give it a crack dont you there was a moments pause the thing hung in the air between thema weighty decision to be made one way or another right now because marriage of convenience or not they both knew this decision would change their lives for ever but he couldnt step back now not when so much was at stake i believe we can give it a crack he said at last and finally he allowed himself to relax he smiled after dessert of course can i interest you in pierres excellent raspberry soufflé you can indeed she said cordially and then lets plan how we intend to get married chapter four it was amazing how quickly once a decision had been made that plans were set in concrete before she could change her mind alastair told marguerite and belle and pennyrose was left to tell bert one wisecrack about romance and youre dead she told her boss its a marriage of convenience for a year but the worldand the teamhas to think its indefinite you know why im doing it and it was you who made me listen to the man so you can just shut up and support me or else bert did surprisingly he met her decision with wholehearted approval and proceeded to tell the menconfidentiallythat pennyrose was taking a step up in the world he didnt tell them about the time frame but he did tell them everything else the men sat in stunned silence while they took it in and then they wholeheartedly approved in the time theyd worked with her the team had become extraordinarily fond of their pennyrose and in their opinion her stroke of good fortune couldnt have happened to anyone nicer but they couldnt understand why she was still sorting rocks as if nothing had happened im not royal yet she retorted and even when im married ill still be me still pennyrose she thought not rose yet im better off out here out of the publicity she meant here in the secluded castle grounds working alongside her friends she was shielded from media hype she could concentrate on what she was good at and block out her increasing nervousness she could also block out her siblings reactions which was tricky because she couldnt tell them it was a business arrangement which would last only for a year they felt so indebted to her already if they knew she was doing this for them shed have a mass educational walkout which was the last thing she wanted so she told heather the bare facts and left her sister to fill in the gaps as best she could which heather did with relish thats just fantastic heather could hardly believe it oh pennyrose i always knew youd marry someone special a real live prince is he fabulous i guess you could call him fabulous she said cautiously and heather chuckled hed have to be if youve decided to marry him i know what you think of marriage she hesitated and pennyrose could hear her uncertainty down the line what does he call you penelope rose even though he knows youre called penelope yes youll be princess rose i guess so she took a deep breath he sayshe says he wont call me pennyrose because im worth much more she didnt add that the way he called her rose made her feel oddlike he was deliberately distancing himself from who she really was but heather loved it then he is special heather said soundly and pennyrose could imagine her sisters glee on the other end of the line is he very rich um yes specialler and specialler pennyrose grinned specialler is that good grammar always the big sister leave my grammar alone when do we get to meet him the weddings in six weeks alastair will send you plane tickets if you can come there was a squeal of delight from the other end of the phone really really oh a long sigh of pure pleasure try and keep us away can we be bridesmaids im not having bridesmaids princesses always have bridesmaids not this one but there was a slight pause it is going to be a royal weddingright there was only one answer to that yes fabulous another sigh then help we dont have anything to wear this had already been discussed alastairs sending you a cheque she told her sister soso you can get something wonderful to wear when she revealed how much the cheque would be for there was a moments silence is this guy for real yes does he have any brothers that brought another grin no he must be wonderful heather said at last when shed caught her breath itd take a special sort of prince to look at you in your disgusting work clothes and see the gorgeous pennyrose underneath she sighed once more youll be able to stop stonewalling if anyone asked you to marry him rose said carefully would you stop wanting to be a doctor that halted her sisters romanticism in its tracks um no then leave my career alone alastairs happy for you to stay a stonewaller its what i am there was a long thoughtful silence and then a sigh so deep it was almost a blessing oh pennyrose oh love im so happy for you im starting to cry there was nothing pennyrose could do to prevent her siblings reactions there was also nothing she could do to stop the media frenzy even though no formal announcement had been made their evening at lilies had been noticed stay at the castle from now on alastair told her and she had no choice photographers were camped out at the castle gates their night at lilies along with belles hasty departure had been noticed and put together with glee the media knew how urgently alastair needed a bride and pennyrose was obviously it and she didnt like the sensation at all the conversion of pennyrose to rose im beginning to feel like a poor little rich girl she said as she sat down to dinner with marguerite and alastair two days later reluctantly shed moved into the castle guest quarters at knockoff time she therefore bathed away her grime and presented herself at the dinner table as a normal guest a normal guest ha she didnt feel in the least normal shed never seen so much glass and silverware in her life and it took all her courage to stay dignified in front of the servants now as the butler moved away with the dinner plates she grimaced i cant go anywhere you couldnt afford to go anywhere before this anyway alastair smiled across the table at her his gentleness robbing his words of offence and at least we dont serve you turnip soup i know im not complaining her sense of humour reasserted itself but she wished he wouldnt smile like that it put her right off what she was thinking what was it oh right not complaining or at least not very much she added hauling herself back to the matter in hand i just need to remember not to take my wheelbarrow close to the boundary while im working and i dread longdistance lenses they havent placed you as one of the stonewalling team alastair told her heaven forbid that they do youre sure the team will stay silent and the berics id imagine your money will ensure that she said dryly talk about buying silence so youre right as long as i stay here im fine but alastair was thinking this through there is one problem youll need to take a trip to the city why you need clothes she bristled whats wrong with my clothes he hesitated and then he smiled again seeking to lessen offence your dress he motioned to her sundress i know im not supposed to notice but its the third night in a row that youve worn it her bristle turned into a glower so i like my dress he raised his eyebrows and you have a wardrobe of different eveningwear i dont need a stonewaller may not need but my intended bride does he told her friday is official announcement time and you should look great she looks great now marguerites warmth and approval were the one constant in this arrangement that was making pennyrose feel ok with what was happening and it came to the fore now the media will love her rose was photographed leaving lilies in that dress alastair said stubbornly she needs another marguerite was like a defensive mother hen im sure she has another and then she frowned at her son why do you call her rose her name is pennyrose pennyrose is hardly a name for a princess rose is much more dignified much more not me pennyrose thought still this marriage was all about keeping their distance if that was the way he wanted it it seemed he did do you have anything else to wear he asked deflecting his mothers query nicely um pennyrose turned pink actually i dont oh my dear marguerite sounded horrified dont let it bother you she said hastily i dont understand what women see in choice it makes dressing a whole lot more complicated but it also makes it more fun marguerite had swung to her sons point of view in a moment now where will you go to shop you cant go anywhere in this principality youll be mobbed before you reach the first boutique theres nothing for it alastair youll have to take her to paris you need a few days on the rue du faubourg saint honoré hey the idea startled him i dont have time to go to paris its not me who needs clothes she cant shop here no but but paris it must be are you saying that you wont take her his mother demanded and fixed him with a look i could have belle take her there was a collective intake of breath and then alastair had the grace to grimace ok bad idea belles well known and there are media problems everywhere he sighed and appealed again to his mother but youre the obvious one to go no dear his mother shook her head the press has seen you once together the more romance we can imbue this with the better im not saying i hope the photographers find youyou need a couple of days gracebut if they do eventually track you down itd be so romantic to have you photographed strolling down paris streets hand in hand hey i dont intend holding anyones hand pennyrose retorted and marguerite sighed again you two arent very good at this romance business are you were fine alastair said right good so hold hands mother you need to get used to it his mother looked from pennyrose to alastair and back again in six weeks someones going to say you may kiss the bride if that means one chaste kiss on the forehead the lawyers will label this marriage a sham and the castleand the estatewill be lost to us and to the villagers they cant this marriage has to appear real marguerite said with asperity alastair stop treating the girl as if shell bite pennyrose stop treating the man as if hes your boss get friendly yes maam pennyrose said and she managed a smile ill do what i can alastair take the girl to paris and start calling her pennyrose um dont um me his mother snapped get a handle on this you never know you could just enjoy yourselves rose could enjoy shopping on her own call her pennyrose its not a princesss name and shell only be a princess not a friend we need to keep things formal fine his mother said exasperated just take whatshername to paris his exasperation equalled his mothers whatshername can go alone excuse me pennyrose said grinning slightly at their matching belligerent expressions they really were very alike but ii suspect i might need some help i dont exactly have much experience in shopping they stopped glaring at each other and turned their stunned attention to her no experience in shopping marguerite gasped oh my dear she sounded as if shed just heard pennyrose had been deprived of something of major importance like a leg so where did you find the dress youre wearing alastair demanded in disbelief all women shopped actually i made it myself i sew all my own clothes that stunned them even more alastair stared at her as if shed announced that shed come from another planet youre kidding sewing your own clothes hed hardly heard of such a thing im not kidding she met his look head on defiant i dont just stonewall i have other skills too she grinned i can also whistle loud enough to call the kids home from a mile away want to hear and she put two fingers to her mouth and prepared to whistle no marguerite and alastair spoke as one and she chuckled and desisted but alastair was still looking at her dress in awe but his critical eyes appraised her workmanship and found no fault at all its lovely she twinkled thank you he was still having trouble believing her andyour overalls i made them too you really have never shopped for clothes sometimes at welfare places she said diffidently but notnot at real clothes shops oh alastair marguerites eyes were shining what fun to introduce your bride to shopping to introduce your future daughterinlaw to shopping he retorted but despite himself his imagination was caught i dont suppose his thoughts were heading off at all sorts of wondrous tangents a woman whod never shoppedit was almost unbelievable things like lacy negligees and so on he said slowly i can hardly help her there of course you can his mother said soundly nowyoure to leave tomorrow morning youre to stay at the hotel carlon which belle tells me is the most splendid hotel in paris youre to spend a fortune and youre to have a very good time thats an order any questions no maam pennyrose said faintly except she blinked theres bert i need to ask bert for a couple of days off bert and i have an arrangement alastair told her hes a very understanding bossand employee that didnt please her you mean youll just bribe him to keep me on the team with no questions asked i need do no such thing hes not about to sack you he mustnt if i lose my spot on the team because youre out buying frilly knickers if you so much as tell him that she was aghast i wont alastair smiled at her drat his smile was really starting to get to her for heavens sakeshed been living in alastairs home for only two days she had over a year of this mock marriage to go but there was something very strange going on already every time the man smiled at her something in the deeper recesses of her middle did some sort of stupid lurch it was just that he was so darned attractive she thought wildly and the number of deeply attractive men shed spent any time with in her life numbered approximately zero or maybe it was just that she hadnt had time to notice she decided forcing herself to be practical maybe there were plenty of gorgeous guys out there and after this wedding farce was overafter her twelvemonth marriagemaybe she could see for herself with her frilly knickers the thought made her grin and alastair saw it and smiled back what sorry what are you laughing at the thought of me in frilly knickers underneath my homemade overalls she confessed some things are too ridiculous for words but youll come shopping with me do i have a choice no she spread her hands ok one shopping hit but itll have to be just the one lets get it all over in one shot can we buy a wedding dress while were at it i have an idea about that marguerite had been watching the interplay a small selfsatisfied smile playing on her lips who knew what was behind that smile i thought she hesitated my dear if you dont mind i thought you could wear my wedding dress she flickered a questioning look at her son youve always loved the photographs of your father and i being married the dress i wore belonged to your grandmother before me and its lovely if pennyrose agrees itd be wonderful for you to have your bride wear it but wont belle pennyrose started but was silenced by the sudden frown snapping down on her future motherinlaws face belle would die rather than wear an old dress of mine belle would the thought of the svelte belle wearing a traditional preloved wedding gown seemed almost ridiculous i it seems very personal pennyrose said looking sideways at alastair to see how he was taking it i mean it is a wedding of convenience it is only for a year but somewhat to her surprise alastair liked the idea i bet itd look gorgeous on you and its very economical he smiled that should appeal to your parsimonious streak if its your money i dont mind spending it she replied and got a bark of laughter in response thats very generous i can be she agreed blandly and just for a moment they were grinning at each other like fools or likefriends or something more which was crazy but the moment stretched on for far too long it was alastair who came back to earth first pennyroses insides were still doing some type of aerobic act she couldnt define youll wear my mothers dress he asked and if his voice was a trace unsteady it was only marguerite who noticed pennyroses thoughts were way too unsteady all on their own pennyrose needs to see it first marguerite decreed smiling complacently at them both things were going very well here very well indeed shes only wearing it if she loves it but meanwhile eat your supper turn in for an early night and then head off to paris in the morning for knicker shopping alastair agreed a wicked gleam lurking deep in those dangerous eyes in your dreams alastair de castaliae pennyrose muttered you buy me frilly knickers over my dead body she hesitated and maybe its just as well if we buy me a wedding dress im really not comfortable wearing your mothers why not because its real she said frankly her insides had somehow settled but with that crazy lurching had come a realisation alastair was holding her at arms length she needed to do the same some day you might meet someone even more special than belle thats silly no its not she turned to marguerite you must understand wearing your wedding dress makes the whole thing personaland this wedding has to be impersonal or it cant work id like you to wear it marguerite told her and with a shock pennyrose realised what she was saying and she knew she was right in her decision i cant she told her its for alastairs true wife to wear i dont understand alastair was looking from one to the other you will be my true wife as i said pennyrose retorted in your dreams alastair de castaliae in your dreams the next day was a dream all by itself first there was the journey to paris pennyrose and her coworkers had taken the train through france when shed started working in alastairs tiny border principality and shed expected that she and alastair would take the same train back to paris or theyd drive either way it was a full days journey but they did neither after an early breakfast alastair ushered her into his ferrari ten minutes later they were boarding a private jet and thirty minutes after that they were at charles de gaulle airport there was a limousine waiting awed into silence pennyrose was ushered into the car like royalty and she sank back onto leather cushions and thought that was exactly what she was royalty sort of or she would be in a matter of weeks after this fairytale wedding had taken place and then they reached their hotel alastair left her at her suite door and she had to pinch herself to ensure she really was awake her suite was twice as big as the house shed been raised in heck the bed was almost as big as the house shed been raised in there was more gold and silk and brocade than shed ever seen in her life it was great great so why wasnt she bouncing in pleasure it was simply too big and too opulent and too damned lonely australia and her family seemed suddenly very far away and she felt herself blinking back a tear she wandered around the suite touching everything hardly daring to breathe and when a knock sounded at the door she jumped a foot it was alastair of course shed been so stunned shed hardly noticed him leaving to be shown to his own rooms but all of a sudden she was desperately glad he was back this felt overthetop opulent and she was way out of her depth thisthis is quite some hotel she made herself say and he nodded and watched her face it is do you like it she took a deep breath and looked around and looked around again it lacks something she said finally or some things it needs halfadozen kids a few cats and dogs pizza boxes on the floor a couple of inner tubes and some rubber duckies for the bath something noisy on televisionand maybe then id like it a little bit you dont like it um no she confessed its like a palace she wrinkled her nose you may be used to sleeping in palaces hey ive only just inherited the title you chose this place i didnt he admitted ive never been in this hotel but belle says its the best and my mother said i should bring you to the best and you always do what belle and your mother say i see she chewed her bottom lip my bath she said at last is in the shape of a heart its a spa with padded seats built for two the bathroom looks as if its been designed for cleopatra mmm you have the same he nodded unsure where the conversation was leading i have the same so we have a heartshaped spa each she said thats cosy two spas built for two one in each room youre telling me its over the top he ventured his lips twitching and she tilted her chin and nodded just a bit maybe we could always share oh right she gave him an oldfashioned look and then your requirement that i be a virtuous bride goes right out the window there is that alastairs smile faded as he assessed his future wife dressed casually in tailored trousers and a linen opennecked shirt alastair himself looked supremely at ease in these luxurious surroundings his future bride however looked far from comfortable it was her hands he thought always his eyes fell to her hands her sundress was lovely she looked lovely but her hands were the true rose or pennyrose they made him feel wrongas if he was pushing her into something she wasnt meant to be he was suddenly irresistibly reminded of a television show hed once seen where a muchdecorated war veteran had been brought in for show and tell the mans deeds had been awesome but the television show had been superficial it had glamorised and in the process somehow belittled both the man and his actions hed been uncomfortable watching he was uncomfortable now do you really not like it its the gilt and the brocade she explained and and what the mirrors wherever i go i see me i can think of worse things to look at yeah right when you have belle to compare me to i dont think she took a deep breath ok ill get over it but i would prefer something a bit simpler the hotel carlon doesnt do simple then im stuck with it she looked down at her sundress and wrinkled her nose but i believe you now when you say i need clothes especially if im to spend any more time in front of these damned mirrors fine lets get out of here and go shopping youre seriously not looking forward to this im seriously not looking forward to this she grimaced and made a confession i dont exactly know how its done what shopping shopping its easy he told her suppressing a smile you stand in a shop you show them your credit card and you watch what happens he held out his hand come and see she stared down at his hand for a long moment his fingers were tanned and strong and inviting the gesture to take her hand in his was a casual one no more but what had marguerite said itd be so romantic to have youstrolling down paris streets hand in hand yeah great but the hand was still proffered and a deal was a deal what was the man offering a million pounds whew it was the stuff of dreams and if she was to engage in dreams she might as well go the whole distance so she smiled up at her intended husband with a confidence she was far from feeling she put her hand in his and she let herself be led out onto the streets of paris to shop it wasnt an introduction into shopping that alastair gave her it was a crash course masters degree and then some they shopped and shopped and shopped and when pennyrose decided there couldnt be an item of clothing left in paris that she hadnt tried on alastair turned to accessories and shopped some more they paused only for meals he took her to quiet little restaurants where he wasnt likely to be known they ate wonderful food but pennyrose slipped into a quietness which even alastair knew was out of character on their second day he collected her from her room to find she had dark shadows under her eyes and when questioned she admitted she hadnt slept its the bed she told him its too big and too cold and too too lonely there shed said it she looked at him expecting to see laughter but instead she saw concern fivestar hotels by yourself are a bit echoing he agreed my suites just as barren but i dont think sharings an option do you no then we just get on with it one more night and then home tomorrow home to your castle he thought of the sumptuous guest room in the castle and frowned do you find that just as lonely im not homesick she said seeing what he was thinking im never homesick no no she lied im enjoying myself these clothes arefabulous we have bought some lovely things he said gravely and theres more to come her determined cheerfulness faltered i yes youre not enjoying the shopping either i feel like a kept woman she blurted out its awful i dont know that im going to be able to stand it for a year being a princess being a princess he surveyed her face with caution if he wasnt careful he could blow it and he knew it most women would jump at the chance she was being offered he thought but he knew enough of her now to know that most women didnt include rose you can back out he told her and then what and then id lose my estate and michael wouldnt go to university see were up against a brick wallboth of us its a comfortably padded brick wall he said lightly and she flushed and bit her lip i know im being stupid its harder for you than for me he acknowledged im not being hauled out of my comfort zone pennyrose thought that through and found flaws its not very comfortable living on turnip soup she said and he smiled she had courage and the only way through this was through it breakfast he proffered his arm oh yup why not a smorgasbord of two hundred different dishes dont tell me youd prefer a baguette well actually actually yes and there was only one answer to that the choice in the hotels lavish restaurant simply overwhelmed her yes he looked her up and down and then he sighed come on he said in exasperation breakfast here is the most magnificent that paris has to offer but dont mind that lets turn our backs on the carlons stupendous breakfast and go find ourselves a baguette alastair but he was brooking no argument i can slum it with the best of them he told her his arm linked with hers and held just watch me chapter five so instead of eating the hotels sumptuous breakfast they found a patisserie and alastair proceeded to show pennyrose that he had absolutely no idea what slumming meant as a peasant he failed miserably pennyroses simple baguette was simply not enough not faced with the choice of pariss magnificent pastries so while she watched in openmouthed amazement he proceeded to buy one of everything he could see a baguette croissants and mouthwatering pastries filled with fruit something chocolate that pennyrose with her limited french decided was called death by explosion and more then there was coffee in huge takeaway mugs the smell of which made her mouth water they emerged finally from their patisserie to find piles of grapes and mandarins on a nextdoor stall ignoring her protestsyouve dragged me away from the hotel carlons breakfast womanyou can let me buy what i wanthe loaded them with so much breakfast they were having trouble carrying it and pennyrose was caught between laughter and exasperation she was given time for neither now to the bois de boulogne alastair decreed its the closest it was also the loveliest the sun was already warm with the promise of a magnificent day to come the park was filled with mothers and pushchairs elderly couples sitting soaking up the sun and small children playing tag or racing with balloons in true royal fashion alastair found a tree and claimed it as their own he signalled to someone in the distance and before she knew it there were two deckchairs set up for their comfort now alastair surveyed his scene with satisfaction breakfast as parisians do it oh right parisian princes would that be you dont like this either his face fell ludicrously and it was all pennyrose could do not to laugh but he was watching her with such an expression of anxiety on his faceand the sun was warm on hersand it was paris in the springtime and the coffee smelled tantalising and the pastries were exquisite id have to be a mindless idiot not to enjoy this she said softly smiling up at him no alastair i dont like this i love it after that the shopping was better though pennyrose still found it uncomfortable she was now wearing some of the clothes shed purchased the day before that made her feel less conspicuous in these overthetop salons but every time she dressed at the end of each fitting she couldnt help thinking these arent my clothes these arent me she was buying clothes for a princess she thought not for pennyrose oshea or twobob rose or whoever she was she was beginning not to know any more once hed made the decision to accompany her alastair took his duties seriously he insisted on seeing her as she emerged in each outfit and his smiles of approval disturbed her still more she was turning into what he wanted she thought she was becoming no longer herself she was becoming alastairs wifeforayear and the prospect was more and more disturbing but finally alastair was satisfied almost at four oclock he announced her major wardrobe complete and he escorted her to a tiny shop off the main boulevard the shop needed some explaining and he did it fast before you get the wrong idea my mother told me to bring you here he told her hastily at the look on her face his dark eyes glinted with laughter this he said with an evil grin may well be the best part of the whole shopping experience its knicker time and as pennyrose gazed into the window she could only gasp these werent just knickers they were flights of fancy here were silken wisps of elegance that had nothing at all in common with the sturdy knickers she was wearingexcept maybe two holes for legs i cant buy these alastairs grin faded you can he took her hand imbuing her with the gravity of the occasion only his stilllurking glimmer belied his serious tone and you must the servants will be doing your washing and theyll expect quality his grin returned in full and she stared at him in confusion the rathe was enjoying this remember he told her this marriage has to appear real somehow she found her voice your wife would wear things like these he nodded with no hesitation at all of course she would he motioned to a flagrantly indecent set of bra and panties on a flagrantly indecent model and his laughter became more pronounced my wife would especially wear those oh yeah i can see belle in those his smile faded again but this time the fading was for real he hadnt been thinking of belle she realised as she watched his face the rat had actually been thinking of her this was crazy the whole situation was absurd so im buying these to keep up appearances with the laundress she asked carefully thats right does the laundress have any colour preference he pointed to the bra and pantie setbright crimson i bet bright crimson would work a treat on the laundress she glowered he assumed an air of injured innocence who else could i be thinking of right her glower intensified well if this is just between me and the laundress you can take yourself off while i make my purchases hey this is between me and the laundress and the shop assistant she said firmly back in your box mister thats no way to talk to a prince a princess can talk any way she wants and you want a virtuous bride virtuous brides wouldnt be seen dead in a shop like this especially with their princeand especially before theyre married he thought that one through and didnt like it thats not playing fair whos playing their eyes locked and suddenly the question was very very real who was playing who could tell the scary part was that somewhere in that overthetop place pennyrose finally started to enjoy herself with alastair firmly left outside she let the sales assistant have her head and she tried on set after set of the most gorgeous lingerie shed ever seen in her life and standing in front of the threeway mirror she started to get an inkling of how cinderella must have felt its an outofbody experience she told herself looking at her trim body clothed only in a wisp of lace that could well have been cutwith cloth left overfrom a very small handkerchief she grinned or an onlyjustinbody experience i guess when this is all done i can donate these to charity charity would have a fit she decided and it was with a chuckle and arms full of packages that she emerged to the street to find her waiting prince but her prince wasnt where shed left him she searched the street and found a dog a pup the pup was some sort of terrier knee high wirehaired and fawn and white or he might once have been fawn and white now his fur was matted and filthy and a deep jagged wound stretched along most of his side one leg was carried high his shaggy ears drooped and his eyes were dull with misery it was the end of a paris business day the boulevard was crowded with legs going everywhere even though paris was a city of dog lovers in this crowd one small dog didnt stand a chance of being noticed except by pennyrose who was feeling bereft herself and was searching for alastair she saw the dog first as she emerged from the shop and saw him the small creature was pushed too close to the road and she realised how hed got that wound he was headed that way again no with a cry of dismay she dropped her parcels and darted forward she was too late to stop the dog being pushed onto the road but that didnt stop her from diving after him there was a screech of brakes and the next moment she was crouched in the gutter her arms were full of dog and her eyes were reflecting his pain oh no rose alastair had been waiting with the patience of a saintsort of hed been across the road windowshopping and desperately trying not to think of what his intended wife was doing he hadnt succeeded for some reason all he could think of was his bride wearing that lingerie so he hadnt noticed the dog through the mass of legs across the street and the first thing he saw was rose diving head first into the crazy parisian traffic hell what on earth his heart hit his mouth he lunged across the road ignoring braking cars reaching the gutter where she knelt he looked down in consternation what was wrong had she been hit are you his voice was a cracked whisper as he stooped urgently toward her rose are you ok yes she didnt even look up his breath came out in a long rush dear god whatwhat on earth are you doing its a dog she said as if he were stupid but he wasnt after that heartstopping moment when he thought shed been hit his brain was starting to function again a taxi veered toward them and before she knew what he was about she was bodily lifted and carried back toward the shops youll get yourself killed alastair had been badly shaken and it showed are you crazy but pennyrose wasnt noticing not even when he carried her across the pavement to the safety of the shop doorway she had eyes only for the dog she carried alastair set her down and her fingers kept probing parting matted fur so she could see the damage what was wrong with him the dog lay limp and unresisting in her arms past caring alastair knelt beside her and watched woman and dog together he felt as if all the breath had been knocked out of him let me see heshes injured she opened her arms so alastair could see the state of her small burden and it was all alastair could do not to wince at the sight hell pennyrose wasnt listening pedestrians were having to detour around her but she didnt notice she sat with her back against the door of the lingerie shop and her whole attention was on one small dog its ok she comforted him its ok little one youre fine now only he wasnt fine he needed a vet alastair he was way in front paris is a dogloving city he said kneeling beside her he knew without being asked that shed never abandon this muttand in truth he felt the same himself the dog was gazing at him now and there was something about those huge brown painfilled eyes there are organisations who take in strays and there are veterinary surgeons everywhere ill call a taxi and well take him to the closest she breathed a long sigh she wasnt sure what shed expectedshe knew this man so littlebut all she knew now was that he hadnt reacted like her father her father would have taken one look at the dogand one look at his daughters concerned faceand fetched his gun but alastair was different his first thought hadnt been how best to be rid of the problem and how to hurt her in the process but how best they could help the dog he was some man she thought dazedly he was some prince but she needed to concentrate on the dog she turned back to her pup cradling him close to give him some body warmth hes only a baby the pup was still at the gangly halfgrown stage when dogs were most at risk outgrowing their cuteness and risking abandonment in the process and hes shaking all over id imagine he must be he looks as if hes been hit by a car and hes starving his ribs oh pup come on alastair made a decision and glanced round the street with a rueful smile you cant stay here for the first time she seemed to take in her surroundings they were hardly dignified she was sitting in the dust with her stockinged legs out in front of her shed lost a shoe the pup was curled into her lap her pale lemon suit was filthy there was blood on her skirt and she must look she didnt get any further a flashbulb went off not four feet from her face she looked up blindly and the flash went again the cameraman had been in a nearby café and had been attracted by the screech of brakes this had the makings of a great photo opportunity hed thought as hed watched what had unfoldeda beautiful woman crouched on the pavement among scattered shopping her arms full of bloodied dog so while the rest of paris had gone about its business hed hauled his camera out of his bag and headed over to take a few snaps pennyrose looked up her face uncomprehending what let her be alastair growled and the mans attention turned to him his eyes widened in shock alastair de castaliae alastair wasnt as well known in paris as he was in his own country but this cameraman was on the fringe of the paparazzi he knew his celebrities in one instant his face changed he saw a fortune dangling before his eyes and his camera turned onto automatic in the next thirty seconds hed taken maybe a dozen shotsof the couple crouched on the pavement of the girl trying to protect her dog from the flash of the camera and alastair using his body to shield her which left alastair in a dilemma stopping the camera was impossible short of doing the man harm he had to be allowed to take what he wanted he had a choice he could treat the cameraman as the enemywhich would get them nowhereor he could treat him as an accomplice which might achieve more ok were sprung alastair sighed letting his shielding hand drop any chance of doing a deal what sort of deal the man was still behind his camera still clicking but his mind was in overdrive thered be at least three major newspapers whod bid for these pictures and that was just in france in alastairs principality thered be more and then there were the womens magazines alastair could see the way his mind was working and his thoughts had to move even faster were making an announcement on friday alastair told him back home would you like to be around when we do the mans eyes practically started from his head he was only just getting a toehold in this industry and this could be the break hed been looking for sure his camera was lowered as he stared in disbelief yeah great then give us a day before you publish these pictures alastair said one more day of peace youre marrying the girl the man looked closely at pennyrose and tried for the jackpot will you tell me your name as i said were making an announcement on friday alastair refused to be drawn further and pennyrose took her cue from him what else could it be but an announcement of a marriage the cameraman knew the conditions of the old princes will all the paparazzi did it was their business to know and youre taking a last fling in paris before the world catches up with you the photographer was a romantic at heart and he could see the headlines over his pictures he took an uneasy glance along the street the last thing he wanted now was someone else with a camera he wanted a scoop and alastair was as eager to get off the street as the cameraman now was to have them leave he hauled out a business card and scribbled something on the back here ring this number ask to speak to dominic and hell organise you a free return flight youre kidding id never kid about something like this the man stared down at the card and his face twisted and he decided on a bit of honesty himself you know this could be just what i need i know but we need another day by ourselves the man hesitated i wont be scooped not if you keep your mouth shut for twentyfour hours i can do that the photographer grinned making up his mind one more day with your lady your dog and your his grin broadened your lingerie with a gasp pennyrose realised what had happened shed thrown aside her bags as shed dived for the dog she was now sitting among a pile of oh good grief can you edit those out alastair demanded glancing around at the wisps of silk he fished in his wallet ill make it worthwhile nothing would make editing this out worthwhile the man said bluntly then as alastair signalled for a taxi he threw in a last question the dogi assume its a stray i imagine he is pennyrose said shortly are you keeping it a taxi drew to a halt alastair helped pennyrose to her feet and thankfully she tumbled into the car still clutching her pup just tell me the photographer said this time more urgently are you keeping the dog alastair was gathering knickers and bras and shopping bags together they needed to get out of there fast are you keeping it the photographer demanded a third time and alastair turned to rose her face was white and strained shed had enough he knew these days in unfamiliar territory had taken their toll she was so far from home he thought as he watched her hug the pup shed come close to being killed she was badly shocked and now suddenly he realised hed never seen anyone look so alone she wasnt alone she was with him he needed herand if he wasnt careful hed lose himself a wife were they keeping the dog she was holding on as if she needed the pathetic little creature more than the pup needed her yes alastair said strongly and with the same flash of insight that had seen her homesickness he knew this was the only sensible thing to do of course were keeping the dog why not the cab driver took them to the nearest veterinarian not to the animal shelter pennyrose asked and alastair shook his head for some reason he was unsure what to saythey were both in unfamiliar territory so they stayed silent while the vet clucked over the little dog cleaned and stitched the gash on his side examined his leg and told them the pup was starving but the leg itself was just badly bruised take him home and give him a light mealnot too much as his stomach wont be accustomed to big feeds look after him well madame the vet smiled speaking in halting english normally this man didnt deign to use englishit was his opinion that foreigners should speak french in francebut there was something about pennyrose that made a man want to help all he could her halting thanks in french had made him smile though i have no need to tell you to take care of him he said gently i believe you are doing so already unlike the photographer he didnt ask if she intended keeping him that was assumed but shed been thinking and there were problems i dont think i can take him she faltered as they emerged again to the streets of paris she looked up and found alastairs eyes gravely watchful at the end of the year i need to go home the quarantine between here and australia takes months whats a few months between friends alastair smiled ok if he was getting committed he might as well get really committed to a dog mind he told himself hastily just to a dog if there are problems ill look after him when you go he looked down at the disreputable mutt the pup looked mournfully back and alastairs grin broadened ok commitment here didnt seem too hard my castle could do with an aristocratic hound as watch dog alastair pennyrose caught her breath at the enormity of his offer she felt like shed been handed the crown jewels youre kidding would i kid about something that means so much she stared up at him and something caught in her throat pennyrose had never been handed a gift like this in her life gifts werent something that came in her directionever with a struggle she kept her voice light though she felt tears of gratitude welling and it was all she could do to fight them back anan aristocratic hound she managed i dont think so hell do she thought about this as ill do for a wife makebelieve until the real thing comes along thats right he was looking at her strangely and her insides were kickinghard someone had to be practical pennyrose had to be practical it was the only way if she wasnt going to sink into the mans chest and sob well lets go then she set her chin with resolution take us home your temporary wife and your aristocratic hound youre getting yourself quite a collection alastair de castaliae i believe i am alastair murmured and he didnt look like a man fighting against the odds one bit to her surprise their cab didnt take them back to hotel carlon ive arranged something different alastair told her as they drove in the opposite direction while you were trying on knickers i made a few phone calls and had our bags moved he grinned maybe its just as well something tells me scruffy will be more comfortable there scruffy she was confused but recovering who are you calling scruffy not you alastairs eyes teased her though come to think of it at the look in her eyes he held up his hands in mock defence no the pup of course i mean the pup scruffy his name she said with injured dignity is not scruffy well what else would you call him scruffy humph his name is leo with her equilibrium almost restored with it came decisiveness she raised her eyebrows with aristocratic hauteur a princess in the making it means king a king he sounded stunned like in leo the lion he looked down at the bandaged bedraggled mutt in her arms his lips twitched and he nodded oh right i see it you will she smiled just wait until he recovers so i have a leo and a rose he told her but he was half talking to himself what next what next indeed what next was introducing her to their hotel which was pure pleasure pennyrose walked through unassuming street doors and was stunned into silence but this time it wasnt grandeur that was taking her breath away it was loveliness the hotels two floors were sedate and low built in pinkwashed stone the buildings circled a cobbled courtyard french windows opened out to the garden and her first impression was the fluttering of soft drapes in the evening air and that air was gorgeous the courtyard was a mass of flowers wisteria clung to hundredyearold vines there were early roses delicate pink tulips soft blue forgetmenots and more the hotel itself looked almost inconspicuous in the garden setting chairs and tables were scattered under the trees comfortable and inviting there was a wellused birdbath a sculpture of a woman drooping over a fishpond there was the gurgle of running water behind this was just fabulous pennyrose decided and when alastair showed her to her roomno porters hereit was even better her bedroom was simplicity itself its major adornment being the windowframed courtyard there was crisp white linen fluffy white towels a bath with no fancy gadgets at all mounds and mounds of pillows and a dog basket she looked an astonished question at alastair how had he managed this i told madame what our problem was he told her she moves fast someone will be here any minute with minced steak for leo oh alastair she found herself suddenly close to tears again drat the man she didnt give way to emotionshe never gave way to emotionand here he was unsettling her as no one else could as usual when things got too much for her she resorted to practical matters or tried to thank you she said simply but she glanced at her watch it was well past eight and even her own stomach was rumbling howhow can we eat were in the middle of the best eating district in paris we can eat any time we want she bit her lip hed done so much already and this was hard i mean i cant leave leo now how did i know youd say that he smiled down at her that heartstopping smile that made her insides do somersaults no problem while you feed leo ill make a foray out into the big bad world and bring us back food we can eat in the courtyard two picnics in one day he nodded i can handle it can you yes oh yes she couldnt think of anything more perfect chapter six so while leo fed and cuddled and exhausted slept as hed never slept in his life before his new owners ate pâté de fois gras then succulent beef cooked to perfection in a rich burgundy sauce with tiny button mushrooms and crusty bread to soak up the juice followed by cheeses by the time the last of the main meal was gone pennyrose knew shed been to heaven and back this was food at its most exquisite served in takeaway containers as if it were everyday food and there was more with the air of a magician conjuring up a rabbit or two alastair poured a rich crimson wine that was full of the sunlight of late harvest and when he produced bitesized meringues luscious strawberries and lashings of clotted cream she could hardly believe her eyes shed never eaten like this she hadnt known such food existed i cant believe you found all this she told him and he looked smug in truth he was enjoying himself hugely he was accustomed to women who treated great food as an everyday event roses delight made him smile it also made his chest expand a notch or two im a huntergatherer from way back he said as his smug look intensified theres not a lot me and my trusty club cant do he pointed to the remnants of the beef thats brontosaurus rex or exrex whatever he pushed his chest out another notch but theres no need to congratulate me a man does what he must in order to survive yeah right you survive on this kind of food i can survive on less he told her if i need to one rex drumstick instead of two his smile faded as i imagine you have in the past unaware of the way his gaze had just changed she popped a strawberry into her mouth and sighed in bliss oh yes you know i may well go home at the end of our twelvemonth marriage the size of a house thats fine by me more of rose he could handle that her smile disappeared as she thought about it i guessme getting fat would give you your excuse to divorce me i doubt anyone would think that was a reasonable excuse he said and suddenly thought hell what excuse was he going to use mutual incompatibility the more he was getting to know her the more that reason wouldnt wash itll have to be homesickness on my part she said watching his face and guessing where his thoughts were headed or ill suddenly find out about belle and you didnt know about belle beforehand i was stupid she said cheerfully thick as a brick i can be when i want to be or even her smile deepened when i dont want to be she decided to confess all you know the day before we came here i started adding a fourth layer to my wall without putting in throughstones throughstones he was lost stones stretching across the wall to tie the sides she said patiently ask bert how stupid that is iumi see an unforgivable sin youll think so if your wall falls down in two hundred years she retorted and he smiled ill be watching for it and youll deduct the cost of repair from my wages thatd be right or from your greatgreatgrandchildrens wages he told her remind me to put something in my will to that effect my greatgreatgrandchildren can gather stupidity compensation when its due it wont be necessary she said with dignity i was only three stones along before i realised the throughstones are now in place you relieve my mind enormously thats the plan her green eyes twinkled and a faintly remembered phrase came wafting thought her consciousness after all as long as domestic service survives the convenience of the employer comes first he grinned at that very good i like it and its not convenient to me if my wall falls down thats the ticket she chuckled your wife and your dog will have fallen down in their duty and that would never do it took alastair a while to answer that he sat and watched her as she tackled a last strawberry the day had taken its toll she looked ruffled and tired but shed showered and changed into her own faded jeans and cotton blouse she looked fresh and clean and lovelybut she was as far from the circle of women he usually moved in as she could be her toes were bare her hair was gently stirring in the warm night air and she wasnt wearing a scrap of makeup domestic servant she was cinderella to a tee he thought ruefully but all at once he knew that if the fairy godmother were to arrive with her magic wand he wouldnt have her wave it i suppose not he said at last and he sounded suddenly bewildered but pennyroses own confusion was settling the last rays of evening sun were lingering over the courtyard with their echoes of warmth from a perfect spring day her little dog lay fast asleep in her room soon shed go up to him and sleep in her wonderful bed and wake tomorrow morning to sunshine and and to alastair the direction her thoughts were headed suddenly jarred home with a vengeance and her eyes flew wide with shock whats wrong alastair saw the look i rose sorry she shook her head its nothing but somethings bothering you no it was just something she fought for an explanationany explanationbecause the real one surely wouldnt do it was something i forgot to tell bert but itll be ok youre not still worrying about your wall he was gently teasing but the concern in his voice deepened her sense of shock because she knew now what was happening there was no question about it it had never happened in her life beforeit was something shed read about but had never believed was realbut there was now no doubting its reality it was happening to her right now help we can go home tomorrowback to your precious stonewalling alastair was saying and she had to concentrate fiercely to hear him the only task we have left is to order your wedding dress she thought that through theyd left her wedding dress to the end of their stay because they knew their chances of making such a purchase without publicity were remote but now it didnt matter tomorrow was thursday theyd make their purchase and then theyd fly home to announce their plans but pennyroses plans had suddenly changed a wedding for a year she looked at alastair and the familiar lurch happened all over again she knew it now for what it was it was inescapable and it had changed things for ever this was serious commitment she thought desperately this man was some prince and he was offering her marriage it might only be for a year but shed still agreed to marry him what would she say with this ring i thee wed with my body i thee worship the words of the wedding vow came to her as clearly as a song on the late night air to love and to cherish from this day forward theyd be making the vows in jestto last for a year but why alastair wasnt in love with belle pennyroses thoughts were flying every which way and it was a wonder she wasnt saying things out loud confusion was certainly washing over her face he wasnt in love with anyone she thought after the shock of lissas death alastair had been deeply wary of commitment he wanted a wife of convenience and that was all soshe was to be his wife of convenience for a year and after that shed be followed by another convenient bride belle it was all wrong she thought wildly this man should be loved to distraction he deserved to be loved to distraction as leo was going to be as much as she was capable of loving oras she loved already this had never happened to her before but she knew she was right somehow her heart had been handed over like it or not whether or not it was sensible she was head over heels in love with alastair de castaliae and she didnt know what to do with it but she knew now that when she made her wedding vows shed be incapable of lying from this day forward thered be a part of her that was desperate for those words to mean exactly what they said and they meant for ever if that was what she wanted the old pennyrose was surfacing the pennyrose who was prepared to fight and steal and do anything she must to protect her sisters and brother the pennyrose who knew the only way to get what she wanted was to fight with everything she possessed and then more well maybe she didnt have enough armoury to win this battle but she knew where shed start i dont think i will buy a wedding dress she told him fighting to keep her voice casual and watching his face as she did he frowned thrown off balance why not he hesitated and the forlorn look shed been wearing came back to him youre not thinking of pulling out are you his voice was anxious hell if she pulled out now youll still marry me now what have you done in the last couple of hours to make me change my mind she teased youve been a model fiancé the lurching in the pit of his stomach settled a bit gee thanks think nothing of it and then her smile died ive its just ive been thinking about your mothers offer she bit her lip hardly daring to go on but her commitment had already been made and she had no control over it now she was suddenly playing for keeps and whether alastair knew it or not his precious independence was in deadly trouble but she couldnt tell him that she had to keep her voice practical and sensible as all her plans must be im tired of spending your money and im tired of shopping she declared ive decided ill wear your grandmothers wedding dress after all but he frowned i thought you objected to the idea that its for my true wife to wear belle doesnt want to wear it and you said thats what ill be she told him your legal wife for a year and however long i can manage she told herself silently from this day forward for ever if i can manage it pennyrose lay in bed that night and thought what have i done beside her leo slept the sleep of the dead filled with food for maybe the first time in his life his wounds eased with painkillers and his body snuggled into soft cushions he lay beside his new mistress and thought he was in doggy heaven her fingers trailed down to touch the pups wet nose and she thought she was pretty much in the same place but not doggy heaven pennyrose heaven hes given me so much she told the sleeping leo her conscience giving her a swift kick in the ribs hes handed me a dream for a year and hes handed me you its dreadful of me to go for more but that was just what she was doing because somewhere during the last few days something strange had happened her heart had been twisted and turned till she hardly knew herself ive fallen in love she whispered so help me leo ive fallen for the man now what fight just try she said to the darkened room justtake this marriage as it comes but say my vows as if i mean them and then cross every finger and every toe that i can work a little magic see if i can change his formal princess rose into a pennyrose he can love and youll wear his mothers wedding dress she was questioning her own motives leo wuffled in his sleep and pennyrose grimaced and buried her nose in the soft pillows its very wrong but if you dont try if you dont try then belle will end up with her prince she told herself or with my prince and he doesnt want her any more than he wants me its such a waste so what makes you think you can win his heart nothing at all she was two voices the voice of reason and the voice of hope nothing at all she repeated into the stillness oh but leo i can only try youll have to do more than try girl ill do whatever it takes she said with a resolution she was far from sure of that and a bit more heaven help me i cant do anything else she flicked on her light with sudden determination and crossed to where the days parcels had been stacked in a minute shed discarded her muchpatched pyjamas and was standing in front of the mirror she was now wearing one of todays purchasesa soft white nightgown of the sheerest silk it was cut low across her breasts it was embroidered white on white with tiny rosebuds and shed never seen anything so exquisite in her life i cant wear this she told her reflection i bought this for the laundress her curls were tumbled to her shoulders her face was tinged with a faint embarrassed pink and the reflection that looked at her was im not wasting this on the laundress she addressed the sleeping leo she gave her reflection a rueful grimace it makes me look almost lovely lovelier than belle she glowered it doesnt matter how lovely belle is she doesnt love him and she herself did alastair was sleeping just the other side of the wall this was a suite meant for a family a door connected the rooms all she had to do was turn the key on her side and alastair turn the key on his if i was a bit more brazen id knock she thought suddenly and then she gasped and took a step back as she realised where her thoughts were taking her pennyrose oshea you hussy she said aloud if thats what it takes her reflection answered her nope she slid the nightgown off and reached for her pyjamas im not into seduction so what are you into im into loving the man to bits she responded to herself its all i have and if thats not enough the nightie lay on the floor and mocked her well see she said and grinned alls fair in love and war this is a combination of both and in the next room alastair lay and stared at the ceiling with a lot more uncertainty there were things going on in his life that he no longer understood it had all seemed so straightforward he thought grimly after lissas death hed made the decision to stay uninvolved and hed succeeded his life was what he wanted he had a profession he was proud of he had more than enough money and he had belle available when he needed her with the thought of a couple of children down the track children theyd be quiet little things he thought conjuring them from the darkness maybe theyd have pigtails and hula hoops whatever theyd be kids for his mother to pamper marguerite deserved grandchildren he checked out his vision of his childrenbut something strange was happening instead of faceless prettiness as there always had been he now had pennyroses face before him rose he told himself its rose not pennyrose it was stupid but it was important somehow he had to keep this formal so she was rose but why did his kids suddenly have roses twinkle and roses cheekiness and for heavens sake no if they had personality like pennyroseno rosethen how could he not love them he thought and loving anything it didnt work hed watched his mother break her heart when his father had died and his own gut had been wrenched enough when lissa had been killed lissa had been such a good friend that the hurt had been dreadful so it was a lesson hed learned the hard way but hed learned it well you dont give your heart he wasnt giving his heart now this was a marriage of convenience what had rose said the convenience of the employer comes first that was what he was he thought grimly an employer he was paying her to be his wife for a year and emotional ties didnt come into it how could they she didnt need him long term that was why hed chosen her she was australian and shed be off home as soon as she had her money leaving him with belle which was the way he wanted it he told himself hastily the way it had to be the sensible way as was roses decision to wear his mothers wedding dress it was economical wedding dressesespecially ones suitable for a royal weddingcost a fortune she was saving him money with her decision putting the convenience of the employer first so why didnt she feel like one of his employees im not very good at this cinderella thing he said out loud im not comfortable with it its the fact that she has nothing and deserves so much thats making this all so damned gutwrenching thats why you gave her the dog thats right she has nothing a dog cant hurt and youre comfortable with her wearing your mothers wedding dress its sensible hell he turned over and pummelled his pillows trying not to envisage rose in his mothers wedding dress and then trying not to envisage rose sleeping just through the wall could he hear her there was a soft murmuring through the door she was awake she was probably lonely all he had to do he thought was take his key and no that was the way of madness he had to stop rose from turning into pennyrose every time he thought of her but she was so close how could he block her out out of his thoughts out of his life hed ring belle he decided shed talk sense into him hed phone her and talk through the palmerstone job theyd been working on it together so she wouldnt think it was strange it was one in the morning he put the phone down with a reluctant grin this was not a good plan belle would think such a phone call was weird hed never hear the end of it but he had to speak to someone or hed go nuts what i need he told the darkness is another leo i wonder whether rose will let me share his key lay in his hand and he held it so hard that it hurt chapter seven just leave everything to me back at the castle groomed to an inch of her life pennyrose was waiting to become alastairs official fiancée theyd called a press conference the gallery was packed and it was all pennyrose could do not to bolt for australia she might have recovered her equilibrium since paris she thought desperately she might have made a few resolutions but she wasnt a limelight kind of girl this is belles forte she muttered cant a substitute wife do as well you are a substitute wife alastair reminded her and she grimaced oh great as if she needed reminding of that you dont need to be nervous leave the talking to me i cant do much else with my grasp of french she said bitterly then she took two deep breaths and got a grip cowardice was not what was needed resolution was what was needed from this moment on i do know a phrase that might be useful she said thoughtfully how about vous ne me ferez jamais parler she clutched her throat with melodramatic flourish jamais jamais jamais youll never make me talk alastair translated faintly he grinned as the tension eased a bit never never never very useful where on earth did you learn that she arched her eyebrows in superior fashion where else but from my usefull frase for toorist book its the same place i learned i am bleeding to death that man has a gun and can you tell me how to reach the border she managed a smirk see im ready for anything alastair choked on laughter and the tension dissipated even further but this was serious as i said maybe its best if i do the talking most of the press have a solid grasp of english but but you dont want me to mess things up by threatening border runs pennyrose nodded her understanding ok i know my place we cinderella types are designed to sit and simper and look beautiful and hope like hell the pumpkins stay at bay rose she put up her hands i know i know im being paid heaps and ill be good i promise then she peeped through a crack in the door trying to see what was waiting for them i wonder if our cameraman from paris is here thatll be one friendly face yeah he knows us intimately right down to the colour of your knickers alastair grimaced he doesnt know the real me wears cottontails cottontails alastair said faintly what are you dont want to know she chuckled if you want to keep your delusion that real women wear black lace thongs its fine by me oh he is here i can see him hell be here marguerite was fluttering round the edges adjusting alastairs tie and putting one last dab of powder on roses nose hed be mad not to be a new princess its what the press have been waiting for for years then lets not keep them waiting alastairs mind was still on the cottontail conversation and he was finding it hard to concentrate but he had to get a grip somehow he swung the door wide but rose for heavens sake leave the talking to me only of course she couldnt because after the first brief announcement the press didnt want to hear from alastair alone they knew this man who they didnt know was the lady he was with and they were fascinated tell us about yourself one asked in english and pennyrose hesitated obedient to instruction may i leave that to my no she was told very definitely and before alastair could get a word in theyd pushed her further tell us what you think of our country well shed been obedient for all of a minute it hadnt worked so what else was a girl to do but tell the truth its the most beautiful country ive ever been in she said frankly and then despite her nervousness her eyes twinkled apart from mine you love australia of course i do then whats the attraction here she rolled her eyes at that and turned toward her intended she looked alastair up and down taking in his immaculate suit and gorgeous tie and the way his eyes creased into laughter lines andand all of him her laughter lines creased into readiness need you ask she chuckled and the room laughed with her they loved her there were flashbulbs going everywhere and the questioning intensified people are saying this is a marriage of convenience she was told what do you say to that alastair opened his mouth to answer but his bridetobe was in her stride and unstoppable theyre right of course her twinkle stayed firmly in place the only way to meet an accusation of an arranged marriage was partial honesty i imagine you know the terms of my future husbands inheritance if he doesnt marry then the estate will be dispersed and thatll cause hardship so her eyes strayed around the members of the press and it was as if she was speaking to each person in turn in moments shed made a big impersonal gathering seem like a cosy afternoontea chat its convenient for alastair to be married to me and its convenient for me to be married to alastair she smiled and her hand reached out to lightly touch his very convenient and apart from that we think well like it very very much youre in love with him one of the female reporters said on a note of discovery and pennyrose refused to be disconcerted of course arent you she asked innocently i thought everybody was there was general laughter and then the questioning turned back to alastair so what makes this lady special alastair took a deep breath but suddenly his rehearsed answer went out the window because the touch of her hand on his had thoroughly unnerved him and so had the way shed handled this terrifying occasion then there was the fascination of the cottontail question all at once there was only one answer to make if you cant see that you must be blind he said and there was a note of sincerity in his voice which gave pennyrose pause her laughter died if it were this easy wheres your engagement ring someone asked and she put up her hand to display a family heirloom that rightly took the presss attention giving them both muchneeded breathing space things were moving way way too fast and it was some rock pennyrose thought gazing down at her ring alastair had only produced it this morning and she wasnt accustomed to its weight on her finger its weight wasnt insignificant pity it wasnt granite what had alastair had once said i never thought id be wining and dining a woman whod look at rock and gasp she looked up and found his eyes on hersand she knew he realised exactly what she was thinking laughter sprang between them and something else wheres your dog a voice called breaking the moment which was just as well because neither of them knew where the moment had been leading into unknown territory she broke from alastairs gaze to see the cameraman from paris beaming at her from across the room wheres the pup you found you mean her voice wasnt quite steady she adjusted it and tried again you mean leo leo the man said and his grin broadened i might have known youd call him something daft like that the rest of the press gallery were fascinated he was a stray the cameraman explained to the room in general maybe he was giving away a scoop but it was he and only he who had the pictures from paris generating interest would do no harm at all the lady rescued him that had everyone enthralledas did the looks that were being exchanged between alastair and pennyrose a love story and a rescued dog well well this then was the humaninterest story theyd craved readers didnt want to hear about a marriage of convenience readers wanted romanceand amazingly it seemed as if it was romance they were being given can we see your dog pennyrose raised her eyebrows at alastair and he gave an imperceptible nod anything to get the spotlight off them his eyes told her she knew exactly how he felt no flashlights then she said sternly and escaped leowards is it true miss oshea is a stonewaller she heard as she left the room of course it is alastair replied its an unusual occupation but you have to agree that miss oshea is an unusual woman youve never met anyone like her why do you think im marrying her was the last thing she heard as she fled with leo in her arms she managed to regain her composuresort of isnt he gorgeous she demanded of the room full of cynical casehardened reporters leo was cleanalmostbut he was bandaged hed lost a heap of hair one ear was torn and his rib cage protruded for all to see but pennyrose had decreed he was gorgeous and there wasnt a person there who would have disagreed do you like the dog too someone rounded on alastair and he managed a grin the dog oh right the dog hed been looking at the lady i like the dog but he was still looking at the lady this is seeming more and more like a love match someone whispered this was suddenly a very different marriage to the one the press had expected pennyrose sat by alastairs side and fielded questions with aplombwithout the least hint of shyness and uncertainty and she glowed nestled on her lap her disreputable pup wagged his tail and licked her face then shifted to lick alastairs face in turn alastair pushed the shaggy face away but it was a very halfhearted push he likes it a reporter whispered to a colleague hell we have headlines another said a royal romance followed by a royal marriage her colleague agreed all at once i cant wait there was one more question to ask a reporter had checked his notes it says here that your name is penelope he said to pennyrose but youve been introduced as rose will you be princess penelope no alastair butted in before she could get a word out shell be princess rose princess rose pennyrose looked at him with eyes that were suddenly bright with unshed tears princess rose it might be too darned formalbut in that one unguarded moment hed spoken her name almost as if he loved her have you seen the newspapers belles voice woke alastair from sleep hed spent the night on interminable paperwork and just before dawn hed fallen into a troubled sleep where rose and leo had mingled with uncertain duty an hour later the phone had rung how could you humiliate me like this belles voice was as shrill as hed ever heard it our friends know this is a marriage of convenience but this she took a deep breath this is disgusting whats disgusting alastairs heart sank uhoh every newspaper has these headlines royal wedding prince finds his cinderella she seemed to be sorting newspapers as she spoke and he could hear as she tossed them aside theyre dreadful you knew this was going to happen alastair ventured still not sure what the problem was it was a mutual decision to do this yes but i didnt know this would happen alastair these pictures youre sitting on the pavement in paris shes cuddling a dog and youre hugging her and there are knickers and bras lying everywhere and some sort of nightgown that only a slut hey hang on but he was in trouble he knew it you look as if you love her and there was the nub of the matter alastair closed his eyes exhaustion washing over him in waves i dont love her he told belle making his voice as firm as he could she was nearly hit by a car the dog was hit they were distressed and shaken i carried both of them off the road and and you were stupid enough to be photographed silence alastair thought that through and he didnt like it he didnt respond and after a moment of silence belle decided that maybe shed gone too far are you still there im here he let the weariness creep into his voice and she heard that too he could hear her rethink she was playing for a major prize here it might be wise to draw back then can i tell my friends it was an accident that you were playing the hero for a momentnothing more i hope you dont tell your friends anything he retorted belle you know how much is at stake the marriage has to seem like its permanent the silence was from belles end now i hate it she said at last and alastair nodded so did he didnt he but belle if we back out now well lose everything she was still focussed on that ultimate prize he realised and it was giving her pause i dont want that so what do you want me to do act formally she ordered these photos make you look ridiculous like a schoolboy with a crush ill see what i can do he told her and then he said his goodbyesas formally as she intended that he act when rose was aroundand he tried for sleep again it didnt work formal formal and rose didnt make sense formal and belle made sense but he wasnt marrying belle he was marrying rose the thought suddenly made the thought of sleep impossible the next few weeks passed in a blur there was so much to be done marguerite came down with influenza and retired to bed it must be from too much excitement she told her son and alastair thought of how much effort his mother had gone to in the past couple of months and felt guilty to the core he couldnt load her with anything else pennyroses knowledge of what was needed for a royal wedding could be written on the palm of one hand the organisation therefore fell to alastair dredging up memories of relatives weddings in the past finally he located and reemployed the man whod acted as his uncles social secretary he was a godsend but he wasnt enough there were wedding organisers caterers state officialseveryone had to put their oar in almost the whole principality had to be invited and the production looked bigger than ben hur cant we just elope pennyrose asked as she saw the lists every night when she came in from her stonewalling there were more decisions to be made she did what she could but the look of exhaustion on alastairs face was making her feel dreadful its a state wedding alastair sighed and raked his hand through his hair to be honest i never imagined itd get so out of hand every politician every person with any clout any deserving localeveryone would be offended to their socks if not invited he gave a twisted smile its made use of the chapel unthinkable theres simply not room the big marquee has to come all the way from paris he shook his head at least he paused and she prodded him to continue at least at least ill only have to do this once he admitted belle and i will have a simple civil affair well bully for you and belle but she said it under her breath alastair was back concentrating on his lists she looked across the dining table at him for a long moment the man looked almost haggard and the urge to rise from the table and go to him was almost irresistible to touch him on the shoulders to massage the tension from his back and to ease the strain but she couldnt she wasnt wanted she was simply a name in the marriage ceremony she thought and any female would do his real wife would be belle the thought was almost unbearable and dinner was finished goodnight alastair she said softly but he didnt look up from his interminable lists he was blocking her out she pushed back her plate and quietly went back to her living quarters back to leo hes driving himself into the ground she told her little dog as well trying to make everyone happy with the wedding the estate managements a mess and hes also trying to keep his architectural projects going the things impossible but he had no choice the only thing he could give up was his architecture and he cant do that because thats what he is she continued an architect leo wagged his tail in agreement and she gave a rueful smile you understand hes an architect not a prince as pennyrose was a stonewallernot a princess so you and i keep to ourselves leo she murmured were not wanted im just a name on a marriage certificate for now pennyrose might have gone back to leo but her presence stayed on with the man she intended to marry an insistent consciousness that followed him everywhere he hadnt said goodnight hed been a bore but if hed looked up he might have saidhe would have said help me with this and shed have stayed and sat beside him and the smell of her would have permeated his consciousness even more and and he wouldnt have been able to keep it formal as he must so hed let her go back to her dog and hed gone back to his paperwork and his exhaustion and sense of confusion deepened by the hour he saw her again at breakfastbriefly they were curt with each other as formal as belle would have wanted then he saw her from a distance during the day it was strange how often his eyes strayed to where the new west wall was gradually taking shape because thered be his intended bride filthy and happy chipping away at stones with leo scrabbling in the dust beside her woman and dog were inseparable and alastair had to fight an almost irresistible urge to join them but keep it formal belle had demanded and it was the only sensible thing to do formality increased as the wedding grew closer it was the only safe barrier but unknown to alastair pennyrose was learning more and more about the castle and its workings and finally she had to break through alastairs barriers to use it henri has bunions she informed him as they sat down to dinner a week before the wedding marguerite was still keeping to her roomher flu had left her worryingly frailso alastair and pennyrose dined alone formally but for once pennyrose was breaking the ice you should do something about it she told him bunions alastair frowned henri did you say bunions i certainly did she attacked the last of her salmon with vigour and as the butler came in to clear the plates she beamed up at him that was great henri can you tell claude that we loved it certainly mselle cook will be delighted the elderly man beamed with a smile that left alastair in no doubt that rose was twisting his staff around her little finger henri was searching to please her now claude has made you something called lamingtons for dessert he told her he bought a book on australian cooking just to make you feel at home smiling the butler carried away his plates and rose turned back to alastair as if her point had been made see hes limping and its getting worse i hadnt noticed alastair confessed and she smiled her royal forgiveness if he could be regally formal then so could she no thats because youre busy but i did the servants talk to me so i can find out whats wrong hed noticed that often he heard laughter and itd be rose and the housekeeper or rose and a kitchen maid or rose and the gardener and more and more he felt shut out now as henri reappeared bearing a tray oflamingtons for heavens sake alastair directed his attention to his butlers feet sure enough the man was limping rose says you need time off to have your feet attended to he said ruefully why didnt you tell me im not a slavedriver i never thought you were henri said with dignity but if it was your workload were talking about i might agree you drive yourself too hard msieur i dont you do henri paused and then relented but if i may say so msieur its a pleasure to work with you youve been a breath of fresh air in the castle he beamed at the pair of them you and mselle rose especially mselle rose his smile said thank you pennyrose said faintly and henris beam widened its my pleasure so my bunions can stay as they are thank you very much he declared take time off with your wedding in a week no msieur tomorrow marie and i intend to attack the marital suite his eyes grew misty at the thought its forty years since your uncle brought his bride home that marriage didnt last butif i may say so that wedding was an arranged match not a match as this is going to be oh no and he limped back to the kitchens leaving them staring after him in astonishment he thinks its real alastair said and pennyrose concentrated on her lamington then i guess weve succeeded it took an effort but she didnt look at him have a lamington theyre delicious he took a bite of a chocolateandcoconutcovered square but his mind wasnt on his lamington what have you been telling them her eyes widened at that me what do you mean this is a marriage of convenience he said heavily i thought it was obvious but the staff dont believe it maybe they dont want to believe it she said gently the staff have had a rough time with the old princes failing health and then louis maybe theyre looking for stability that doesnt depend on a stable marriage of course not she lifted another lamington and took a bite then surveyed it with care i guess henry the eighth had quite a stable household henry the eighth the one with six wives she told him hey that was a bit much i only want two very moderate i call it she agreed equitably and theres been no suggestion at all of anyone getting their heads chopped off she chuckled across the table at him and it was all he could do not to drop his lamington hell things were getting seriously out of hand rose these lamingtons are great she enthused maybe we should honeymoon in australia so we can eat more i could introduce you to pavlovas and vegemite sandwiches and pie floaters pie floaters pies in pea soup she explained and he shuddered if you dont mind ill stick to our cuisine but that reminds me our honeymoon sorry the press are expecting us to honeymoon they can expect all they like i havent finished my wall oh for heavens sake his pentup emotions overflowed and he thumped the table rose will you take this seriously you dont want me to take it seriously i its a mock marriage she told him she rose and gave him a mock curtsey pardon me your serene highness but theres nothing serious about our marriage at all so im not going on a honeymoon anywhere sorry alastair but im going up to say goodnight to your mother then she flashed her infectious grin at him stop worrying go and design a mansion for someone and stop thinking of weddings youre getting paranoid and before he could stop her shed come around the table and kissed him very lightly on the top of his head it was a teasing kissperfunctory and lighthearted there was no reason at all for him to put a hand to his forehead and for him to leave his hand there for a good three minutes after shed left the room chapter eight i have a surprise for you marguerite told her it was four days before the wedding the castle was a hive of activity and with the invasion of so many strangers pennyrose had grudgingly conceded to stop her walling she was feeling like a pampered but caged pet but at least time with marguerite was productive the effects of her influenza were dragging on marguerite was wan and listless she spent most of her day in bed and she had everyone worried but she was still scheming ive had the most wonderful plan she told pennyrose for your honeymoon were not having a honeymoon pennyrose glanced up as alastair entered the room tell her alastair we dont want a honeymoon just a well motherinlaw thats all we want alastair crossed the room and gave his mother a kiss dr barnard was here earlier what did he say just more rest his mother sighed her exasperation you cant expect anything else at my age that makes you sound as if youre ninety instead of only just seventy pennyrose retorted she grinned madame beric says all you need is a good tonic she makes poor msieur beric drink some foul potion full of aniseed and all sorts of horrible herbs and spices that she swears will cure anything from warts to ingrown toenails do you want me to get you some i dont think so marguerite said faintly are you missing paris alastair demanded sitting down on her bed his mother had a lovely apartment near the seine shed dropped everything to come here when louis had died and she hadnt been home since youve been doing so much ive hardly done anything his mother cut in you have without your organisation this household would be a mess but you must miss your friends ill go back to paris after i see you safely married she told him and pennyrose gave her a strange look dont you want to go back to paris she asked feeling her way is that the problem i do you dont like it here i love it here marguerite confessed leo bored with sitting on the settee with his owner jumped down and nosed over to the bed he leapt onto the covers and curled into the crook of marguerites arm maybe we could buy you a pup to keep you company pennyrose suggested and marguerites face stilled i dont need a dog do you have many friends in paris alastair frowned was this any of roses business but marguerite was sighing preparing to open up to pennyrose as she never talked to him i only moved to paris after my husband died but i havei have a beautiful apartment belle decorated it for me oh great she could imagine a big elegant apartment modern and chic and sterile as hell but not company i dont know many people yet then move back here pennyrose said cheerfully decide to stay here permanently she cast a quick glance at alastair and saw she had his approval leo and i need company itd be great thatd be lovely dear but but marguerite looked at her son and then looked away itd be worse she said softly id stay for twelve months and then youd leave and belle would come and belle and i dontdont get along belle likes you alastair protested but marguerite shook her head belles a woman who cant share whereas pennyrose she smiled fondly at her future daughterinlaw pennyrose even shares her dog certainly if it means i can get a nights sleep without someone scratching his hindquarters in my face pennyrose grinned so yep im extraordinarily generous and willing to be more so stay with us no marguerite shook her head as soon as the weddings over ill return to paris if youre better alastair growled and she nodded ill be better for your wedding i must be her scheming look reappeared but speaking of weddings i was telling pennyrose when you came in i have a surprise i dont trust your surprises alastair said cautiously and his mother flashed him her most innocent of looks thats a dreadful thing to say as if id do anything you mightnt like his look of foreboding deepened what have you done its my wedding present to you both ive booked you a honeymoon a honeymoon alastair took a deep breath and looked sideways at rose were not going on a honeymoon of course you are his mother said turning businesslike everyone needs a honeymoon and youre looking grey with exhaustion isnt he pennyrose pennyrose could only agree yes but there you are marguerite beamed she agrees and ill bet pennyrose has never been on a decent holiday in her life have you dear no but youre not refusing to take your wife on a holiday marguerite demanded of her son especially as its already booked she shifted leo to retrieve a handful of pamphlets which had been lying on the coverlet these came with this mornings post dont they look wonderful pennyrose looked at what she was holding upand was caught koneata lau its the most beautiful resort in the world marguerite told her its part of fiji but its a tiny cluster of separate islands and you book your own island this is the one ive booked for you she opened a pamphlet to poster size and a vision of sparkling seas palm trees golden beaches and tiny thatched cottages caught pennyroses imagination like nothing else could have a beach ive never been to the beach pennyrose whispered before she could stop herself not properly not to swim not to stay youve never been to the beach asked marguerite in surprise none of us has she confessed we lived a hundred miles inland and there was never money or time for holidays she took a deep breath and pushed the thought away but no marguerite it looks gorgeous and thank you but no honeymoons arent for crazy marriages like ours she flashed an uncertain glance at alastair a honeymoon would be pushing him too far and too fast she thought she had every intention of trying to make this marriage work but this was a bit much besides theres leo she added as if that clinched it i couldnt leave him but marguerite had an answer for that henri and i will look after leo as if hes our own she said scratching a floppy and adoring ear the staff are besotted by this dog of yours they were too in the weeks since his arrival leo had crept around the collective castle hearts like a hairy worm but that wasnt the issue here the honeymoon was beaches palm trees a honeymoon with alastair it was a fantasy nothing more but it was some fantasy she had to get away from these brochures my sisters and brother will be here tomorrow she told them and she couldnt stop her voice from sounding a trifle desperate i can hardly get married and leave them to fend for themselves it wouldnt be fair you intend to entertain your siblings on your honeymoon marguerite was aghast this is their holiday pennyrose looked at alastair but his face gave nothing away this was up to her theythey work hard too and alastairs offer of a trip here is unbelievable she tilted her chin and ignored alastairs silence itll be fun showing them around you can hardly take your family sightseeing when youre just married marguerite said shaking her head beside her alastairs face didnt reveal one hint of what he was thinking and it was starting to make pennyrose nervous but she had to be firm for both of them she set her chin in a manner both alastair and his mother were starting to know alastair will have work to do and we dont intend to hang in each others pockets then she cast one more wistful glance at the posters one last look so no thank you very much but no she rose and managed a smile at both of them albeit a shaky one ill leave you to each others company ihave things to do only of course she didnt she just needed to get away from the strange expression on alastairs face it was an hour later that alastair found her strangely unsettled pennyrose had headed up to the battlements now she sat on the parapets hugging her knees and staring out over the countryside below thinking of beaches and hopeless marriages and alastair he found her there she hadnt heard him climb the stairs and for a moment he stood in the sunshine and watched her face as she stared out away from him she looked bleak he thought and why not shed spent her life denying herself and here she was denying herself again ive never been to the beach that one phrase had been enough to give him pause when shed left alastair had stood with his mother staring down at the pamphlets he had so much so would she hed told himself in a year she could afford to go to any beach she wanted buthe wouldnt be with her to see shed never been to the beach she asked for so little she wouldnt have entertained the idea of this marriage if it hadnt been for her family and the villagers he knew and the thought of her denying herself this was suddenly unbearable isnt there any way you can organise things and go his mother had asked at her most wistful and hed looked down at her with suspicion it had been her wheedling tone just because youre sick no dear just because pennyrose needs you she had hesitated you know the estates almost at the stage where itll run itself once youre married therell be funds for everything your new secretary knows the running of the place when the weddings over he can take over with ease and my architecture no ones indispensable shed said meekly and you only marry once mother sorry shed peeped a smile at him but thats what the world needs to think and theyll think it very odd if you dont honeymoon it would give pennyrose so much pleasure and ive already booked it her voice had faded but her expression had stayed wistful it had been more than a man could stand hed taken the pamphlets and had gone to find rose and now hed found her leo was sitting by her side his doleful expression matching hers the pup looked up at alastair as he appeared and the look of reproach he gave him was almost enough to make him laugh good grief youd have sworn the dog knew he crossed to where she was sitting rose she glanced up and then looked back out to the river fast im sorry she told him without looking up at him again i didnt know your mother was planning anything so dire as dire as a honeymoon he sat beside her archers had once waited up here for the vikings to sail up the river to loot and pillage it was hard to imagine anything so dreadful on a day like today the sun was warm on their faces and below them the river drifted dreamily on ive never been to the beach ive just been on the phone to koneata lau he said cancelling things for the life of her she couldnt keep the desolation out of her voice thats good no confirming them she swung around to face him disbelief and hope warring within disbelief won we cant we can hope flared again but died just as fast no its not possible if i can why cant you he ruffled leos shaggy ears and grinned the only problem that i can see is leo and ive fixed that henri is having his bunions attended to on the day after the wedding hell therefore have two weeks enforced rest during which hell watch daytime television with leo on his chest and madame henri will dice fillet steak for your pup every night alastair rose was half laughing half exasperated you know i cant its a gorgeous offer but but what my sisters and brother thats what i need to talk to you about alastair took her hands and pulled her to her feet which was maybe a mistake her breasts pressed against his chest and as his hands gripped hers the texture of her hands and the closeness of her body was doing something really strange but he didnt know what just tell her what you need to tell her and then get out of here he thought desperately now and somehow he made his voice work youre doing this for your family he told her marrying me but when you said ive never been to the beach i thought they wont have either and theyre probably just as deserving as you but shut up and listen rose he said kindly this is the plan your brother and sisters arrive tomorrow they can have a couple of days looking over the castle we marry on thursday and on friday the five of us get on a plane and head for fiji the press will think your family is going home koneata lau is renowned for its privacyphotographers are shot on sight the five of us can have a very good time the five of us all of us the very best honeymoons are crowded he said smiling what do you say oh alastair hed taken her breath away all her life shed wanted to give her family a holiday shed struggled but so had her siblings nothing was easy for a family as in debt as they were and to take them all to koneata lau pennyrose couldnt resist it not when it wasnt just for her but all sorts of possibilities were opening up before her your mother she whispered starryeyed alastair your mother could come too yeah and my butler could do with a break and bert and his team would build great sandcastles he grinned no then he relented actually i asked my mother but she refused shes probably right when she says that a long plane flight would be too much for her if only she were well well get her well after our honeymoon well pressure her to stay here and give her a real break but meanwhile the thing that could give her real pleasure is if we agree to her plan what do you say rose can i take youand all your familyon a honeymoon to die for oh alastair it was too much she looked up at him her eyes shining and suddenly before he knew what she was about shed stood on tiptoe to kiss him it had been intended as a kiss of gratitudenothing more but she was emotional close to tears and she let her featherlight kiss stay on his lips for just a fraction of a second too long because somehow it became not a featherlight kiss in fact featherlight suddenly didnt come near it beneath the surface a feeling of warmth and empathy had begun to flow between them a feeling as powerful as it was real theyd started this mad escapade as a business proposition what had passed between them over the last few weeks had made them friends and now it was shifting past that to something deeper it had already shifted for pennyroseshe knew what she was feelingbut alastair had no idea hed let her lips touch his and hed expected a soft brush of mouth against mouth nothing more what he received was an electric charge that nearly blew him away a surge of wanting engulfed him that was so powerfulso allengulfingthat his hands moved up instinctively to steady her as if she could somehow feel it too and be hurt by it so it was natural that his hands held hersteadied her and pulled her even closer into himand the linking of their lips forged an even stronger tie dear heaven the taste of her the feel of her hed never felt like this he thought dazedly it was as if her body were merging into his and there was a sweetness about her that he could hardly believe she was so innocent and she was lovely and she was his for the taking she was to be his wife for a whole minute he gave himself up to the exquisite sensation of savouring her touch of believing that something could come of this something magicalthat he could let himself love that in four days time he could marry this woman and take her to him and have her for ever that he could let this sensation run where it would letting it take its own sweet course and be damned with the consequences the kiss grew deeper neither could break the momentbreak the contact it was too precious too infinitely valuable it was as unexpected as it was magical msieur the voice came from below echoing up toward the open door of the battlements henri must have seen alastair come up and was calling for him msieur are you there with his feet it would have been agonising for the old butler to climb the spiral staircase but they heard the heavy tread as he started it was enough pennyrose broke away for one long moment alastair still held her his hands on her arms and his gaze locked on hers their eyes reflected mutual confusion mutual need but im coming henri alastair called halting the man before he could do himself any damage what is it your friend from paris is on the phone henri announced he didnt need to say more the staff hadnt taken to belle and henry used the same words and inflection every time she rang your friend from paris belle it had to be as usual her timing was impeccable they both knew who it was and the moment henri spoke it was as if belle had planted herself firmly between them alastair let his hands fall imim sorry he managed and pennyrose shook her head it needed only that an apology dont be i had no business to kiss you i never meant of course you didnt he looked at her uncertainly it was just i was worried about my mother and dont explain things to me alastair she said gently because he couldnt pennyrose had to let him off the hook he was confused and angry with himself she could see that hed broken his unwritten rule this hadnt been a kiss that could be forgotten it had been very much more pennyrose knew how much more but alastair would have to discover it for himself talk about avoidance if two people didnt want to see each other a castle was the perfect home and over the next twentyfour hours a lot of avoidance took place not deliberately of course never that but if pennyrose happened to be visiting marguerite and alastair decided to do the same hed hear her voice on the other side of the door and suddenly think of an urgent task down in the offices or there was a cow in trouble in the river pasture that he felt sure his farm manager needed a hand withand it just happened to be dinnertime when it happened or hed be eating his leftover dinner in the kitchen and hear henri and rose walking down the passage toward himand suddenly hed had enough to eat he was no longer hungry this was going to be some marriage if he couldnt face the girl keep it formal belle had said and he knew he had to do just that anything else was the way of madness he was not going to lose his head like a stupid schoolboy he was not exposing himself to the pain hed known when hed lost lissa and what hed felt for lissa seemed pale to how he could love no stupid thought keep it formal or keep away entirely for twelve months he could only try it was madness pennyrose thought bleakly to herself as she tried for sleep that night loving and marrying without being loved in return for the first time she let herself think what would happen if her loving didnt work what if nothing came of it but cold formality and divorce after twelve months i could go nuts she told leo seriously peculiarly nuts or maybe i am already maybe i was nuts to agree to this wedding and now a honeymoon but she wasnt backing out no way and money didnt enter the equation at all hes a dish but hes awfully formal twentyfour hours into their visit her siblings were ready to pronounce judgement why doesnt he lighten up a little hes a prince hes supposed to be formal pennyrose retorted and got howled down for her pains i suppose he wears a crown to bed it was heather ever the impertinent one she chuckled bouncing on her sisters gorgeous bed where theyd retired to gossip what does he wear to bed by the way gold pyjamas and then as pennyrose turned an interesting shade of pink her sister homed in like a bee to honey you mean you dont know her jaw dropped in amazement youre engaged to be married and you dont know what he wears to bed maybe he doesnt wear anything to bed elizabeth butted in and pennyrose sighed honestly her sisters were incorrigible do you two mind mikes here michaels sixteen years old and sixteenyearolds know more than you do heather retorted ill bet it was mikes turn to blush but still he grinned does he lighten up he persisted accompanying pennyrose alastair had met them off the plane hed been welcoming and pleasant but distant and as soon as theyd reached the castle hed excused himself saying rose needed time with her family theyd hardly seen him since hes busy pennyrose said he has a wedding to organise the day after tomorrow and its getting to him but the question stayed the same does he lighten up he does if you say so heather was fidgeting with her fingers finally she found the courage to say what needed to be said love youre not just doing this for the money are you forfor us if ever there was a time to admit that this was a marriage of convenience this was it but pennyrose gazed around at the anxious faces of her family and found she couldnt do it they were obligated to her enough she thought it wasnt fair to make the debt deeper stoopid why would i you would heather sounded seriously perturbed i know you would its been getting harder and harder for us all to stay at uni and the burdens been heaviest on you but i can leave i can defer for a couple of years youd never go back i would the odds are against it pennyrose spread her hands i love stonewalling and thats what im doing were all doing what we want soyoure going to be a doctor liz will be an architect and mike will be the worlds greatest engineer but heather was still threading her fingers not if it means youre making an unhappy marriage her chin lifted and her eyes met her sisters really they were very alike do you love him she asked directly and there was only one answer to that yes i do pennyrose said in a voice that left no room for doubt and how could she doubt marriage to alastair it was what she wanted even more than stonewalling but what was she being offered not a proper marriage a marriage of convenience of course i love him she said even more strongly and how can i want any more than that how indeed chapter nine and then there was the wedding it was a wedding that cinderellas fairy godmother would have approved of pennyrose thought dazedly because the magic wands were certainly out in force today shed seen the plans for the ceremony taking shape but until now everything had seemed a chaotic muddle but on her wedding morning she woke and looked out of her window to find the mass of canvas and poles and ropes had suddenly transformed themselves into the most beautiful marquee imaginable the thing was hugealmost as big as the ground floor of the castle it stretched over the river pasture part of it was built on a wooden platform over the river and there were royal pennants flying gaily from each pole the whole scene looked like something out of a mediaeval pageant and the sight made her catch her breath up until now this wedding had been all talk today it was very very real what on earth was she doing doubts crowded in from every side as she showered and left her bedroom help but who to turn to her siblings were nowhere to be foundthey only had three days in this magic place and they were making the most of them even leo had deserted her confused and aimless she wandered down to breakfast in a muddle of caterers and guests she didnt know then she headed outside here the sense of pageant was even stronger carriages were drawn up by the front gates and horses were being walked up and down in readiness the servants were in full livery in her jeans and tshirt pennyrose felt like someone whod wandered onto the wrong stage it was someone elses stage someone elses life not hers where was leo and where was alastair he must be as confused as she was she thought but hed absented himself deliberately maybe and maybe he should it was supposed to be unlucky to see the bride on her wedding day the way alastair was acting it seemed it was unlucky to see the bride at all but hed organised koneata lau theyd have their honeymoon when theyd have to see each other yeah itll be a really romantic honeymoonjust me and alastairand heather and liz and mike she murmured scooting around the edges of the marquee and trying hard to settle the sick feeling in the pit of her stomach think of the beach she told herself helplessly koneata lau it was something to look forward to it should have been just alastair and herself alone on a tropical island which would have been a waste she acknowledged because if alastair had his way theyd probably stay at opposite ends of the island it made sense to take the kids with them be contented with what you have girl she muttered to herself crossly today you have a truly royal wedding she looked around at the marquee with pennants flying the castle as backdrop the liveried servants the carriages and the horses a mediaeval wedding she continued for a year she kicked her toes against a rock and one corner of her mind registered that it had a very flat base and would make a great foundation stone for the wall she was building that was what she felt like doing she decided climbing back into her overalls and heading back to her stonewalling but i cant she told herself get back to your quarters woman turn yourself into a princess you have a prince to marry its magic heather declared as she bounced into the room an hour later pennyroses sister looked stunning in a tiny crimson suita minuscule leather skirt and matching jacket her entrance destroyed the mediaeval air in an instant heather gave her sister a resounding kiss and whirled to admire herself in the mirror thank you for not insisting on bridesmaids she told her stroking her leather with sheer joy i spent all my money on this and ill love it for ever my friends back home will die of envy pennyrose managed a smile its great wherewhere are the others wheres alastair shed meant to say but she couldnt elizabeths flirting with a distant cousin who says hes a count a count for heavens sake i could end up with a dynasty of royal relations and alastair and mike have taken leo for a walk by the river pennyrose took a deep breath she might have known her little brother was almost overwhelmed by all of this while her sisters thought it was exciting mike had been growing quieter and quieter and to take him for a walk had been pure kindness her alastair she thought was the very nicest prince a girl could ever marry she forced her voice to stay casual but emotion was threatening to overwhelm her theylltheyll be back on time of course theres hours to go heather plonked herself down on the bed and bounced this is the most gorgeous bed she bounced again and then focussed on her sisters face oh stop worrying alastair doesnt have to get his hair done like you do then she grinned thats what im here for the team are ready can i tell them to come up the team wait till you see what marguerite has in store for you heather giggled youll die of shock pennyrose didnt quite die of shock but she came close marguerite had decreed what was necessary and into her room came hairdresser manicurist beautician florist a fairy godmother would have been much simpler pennyrose thought dazed as it was she was twisted this way and that pampered and petted and turned into something shed never dreamed was possible and an hour later marguerite looking stunning herself in a blue silk suit which must have cost a fortune carried in the dress she had tried it on just once it had been taken away to be altered and now it appeared again in all its shimmering glory the rest of the entourage stood respectfully back the gown was slipped over her shoulders and there was a collective gasp from the entire room the gown was deceptively simple it was of made of smooth ivory silk with a scooped neckline tiny filigree sleeves and a bodice that showed every lovely curve beneath the bodice the gown clung revealingly to her hips then with a rope of rich ivory braid to delineate the skirt it flared out into fold upon fold sweeping to the floor at the front and drifting into a lovely rich train behind the skirt was so heavy alastairs grandmother hadnt skimped when shed had this dress made and the hidden folds made the gown flare and swirl like magic marguerite darted forward and threaded a tiny delicate diamond tiara on pennyroses head then the florist fixed a trace of lily of the valley into her mass of tumbling curls and the hairdresser tweaked the curls this way and that wanting just one curl to lie on the soft curve of her breast and that was that finished the effect was ethereal and i thought my leathers were fabulous heather breathed and it broke the ice there was a general chuckle the beautician made one final adjustment and marguerite stepped forward and took pennyroses hand are you ready to meet your husband my love pennyrose met marguerites eyes they were calm and steady and they knew exactly what they were asking and she drew in her breath marguerite knew i i think youre ready marguerite said softly oh my dear this is just what i always dreamed of marguerite now not another word her soontobemotherinlaw told her and patted her hand youll spoil your makeup or i might crack it she whispered and managed a smile but it was nonsense the beautician had had enough sense to leave her skin flawlessly natural youll knock your husbands socks off heather declared and pennyroses smile faltered she turned and took one last long look in the mirror the woman who looked back at her was a fairy princess shed been handed every weapon she could possibly need she thought the rest of it was up to her or how strong alastairs defences could be shed knock his socks off thats my intention she murmured ok alastair de castaliae prince alastair here i come ready or not theyd decided on no formal bridal party if you dont want bridesmaids i wont have groomsmen alastair had said its just as well theres no one close enough to be an obvious best man whoever i ask someone else is bound to be offended and it was ridiculous given pennyroses fierce independence that someone give her away so theyd decided that shed walk up the aisle by herself shed have no attendants and alastair would carry his own ring her sisters fussed around her as she arrived but with her train arranged beautifully to sweep down the aisle behind her they took themselves to the front row to watch her make her way to her bridegroom in solitary splendour and all at once solitary splendour felt very very lonely there must be a thousand people present she thought dazedly starting that long solemn walk as a lone trumpeter sounded and then she saw alastair he was dressed in a soft grey morning suitof courseand he looked magnificent the only touch of colour was a crimson rosebud in his lapel a rose the flower of love marguerite had chosen the flowers and pennyrose carried twelve matching buds in her bouquet the sight for some reason made her feel like weeping red roses for her wedding day it seemed almost a mockery but alastair was watching her and his eyes were calm and reassuring a tiny smile creased the corner of his mouth dear god he was soso so alastair there was no other way of describing him because that was who he was and she loved him so much that she felt she was close to breaking how could she do this she thought wildly she was marrying the man under false pretences alastair didnt want a wife who loved him to bits he didnt even really want a wife panic was suddenly close to overwhelming her and then she saw michael her baby brother alastairs promise that hed have no attendants had gone out the window michael had alastairs ring in his hand he was wearing a morning suit to match alastairs and the look on his face was as if hed been handed the world the sixteenyearold had flown halfway around the globe to be at his sisters wedding but until this moment hed been thoroughly confused by everything that was going on sixteenyearolds were insecure at the best of times unlike heather and liz hed hated this but now hed been handed a part to play and what a part best man and in his free handthe one that wasnt holding the ring for heavens sake mike was holding a leash he was holding leo the pup had been brushed to an inch of his life and hed never looked so splendid the scars on his side were almost healed but they were completely covered by a magnificent crimson doggy coat he wore a studded collar his lead was crimson suede and he beamed at the approaching bride and wagged his tail as if this entire ceremony was being put on for his benefit her brother and her dog alastair had done thisfor her she couldnt help it panic subsided and despite the aura of solemnitydespite the state officials and the hundreds of people shed never seen in her life despite the grandeur and the fussshe chuckled this would be ok she loved this man so much hed known how alone this ceremony would make her feel so hed done the two things that could ease her fears he was some prince and surely the only thing to do with a prince like this was to marry him and alastair watched his bride come toward him with a feeling in his chest that was almost as close to panic as hers what was he doing marrying this wasnt real he told himself it was a pretence it was a mock wedding made for the best of purposesto protect his tenants and to provide for their future in twelve months hed let this woman go and hed marry a sensible womana woman who suited his lifestyle belle but the thought of belle was suddenly very far away what was real was pennyrose no she was rose he told himself for some reason it was a distinction it was important to keep pennyrose was for those who loved her rose rose was to be his formal wife so it was rose who was walking toward him her eyes wide and her face determined despite her determination her steps were faltering she was fearful he thought damn it hadnt been fair to drag her into this into the goldfish bowl of royalty but she was so beautiful she took his breath away she was wearing his mothers dress a dress that would have been equally beautiful a hundred years ago she looked timeless and serene and incredibly lovely in fact she looked just as a princess should his princess for a year the time frame was suddenly gutwrenching but thenhe saw the exact moment she registered that mike and leo were by his side he saw the serenity and solemnity vanish along with the fear laughter flashed into her lovely eyes her lips twitched with pleasure and as she reached him he heard a low lovely chuckle oh alastair her laughing face was raised to his and he gazed down at her for a long long moment then he calmly took her hand and smiled back this was suddenly very very ok his princess her prince and while the world watched they turned together to be made one the wedding celebrations went on through the day and far into the night and what a night because the weather was perfect the sides of the marquee were raised so the dance floor was partly over the river and partly over the pasture the moon was brilliant the night was brilliant no one wanted to go home and everyone wished to dance with the bride she was passed from one partner to another and her feet barely had time to touch the ground alastair was free to do as he willed which was just what he wanted he told himself trying not to follow his new wife with his eyes she was dancing with one of his business partners now clasped around the waist in a manner that made him want to alastair he paused as he realised who was calling belle belles presence had been necessary here if only to allay gossip and there was no reason now that they shouldnt speak strange that it felt almost like a betrayal but belle didnt notice she looked very pleased with herself ive been talking to marguerite she announced she tells me youre taking roses family on your honeymoon thats a great idea itll take the pressure off he agreed still watching his wife twirling across the floor then he thought about what hed said why should there be any pressure belle was raising one elegant eyebrow pressure surely youre not worried that shell ravish you she wasnt worried at all rose was such an insignificant little thing her tone implied and alastair was forced to smile of course not i meanhaving other people to share the conversation itll help he received a blinding smile of sympathy shell bore you within a day belle agreed poor darling it wasnt fear of boredom that was worrying him he decided but if thats what belle thought maybe it was just as well i can cope this marriage is only for twelve months he reiterated and it was as if he was reassuring himself of course it is belle kissed him lightlya gesture that was as natural as any guest congratulating a bridegroomand then she stepped back their path was set and she for one was sure of the rightness of what they were doing secure your fortune and then were settled for life off and do your duty my darling just dont let the creature fall in love with you the creature belle hadnt meant it as it had sounded alastair decided as he succeeded in claiming and dancing with his lovely new wife but the description rankled it rankled for the rest of the evening she was not a creature she was his wife just for a year his hold grew imperceptibly tighter and his patience with other men wishing to claim her grew thin a year wasnt very long belles looking lovely she told him as the music slowed and he held her close she is he swirled her around and smiled down into her dancing eyes and sos the man you were just dancing with that had her startled whatlovely you might say that he wouldnt mind maurice is gay oh she choked on laughter are you sure no but if he insists on wearing a pink bowtie and matching braces he has to expect a suspicion or two she choked again what an ungentlemanly thing to say you sound almost jealous alastair de castaliae how could i be jealous how indeed when you have belle right where you want her right she was right he did have belle sort of but meanwhile he had his wife right where he wanted her in his arms they danced until dawn then as they bade farewell to the last stray guest alastair glanced at his weary bride and felt an almost overwhelming urge to pick her up and carry her back to his castle further back to the ready and waiting bridal chamber which was all very well but he wanted a change to their plans he wanted the door between them to be unlocked in days of old he could have done it he thought savagely if the prince were the real lord of the manor he could have claimed this woman for twelve monthsproperly taken herthen discarded her and taken another but he couldnt think of another he could only think of the woman by his side he absorbed the weariness on her lovely face the way her soft body yielded to his touch the fragrance of her the way she looked hed never seen a woman as lovely as his wife looked tonight his wife he was going nuts he thought he should stop thinking like this he must she was justrose there was no his wife about it not really this was a business arrangement and nothing else tired he managed and she chuckled how can you doubt it oh but alastair its been the most wonderful day a day to remember for ever and my gorgeous gown hasnt turned to rags yet she managed another chuckle the pumpkins have stayed at bay and i have twelve months to go before my midnight she did twelve months twelve whole months the thought was suddenly immensely cheering shed be with him until then working as he worked the thought of her work reminded him of something important i have a wedding gift for you he told her a wedding gift she gazed up at him in surprise theres no need youve given me enough not quite enough he smiled down at her i realise i dont know you very well so i asked bert what you most wanted and ive got you just that you asked bert then i cant imagine she said faintly shut your eyes the dawn was just starting to break the bride and groom had decided not to make a formal departure which left them now at the entrance to the marquee on the river bank and alone ill lead you he said softly and he took her hand in his trust me with all my heart she thought but she didnt say it she merely nodded and let herself be led her wedding gift was on the other side of the castle they made their way in the soft dawn light across the pastures of buttercups and poppies to where the new wall was being built the team had finished the most urgent repairs but there were miles of fencing yet to go a whole years worth of stonewalling pennyrose thought happily and then she saw alastairs gift it was a vast mound about six feet high and eight feet square it was wrapped in some sort of white parchment and a vast gold bow about three feet high adorned the whole thing what on earth its soap and a handtowel pennyrose said faintly and alastair grinned some soap nope bad guess try again a toaster then she giggled or a casserole her thoughts slipped sideways weve been given so much well have to keep careful notes and send everything back at the end of the year it was a bad thought it sobered them both but the parcel was still in front of them enticing in its mystery arent you going to open it alastair demanded i dont think i dare she was eyeing it as if it might bite it looks like it could be a rhinoceros he grinned damn you guessed she smiled but her smile was troubled alastair you neednt have done this it makes it seem makes it seem what it makes it seem almost a proper wedding she whispered and her words felt good to alastair he might only have her for a year but a year was better than nothing for heavens sake what was he thinking the current had caught him unawares and he was being swept along without realising it which was ridiculous he thought savagely hauling himself back to some sort of common sense hadnt he made himself a vow when lissa died had lissas death taught him nothing this was a marriage of convenience nothing more as was this gift to his wife it wasnt a proper gift it was only open it he said and she cast him an uncertain glance something had changed open it he growled and she took a deep breath ok keep it formal concentrate on the parcel and what a parcel she had to tug the vast ribbon until it floated free and after that she had to pull aside the parchment and inside were copestones she stood back in incredulity youve given me copestones bert said one of the reasons he employed you was that you were a copestone perfectionist alastair said trying not to sound too pleased with himself these stones had taken a lot of organising he also told me the main reason your hands are a mess is because you chip the damn things until theyre perfect but otherwise they dont look good pennyrose was lifting a single stone and staring at it in disbelief copestones were the stones used to top and weight her wall chosen and chipped well they made the wall look greatthe icing on the cake but it could take her almost half an hour to chip a stone to this shape and on this job bert had refused to give her the time theres too much to do we cant afford your standards here hed told her this is farmwork we have a job to do and we need to be economical shed agreed but she made them perfect anyway working into her lunchhours and evenings to get them right so her stones would still look magnificent in hundreds of years but they took so much effort and here they were already cut how she couldnt believe what she was seeing how i employed men off site alastair explained bert showed them what youve been doing and said we wanted more of the same they delivered them this morning as she replaced her stone he lifted her hands and fingered her rough skin so for the next year you can go on stonewalling all you like but the hardest bits done oh alastair it was berts idea it was no such thing she knew that much at least alastair must have thought of this all by himself she thought back to the day a couple of weeks ago when hed discovered her swearing over a gashed hand and a copestone that wouldnt cut as shed wanted it bert wouldnt have thought of this as a gift she managed a wavering smile not in a million years as a matter of fact i think one of our toasters is his it would be silence she carefully disengaged his hand for some reason it was suddenly important that she do so a thousand copestones she couldnt have thought of a better wedding gift if shed tried damn there was a tear trickling down her noseand then another one she wiped them fiercely away with the back of her hand and gave a very unromantic sniff which suddenly made alastair feel very romantic indeed this was unreal standing in the dawn light beside a mound of stones with a woman in bridal attire a woman who sniffed and tried to look fierce when he knew she wanted to burst into tears and the reason for those tears because here was a woman who thought a pile of copestones was the greatest present he put a hand out to touch her but she backed away as if she were scared of being scorched no no what his eyes were on hers dont you like my gift ii do but pennyrose knew what shed stepped back from she knew what was close to happening and she didnt want this man to kiss her not yet it wasnt right she didnt want to seduce him she thought frantically nor did she want him to make love to her because she was convenient she wanted him to fall in love with her as she loved him so intensely that she ached ii have a gift for you too she murmured softly and it brought him up short a gift you dont have any money he said before he could stop himself and she glared yeah well there are some things that can be gained without money like leo like our aristocratic dog he agreed a gift without price and then his brow creased and he grinned in mock dismay oh hell dont tell me another dog its nothing of the kind she said with dignity though if i find one with just the right pedigree to match leos thats right she was relaxing again now the moment of tension had passed sodo you want to see my gift of course i do he was fascinated it doesnt come in a velvet box either she told him and its not giftwrapped its no toaster rose theres no need to give me anything you brought the kids over for the wedding she said simply youve given me the earth so of course theres a need for a gift it took me a while to figure out what but i finally did what come and see once again they walked around the castle but this time south where pastures gave way to woodland here there was a small rise looking back over the castle to the cliffs and river plains beyond it was a place of absolute beauty pennyrose had found it one day when shed sought a quiet place to eat her lunch and shed been back again and again ever since and finally shed asked marguerite about it my husband loved the castle marguerite had said in a way he felt it was his ancestral home and lissas family couldnt bear for her to be buried alone theres a crypt for the royal family underneath the chapel but we thoughtitd be lovely if they were buried here so there were two simple gravestones nestled among the woodland and surrounded by flowers alastair planted them marguerite had told her all the flowers we both love wildflowers and roses and daffodils and tulips and honeysuckle and wisteria so itll be a mass of flowers all year round the only jarring note to pennyroses mind was the fence theyd erected a simple wire fence around the graves to keep the cattle out and it looked discordant in such a lovely place so shed fixed it alastair hadnt been here for weeks hed had so much on his plate he hadnt had time but now he saw what shed done before he reached the graves his steps slowed he walked up to the fence and he stopped and took it in it was the most beautiful fence hed seen in his life made of simple sandstone every stone was perfect the fence formed a tiny fold about ten feet square a croft where the graves were protected against the weather and against the cattle and the fence was built with such care and craftsmanship that the graves would be protected for a thousand years it was highfour feet or soso the sturdiest sheep couldnt climb over but there were throughstones forming a stile so one could enter and shed formed smootsnarrow slits in the stoneregularly spaced all the way along to let light in and so the woodland creatures can enjoy your garden she explained watching his face with some anxiety the first morning i walked up here i saw a litter of tiny rabbits munching on your buttercups and i thoughtif this was my grave thats what id want silence i can pull it down if you dont like it she whispered still anxious but it was the one thing i could do for you i know you loved your dad and you loved lissa and somehow this seemed right it did too it seemed perfect alastair climbed the stile without a word reaching the top he held out his hand after the briefest of hesitations pennyrose placed her hand in his and climbed the stile with him her wedding dress was lifted carefully over and then they were together in the fold around them wildflowers blossomed around masses of tulips wisteria had been carefully restrung against the stones as it was late spring it was losing its flowers so a carpet of soft blue petals lay everywhere and the wild roses were just starting to bloom the smell of the morning was with them the dew on the grass left a pungent fragrance where they walked and the two simple graves lay gently side by side like two friends as they had been marguerite had told her lissa had been almost a daughter to alastairs parents these were alastairs people and it was right that they be buried together thankthank you he said in a voice that wasnt too steady and this time it was he who badly wanted to sniff pennyrose heard it and managed a grin she was still feeling distinctly sniffy herself keep it practical not carrying a handkerchief she managed they gave me a buttonhole instead he smiled and plucked the crimson rose from his lapel as a handkerchief it makes a very poor substitute but here it is whats mine is yours it was a simple statementa jestbut it hung between them like the promise of the morning to come onlythe morning was already here wewed best get back to the castle pennyrose said uncertainly we have a plane to catch this afternoon and we havent had any sleep thats right but he couldnt keep his eyes from her we have a honeymoon to begin a holiday she corrected him you need to be really married to go on a honeymoon and were not really married she hitched her dress high this scene was threatening to run away with her and she wasnt ready alastair wasnt ready seduction wasnt her scene she was playing for keeps so she had to be practical somehow no alastair were not she told him she looked down at lissas grave and a tiny smile curved her lips i hope were becoming like you and lissagood friends but thats not a basis for a marriage lissa and i thought so well im not lissa she stepped up onto the stile and stayed on the fencetop for a moment looking down she looked immeasurably lovely dressed in her bridal finery with the dawn light behind her and the carpet of wildflowers at her feet im me im pennyrose the girl who married for money im your bride for a year but just for a year alastair de castaliae so lets not forget it the door between alastair and his new bride was firmly locked goodnight shed said sweetly as theyd arrived back at the castle shed stood on tiptoe to kiss him but it had been a fleeting kiss of farewellnothing more we only have eight hours till we catch our plane im off to get some beauty sleep and i suggest you do the same but how could he when every nerve in his body screamed that his bride was just on the other side of the door belle think of belle he told himself desperately hed promised to marry her that was the sort of marriage he wanted notnot what he could have with rose and what sort of marriage was the one he envisaged with rose if he allowed it to becomeproper it was the sort of marriage his mother had had he acknowledged because if he allowed himself to giveas rose gavethered be no holding back and if anything happened as it did as life had taught him it always did hed committed himself to lissa and it had ended in tragedy if something like that happened again hed go crazy he told himself fiercely but maybe he was going crazy already chapter ten taking the kids on their honeymoon didnt make it less romantic alastair decided a few days later it made it more so after initial polite protests the kids had agreed to accompany them they intended to have a great time but they also intended their sister to have a honeymoon to remember for ever which included romantic seclusion we want to spend time with you both pennyrose and alastair protested but their words fell on deaf ears well we dont want to spend time with you heather declared so this morning weve booked the catamarans one each were having lessons and the instructor can only take three so you guys will just have to find something else to do hmm i wonder what she threw them a cheeky grin and disappeared which left them alone again iill take a walk pennyrose said and alastair gazed at her in exasperation in three days she hadnt relaxed once and the island wasnt big enough to stay away from each other for ever can i come with you she appeared to give it serious thought as if she didnt really want to i if you like i do like of course he liked who wouldnt ok it might be unwise but in a simple sarong with her hair hanging free and her nose sporting a touch of sunburn she looked almost breathtakingly lovely what man could resist walking beside a woman like this especially when that woman was his wife in name only he had to keep reminding himself of that ever since theyd arrived theyd been treated as being very much in love and formality was harder and harder to maintain the sleeping arrangements were the hardest there were three guest cottages on the islandgorgeous thatched bures if alastair and pennyrose had done what theyd first planned and had the island to themselves they could have had a cottage each but liz and heather had taken one and michael another which left only the honeymoon suite the suite was gorgeous built right on the edge of the waves whenever they liked they could push back the folding walls so that sea air and moonlight drifted right into the room with them simple but beautifully built it was almost erotic in its design with one enormous bed taking up over half the room so the sensible plan had been to place a row of cushions down the middle of the bed it workedsort of but the trace of shadows under roses eyes told alastair that she was feeling the strain almost as much as he was she was so near and yet so far she was his wife she was his paid companion for a year he reminded himself harshly as they walked slowly along the sand nothing more he couldnt let her any closer than this otherwise when it ended hed go nuts did it have to end yes he told himself fiercely it must even if he was stupid enough to lose his heart there was belle to consider and it was just plain stupid to let himself lose his heart hadnt life taught him anything penny for them pennyrose asked and he lifted his head with surprise they were in the shallows barefooted and kicking their way through the foam alastair was wearing his bathing trunks and nothing else which was just as well any minute now he could end up swimming if things became too hot i beg your pardon he had trouble forcing his thoughts from where theyd been straying penny for your thoughts she repeated you look away with the fairies he managed a smile was i sorry i was thinking of belle pennyroses smile faded belle of course she was between them all the time you must miss her i yes thisll be hard on you both pennyrose admitted knowing how beautiful this is she brightened a little still the fact that my sisters and brother are here must make it easier for her i hell concentrate make yourself talk sensibly he told himself it does belle approves of the idea im glad but belle had called rose the creature alastair looked across at the creature in question the soft breeze was blowing her hair into a tumble of riotous curls the sun was warm on her face and she was lifting her nose to smell the sea isnt it gorgeous she breathed and he was forced to smile his agreement absolutely but he wasnt talking about what she was talking about maybe hed better head for the water but beside him pennyrose had paused far out in the bay just around the headland from where they were she could see three little catamarans her siblings were having a ball she watched for a while and then sighed and smiled i want to thank you she said seriously alastair what youre doing for us im doing it for me i dont think you are she said softly before he could stop her shed caught his hand and was tracing the strong lines below the wrist i think youre doing this for your tenants and for belle and for your motherand for me but maybe not for you im starting to know that you dont really want to be royalty being royalty cant hurt the feel of her hand was unnerving one part of him wanted to pull away the other part of him wanted to move in closer you dislike the publicity i yes itll get worse for a while because of our marriage i guess and the divorce at the endtherell be a heck of a fuss i can cope he shrugged a year was starting to seem a very long way away i wish i could make it easier for you the only way she could make things easier was to leave right now he was starting to feel as if he was being torn in two to have her so near come in for a swim he suggested and she kicked up some water with her toes i wish i could hed forgotten again she couldnt swim hed discovered it on the first day the others had somehow managed to learn but his wife hadnt been so fortunate in her tough childhood thered simply never been time and alastair hadnt found the courage to say what he most wanted to say that hed teach her because how could he teach her without touching her and how could he touch her without he hauled his hand away and grimaced ok you do your splashing bit and ill do my lap stuff which was fine he thought savagely as he stroked strongly in deep water this way he could put some of his unused physical energy to good use so far this holiday he must have swum for twenty miles or more every time things got too much for him he swam while rose enjoyed herself in the shallows did she enjoy herself of course she did he told himself shed never been to the beach it was a novelty the shallows were enough he was being mean but if he wasnt meanthat way led to disaster teaching her to swim letting her close alastair paused but as he did so a movement caught his eye entranced he trod water and watched out past the breakers where the waves were forming into massive rolling swells a pod of dolphins had come in to surf they were darting into the sapphire crests row upon row of themthere had to be thirtyusing the force of the waves to surf gloriously toward shore alastair was just far enough out to see they were past the sandbar which created the lagoon effect where alastair swam and rose paddled between sandbar and the beach the water sloped gently meaning he had to be a hundred yards from the beach before he could swim and that meant rose could hardly see the dolphins from where she was shed love them alastair watched the sea creatures for a moment longer and then he glanced back at rose she was lying full length in the shallows letting the foam trickle through her toes she was wearing a crimson bikini and nothing more she looked blissfully happy and very very lovely but the dolphins were a sight to be seen maybe once in a lifetime alastair thought desperately she should see them she couldnt see them from where she was not properly and there was a channel fifteen or twenty feet wide of deep water between shore and the sandbar that was where hed been swimming maybe shed trust him to tow her through the deep water to where the sandbar created a ledge he thought if she let him do that then they could both see to have him carry her through deep water when she couldnt swim shed have to trust him absolutely and suddenly there was no reason why not and every reason why rose he shouted and started over to where she lay come and see its magic and it was magic as was her trust she lay limply in his hold totally reliant on his strength as he carried her out to sea and he knew how reliant she must be the channel of deep water was maybe only fifteen feet wide but for a nonswimmer to trust that much was no mean feat kick your legs he said and felt her do just that her courage was immutable she was some lady but touching her towing her strongly alongside him in the deep water with his arm holding her close this was an indescribable sensation finally he felt the sandbar rise underneath him and he guided her feet so she could stand but then somehow he didntcouldntquite let her go after all he had to guide her so she was looking toward the dolphins and they were still near deep water so if she fell hed have to support her and she felt so good by his side so right but she seemed almost unaware of the man by her side she was totally focussed on the dolphins and why not for someone whod never been to the beach the creatures were entrancing they surfed and tumbled and dived swimming for the sheer exuberance of being alive time after time they darted into the waves streaming through the sapphire waters their bodies like glinting silver arrows and the joy they felt was almost a tangible thing theyre justtheyre just magic rose whispered and alastair could only agree it was magic the whole morning was magic this place the island the dolphins the sun on his face this woman and then as suddenly as theyd appeared the dolphins departed backing out of the waves and leaping and cresting along the shoreline around the headland and off to thrill the three younger ones on their catamarans do you think theyre paid by the island management pennyrose whispered her voice still awed and alastair managed a smile it was a wonder he could manage anything his body was doing very very strange things his head was also doing strange things but he had to force his voice to sound normal with the price were paying theyve probably been trained in miami he told her and then he laughed at the expression on her face nope they were the real thing lady totally wild and totally free giving us the performance of their lives just for their pleasure and ours she closed her eyes and he felt her take it all in the sheer loveliness of it the wonder and then she opened her eyes again and he saw that the real world had intruded she shifted away from himimperceptibly but it was a shift for all that take me back to shore she said simply thank you for bringing me out but its time my feet hit the ground you should be able to swim he growled and she nodded yes she couldnt quite keep the note of wistfulness from her voice but i cant so i need a tow and then you can get back to your swimming and all at once alastair couldnt bear it she asked for nothing he thought savagely she gave and gave and gave if he hadnt had a damned good reasonlike saving the tenants livelihoodsfor this marriage shed never have made it she wouldnt marry for profit she wouldnt do anything for profit he thought not for herself would you like to learn to swim he asked and it was as if someone else were doing the asking he hadnt meant to had he would i like i can teach you he smiled i taught lissa the name came up naturally with no strain at all lissa hed hardly talked about lissa since her death hed tried not to think of her but now the memories came flooding back of alastair as a tenyearold holding his sixyearold cousin under the tummy and yelling kick kick and lissa kicking so hard hed been bruised for weeks he grinned suddenly and it was as if a weight had been lifted that he hadnt known was there the grieving had shifted imperceptibly and the memories that remained were full of sunlight and laughter and love but not passion the passion he was learning about hadnt come into the equation he thought as pennyrose watched his face he and lissa had been such good friends that they hadnt wanted moreor simply hadnt known that more existed and shed been killed before theyd found out and now now he knew more existed because what he was feeling for the woman by his side was very very different hell but pennyrose was lifting her eyes to his and the expression on her face said she understood she couldnt understand how could she it was his imagination if you could teach lissa then you can teach me she said softly oh alastair id love it thus began one of the funniest most precious days of alastairs life all the rest of the morning they worked at it her trust was absolute and her faith paid dividends youll do deadmans float first he told her and made her lie face down in the water lie as flat as a board and dont let yourself put your head up until i touch your shoulders and she didnt he put his hand under the flatness of her stomach and held hersupporting her totallyand the feeling it gave him was spinetingling she lay still and trusting until he touched her shoulder then she gasped and spluttered and knelt up on the sand to laugh in sheer delight they did it again and again until she was almost floating by herself it feels wonderful it feels weird itll feel weirder this time im going to lower my hand and youll feel the water supporting you instead of me youll float and she did she floated as if shed done it since childhood and he gazed down at her beautiful bodyand almost forgot to touch her shoulder when he did she spluttered a whole lot more as she struggled to her feet he expected indignation but what he received instead was blazing joy i floated i floated all by myself i floated if i dont touch your shoulder you can decide to put your head up yourself he managed laughing with her joy but trying desperately to ignore the strange feelings coursing through his body pennyrose didnt understand why would i youll touch me when its time to surface i trust you he knew it the thought was incredible butif im eaten by a shark she grinned delirious with sun and surf and happiness then ill drown of a broken heart deadmansfloating to my doom what a princess people would say romeo and juliet would have nothing on a scenario like that he chuckled hey theres no need to go to extremes dying of devotion all of a sudden the lightness faded they were standing in the shallows looking at each other and her words hung between them ill drown of a broken heart and his dying of devotion the words had been said in jest but suddenly things werent light at all things were moving fast here changing every minute the magnetism between them was a tangible power it was gaining strength every second and to resist the pull how was he to sleep next to her tonight he asked himself desperately on the other side of the mound of pillows concentrate on practicalities speaking of lunch he said and her look of uncertainty faded she was starving and passion could maybe take a back seat it was a shame but where he led shed follow dont push the pace now youre talking i wonder if flakes on the menu you mean we get to eat shark before it eats us how very wise he managed a grin and glanced at his watch itll be on the table right now race you up to the dining room rose oshea its pennyrose de castaliae to you sir she said meekly and while he took that on board she gained so much of a head start that she beat him to lunch hands down and by nightfall she could swim not very far but she could manage half a dozen strokes before she had to surface and she was so proud of herself she was threatening to burst i can swim i can swim she crowed at dinner and her sisters and brother looked on with wonder you sound like a tenyearold i feel like a tenyearold except heather said slowly watching her sister with delight that when you were ten you sounded thirty she turned to alastair and her eyes shone with pleasure we cant tell you how much it means to usthat our pennyrose met you alastair smiled but inside he didnt smile at all their pleasure in this marriage made him feel like a traitor why hed paid for this he thought grimly hed paid money for a bride so why was he feeling like a rat because they were assuming he was doing this because he loved her he thought and he did no such thing in twelve months hed walk away back to belle belle would never come to dinner with sand on her nose bare toes and a makeupfree face that glowed with happiness he thought suddenly watching roses lovely laughing face it was just as well belle would be a sensible practical wife have some lobster pennyrose said and handed him a claw she seemed totally oblivious of his confusion this guys defending his territory even in death i cant get the meat out that made him grin she was in lobster up to her elbows and her enjoyment was obvious to all he thought back to the night shed eaten her first snail and he knew without asking that this was her first lobster allow me he cracked the shell with practised ease the long smooth sliver of meat slid free and then because he couldnt resist it he leaned forward and popped it between her lips she gazed up at him as the meat disappeared and and it was suddenly an incredibly sexy moment and behind them he heard heather snigger umexcuse me are we in the way no said pennyrose and blushed to the roots of her hair i thank you thats quite all right alastair tried for an unflustered voice but it didnt quite come off cracking lobsters is one of my splinter skills along with swimming lessons and he badly wanted to do it again pop a little more lobster between those lips in fact he wanted to desperately but rose was pushing her plate away decisively swimmings worse than stonewalling she said and her voice sounded even more flustered than he was feeling im going to bed but theres meringue for dessert mike couldnt believe that she could leave and pennyrose turned her attention gratefully to her younger brother im sure you wont have any trouble eating my share or alastair will help and then she caught the way alastair was looking at her ggoodnight and she fled which left alastair sitting with her sisters and brother who were all looking at him with an air of bright expectancy and he couldnt disappoint them could he i guess ill turn in too he said and they beamed their approval after all this was how honeymoons were supposed to proceed help but he left anyway how could he not because rose was waiting this bedroom arrangement was impossible when he got back to their cottage rose was already in the bathroom she was running a bath so there was nothing for alastair to do but to lie on the bed and listen to her wallowing in the vast white tub he could imagine her so vividly she might as well have left the door open he knew how it would be the bathroom was a tiny walled patio with three sheltered walls and the fourth side open to the sea the bathtub was sunk into the decking it had two soft headrests and it was designed so lovers could lie side by side they could soak in the warm water and watch the moon over the sea onlyone side would be empty alastair thought his side the other side would have rose rose he let his imagination wander lovely naked rose slippery with soap suds lying back letting the salt and sand wash away from her gorgeous body pennyrose lying alone in a bath built for two rose not pennyrose stop thinking like this youll go stark staring crazyif youre not already he said desperately to himself and took himself out for a walk where could he go if he walked around the cottage and down to their secluded cove hed be able to look up and see no damn he was turning into a peeping tom he strode deliberately back up to the management lodge where the kids were setting up a game of cards from the darkness he could see them out on the verandah laughing as they played some silly game of snap he couldnt go there what would he say can i play too your sisters taking a bath and its driving me nuts theyd think he was nuts they were such nice kids and they thought he was in love with their sister which was nonsense he wasnt in love with anyone but he was definitely in lust with her that was it hed found the answer only lust he just wanted her body he was as aroused as hed ever been in his life and the fact that she was a virgin bride she was his virgin bride she wasnt his anything and she had to stay a virgin he told himself desperately hell wasnt that why hed married her because he didnt want commitment so it had to stay that way the last thing he wanted was to make it hard for her to walk away but was he sure about what he wanted he knew what he didnt want he didnt want commitment in fact he didnt want marriage hed agreed to marry belle because his mother had wanted grandchildren hed quite liked the idea of kids hed needed a hostess and the whole thing had been sensible that was a decent basis for a marriage sense not lust so he should walk right back to his cottage settle down on the far side of the pile of cushions and go straight to sleep buthe just might take a cold shower first a cold shower didnt help alastair returned to the cottage to find rose glowing from the warmth of the bath she was wearing one of those damned lingerietype nightdresses shed bought in paris and she was curled into her half of the bed with the sheet drawn up to her waist the sheet wasnt drawn up far enough the nightgown was cut low over her lovely curving breasts her curls were sprayed out over the pillowand it was as much as he could do not to groan so he stood under the cold shower for a very long time when he emerged she was lying in the halfdark only his bedside light was on she was still awake smiling up at him in the dim light as he walked around to his side of the bed and heaven only knew how heavy his feet felt it was so darned hard to make himself walk around her this was crazy feeling better she whispered and he managed a nod yes thanks but hed lied its been the most gorgeous day she said sleepily as he slid down under the sheetstill on his side thank you alastair think nothing of it that sounded curt he forced himself to smile and then flicked off the light so he wouldnt need to hide his expression but he could still see the curves of her in the moonlight she was too damned close i enjoyed myself too youd never seen yourself as a swimming master extraordinaire theres a whole lot of things id never seen myself as he said bitterly a prince a swimming master a husband the kids think its real he burst out and there was surely the nub of the matter if no one thought it was real he wouldnt have to pretend it was the pretence that was driving him crazywasnt it they do she said softly do you mind i no only if you do he managed itll make it harder at the end of the year alastair lets worry about the end of the year at the end of the year for nowthis is the honeymoon of my dreams the holiday of my dreams ive learned to swim five strokes im here with my sisters and brotherand with you i couldnt be any happier if i tried he could be he could be a whole lot happier all he had to do was shift these damned cushions he had to stay formal somehow im glad youre having a good time im having a wonderful time and then before he knew what she was about she slipped her hand under the pillows and found his hand her fingers were warm and sure as she pulled his hand toward her and then she raised his hand to her lips and gently kissed his fingertips it was a gesture of thanks nothing more wasnt it this is magic she said softly a magic day a magic prince itll end he somehow managed to haul his hand away and it nearly tore him apart to do it his voice came out as a sort of strangled croak after all cinderella had her midnight to contend with your midnight is just taking a while longer to come i wont forget her voice was suddenly serious but she was still whispering into the dark the sensation was unutterably intimate alastair why are you so afraid of commitment im not you are he heard her smile in her voice youre just a great big chicken he drew in his breath how to answer that one with the truth id rather be a chicken than a squashed hen theres a brave prince she chuckled is that your royal creed he who fights and runs away lives to fight another day it has a whole lot going for it it was surreal lying in the dark talking to her as if nothing was between them only these damned cushions seriously though seriously what why dont you let yourself lovebelle because ive never been the least bit tempted to love belle he thought but he didnt say it whereas you but he had to give her a reasonable answer an answer he thought was the truth ive told you before i dont do love because you might get hurt her voice was carefully neutral because i will get hurt eventually or youor belle would nothing lasts for ever so shed forgotten to whisper her voice was curious now nothing more so when youre designing buildings youre planning on them lasting a thousand years she asked like your fences he smiled into the dark nope youre the master builder in that direction so how long would a building of yours laston average say he didnt understand what she was getting at id like to think a hundred years he shrugged but probably only forty maybe less but you still think its worthwhile building them damn hed walked straight into her trap and the cushions werent high enough buildings are different he managed i imagine they are she said softly different to relationships but in some ways theyre the same if they only last for forty years they can still be incredibly wonderful while they last she frowned then and he heard the frown in the dark he was starting to know her so well you lost lissa she said gently you said she was your best friend today you told me about teaching her to swim when you were kids if you had your time again would you choose not to have that time with her because she might die thats none of your business she was cutting too close to the bone here im just interested well stop being interested go to sleep ha that was a good one how could they possibly sleep i dont think youre being fair on bellethats all she was still probing right where it hurt most i think marriage is all about loving someone to bits like your fathers and mothers marriage thats not fair isnt it at least they took a chance she said and now she sounded angry at least they tried they didnt lock themselves up in some antiseptic world in case the big bad lovebug bit them so hard it hurt so yes they loved and yes it did hurt my mother made a bad marriage but she had four kids and she had a life and she loved my dad to bits even if he was a loser she loved him and even when she knew she was dying i suspect she never regretted a thing apart from leaving you all we had her pennyrose said strongly we had her for enough time to love her and be proud to be her kids even michael has the stories we tell about her and the knowledge that he was loved you think wed abandon that love or not embrace it in the first place because we knew shed die if you do then you dont know what way your head is screwed on alastair de castaliae oh for heavens sake theres no for heavens sake about it you loved lissa you should try loving belle i cant love belle there hed said it it hung between them almost as big a barrier as the cushions then dont marry her im married to you no youre not she said reasonably you cant be married to someone when theres two feet of cushions between them that someone refuses to be married on that basis this is pretend alastair i yes but you and belle arent pretending we dont need to he said exasperated its a business arrangement but she reflected on this for a moment youre not paying her no and youre intending to have kids maybe yes ill need an heir poor little heir she said softly i hope marguerite loves it enough for all of you ill love it no pennyrose shook her head and anger vibrated harshly in her voice how can you because thats commitment too thats risking your precious independence and you dont want that rose its pennyrose and what she said crossly can we go to sleep how can i go to sleep she demanded how can i sleep when ive had such a wonderful wonderful day and ive learned to swim and ive seen dolphins and im now lying in bed wide awake beside the most gorgeous man ive ever met andand you expect me to sleep silence hell she was feeling the same as he was i you took a cold shower she said carefully i know the bathroom didnt steam you think my bath was hot rose this is impossible she snapped cold showers arent all theyre cracked up to be im going nuts and theres twelve months to go youd better take me home to your castle and dig a few moats right through the middle of the castle and fill the moats with alligatorswith you on one side and me on the other because this years getting out of hand already alastair tried reason rose if were sensible and that was enough for her she sat up and in the dim light he could see her eyes flashing with temper why the hell do we need to be sensible because because why a cushion tumbled toward her and she lifted it and hurled it to the other side of the room stupid cushion rose dont rose me she was so angry she was almost spitting ok heres the truth i didnt want to do thisi didnt want to tell youbut its too much for me to hide and i cant go around like youan ostrich with my head in the sandfor twelve months i dont know what you mean but he did you cant feel this thing between us no liar the word hung in the air between them a threat the truth and then shed had enough she took a deep breath and she said what shed promised not to say whatever the outcome it had to be said i love you alastair de castaliae she said and her anger was all around them she was furious with him she was also furious with herself for betraying what she hadnt wanted to reveal but there was suddenly no choice he was so close and there were these stupid cushions another cushion went flying i love you she repeated i know its stupid stupid stupid stupid but you picked me up and rescued me from a life of poverty you took me to paris and fed me snails and cheeses and strawberries you bought me the sexiest knickers a girl could ever haveand then refused to look at them and you rescued me from traffic and you gave me the most gorgeous dog that was a good one the most gorgeous dog are we talking about leo here he asked cautiously and she glared and threw away another cushion she was tempted to whop him with it shut up she glowered just listen and then you take my little brother as your best man and you stand there in your gorgeous suit and you smile at me and you make those vows and you give me copestones for a wedding present damn a girl would have to be abnormal to ignore that and im not abnormal im truly madly deeply in love with you so there ive said it you can do with it what you like your serene stupid highness like it or lump it her breath caught on a sob and you neednt worry that it changes anything at the end of the year ill still walk away as i promised but for what its worth you should know what youre letting go you have a wife i might not be the wife you planned but im a wife all the same not a pretend wife alastair im a wife who loves you so much it hurts and whos given you her heart and who doesnt expect a single thing in return and she flung herself over onto her breast and buried her face in her remaining pillows and then she sat up again and swallowed the situation was impossible and somehow she had to strive for lightness except another swimming lesson tomorrow she managed while alastair stared at her in openmouthed amazement i do expect that you know this doesnt mean anything has to change but i thought you ought to know the factsand the facts are that im yours if you want me but if you dont want me then thats ok too as long as i get to swim tomorrow and that was the end of that she buried her head again and alastair sat staring down at her trying to figure out what the hell to say what was there to say he could think of exactly nothing chapter eleven alastair slept on the beach or rather he tossed and turned on the beach hed taken a spare blanket and gone down to the sand back in the cottage his wifes body had been rigid her breathing had been even and measured but hed known she hadnt been asleep and there would have been no sleep for either of them if hed stayed where he was so hed left and lay in the moonlight and listened to the waves gently lap the shoreand wondered what on earth he had done and where he could go from here back to rose his body screamed at him he had only to make the slightest move sheloved him nonsense that was impossible fantasy stuff hed let himself get too close he told himself and she was too alone in the world shed built him into something he couldnt be hed never pretended with her she knew him she knew what she wanted to know love itd fade romantic love ha buthis mother and father had been in love and their love had endured for over thirty years and then it had been shattered in one instant he remembered bitterly one drunken driver on a motorway and that love had been splintered into a thousand shards each one capable of hurting to death his mother had shrivelled since his fathers death and so had he lissa had accepted a ride from paris with alastairs father and the two had been wiped out in milliseconds love lost love found rose was back in their cottage waiting waiting for her husband all he had to do was take her he thought savagely it would be so easy to accept her love but he was incapable of giving that love in return because he knew that giving meant pain he couldnt he just couldnt expose himself to that sort of pain again no matter how desirable she was he couldnt take that last final step he couldnt depend on her for his sanity and he surely would depend on her if he let himself believe in her loving it would be so easy to lay his life in her sweet hands to love and lose that was the way of madness so he was better here under the stars for twelve months if necessary for however long it took for this strange marriage to run its course pennyrose came to find him just before dawn he was half awake half asleep and his dark form was a mere shadow on the sand she came flying down to the beach and almost fell over him as he reached up and steadied her she fell to her knees alastair and all of a sudden things had changed there was no hint of the passionor the angerof the night before there was only fear in her voice and the fear was raw and real what is it he was sitting up and she was kneeling still in the lovely negligee of last night her curls tumbled and wild and her eyes huge in the predawn light alastair just say it alastair its your mother marguerite had had a heart attack the call had come through to the resort and the manager had come to the cottage to break the news mymy husbands gone for a dawn walk pennyrose had managed just tell me whats wrong and ill find him so now she told alastair what the manager had told her marguerite went back to paris the day after we were married she explained gently but apparently shes had chest pains and theyve been growing worse finally she made an appointment to see her local doctor but by the time she reached him it was a fullstage heart attack shes in intensive care ill go alastair was rising and pennyrose was right there with him ill come with you but alastair was no longer seeing her his thoughts were only on his mother ill find the manager and see how fast i can get back to paris getting back to paris was easier said than done the supply boat pulled into the island once a week bringing the guests from the mainland otherwise they came by helicopter and the hire choppers out of action the manager said apologetically by the time pennyrose and alastair reached his office hed already made enquiries on their behalf the engines being reconditioned im afraid its useless until thursday thats two days alastair took a deep breath you mean theres no way i can get off the island until then i can pay the boat the boat does the rounds of the islands itll take at least a day to get back here but if i could make a suggestion anything one of the outer islands is owned by a reclusive fisherman the manager gave a deprecating smile a rich reclusive fisherman hes somewhat of an eccentric he lives alone and doesnt socialise but he owns his own helicopter alastair frowned will he rent it out maybe but it only holds one passenger the manager cast an apologetic glance at pennyrose and while i might be able to persuade him to make a mercy dash for one i doubt hed take kindly to doing more thats fine its only me thats going but pennyrose flinched alastair i need to go with you theres no room he said briefly and no need either he didnt need her of course he didnt pennyroses face tightened but it was marguerite she was worried about wasnt it damn it she was worried about both of them and if anything happened to marguerite and she wasnt by alastairs side id still like to come im afraid you cant maam the resort manager apologised at least not straight away he lifted the telephone and looked enquiringly at alastair the plane from suva to europe leaves at nine this morning that means theres very little time if i make fast arrangements i can have you on it do it alastair growled he turned and found rose watching him she looked hell she looked like shed been kicked and like she was expecting to be kicked again the kids are booked back to australia on saturday he told her his voice gentling thats when the boat calls you cant cut it short you know this is the holiday theyve always dreamed of and so have you he couldnt resist then he put a hand out to trace the outline of her cheek and if it had been meant to comfort her then who could blame him if he took a modicum of comfort himself have a wonderful time come back when they leave you dont want me i dontneed you and that was that belle alastair it was early evening in paris alastair telephoned belles cellphone while he sat in the departure lounge at suva and she answered on the first ring there was a party of some sort in the background he could hear laughter and voices and the clink of glasses alastair what is it briefly he outlined what had happened and she was horrified oh alastair thats dreadful you poor darling he didnt want sympathy for himself that was the last thing he needed he wanted tangible help belle shes alone you know we have no family in paris and my only aunts in yorkshire and too frail to travel itll take me twentyfour hours to get there pleasecan you go to her visit her in hospital you mean yes he said gratefully belle i know its a lot to ask but could you stay with her until i get there i cant bear to think of her being alone of her being in pain of course ill go darling he heard her pause and speak an aside to someone in the background and then she came on the line again sorry about that damn clients just tell me what hospital shes in and as soon as my guests leave ill go not now alastair these are important clients he said something exceedingly rude about the clients she didnt appreciate it alastair theres no need to be coarse ill go as soon as i can and that was all he could do twenty minutes later the jet lifted off from the international airport and alastair was finally away the plane circled the islands underneath as it veered to face europe and alastair stared down at the turquoise sea and imagined his wife rose shed be practising her swimming he thought and wondered if shed have made it past five strokes by the next time he saw her she wouldand hed miss seeing her try the thought was suddenly almost unbearable he stared down into the water willing himself to see but it was too far away but he stayed looking for a very long time but pennyrose wasnt swimming as alastairs helicopter took off for the mainland she sat and watched until the sound had faded to nothing the seabirds had returned to reclaim the patch of beach where the helicopter had landed and the machine was far out of sight yet still she watched have a wonderful time hed said how could she do that when marguerite might be dying when anything could be happening on the other side of the world on her side of the world and that was the crux of it this wasnt her home and neither was australia home was where the heart was home was with alastair fiji los angeles london paris the journey was interminable each step seemed to take for ever and sleep was impossible by the time alastair reached the hospital he was past the point of rational thinking so much time had elapsed what if what if didnt bear thinking of at least belle was with her he thought again and again if the worst came to the worst his mother wouldnt be completely alone but thankfully the worst hadnt come to the worst shes had a mild heart attack the physician on duty saw the grey look of strain in his face and answered his overriding terror straight away shes still very much alive and she should be ok should he went straight to the nub of the matter why do you say should the physician gave him a smile that didnt quite reassure him the attack itself didnt cause longterm damage but weve had to operate one of her arteries has become too thin to allow safe passage of blood the way it was it was a miracle she hadnt had an attack earlier im sure shes been suffering angina for some time she wanted to wait until you arrived but we darent in fact shes in theatre right now the physicians voice gentled as she tried to ease his strain shes having whats called a coronary artery bypass and theres every reason to hope shell come through it with flying colours but alastairs eyes were searching the doctors face she mightnt your mother is seventy shes been ill and its a major operation theres always a chance that things wont go well she could die on the operating table yes the doctor said frankly there is that chance but theres every reason to hope that she wont i wish i could have been herebefore she went in we couldnt wait the physician told him im sorry alastair put his hands up and raked his hair then closed his eyes at least she had belle he opened his eyes again forcing himself to practicalities if his mother was in theatre there was nothing to do but find belle wheres she waiting belle myour friend as the doctor looked confused alastair explained further belle will be here somewhere i rang her he glanced at his watch twentyfour hours ago as far as i know theres been no one with your mother silence youre kidding ive spent a lot of time with your mother the physician told him ive been on duty in coronary care for the last twelve hours she gave a rueful smile weve had an epidemic of heart attacks and ive hardly had a break i would have seen anyone with your mother he couldnt believe it belle said shed come maybe shes been delayed the doctor said gently she too glanced at her watch her time with alastair was over it may well be a couple of hours before your mothers out of theatre can i show you where you can wait or would you prefer to find yourself a hotel freshen up and come back when the surgerys finished ill wait alastair said grimly of course ill wait he waited for four hours the surgery went on for ever and alastair paced the waiting room as if somehow expending energy could help it didnt there are complications the physician popped in to find him before she finally went off duty im sorry but its taking longer than expected but theres still no need to panic she reassured him not yet its just been a more extensive repair job than they thought shell never make it alastair groaned and the doctor looked at him and then pushed him gently into a chair sit she ordered ill ask the staff to bring you sandwiches and coffee and then she paused is there anyone you want us to contact you mentioned a name before belle would you like her to be with you no and suddenly he was very sure of it and he was also sure who he really wanted to be by his side he wanted his pennyrose and he wanted her so badly it was as if his heart were as injured as his mothers belle arrived half an hour later breezing into the waiting room with her arms full of flowers as if she were there to visit a mother with a newborn babe she looked gorgeous chic and immaculate in a tiny black suit that must have cost a mint not a hair out of place her face immaculately made up here was every reason he had wanted to marry her alastair thought grimly she was indeed the perfect woman so why as she gave a cry of pleasure placed her flowers aside and rushed to put her arms around him did he feel nothing nothing at all it was as if she were some sort of plastic dollbeautiful but inside there was nothing she didnt notice his reaction oh alastair what a frightful time you must have had poor darling she kissed him lightly then pulled away and made a little moue with her lips darling you havent shaved he hadnt and he didnt give a damn has it taken twentyfour hours he said carefully for you to decide what to wear when visiting hospital she looked astounded im sorry where the hell have you been his pentup anxiety exploded in fury i asked you to come i needed someone to be here with her what have you been doing darling i knew you couldnt be here until now i asked you to see my mother not me she still looked astonished as if the idea of spending time with an old lady was preposterous i rang you rang of course i rang belle was defensive and angry in return she had never been one to take criticism lightly the nurse said she was as well as could be expected and due for surgery there wasnt any point in coming while she was busy having preop examinations and things i would have just had to sit in the room and wait right he was past anger now he was cold and drained and very very tired what a waste of time of course so when she went to theatre she had no one with her at all she had the staff its not the same belle he drew in an angry breath and he knew what he had to say she had no one with her who loved her its important i dont you dont love my mother of course you dont he nodded his weariness intensifying by the minute i should have thought of that im fond of marguerite she chided him gently alastair youre weary youre not thinking straight maybe i am he shook his head trying to clear the fog but truth was surrounding him fog or not he lifted the flowers from the table and handed them back to her love isimportant i hadnt realised it until now and we dont have it belle what we never have had it he said grimly and i want it i want it for my mother for my childrenand for me and i wont find it with you so he took a deep breath im sorry belle but there it is i organised my life like a business but its not like that since lissa died alastair i understand you dont he said bleakly after lissa died i thought i could do without love but that was because i didnt know what love was not true love lissa and i were the best of friends and her death hurt like hell maybe if wed married we would have ended up lovinglike its possible to love maybe we wouldnt all i know is that when i made my vow not to love i didnt have a clue what i was talking about i do now she still didnt get it darling youre overwrought im overwrought he agreed yes and maybe i should have been overwrought a long time ago take your flowers belle he told her im sorry if ive messed with the smooth running of your life but theres no future for us take your flowers and go she got it then her eyes narrowed in anger oh alastair for heavens sake if that little slut has pulled you in if youre talking about my wife id advise you to be very very careful he growled my wife is anything but a slut he took a deep breath my wife is my love marguerite came back from theatre two hours later and they still didnt know if shed make it she had tubes and machines hooked up everywhere and the sight of her pale face made alastair feel sick she arrested on the operating table the surgeon explained weve been very lucky to get her back but the repair work has been done if she pulls through the next few hours she should be fine so he sat glued to her bedside willing her to keep on breathing hour after hour staff came and went he hardly noticed all he saw was his mother all he thought about was his mother or maybe that wasnt quite true because at the back of his mind was an aching need for pennyrose why was he calling her pennyrose in his thoughts it was how hed first seen her he thought diminutive and workstained and determined clad in overalls ready to take on the world for her siblings as tough as old boots and tender to the core shed said she loved him hell he watched his mother but over and over through that dreadful night he thought of his wife and with the dawn marguerite opened her eyes and smiled alastair it was a faint whisper thready and weak but she was there conscious and alive her pleasure resonated in her voice whatwhat are you doing here i came to be with you but she thought that through you should be with your wife pennyrose it was so close to what hed been thinking that he was thrown off balance you know its just makebelieve pennyrose isnt my wife of course she is marguerite squeezed his hand with what little strength she had she loves you just like i loved your father she loves you even more than i love you so much and she closed her eyes and sleptand left him wondering finally he was persuaded to take a break marguerite was settled her breathing was deep and even and the doctor said she might well sleep for hours he was sure now that when she woke shed remember hed been here and the staff were smiling their reassurance and their pleasure shed live soa shave and a wash and a sleep were called for not necessarily in that order but maybe youd better see your friend before you go the charge nurse said and he frowned my friend shes in the main waiting room she says you wont want to see herthat were not to disturb youbut shes been waiting for some time now maybe seven or eight hours she looks as worried as you have been i was just about to send someone down to tell her your mother has every chance of recovering but if youd like to tell her yourself it didnt make sense belles been waiting is that her name she didnt say youll find her down the hall so he went down the halland in the waiting room was pennyrose for a moment he said nothingjust stood staring down at her as if he were seeing an apparition the waiting room was desertedno one but the most anxious of relatives would be here at this early hour so pennyrose had sat alone and her eyes had been glued to the door as shed waited when alastair appeared she looked up at him without saying a word her eyes were huge questioning and terrified and he realised with a stabbing certainty that she wasnt concerned about him not now unlike belle whod only come to the hospital when shed been sure of seeing alastair all pennyroses thoughts were with marguerite that was what she was searching for in his face marguerites fate and he looked haggard he knew and his face must give the worst of impressions but for the life of him he couldnt make himself smile all he could think of was that she was there she was his love the two thoughts crashed down on him with overwhelming force how could he have been so stupid as not to have seen it how could he have thought he couldnt love here she was miraculously here his wonderful wonderful bride his wife pennyrose his voice came out a haggard whisper and she came straight to the worst conclusion possible oh alastair alastair it was a whisper of distress and absolute desolate loss and she buried her head in her hands and closed her eyes oh no he couldnt bear it it took half a second to cross the room kneel before her and take those beloved hands in his to drag her fingers away from her teardrenched eyes and make her look at him no pennyrose no shes alive shes ok as she still looked at him with the remains of horror he finally made himself smile sweetheart i didnt mean to look dreadful its just because i havent shaved and havent slept but shes recovering theyve operated and theyve repaired the damage shes woken shes spoken to me and ive left her to sleep she stared up at him torn between disbelief and hope her eyes were vast pools of exhausted misery weariness had put her almost past hope but finally hope won you meanshell live yes youre sure as sure as i can be i wouldnt have left her otherwise oh alastair it was too much she put her arms around his neck buried her face in his shoulder and burst into tears he didnt let her stay there not for long anyway for maybe a minute he let her weep while wonder faded and her touch seeped into his soul she was real she was here she was his and he could wait no longer he put her back from him looked at her drowning face and smiled down into her eyes with a smile that held infinite tenderness infinite wonderand infinite love my pennyrose he said softly my love and his mouth found hers and he kissed her with a passion that threatened to last for ever it was a kiss that made a marriagea marriage that was from this moment forward how did you get here neither of them knew how long it took before words were possible between them but when they were everything that needed to be said somehow already had been the kiss had said it all pennyrose was in her husbands arms and it would take the strength of giants to tear her away how on earth did you do it magic she smiled and he chuckled i know more of the fairy godmother stuff but seriously seriously the resort manager realised how much i wanted to go so he contacted your recluse with the helicopter and used all his charm to persuade him to take me as well of course we didnt make it to suva in time for your flight so i caught a flight back to sydney then
