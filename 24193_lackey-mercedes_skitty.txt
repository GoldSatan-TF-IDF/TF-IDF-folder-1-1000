skitty the four skitty stories appeared in cat fantastic anthologies edited by andre norton im very very fond of skitty it might seem odd for a bird person to be fond of cats but i am so there it is i was actually a catperson before i was a birdmother and i do have two cats both siamesemix both rather old and very slow just if the other local cats poach too often at my bird feeders they can expect to get a surprise from the gardenhose nasty skitty complained in dicks head she wrapped herself a little closer around his shoulders and licked drops of oily fog from her fur with a faint mew of distaste smelly dick white had to agree the portside district of lacuun was pretty unsavory the dismal foggy weather made it look even worse shabby cheap and illused every building hereall twenty of themwas offworld design shoddy prefab mostly painted in shades of peeling grey and industrial green with garish neonbright holosigns that were thank the spirits of space mostly tuned down to faintly colored ghosts in the daytime there were six bars two gamblingjoints one chapel run by the neojesuits one flophouse run by the reformed salvation army five government buildings four stores and once place better left unnamed they had all sprung up like diseased fungus in the year since the planet and people of lacuun had been declared open for trade there was nothing native here for that you had to go outside the fence and to go outside the fence dick reminded himself you have to get permits signed by everybody and his dog cat corrected skitty okay okay he thought back with wry amusement everybody and his cat except they dont have cats here except on the ships skitty sniffed disdainfully fools she replied smoothing down an errant bit of damp fur with her tongue thus dismissing an entire culture that currently had most of the companies on their collective knees begging for trading concessions well weve seen about everything there is to see dick thought back at skitty reaching up to scratch her ears as she purred in contentment are you quite satisfied hunt now she countered hopefully no you cant hunt you know that very well this is a class four world you have to have permission from the local sapients to hunt and they havent given us permission to even sneeze outside the fence and inside the fence you are valuable merchandise subject to catnapping as you very well know i played shining knight for you once furball and i dont want to repeat the experience skitty sniffed again not love me love you too much pest dont want you ending up in the hold of some tramp freighter skitty turned up the volume on her purr and rearranged her coil on dicks shoulders until she resembled a lumpy black fur collar on his gray shipsuit when she left the shipand often when she was in the shipthat was skittys perch of choice dick had finally prevailed on the purser to put shoulderpads on all his shipsuitssometimes skitty got a little careless with her claws when man had gone to space cats had followed they were quickly proven to be a necessity for not only did mans old pests rats and mice accompany his tradethere seemed to be equivalent pests on every new world but the shipscats were considerably different from their earthbound ancestors the cold reality was that a spacer couldnt afford a pet that had to be cared forhe needed something closer to a partner hence skitty and her kind genetailored into something more than animals skitty was biotech type f forepaws like that of a raccoon more like stubby little hands than paws smooth short hair with no undercoat to shed and clog up airfilters hunter second to none middleear tuning so that she not only was not bothered by hyperspace shifts and freefall she actually enjoyed them and last but by no means least the enlarged head showing the boosting of her intelligence biotech released the shipscats for adoption when they reached about six months old when theyd not only been weaned but trained training included maneuvering in freefall use of the same sanitary facilities as the crew and emergency procedures skitty had her vacuum suit just like any other crew member a transparent hard plex ball rather like a tiny lifeslip with a simple panel of controls inside to seal and pressurize it she was positively paranoid about having it with her shed haul it along on its tether if need be so that it was always in the same compartment that she was dick respected her paranoia any good spacer would officially she was lady sundancer of greenfields greenfields being biotech station na in actuality she was skitty to the entire crew and only dick remembered her real name dick had signed on to the catseye company ship brightwing just after theyd retired their last shipscat to spend his final days with other creaky retirees from the spacetrade in the tau epsilon old spacers station as junior officer dick had been sent off to pick up the replacement sop was for a biotech technician to give you two or three candidates to choose amongin actuality dick hadnt had any choice lady sundancer had taken one look at him and launched herself like a little black rocket from the arms of the tech straight for him shed landed on his shoulders purring at the top of her lungs when they couldnt pry her off not without injuring her the choice became moot and dick was elevated to the position of designated handler for the first few days she was dick whites kittythe rest of his fellow crewmembers being vastly amused that she had so thoroughly attached herself to him after a time that was shortened first to dicks kitty and then to skitty which name finally stuck since telepathy was not one of the traits biotech was supposedly breeding and genesplicing for dick had been more than a little startled when shed started speaking to him and since none of the others ever mentioned hearing her he had long ago come to the conclusion that he was the only one who could he kept that a secret at the least should biotech come to hear of it it would mean losing her biotech would want to know where that particular mutation came from for fair pretty gamy he told erica makumba legal and security officer who was the current onwatch at the airlock the dusky woman lounged in her jumpseat with deceptive casualness both hands behind her curly headbut there was a stunbracelet on one wrist and erica just happened to be the brightwings current karate champ eyeah she replied with a grimace had a look out there last night talk about your lowclass dives im not real surprised the lacuun threw the fence up around it damn if id want that for neighbors hey we may be getting a break though invitations gone out to about three capns to come make tradetalk seems the lacuun got themselves a lawyer so much for the unsophisticated primitives dick laughed i thought tristar was riding for a fall taking that line erica grinned a former tristar employee she had no great love for her previous employer eyeah so lawyer goes and calls up the records on every company making bids goes over em with a finetooth seems only three of us came up clean us solarquest and uvn we got invites rest got byebyes be hearing a buncha ships clearing for space in the next few hours my heart bleeds dick replied any chance they can fight it ha didnt tell you who they got for their mouthpiece lan ventris dick whistled somebodys been looking out for them terran consul she was the scout that made first contact they wouldnt have anybody else adopted her into the ruling sept keep her at the palace nice lady shared a beer or three with her she likes these people obviously takes their welfare real personal nowyou want the quick lowdown on the invites dick leaned up against the bulkhead arms folded taking care not to disturb skitty say on one she held up a solemn finger venathats the consulsays that these folk have a long martial tradition theyre warriors and admire warriorsbut they admire honor and honesty even more the trappings of primitivism are there but its a veneer for considerable sophistication so whoever goes needs to walk a line between pride and honorable behavior that will be a lot like the old japanese courts of terra two they are very serious about religionthey give us a certain amount of leeway for being ignorant outlanders but if you transgress too far venas not sure what the penalties may be so you want to watch for signals bodylanguage from the priestcaste that could warn you that youre on dangerous ground threeand this is what may give us an edge over the other twothey are very big on their totem animals the sept totems are actually an important part of sept pride and the religion so the capn intends to make you and her highness there part of the delegation vena says that the lacuun intend to issue three contracts so were all gonna get one but the folks that impress them the most will be getting first choice if dick hadnt been leaning against the metal of the bulkhead he might well have staggered as most junior on the crew the likelihood that he was going to even go beyond the fence had been staggeringly lowbut that he would be included in the first trade delegation was mindmelting skitty caroled her own excitement all the way back to his cabin launching herself from his shoulder to land in her own little shockbunk bolted to the wall above his dick began digging through his catchall bin for his dressinsignia the halflidded topaz eye for catseye company the gold wings of the ships insignia that went beneath it the three tiny stars signifying the three missions hed been on so far he caught flickers of skittys private thoughts then thoughts of pleasure thoughts of nesting nesting oh no he spun around to meet her wide yellow eyes to see her treading out her shockbunk skitty he pled please dont tell me youre pregnant kittens she affirmed very pleased with herself you swore to me that you werent in heat when i let you out to hunt she gave the equivalent of a mental shrug i lie he sat heavily down on his own bunk all his earlier excitement evaporated biotech shipscats were supposed to be sterileabout one in a hundred werent and you had to sign an agreement with biotech that you wouldnt neuter yours if it proved out fertile they wanted the kittens wanted the results that came from outbreeding or you could sell the kittens to other ships yourself or keep them provided a biotech station wasnt within your ships current itinerary but of course only biotech would take them before they were six months old and trained that was the rub dick sighed skitty had already had one litter on himonly two but it had seemed like twentytwo there was this problem with kittens in a spaceship there was a period of time between when they were mobile and when they were about four months old that they had exactly two neurons in those cute fluffy little heads one neuron to keep the body moving at warp speed and one neuron to pick out the situation guaranteed to cause the most trouble everyone in the crew was willing to play with thembut no one was willing to keep them out of trouble and since skitty was dicks responsibility it was dick who got to clean up the messes and dick who got to fish the little fluffbrains out of the bridge console and dick who got to have the anachronistic litter pan in his cabin until skitty got her babies properly toilet trained securing a litter pan for freefall was not something he had wanted to have to do again ever how could you do this to me he asked skitty reproachfully she just curled her head over the edge of her bunk and trilled prettily he sighed too late to do anything about it now and you can see the carvings adorn every flat surface vena ferducci the small darkhaired woman who was the terran consul said waving her hand gracefully at the walls dick wanted to stand and gawk this was incredible the fence was actually an opaque forcefield and only one of the reasons the companies wanted to trade with the lacuunthough they did not have spaceflight there were certain applications of forcefield technologies they did have that seemed to be beyond the terrans abilities on the other side of the fence was literally another world these people built to last in limestone alabaster and marble in the wealthy district and in cast stone in the outer city the streets were carefully poured sections of concrete cleverly given stressjoints to avoid temperaturecracking and kept clean enough to eat from by a small army of streetsweepers no animals were allowed on the streets themselves except for housetrained pets the only vehicles permitted were single or doublebeing electric carts that could move no faster than a man could walk the lacuun dressed either in filmy silken robes or in more practical shorter versions of the same garments they were a handsome race upright bipeds skin tones in varying shades of browns and dark golds faces vaguely avian with a frill like an iguanas running from the base of the neck to a point between and just above the eyes as vena had pointed out every wall within sight was heavily carved the carvings all having to do with the lacuun religion most of the carvings were depictions of various processions or ceremonies and no two were exactly alike thats the harvestgladness vena said pointing as they walked to one elaborate wall that ran for yards its particularly appropriate for kladera he made all his money in agriculture most lacuun try to have something carved that reflects on their gratitude for favors granted i think i can guess that one the captain reginald singh said with a smile that showed startlingly white teeth in his dark face the carving he nodded to was a series of panels first a celebration involving a veritable kindergarten full of children then those childrennow sexdifferentiated and seen to be all femaleworshiping at the alter of a very fecundlooking lacuun female and finally the nowmaidens looking sweet and demure each holding various religious objects vena laughed her brown eyes sparkling with amusement no that one isnt hard theres a saying as fertile as gelvaderas wife every child was a female too that made it even better between the brideprices he got for the ones that wanted to wed and the officers price he got for the ones that went into the armed services gelvadera was a rich man his first daughter owns the house now ahthat brings up a question captain singh replied would you explain exactly who and what well be meeting i read the briefing but i still dont quite understand who fits in where with the government it will help if you think of it as a kind of unholy mating of the british parliamentary system and the medieval japanese shogunates vena replied youll be meeting with the kingthats the lacuarahis consort who has equal powers and represents the priesthoodthats the lacuteverasand his three advisors who are elected the advisors represent the military the bureaucracy and the economic sector the military advisor is always female all officers in the military are female because the lacuun believe that females will not seek glory for themselves and so will not issue reckless orders the other two can be either sex advisor is not altogether an accurate term to use for them the lacuara and lacuteveras rarely act counter to their advice dick was paying scant attention to this monologue hed already picked all this up from the faxes hed called out of the local library after hed read the briefing he was more interested in the carvings for there was something about them that puzzled him all of them featured strange little sixlegged creatures scampering about under the feet of the carved lacuun they were about the size of a large mouse and seemed to dick to be wearing very smug expressions though of course he was surely misinterpreting excuse me consul he said when vena had finished explaining the intricacies of lacuun government to captain singhs satisfaction i cant help wondering what those little lizardlike things are kreshta she said i would call them pests you dont see them out on the streets much but they are the reason the streets are kept so clean youll see them soon enough once we get inside theyre like mice only worse fast as lightningtheyll steal food right off your plate the lacuun either cant or wont get rid of them i cant tell you which when i asked about them once my host just rolled his eyes heavenward and said what translates to its the will of the gods inshallah captain singh asked very like that yes i cant tell if they tolerate the pests because it is the gods will that they must or if they tolerate them because the gods favor the little monsters inside the fence we have to close the government buildings down once a month seal them up and fumigate were just lucky they dont breed very fast hunt skitty asked hopefully from her perch on dicks shoulders no dick replied hastily just look dont hunt the cat was gaining startledand dick thought appreciativelooks from passersby just what is the status value of a totemic animal erica asked curiously its the fact that the animal can be tamed at all aside from a handful of domestic herbivores most animal life on lacuun has never been tamed to be able to take a carnivore and train it to the hand implies that the gods are with you in a very powerful way vena dimpled ill let you in on a big secret frankly lan and i preferred the record of the brightwing over the other two ships you seemed to be more sympathetic to the lacuun thats why we told you about the totemic animals and why we left you until last it wouldnt have worked without dick captain singh told her skitty has really bonded to him in a remarkable way i dont think this presentation would come off half so impressively if he had to keep her on a lead it wouldnt vena replied directing them around a corner at the end of a short street was a fifteen foot wallcarved of coursepierced by an arching entranceway the palace she said rather needlessly vena had been right the kreshta were everywhere dick could feel skitty trembling with the eagerness to hunt but she was managing to keep herself under control only the lashing of her tail betrayed her agitation he waited at parade rest trying not to give in to the temptation to stare as the captain and the negotiator grace vixen were presented to the five rulers of the lacuun in an elaborate ceremony that resembled a stately dance behind the low platform holding the five dignitaries in their iridescent robes were five soberly clad retainers each with one of the totemic animals dick could see now what vena had meant the handlers had their creatures under control but only barely there was something like a bird something resembling a small crocodile something like a snake but with six very tiny legs a creature vaguely catlike but with a feathery coat and a beast resembling a teddybear with scales none of the handlers was actually holding his beast except the birdhandler all of the animals were on short chains and all of them punctuated the ceremony with soft growls and hisses so skitty perched freely on dicks shoulders had drawn no few murmurs of awe from the crowd of lacuun in the audience hall the presentation glided to a conclusion and the lacuteveras whispered something to vena behind her fan with your permission captain the lacuteveras would like to know if your totemic beast is actually as tame as she appears she is the captain replied speaking directly to the consort and bowing exhibiting a charm that had crossed species barriers many times before this it worked its magic again the lacuteveras fluttered her fan and trilled something else at vena the audience of courtiers gasped would it be possible she asks for her to touch it skitty dick asked quickly knowing that she was getting the sense of what was going on from his thoughts nice the cat replied her attention momentarily distracted from the scurrying hints of movement that were all that could be seen of the kreshta nice lady feels good in head like dick feels good in head he thought startled i dont think that there will be any problem captain dirk murmured to singh deciding that he could worry about it later skitty seems to like the lacuun maybe they smell right skitty flowed down off his shoulder and into his arms as he stepped forward to present the cat to the lacuteveras he showed the lacuun the cats favorite spot to be scratched under the chin the long talons sported by all lacuun were admirably suited to the job of catscratching the lacuteveras reached forward with one lilactipped finger and hesitantly followed dicks example the audience hall was utterly silent as she did so as if the entire assemblage was holding its breath waiting for disaster to strike the courtiers gasped at her temerity when the cat stretched out her neckthen gasped again this time with delight as skittys rumbling purr became audible skittys eyes were almost completely closed in sensual delight dick glanced up to see that the lacuteveras amber slitpupiled eyes were widened with what he judged was an equal delight she let her other six fingers join the first tentative one beneath the cats chin such soft she said shyly in musicallyaccented standard such nice thank you high lady dick replied with a smile we think so verrry nice skitty seconded not headtalk like dick but feel good in head like dick nice lady have kitten soon too the lacuteveras took her hand away with some reluctance and signed that dick should return to his place skitty slid back up onto his shoulders and started to settle herself it was then that everything fell apart the next stage in the ceremony called for the rulers to take their seats in their five thrones and the captain vena and grace to assume theirs on stools before the thrones so that each party could present what it wanted out of a possible relationship but the lacuteveras her eyes still wistfully on skitty was not looking where she placed her hand and on the armrest of the throne was a kreshta frozen into an atypical immobility the lacuteveras put her handwith all of her weight on itright on top of the kreshta the evillooking thing squealed squirmed and bit her as hard as it could the lacuteveras cried out in painthe courtiers gasped the advisors made warding gesturesand skitty roused to sudden and protective rage at this attack by vermin on the nice lady who was with kittenleapt the kreshta saw her coming and blurred with speedbut it was not fast enough to evade skitty genetailored product of one of biotechs finest labs before it could cover even half of the distance between it and safety skitty had it there was a crunch audible all over the audience chamber and the ugly little thing was hanging limp from skittys jaws tail high in a silence that could have been cut up into bricks and used to build a wall she carried her prize to the feet of the injured one lacuun and laid it there fix him dick heard in his mind not hurt niceonewithkitten the lacuara stepped forward face rigid every muscle tense spirits of space dick thought steeling himself for the worst thats bloody well torn it but the lacuara instead of ordering the guards to seize the terrans went to one knee and picked up the brokenbacked kreshta as if it were a fine jewel then he brandished it over his head while the entire assemblage of lacuun burst into cheersand the terrans looked at one another in bewilderment skitty preened accepting the caresses of every lacuun that could reach her with the air of one to whom adulation is long due whenever an unfortunate kreshta happened to attempt to skitter by she would turn into a bolt of black lightning reenacting her kill to the redoubled applause of the lacuun vena was translating as fast as she could with the three advisors all speaking at once the lacuara was tenderly bandaging the hand of his consort but occasionally one or the other of them would put in a word too apparently theyve never been able to exterminate the kreshta the natural predators on them cant be domesticated and generally take pieces out of anyone trying traps and poisoned baits dont work because the kreshta wont take them the only thing theyve ever been able to do is what we were doing behind the fence close up the building and fumigate periodically and even that has problemsthe lacuteveras for instance is violently allergic to the residue left when the fumigation is done vena paused for breath i take it theyd like to have skitty around on a permanent basis the captain said with heavy irony spirits of space captainthey think skitty is a sign from the gods incarnate im not sure theyll let her leave dick heard that with alarmin a lot of ways skitty was the best friend he had to leave herthe thought wasnt bearable skitty whipped about with alarm when she picked up what he was thinking with an anguished yowl she scampered across the slippery stone floor and flung herself through the air to land on dicks shoulders there she clung howling her objections at the idea of being separated at top of her lungs what in captain singh exclaimed turning to see what could be screaming like a damned soul she doesnt want to leave me captain dick said defiantly and i dont think youre going to be able to get her off my shoulder without breaking her legs or tranking her captain singh looked stormy damn it then get a trank im afraid ill have to veto that one captain erica interrupted apologetically the contract with biotech clearly states that only the designated handlerand thats dickor a biotech representative can treat a shipscat and furthermore she continued halting the captain before he could interrupt it also states that to leave a shipscat without its designated handler will force biotech to refuse anymore shipscats to brightwing for as long as you are the captain now i dont want to sound like a troublemaker captain but i for one will flatly refuse to serve on a ship with no cat periodic vacuum purges to kill the vermin do not appeal to me well then ill order the boy to sir i am the brightwings legal advisori hate to say this but to order dick to ground is a clear violation of his contract he hasnt got enough hours spacing yet to qualify him for a ground position the lacuteveras had taken vena aside dick saw and was chattering at her at top speed waving her bandaged hand in the air captain singh she said turning away from the lacuun and tugging at his sleeve the lacuteveras has figured out that something you said or did is upsetting the cat and shes not very happy with that captain singh looked just about ready to swallow a bucket of heated nails spacer will you get that feline calmed down before they throw me in the local brig illtry sir come on old girlthey wont take you away erica and the nice lady wont let them he coaxed youre making the nice lady unhappy and that might hurt her kitten skitty subsided slowly but continued to cling to dicks shoulder as if he was the only rock in a flood not take dick erica wont let them nice erica a sudden thought occurred to him skittylove how long would it take before you had your new kittens trained to hunt she pondered the question from wean three heats she said finally about a year then from birth to full hunter captain i may have a solution for you i would be overjoyed to hear one the captain replied dryly skittys pregnant againim sorry sir i just found out today and i didnt have time to report itbut sir this is going to be to our advantage if the lacuun insisted we could handle the whole trade deal couldnt we erica and it should take something like a year to get everything negotiated and set up shouldnt it up to a year and a half standard yes she confirmed and basically whatever the lacuun want they get so far as the company is concerned once the kittens are a year old theyll be hunters just as good as skitty isso if you could see your way clear to doing all the set upand sortof wait around for us to get done rearing the kittens captain singh burst into laughter boy do you have any notion just how many credits handling the entire trade negotiations would put in brightwings account do you have any idea what that would do for my status no sir he admitted suffice it to say i could retire if i chose andspirits of spacekittens kittens we could legally sell to the lacuun i dont suppose you have any notion of how many kittens we can expect this time he sent an inquiring tendril of thought to skitty uhi think four sir four and they were offering us what for just her the captain asked vena a morethanconsiderable amount she said dryly exclusive contract on the forcefield applications how would they feel about bargaining for four to be turned over in about a year vena turned to the rulers and translated the excited answer she got left no doubts in anyones mind that the lacuun were overjoyed at the prospect basically captain youve just convinced the lacuun that you hung the moon wellwhy dont we settle down to a little serious negotiation hmm the captain said nobly refraining from rubbing his hands together with glee i think that all our problems for the future are about to be solved in one fell swoop get over here spacer you and that cat have just received a promotion to junior negotiator okay skitty asked anxiously yes love dick replied taking ericas place on a negotiators stool very okay
