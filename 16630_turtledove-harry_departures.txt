harry turtledove departures appear in chronological order starting in the early second century bc and ending about a thousand years from now rather more are science fiction than fantasy its hard to tell into which genre a couple of them can fall they are intended to amuse and with a little luck to provoke thought some of the notes talk about how they came to be written others about the ideas they examine one of the things that makes science fiction and fantasy the exciting fields they are is that they let a writer look at ideas from angles impossible to achieve in other genres i hope you enjoy these unusual angles counting potsherds our own civilization owes greece in the fifth century bc so much democracy the drama the liberation both of the examination of the natural world and of historical inquiry from the straitjacket of theology but before these things could flower greece had to succeed in repelling the invasion of the persian empire the mightiest state of the day this she did by a narrow margin but suppose greece had failed the ship clung close to land like a roach scuttling along a wall when at last the coast veered north and west the ship conformed steering oars squealing in their sockets and hennadyed wool sail billowing as it filled with wind to push the vessel onto its new course when the ship changed direction the eunuch mithredath summoned the captain to the starboard rail with a slight nod we draw near then agbaal mithredath asked his voice a nameless tone between tenor and contralto was cool precise and intelligent the phoenician captain bowed low the sun sparked off a silver hoop in his left earmy master we do agbaal pointed to the headland the ship had just rounded that is the cape of sounion if the wind holds we should be in peiraieus by eveninga day early he added slyly you will be rewarded if we are mithredath promised agbaal satisfied bowed again and after glancing at his important passenger for permission went back to overseeing his crew mithredath would have paid gold darics from his own purse to shorten the time he spent away from the royal court but there was no need for that he had come to this western backwater at the royal command and so could draw upon the treasury of khsrish king of kings as he required not for the first time he vowed that he would not stint the day was brilliantly clear mithredath could see a long way the only other ships visible were a couple of tiny fishing boats and a slow wallowing vessel probably full of wheat from egypt gulls mewed and squawked overhead mithredath tried to imagine what the narrow islandflecked sea had looked like during those great days four centuries before when the first khsrish the conqueror had led his huge fleet to the triumph that had subjected the western yauna to persia once and for all he could not he was not used enough to ships to picture hordes of them all moving together like so many sheep in a herd on its way to the marketplace of babylon that thought he realized with a wry nod showed him what he was most familiar with the baking but oh so fertile plain between the tigris and euphrates he also knew ektabana well the summer capital of the kings of kings nestled in the shade of mount aurvant though he had never suffered through a winter there but until this journey he had never thought to travel on the sea yet to his surprise mithredath was finding a strange sort of beauty here the water over which he sailed was a blue deep enough almost to be winepurple the sky another blue so different as to make him wonder how the same word could apply to both the land rising steeply from sea to sky was by turns rocky and bare and shaggy with greengray olive trees the combination was peculiar but somehow in its own way harmonious true to his promise agbaal brought mithredath to his destination with the sun still in the sky true to his the eunuch pressed a pair of goldpieces into the captains palm agbaal bowed almost double his swarthy face glowed with pride when mithredath offered him a cheek to kiss as if the two of them were near in rank the docks swarmed with the merchant folk of the western sea there were phoenicians like agbaal in turbans tunics and mantles italians wearing long white robes draped over one shoulder and of course there were many native yauna or as they called themselves hellenes milling about their slightly singsong speech was heard more than aramaic the empires common tongue understood everywhere from india to the edges of the gallic lands mithredaths rich brocaded robes the gold bracelets on his wrists and the piles of baggage his servants brought onto the docks drew toutsas a honey pot draws flies he thought sourly he picked a fellow whose aramaic had less of a hellenic hiss to it than most then said be so good as to lead me to the satraps palace of course my master the man said but his face fell he would still get his fee from mithredath but had just had his hopes dashed of collecting another from the innkeeper upon whom he would have foisted mithredath too bad mithredath thought he was used to babylons sensible grid of streets these small western towns had their narrow stinking lanes running every which way and sometimes abruptly petering out he was glad he had hired a guide anyone unfamiliar with these alleys could not have found his way through them though larger than its neighbors the satraps residencepalace mithredath discovered was far too grand a wordlooked like any other house hereabouts it presented a plain whitewashed front to the world mithredath sniffed to his way of thinking anyone who was someone should let the world know it he paid the guidewell enough to keep him from sneering but not extravagantlyand rapped on the door with his pomegranateheaded walking stick a moment later a guard opened the little eyelevel observation window to peer out at him who comes the fellow demanded fiercely mithredath stood where the man could see him clearly and answered not with the accented aramaic in which he had been challenged but in pure clear persian i am mithredath sarissomehow in his own tongue eunuch became almost a word of prideand servant to khsrish king of kings king of lands containing many men king in this great earth far and wide son of marduniya the king an achaemenid a persian son of a persian of aryan seed may ahura mazda smile upon him and make long his reign i am come to the satrapy of the yauna of the western mainland upon a mission given me from his own royal lips i would discuss this with your master the satrap vahauka he folded his arms across his chest and waited he did not wait long he heard a thump on the other side of the door and guessed the guard had dropped his spear in surprise mithredath did not smile years at the court of the king of kings had schooled him against revealing his thoughts to a dangerous world his face was perfectly composed when the guard flung the door wide and shouted enter servant of the king of kings the guard bowed low mithredath walked past him returning the courtesy with a bow barely more than a nod some people he thought deserved to be reminded from time to time of their station as he had intended more people in the satraps residence than the door guard heard his announcement a majordomo came rushing to greet him in the outer hall he wore the rectangular mantle of a hellene over persian trousers his bow mithredath returned in full he would be a power in this miniature court the majordomo said excellent saris he was a cautious one too mithredath thought again not smilinghis highness vahauka great satrap of the yauna of the western mainland now dines with the secretary with the ganzabara of the satrapy and with the general of the garrison he bids you join them if your long journey from the court of the king of kings may ahura mazda smile upon him and make long his reign has not left you too tired the gracious invitation honors me mithredath said i accept with pleasure he was glad to get the chance to meet the ganzabara so soon the financial official was the one who would have to meet his tablet of credit from the court come this way then the majordomo led mithredath out to the central courtyard where the satrap and his officers were dining here at last the eunuch felt himself among persians again for most of the courtyard was given over to a proper paradise a formal garden of roses tulips and other bright blooms their fragrance mingled with the odors of cookery made mithredaths nostrils twitch lord vahauka i present the saris mithredath servant of the king of kings the majordomo said loudly mithredath began to prostrate himself as he would have before khsrish but vahauka a lean graybearded persian of about fifty stopped him with a wave the satrap turned his head presenting his cheek to the eunuch my lord is gracious mithredath said as he stepped up to vahauka and let his lips brash the satraps beard we are both the king of kings servants how can our ranks greatly differ vahauka said his fellow diners nodded and murmured in agreement he went on mithredath i present you to my secretary rishikidina perfumed sweating babylonian in linen undertunic wool overtunic and short white cloakthe ganzabara hermipposa cleanshaven hellene who like the majordomo wore trousersand the general of this satrapy tadanmua persian with a nononsense look in his eyes dressed rather more plainly than suited his station mithredath kissed more cheeks after the satraps example his aides could hardly show the eunuch less favor the feel of hermippos face was strange only among his own kind was mithredath used to smooth skin against his lips not being the only beardless person present made him feel extraordinarily masculine he laughed at himself for the conceit here sit by me vahauka said when the introductions were done he shouted for his servants to bring mithredath food and wine refresh yourself when you have finished perhaps you will favor us by telling what business of the king of kings may ahura mazda smile upon him and make long his reign brings you to this far western land with pleasure my lord mithredath said then for some time he was busy with food and drink the wines were excellent the satrapy of the yauna of the western mainland was known for its grapes though grapes were one of the few things it was known for even in babylon the food pleased mithredath less vahauka might be used to salted olives but one was enough to last mithredath a lifetime servants lit torches as twilight gave way to darkness insects fluttered around the lights whose smoke was sweet with frankincense every so often a nightjar or bat would dive into view snatch a bug and vanish again the majordomo led in three flute girls wearing only wisps of filmy cloth vahauka sent them away saying our distinguished guests news will prove more interesting than their songs and dances which we have all seen and heard before and surely he will not miss them in any way mithredath glanced at the satrap from under lowered brows was that a sly dig at his condition if so vahauka was a fool which might account for his governing only this undistinguished satrapy eunuchs memories for slights were notoriously long and mithredath soon would be far closer to the ear of the king of kings again than vahauka could dream of coming for the moment of course mithredath remained the soul of courtesy as my lord wishes know then that i am come at the command of the king of kings may ahura mazda smile upon him and make long his reign to learn more of the deeds of his splendid forefather the first khsrish called the conqueror that those deeds may be celebrated once again and redound to the further glory of the present king of kings who proudly bears the same name a brief silence followed as the officials thought over what he had said vahauka asked this is your sole commission excellent saris it is my lord then we will be pleased to render you such assistance as we may be capable of the satrap said fulsomely his aides were quick to echo him mithredath heard the relief in their voices he knew why it was there no misdeed of theirs had come to the notice of the king of kings you want to learn how the first khsrish took hellas eh hermippos said mithredath almost failed to recognize the king of kings name in his mouth flavored by his native speech it came out sounding like xerxes the ganzabara went on the ruins of athens i suppose would be the best place for that aye indeed well said vahauka rishikidin and tadanmu all spoke at once mithredath smiled but only to himself how eager they were to get him out of their hair perhaps they or some of them were up to something about which khsrish should know still hermippos had a point as mithredath had learned in babylon preparing for this mission athens had led the western yauna in their fight against the conqueror the eunuch sighed having come so far already he supposed poking through rubble could not make things much worse hermippos said if you like excellent saris i will provide you with a secretary who reads and writes not only aramaic but also the hellenic tongue it is still often used here and in the ancient days of which you spoke would have been the only written language i suppose i accept with thanks mithredath said sincerely dipping his head hed picked up a few words of the tongue of the hellenes on his westward journey but it had never occurred to him that he might also need to learn the strange angular script the locals used he sighed again wishing he were home vahauka might have been peering into his thoughts tell us of the news of the court mithredath here in this distant land we learn of it but slowly and imperfectly nodding mithredath gave such gossip as he thought safe to give he had no intention of setting out all of khsrishs businessor his scandalsbefore these men he did not know he was though so circumspect that he blundered for after he was through tadanmu observed you have said nothing excellent saris of the king of kings cousin the great lord kurash i pray your pardon my lord i did not mention him because he has been seeing to his estates these past few months and hence is not currently in attendance upon the king of kings may ahura mazda smile upon him and make long his reign lord kurash is well though so far as i know and i have heard he has new sons by two of his younger wives and likely hiked up the midwifes skirts after she came away from each one of them to celebrate the news tadanmu chuckled kurashs prowess and his zeal in exercising it were notorious the general asked more of kurash mithredath declined to be drawn out and tadanmu subsided mithredath made a mental note all the same kurashs ambitions or rather the forestalling of them were the main reason the eunuch had come to the satrapy of the yauna of the western mainland new glory accruing to khsrish the conqueror would also reflect onto his namesake the present occupantunder ahura mazdaof the throne of the kings of kings mithredath drained his cup and held it out for more a servant hurried up to fill it the eunuch sipped rolled the wine around in his mouth so he could appreciate it fully and nodded in slow pleasure here was one reason anyhow to approve of this western venture he cherished such reasons he had not found many of them my lord mithredath looked around to see who the young hellene was addressing then realized with a start that the fellow was talking to him the ignorance of these provincials no lord i he said i am but a saris in the service of the king of kings he watched a flush rise under the young mans clear skin my apologies myexcellent saris the hellene said correcting himself you are called mithredath though are you not that is my name the eunuch admitted adding icily you have the advantage of me i believe the fellows flush grew deeper apologies again my name is polydoros i thought hermippos would have mentioned me if it please you i am to be your guide to the ruins of athens ah mithredath studied this polydoros with fresh interest but no his first impression had been accurate the fellow was well on the brash side of thirty wondering if the ganzabara was trying to palm some worthless relative off on him he said cautiously i had looked for an older man to be fluent in aramaic and the hellenic tongue both you mean polydoros said and mithredath found himself nodding the hellene explained its coming from a banking family that does it excellent saris most of the inland towns in this satrapy still cling to the old language for doing business so naturally ive had to learn to read and write it as well as speak it ah mithredath said again that made a certain amount of sense well see how things go then very good polydoros said what are your plans will you travel up to the ruins each day or had you planned actually to stay in athens just how far inland is it mithredath asked a parasang and a half maybe close to two hours walk each way in the little time id have in the ruins how could i hope to accomplish anything id sooner pitch a tent there and spend a much shorter while in a bit more discomfort that will let me return to the east all the sooner as you wish excellent saris after tomorrow i shall be at your service why not go tomorrow mithredath asked rather grumpily i can send my servants out at once to buy tent cloth and other necessities you pardon sir but as i said i am of a banking family tomorrow the monthly silver shipment from the laurion mines south of here will arrive and ill need to be present to help with weighing and assaying the metal the mines dont produce as they did when the great lode was found not long after hellas came under persia but there will still be close to a talent of silver forty or fifty pounds of it certainly do what you must of course mithredath said yielding to necessity ill look forward to seeing you morning after next then he bowed indicating that polydoros could go but the hellene did not depart immediately instead he stood with a faraway expression on his face looking through mithredath rather than at him the eunuch was growing annoyed when at last polydoros said dreamily i wonder how the conquest would have gone had the athenians stumbled onto that silver before khsrishs he pronounced it xerxes too campaign money buys the sinews of war a banker indeed mithredath thought scornfully money does not buy bravery he said perhaps not excellent saris but even the bravest man were he naked would fare badly against an armored warrior with a spear had athens been able to build ships to match the persian fleet the hellenes might not have fallen under the empires control mithredath snorted all the subject peoples have their reasons why they should have held off persia none did of course you are right excellent saris polydoros said politely wise enough to hide his true feelings whatever they were it was but a fancy of the moment he bowed till the day after tomorrow he hurried off i came to the proper decision mithredath lifted his soft felt cap from his head and used it to wipe sweat from his face i shouldnt care to have to make this journey coming and going each day as you say excellent saris with a broadbrimmed straw hat and thin short hellenic mantle polydoros was more comfortably dressed than mithredath but he was sweating too behind them the eunuchs servants and a donkey bore their burdens in stolid silence one of the servants led a sheep that kept trying to stop and nibble grass and shrubs something crunched under mithredaths shoe he looked down and saw a broken piece of pottery and close by it halfburied in weeds a chunk of brick a house stood here once he said he heard the surprise in his voice and felt foolish but knowing this wilderness had been a city was not the same as stumbling over its remains polydoros was more familiar with the site he pointed you can see a fragment of the old wall there among the olive trees had he noticed it mithredath would have taken it for a pile of rocks now that he looked closely though he saw they had been worked to fit together most of what used to be here i suppose has been carried off over the years polydoros said mithredath nodded stealing already worked stone would be easier for a peasant than working it himself polydoros pointed again to the top of one of the hillocks ahead more of the wall around the akropolis the citadel you would say in aramaicis left because its harder to get the rock down aye mithredath said pleased to find the hellene thinking along with him it was his turn to point that is the way up to thethe citadel at the last moment he decided against trying to echo the local word polydoros had used the hellene dipped his head a gesture mithredath had learned to equate with a nod of course it would have been an easier ramp to climb when it was kept clear of brush polydoros said dryly so it would the eunuchs heart was already beating fast he had endured more exertion on this western journey than ever before in his life still he had a job to do let us go up if that is the citadel the ruins there will be important ones and may tell me what i need to learn of athens as you say excellent saris on reaching the top of the akropolis mithredath felt a bit like a conqueror himself not only was the ancient ramp overgrown it was also gullied one of the eunuchs servants limped with a twisted ankle had the donkey stumbled into that hole it probably would have broken a leg mithredath was winded and even polydoros who seemed ready for anything was breathing hard rank grass and weeds also grew on the flat ground on top of the citadel between the stones of the wrecked wall and over the lower parts of the destroyed buildings the persians had sacked so long ago one of those buildings a large one had been unfinished when athens fell marble column drums thrust up from the undergrowth mithredath could still see scorch marks on them in front of those half columns stood a marble stele whose shape was familiar to the eunuchthere were many like it in babylonbut which did not belong with the ruins around it nor was the inscription carved onto that stele written in the local language but in aramaic and in the wedgeshaped characters the persians had once used and the native babylonians still sometimes employed a thrill ran through mithredath as he read the aramaic text khsrish king of kings declares you who may king hereafter of lies beware i khsrish king of kings having pulled down this city center of the rebel yauna decree that it shall remain wilderness forevermore you who may be king hereafter and obey these words may ahura mazda be your friend and may your seed be made numerous may ahura mazda make your days long may whatever you do be successful you who may be king hereafter if you see this stele and its words and follow them not may ahura mazda curse you and of your seed more may there not be and may ahura mazda pull down all you make as i khsrish king of kings have pulled down this city center of the rebel yauna a mighty lord khsrish the conqueror to have his decree obeyed down across the years mithredath said proud to be of the same persian race as the longago king of kings though of his own seed of course more there would never be mighty indeed polydoros said tonelessly mithredath looked at him sharply then relaxed polydoros was after all a hellene expecting him to be overjoyed before an inscription celebrating the defeat of his forefathers was too much to ask the eunuch rummaged in one of the packs on the donkeys back until he found a sheet of papyrus a reed pen and a bottle of ink he copied the aramaic portion of khsrishs inscription he presumed the persian text said the same thing but could not read it perhaps some magus with antiquarian leanings might still be able to perhaps not the present khsrish would care only about the aramaic of that the eunuch was certain he looked at what he had written he frowned and compared the papyrus to the text carved into the stele he had copied everything written there still something seemed to be missing perhaps polydoros could supply it he was a native of these parts mithredath turned to him tell me please good polydoros do you know the name of the king of athens whom khsrish the conqueror overcame the hellene frowned excellent saris i do not the last king of athens whose name i know is kodros and he is a man of legend from long before the time of xerxes i might have known this was going too smoothly mithredath sighed then he brightenedit was to learn such things after all that i came here he scratched his head he did not approve of loose ends but how is it you know of thiskodros you saidand not of the man who must have been athenss last king excellent saris polydoros said hesitantly in the legends of my people kodros is the last king of athens ridiculous mithredath snorted someone must rule is it not so this athens must have been an enemy worthy of khsrishs hatred for him to destroy it utterly and afterward curse it such an enemy will have had rulers and able ones to oppose the king of kings how can it have lacked them for all the time since the death of kodros did not one lead it all those years i cannot believe that nor i polydoros admitted very strange mithredath glanced over to the unhappy sheep his servants had urgedand draggedup the overgrown ramp here before khsrishs victory stele seems as good a spot as any to offer up the beast he drew the dagger that hung from his belt and cut a spray of leaves from a nearby bush he put the leaves in his cap they should be myrtle but any will do in a pinch polydoros watched mithredath lead the sheep over to the marble pillar and set the dagger against its neck just like that the hellene asked no altar no ritual fire no libation no flute players no grain sprinkled before you sacrifice the good god ahura mazda does not need them to hear my prayer polydoros shrugged our rites are different mithredath cut the sheeps throat as the beast kicked toward death he beseeched ahura mazda to help him succeed in his quest for knowledge with which to glorify the king of kings he was forbidden to pray for any more personal or private good but with this sacrifice had no need to do so in any case does your god require any of the flesh of you polydoros asked as the eunuch began the gory job of butchering the carcass and setting the disjointed pieces on a heap of soft greenery no it is mine to do with as i will a magus should pray over it but as none is here we shall have to make do is that garlic growing over there it will flavor the meat once its cooked polydoros licked his chops mithredath felt saliva flow into his own mouth he turned to a servant you can get a fire going now tishtrya what are you doing polydoros asked the next morning looking through the notes i made before i left babylon mithredath said here i knew there was something that would tell me who ruled here when the first khsrish came an old tablet says he led demos of athens into captivity who is this demos if kodros was the last king here demos isnt a who im afraid excellent saris but rather a what polydoros said whoever wrote your tablet wanted to celebrate the king of kings as you do but did not know the hellenic tongue well demos of athens simply means the people of athens oh mithredath sighed if you knew the trouble i had finding that he shuffled scraps of papyrus briefly looked happy then grew cautious againi also found something about boule of athens someone told me e was the feminine ending in your language so i took boule to be demos wife youre going to tell me thats wrong too though arent you polydoros dipped his head im sorry but i must excellent saris boule means council oh the eunuchs sigh was longer this time the people of athens the council of athenswhere is the king of athens he glared at polydoros as if the young banker were responsible for making that elusive monarch disappear then he sighed once more thats what i came here to find out i suppose where are we most likely to find whatever records or decrees this town kept before it came under the rule of the king of kings there are two likely places polydoros said after a visible pause for thought that made mithredath very much approve of him one is up here in the citadel the other would be down there he pointed north and west in the agora the citys marketplace anyone who came into the city from the countryside to do business would be able to read them there sensible mithredath said well cast about here for a while then and go down again later the fewer trips up and down that ramp i take the happier i shall be when polydoros agreed the eunuch turned to his servants tishtrya raga you will be able to help in this enterprise too all you need do is look for anything with writing on it and let me or polydoros know if you actually find something the servants nods were gloomy they had looked forward to relaxing while their master worked mithredath expected little from them but did not feel like having them sit idle he was surprised when a few minutes later one of them came trotting through the rubble and undergrowth waving excitedly to show he had found something what is it raga the eunuch asked words master carved on an old wall raga replied come see i shall mithredath said he and polydoros followed the servant back to where his companion was waiting tishtrya proudly pointed at the inscription the eunuchs hopes fell at once it was too short to be the kind of thing he was seeking he turned to polydoros what does it say kalos arkhias the hellene replied arkhias is beautiful its praise of a pretty boy excellent saris nothing more you could see the like chalked or scratched on half the walls in peiraieus nasty buggers tishtrya muttered under his breath in persian polydoros eyes went hard for a moment but he said nothing mithredath upbraided his servant at the same time he made a mental note that the hellene understood some persian the search resumed the citadel of athens was not a large place a man could easily walk the length of it in a quarter of an hour but how many such trips would he have to take across it mithredath wondered to make sure he missed nothing assuming of course he added to himself a moment later anything was there to be missed polydoros sat down in the narrow shade of an overthrown chunk of masonry and fanned himself with his straw hat he might have been thinking with mithredaths mind for he said this could take forever you know excellent saris yes was all mithredath cared to reply to that obvious truth we need to plan what to do then rather than simply wandering about up here the hellene went on mithredath nodded polydoros seemed to have a talent for straightforward thinking after more consideration polydoros said lets make a circuit of the wall first decrees often go up on the side of a wall so people can see them it is not the same in babylon it is mithredath agreed he and polydoros made their way back to the ramp up which they had come they walked north and east along the wall mithredaths heart beat faster when he saw letters scratched onto a stone but it was only another graffito extolling a youths beauty then when they were about halfway along the northern reach of the wall opposite the ruins of some manycolumned building polydoros suddenly pointed and exclaimed there by zeus thats what were after mithredaths eyes followed the hellenes finger the slab polydoros had spied was flatter and paler than the surrounding stones as they hurried toward it mithredath saw the slab was covered with letters in the angular script the hellenes used for their own language if this was someone praising a pretty boy hed been very longwinded what does it say the eunuch asked he fought against excitement for all he knew the inscription had been ancient when khsrish took athens let me see polydoros studied the letters so in his more ignorant way did mithredath he could see that the stone carving here was more regular than the scratchings his servants and he and polydoros had come upon before that in itself he suspected marked an official document well he asked impatiently he took out pen and ink and papyrus and got ready to transcribe the words polydoros was presumably rendering into aramaic this is part of what you seek i think the hellene said at last tell me then had he been a whole man mithredaths voice would have cracked as he was what he was it merely rose a little im about to here it seemed good to the council and to the people boule and demos again you see a plague on the council and people mithredath broke in who in ahura mazdas name was the king im coming to that i think let me go on with the tribe of antiokhis presiding leostratos serving as chairman hypsikhides as secretary the king mithredath shouted where is the name of the king it is not on the stone polydoros admitted he sounded puzzled mithredath for his part was about ready to grind his teeth polydoros continued this may be it aristeides proposed these things concerning the words of the prophetess of delphi and the persians let the athenians fortify the citadel with beams of wood as well as stone to meet the persians just as was bade by the prophetess let the council choose woodsmen and carpenters to do this and let them be paid from the public treasury let all this be done as quickly as possible xerxes already having come to asian sardis let there be good fortune to the people of athens read it over again mithredath said read it slowly so that i can be sure i have your yauna names correct not all hellenes are ionians polydoros said mithredath shrugged how these westerners chose to divide themselves was their business and he did not care one way or the other but khsrish back in babylon would think of them all as yauna and so in his report yauna they would be polydoros finished reading mithredaths pen stopped its scratching race across the sheet of papyrus the eunuch read what he had written he read it again is ah leostratos the ruler of athens then and this aristeides his minister or is aristeides the king the measure is his i gather so it would seem excellent saris polydoros said but our words for king are anax and more usually basileus neither of those is here no mithredath said morosely he mentally damned all the ancient athenians to ahriman and the house of the lie for confusing him so khsrish and his courtiers would not be pleased if mithredath had traveled so far had spent so much gold from the king of kings treasury without finding what he had set out to find nothing was more dreadful for a eunuchfor anyone but for a eunuch especiallythan losing the favor of the king of kings mithredath read the translated inscription once more you have rendered this accurately into aramaic as best i could excellent saris polydoros said stiffly i pray your pardon good polydoros the eunuch said i meant no disrespect i assure you its only that there is much here i do not understand nor i polydoros said but some of the ice was gone from his voice mithredath bowed thank you help me then if you will to put together the pieces of this broken pot what does this phrase mean it seemed good to the council and to the people why does the stone carver set that down why should anyone care what the people think theirs is only to obey after all true excellent saris polydoros saidyour questions are all to the point the only difficultyhe spread his hands and smiled wrylyis that i have no answers to them mithredath sat down on a chunk of limestone that from its fluted side might once have been part of a column weeds scratched his ankles through the straps of his sandals a spider ran across his instep and was gone before he could swat it in the distance he heard his servants crunching through brush a hoopoe called its strange trilling call otherwise silence ruled the dead citadel the eunuch rubbed his smooth chin how is peiraieus ruled maybe that will tell me something of athenss ways before the conqueror came i beg leave to doubt it excellent saris the city is no different from any other in the empire the king of kings may zeus and the other gods smile on him appoints the town governor who is responsible to the satrap in the smaller towns the satrap makes the appointment youre right that doesnt help mithredath read the inscription again by now he was getting sick of it and put the papyrus back in his lap with a petulant grunt the people he repeated it almost sounds as if they and the council are sovereign and these men merely ministers so to speak i can imagine a council conducting affairs i suppose polydoros said slowly though i doubt one could decide matters as well or as fast as a single man but how could anyone know about what all the people of a city thought on a question and even if for some reason the people were asked about one matter surely no one could expect to reckon up what they thought about each of the many concerns a city has every day i was hoping you would give me a different slant on the question unfortunately i think just as you do mithredath sighed and heaved himself up off his makeshift seat i suppose all we can do now is search further and hope we find more words to help us pierce this mystery the eunuch the hellene and the two servants prowled the citadel for the next two days tishtrya almost stepped on a viper but killed it with his stick before it could strike mithredath came to admire the broken statuary he kept stumbling over it was far more restrained than the ebullient emotional sculpture he was used to but had a spare elegance of its own the searchers came across a good number of inscriptions but none that helped unravel the riddle the first long one had posed most were broken or worn almost to illegibility twice polydoros found the formula it seemed good to the council and to the people each time mithredath swore in frustration because the rest of the stone was in one case buried beneath masonry and therefore would have taken twenty men to move and in the other case missing altogether enough of this place mithredath said on the evening of that second day i dont care any longer if the answer is right under my feet i think it would run away from me like a rabbit from a fox if i dug for it tomorrow we will search down below in the marketplace maybe our luck will be better there no one argued with him although they all knew they had not thoroughly explored the citadelthat would be a job for months or years not days they rolled themselves in their blanketsno matter how hot the days were the nights stayed chillyand slept the marketplace had fewer ruins than the citadel how do i know this still is part of the marketplace mithredath asked pointedly as he polydoros and the servants picked then way along through grass bushes and brush before polydoros could answer the eunuch added aii he had just kicked a large stone with painful results he pushed away the brush that hid it it was a very large stone he felt like a idiot for not having seen it in his anger he bent down to push the stone over wait polydoros said it has letters on it he read them and began to laugh what if i may ask strikes you funny glacial dignity mithredath thought was preferable to hopping up and down on one foot it says i am the boundary stone of the agora polydoros told him oh the eunuch said feeling foolish all over again the most prominent wrecked building was a couple of minutes walk north of them its wrecked facade had eight columns two of them still standing at their full height and supporting fragments of an architrave shall we examine that first polydoros asked pointing mithredaths throbbing toes made him contrary no lets save it for last and wander about for a while after all it isnt going anywhere as you wish polydoros said politely behind them mithredaths servants sighed the eunuch pretended he had not heard whats that mithredath asked a minute or so later seeing another piece of stone poking up from out of the weedsseeing it thankfully before he had a closer encounter with it by the shape its the base a statue once stood on polydoros said he walked over to it two statues he amended i see insets carved for four feet ah theres writing on it here he pulled weeds aside and read harmodios and aristogeiton those who slew the tyrant hipparkhos whats a tyrant mithredath frowned at the unfamiliar word some sort of legendary monster no merely a man who ruled a city but was not of any kingly line many towns among the hellenes used to have them ah thank you mithredath thought about that for a moment then said incredulously there was in the marketplace of athens a statue celebrating men who killed the citys ruler so it would seem excellent saris polydoros said put that way it is surprising is it not its madness the eunuch said shuddering at the idea as well for all that persia conquered you yauna who knows what lunacy you might otherwise have loosed on the world hmm was all polydoros said to that the hellene jerked his chin toward the ruined building which was now quite close shall we go over to it now but mithredath reacted to the hellenic perversity exemplified by the ruined statue base with perversity of his own no well go around it see what else is here he knew he was being difficult and reveled in it what could polydoros do about it nothing obviously as you wish the hellene repeated he then proceeded to skirt the ruins by an even larger margin than mithredath would have chosen take that the eunuch thought smiling behind polydoros back he followed him north and west still enough was enough im certain this isnt the marketplace anymore mithredath said when the hellene had led him almost all the way to athens overthrown gates no i suppose not polydoros admitted are you ready to head back now more than ready mithredath caught polydoros eye they grinned at each other both of them a little sheepish mithredath glanced at his servants they did not seem amused and knew better than to seem annoyed something crunched under the eunuchs foot curious he bent down then more curious he showed polydoros what he had found whats this an ostrakona potsherd polydoros amended remembering to put the yauna word into aramaic i knew that mithredath said impatiently ive stepped on enough of them these past few days but whats this written on it hmm polydoros took a closer look a name themistokles son of neokles why write on a potsherd cheaper than papyrus polydoros shrugged people are always breaking pots and always have sherds around why just a name then why not some message to go with it excellent saris i have no idea hrmp mithredath said he took another step and heard another crunch he was not especially surprised to find another potsherd under his foot as polydoros had said people were always breaking pots he was surprised though to find he had stepped on two sherds in a row with writing on them he handed the second piece of broken pottery to polydoros and pointed at the letters themistokles neokles son again the hellene said thats all mithredath asked polydoros dipped his head to show it was the eunuch gave him a quizzical look good polydoros why write just a mans namejust his name mind you nothing elseon two different pieces of broken pottery if one makes no sense does twice somehow not to me excellent saris polydoros shifted his feet like a schoolboy caught in some mischief by his master this time his sandal crunched on something mithredath felt a certain sense of inevitability as polydoros looked at the sherd found writing on it and read themistokles son of neokles the eunuch put hands on hips just how many of these things are there he turned to his servants tear out some brush here my curiosity has the better of me lets see how many sherds we can turn up the look raga and tishtrya exchanged was eloquent like any master with good sense mithredath pretended not to see it the servants bent and began uprooting shrubs and weeds they moved at first with the resigned slowness servants always used on unwelcome tasks but then even they began to show some interest as sherd followed sherd in quick succession themistokles neokles son polydoros read again and again and then once to vary the monotony themistokles of the district phrearrios he turned to mithredath and raised an eyebrow i think we may assume this to be the same man referred to by the rest of the sherds er yes mithredath watched the pile of potsherds grow by polydoros feet he began to feel like a sorcerer whose spell had proved stronger than he had expected his servants had speculations of their own who dyou suppose this themiswhatever was tishtrya asked raga as they worked together to uproot a particularly stubborn plant probably a hewhore putting his name about so hed have plenty of trade raga panted mithredath listening did not dismiss the idea out of hand it made more sense than anything hed been able to think of themistokles son of neokles polydoros said almost an hour later he put down another sherd that makes ah ninetytwo enough mithredath threw his hands in the air at this rate we could go on all summer i think there are more important things to do like the ruin for example polydoros asked slyly well now that you mention it yes mithredath said with such grace as he could muster he kicked a foot toward the pile of potsherds well leave this rubbish here i see no use for it but to prove how strange the men of athens were and it would glorify neither khsrish the conqueror nor through him our khsrish iv may ahura mazda make long his reign to say he overcame a race of madmen the eunuchs servants laughed at that they were persians too polydoros managed a lopsided smile he was on the quiet side as the four men made their way back to the ruined building in the marketplace once they were there the hellene quickly regained his good spirits for he found he had a chance to gloat this building is called the stoa basileios he said pointing to letters carved on an overthrown piece of frieze the royal portico if we wanted to learn of kings we should have come here first chagrin and excitement warred in mithredath excitement won good polydoros you were right find me here if you can a list of the kings of athens the last one surely will be the man khsrish overcame which will mean he added to himself that i can get out of these ruins and this whole backward satrapy seized perhaps by some of that same hope raga and tishtrya searched the ruins with three times the energy they had shown hunting for potsherds stones untouched since the persian sack save by wind rain and scurrying mice went crashing over as the servants scoured the area for more bits of writing mithredath found the first new inscription himself but already had learned not to be overwhelmed by an idle wall scratching all the same he called polydoros over phrynikhos thinks aiskhylos is beautiful the hellene read dutifully about what i expected but one never knows mithredath nodded and went on looking he had been gelded just before puberty feeling desire was as alien to him as athenss battered rocky landscape he knew he would never understand what drove this phrynikhos to declare his lust for the pretty boy lustother mens lustwas just something he had used to advance himself back when he was young enough to trade on it once in a while abstractly he wondered what it was like raga let out a shout that drove all such useless fancies from his mind heres a big flat stone covered with letters everyone came rushing over to see the servant went on i saw this wasnt one stone here but two the white one covering the gray so i used my staff to lever the white one off and look he was as proud as if hed done the writing himself mithredath plunged pen into ink and readied his papyrus what does it say he asked polydoros the hellene plucked nervously at his beard and looked from the inscription to mithredath and back again the eunuchs impatient glare finally made him start to talk it seemed good to the council and to the people what mithredath jumped as if a wasp had stung him more nonsense about council and people where is the list of kings in ahura mazdas name where if not by the royal portico i would not know that excellent saris polydoros said stiffly if i may though i suggest you hear me out as i read this stone bears on your quest i assure you very well it wasnt very well but there was nothing mithredath could do about it grouchily he composed himself to listen it seemed good to the council and to the people polydoros resumed with the tribe of oineis presiding phainippos serving as chairman aristomenes as secretary kleisthenes proposed these things concerning ostrakismos what in ahrimans name is ostrakismos mithredath asked something pertaining to ostrakapotsherds i dont know how to put it into aramaic any more precisely than that excellent saris im sorry but the words on the stone explain it better than i could in any case if youll let me go on mithredath nodded thank you excellent saris polydoros said where was i oh yes concerning ostrakismos each year when the sixth tribe presides let the people decide if they wish to hold an ostrakophoria seeing mithredath roll his eyes polydoros explained that means a meeting to which potsherds are carried i presume this is leading somewhere the eunuch said heavily i believe so yes polydoros gave his attention back to the inscribed stone let the ostrakophoria be held if more of the people are counted to favor it than to oppose if at the ostrakophoria more than six thousand potsherds are counted let him whose name appears on the largest number of ostraka leave athens within ten days for ten years suffering no loss of property in the interim may there be good fortune to the people of athens from this exiled by potsherds mithredath said as his pen scratched across the sheet of papyrus even for yauna that strikes me as preposterous then he and polydoros looked first at each other then back the way they had come raga tishtrya go gather up the sherds we were looking at i think we may have a need for them after all the servants trotted off i also think we may polydoros said let me read on those who have been ordained to leave the city in the year when ankises was arkhon arkhon mithredath asked some officer or other polydoros shrugged it means leader or ruler but if a man only held the post a year it can hardly have been important can it i suppose not go on in the year when ankises was arkhon hipparkhos son of kharmos in the year when telesinos was arkhon megakles son of hippokrates in the year when kritias was arkhon the hellene broke off no one was exiled that year it seems in the next when philokrates was arkhon xanthippos son of ariphron was exiled then no one again and then he paused for effect themistokles son of neokles well well mithredath scribbled furiously pausing only to shake his head in wonder the people really did make these choices then without a king to guide them so it would seem excellent saris how strange did the ostrakismosmithredath stumbled over the yauna word but neither aramaic nor persian had an equivalentfall upon anyone else not in the two years excellent saris polydoros said when hypsikhides was arkhon the athenian people choose exile for xerxes son of dareios who can only be the king of kings the conqueror i would guess that to be a last gesture of defiance the list of arkhontes ends abruptly with hypsikhides very likely you are right so they tried to exile khsrish did they much good it did them mithredath finished writing the servants were coming back carrying in a leather sack the sherds that had helped exile a man their shadows were long before them mithredath saw with surprise that the sun had almost touched the rocky western horizon he turned to polydoros it would be dark by the time we got back to peiraieus falling into a pothole i never saw holds no appeal shall we spend one more night here and return with the light of morning the hellene dipped his head that strikes me as a good plan if you are satisfied you have found what you came to learn i think i have mithredath said hearing that tishtrya and raga began to make camp close by the ruins of the royal portico bread and goat cheese and onions washed down with river water seemed as fine a feast as any of the elaborate banquets mithredath had enjoyed in babylon triumph he thought was an even better sauce than pickled fish his servants dove into their bedrolls as soon as they finished eating their snores all but drowned out the little night noises that came from beyond the circle of light around the camp fire mithredath and polydoros did not go to sleep right away the eunuch was glad to have company he felt like talking about the strange way the athenians had run their affairs and the hellene had shown himself bright enough to have ideas of his own no sign of a king anywhere mithredath said still bemused at that i wonder if they settled everything they needed to decide on by counting potsherds i would guess they probably must have excellent saris polydoros said all the inscriptions read it seemed good to the council and to the people how would they know thatwhy would they write thatif they had not counted potsherds to know what seemed good to the people there you have me good polydoros but what if something that seemed good to the people was in fact bad for them then they suffered the consequences i suppose they certainly did when they decided to oppose xerxes polydoros waved at the dark ruins all around but they were the leading yauna power at the time were they not they must have been or khsrish would not have obliterated their city as a lesson to the others until they chose to fight him they must have done well a king can also make an error polydoros said oh indeed being a courtier mithredath knew better than the hellene how gruesomely true that could be but he pointed out a king knows the problems that face his land and if by some mischance he should not why then he has his ministers to point them out to him so that he may decide what needs to be done how could the peoplefarmers most of them and cobblers and potters and dyershow could they even have hoped to learn the issues that affected athens let alone what to do about them there you have me polydoros confessed they would be too busy id think working just to stay alive to be able to act as you say more or less as ministers in their own behalf mithredath nodded exactly the king decides the ministers and courtiers advise and the people obey so it is so it has always been so it always will be no doubt you are right an enormous yawn blurred polydoros words your pardon excellent saris i think i will imitate your servants he unrolled his blanket and wrapped it around himself will you join us soon polydoros did not snore but before long was breathing with the slow regularity of sleep mithredath remained some time awake every so often his eyes went to the bag of potsherds which lay close by ragas head he kept trying to imagine what being an athenian before khsrish the conqueror had come had been like if the farmers and potters and such ruled themselves by counting sherds would they have made an effort to learn about all the things athens was doing so they could make sensible choices when the time came to put the sherds in a basket for counting or whatever it was they did what would it have been like to be a tavern keeper say with the same concerns as a great noble the eunuch tried to imagine it felt himself failing it was as alien to him as lust he knew whole men felt that even if he could not he supposed the athenians might have had this other sense but he was sure he did not he gave it up and rolled himself in his blanket to get some rest as he grew drowsy his mind began to roam he had a sudden mental picture of the whole vast persian empire being run by people writing on potsherds he had visions of armies of clerks trying to transport and count them and of mountains of broken pottery climbing to the sky he fell asleep laughing at his own silliness thirdrate town though it was peiraieus looked good to mithredath after some days pawing through the ruins of dead athens he paid polydoros five gold darics for his help there the hellene bowed low you are most generous excellent saris mithredath presented his cheek for a kiss then said your assistance has but earned its fitting reward good polydoros if you will excuse me then im off to see how much work has fallen on my table while i was away at mithredaths nod polydoros bowed again and trotted away he turned back once to wave then quickly vanished among the people crowding the ports streets and now we are off to the satraps residence the eunuch told his servants i shall inform vahauka of the success of my mission and draw from the ganzabara mithredath snapped his fingers what was the fellows name hermippos wasnt it sir tishtrya said yes thank you i shall draw from hermippos the funds we need for our return journey to babylon after giving polydoros his due we are for the moment poor but only for the moment yes sir i like the sound of going home fine sir tishtrya said raga nodded i wouldnt be sorry never to see this satrapy again myself mithredath admitted smiling the satraps residence was busier in the early morning than it had been at nightfall a couple of guards stood outside the entrance to make sure the line of people waiting to see vahauka and his officials stayed orderly mithredath recognized one of the guards as the man who had been at the door the evening hed arrived he went up to the fellow be so good as to convey me to his excellency the satrap he said i dont care to waste an hour of my time standing here the guard made no move to do as mithredath had asked instead he looked down his long straight nose at the eunuch and said you can just wait your turn like anybody else mithredath stared why you insolent he started to push past but the guard swung up his spear what do you think youre playing at the eunuch said angrily i told you nostoneswait your turn the spear head pointed straight at mithredaths belly it did not waver the guard looked as though he would enjoy thrusting it home mithredath glanced at his servants like any travelers with a shekels weight of sense he tishtrya and raga all carried long daggers as protection against robbers neither servant though seemed eager to take on a spearcarrying soldier especially when the man served the local satrap seething mithredath took his place in line i shall remember your face he promised the guard and ill forget yours the lout laughed loudly at his own wit the line crawled ahead but mithredath was too furious to become bored the revenges he invented grew more and more chilling as he got hotter and hotter a soldier who thwarted one of the royal eunuchseven a soldier so far from babylon as this guardwas asking to have his corpse given to ravens and kites the eunuch had thought vahauka would signal him forward as soon as he saw him but the satrap went right on with his business at last mithredath stood before him mithredath started to prostrate himself and waited for vahauka to stop him and offer his cheek vahauka did not feeling his stomach knot within him the eunuch finished the prostration when he rose he had his face under control my lord he said and gestured toward the bag of potsherds raga held i am pleased to report my success in the mission personally set me by khsrish king of kingshe stressed the rulers name and titlemay ahura mazda make long his reign vahauka yawned of all the responses mithredath might have expected that was the last having to work now to keep his voice from stumbling the eunuch went on as i have succeeded i plan to draw funds from the ganzabara hipparkhos for my return voyage to babylon no vahauka yawned again my lord must i remind you of my closeness to the king of kings only alarm made mithredaths threat come out so baldly noballs i doubt very much if you ever have beenor ever will beclose to kurash kings of kings may ahura mazda smile upon him and make long his reign ku the rest of the name could not get through the lump of ice that suddenly filled mithredaths throat aye kurash a ship came in with the word hed overthrown and slain your worthless khsrish the day you left for the old ruined inland town good riddance says i now we have a real king of kings again and now i dont have to toady to a halfman anymore either and i wont get out of my sight wretch and thank the good gods i dont stripe your back to send you on your way the satraps mocking laughter pursued mithredath as he left the hall his servants followed as stunned as he even the vestiges of dignity deserted him as soon as he was out of sight of the satraps residence he sat down heavily and buried his face in his hands so he would not have to see the passersby staring at him tishtrya and raga were muttering back and forth poor he heard one of them say he cant pay us anymore well to ahriman with him then what else is he good for the other replied it was raga he dropped the leather sack the potsherds inside clinked the sack came open some sherds spilled out mithredath did not look up he did not look up at the sound of his servantsno his exservants he thought dullywalking away either they were some time gone when at last the eunuch began to emerge from his shock and despair he picked up a sherd because one man had died his own life abruptly was as shattered as the pot from which the broken piece had come as shattered as longago athens he climbed slowly to his feet perhaps he could beg one of his darics back from polydoros it would feed and lodge him for a couple of weeks then he couldwhat at the moment he had no idea for that matter he did not even know if the hellene would give him the gold one thing at a time he thought he stopped a man and asked the way to the bankers street the man told him nodding his thanks he tossed the potsherd on the leather sack and started off death in vesunna this story was my first professional sale it was not however my first professional appearance the magazine that bought it cosmos folded after four issuesand before the story saw print it later ran in isaac asimovs the idea from which it sprang came from my exwife who was not then ex whose name appears in the table of contents as coauthor the research and almost all the writing are mine the marriage ended up failing as sometimes happens the story i think still works more wine gentlemen clodius eprius asked eyeing his two guests with faint distaste he had wanted to leave for his country estate to supervise the harvest but this dinner meeting was keeping him stranded in vesunna like some vulgar lampseller when both men nodded he sighed and rose from his couch picking up the red earthenware jug he filled their cups and poured himself a hefty dollop as well all drank the two strangers murmured appreciatively that warmed eprius a little he said its not falernian but this is a fine vintage it was laid down the year hadrian died eightno nine years ago now a fine vintage he repeated do you know theyre even shipping our aquitanian wine to britain these days really one of his visitors a short blondish fellow who called himself lucius looked interested his comrade kept his nose in his cup a tall solidly built man with hard dark eyes he had not said three words all through dinner lucius had introduced him as marcus for no reason he could name eprius guests disturbed him it was not their accent though lucius who did most of the talking flavored his latin in a curious fashion no the way they looked at their surroundings nettled their host more itinerant booksellers like these men would have seen many splendid villas in their travels to be sure eprius knew his house would not have seemed imposing to anyone newly come from rome or antioch but a fountain laughed in the courtyard and the statues around it were good work so was the hunting scene picked out in mosaic on the dining room floor craftsmen from rome had created it his home was no hovel it did not deserve lucius patronizing stare or the contempt marcus scarcely bothered to conceal he drained his wine well good sirs he said you told me you had a proposition i might find interesting could it be kept in sufficient privacy i have met your request my servants are already at my other home and ive given my valet the evening off i am at your disposal gentlemen how do you wish to entice me we thank you my friend lucius replied for a fine meal and for the kindness you have shown two men you do not know we will think your courtesy limitless indeed if you answer one question for us ask sir ask i am sure you know vesunna is not a town to which we usually travel fine though it may be but while we were in massilia we heard a rumor so astounding if true that we hurried north to investigate you have not asked your question eprius pointed out there was a tinge of smugness in his voice and lucius did not miss it its true then you do have a copy of sophokles aleadai and if i should may we see it for the first time lucius displayed real eagerness even marcus dour features almost smiled i keep it in my private suite wait here a moment if you will taking a lamp to light his way eprius bustled out of the dining room down the hall and into his sanctum the first thing he spied there was a stout walking stick he seized it gratefully for he had been a trifle lame since falling from a horse a couple of years before he shuffled rolls of papyrus finding book three of the aeneid book one of the iliad a bill from the sheep doctor valerius bassus book seven of the aeneid and at last the work he sought a copy of the aleadai had been in his family for almost three hundred years one of his ancestors had been a centurion in lucius mummius army when that general had sacked corinth and had taken the original document as part of his loot finding that the ravages of time had made it almost illegible eprius grandfather had had it recopied it had been rare then eprius still recalled the old man chuckling as he described the surprise of the copyist who redid it he could well understand booksellers coming a long way in search of such a work lucius took the roll like a lover caressing his beloved yet he handled its spindles clumsily almost thought eprius as if he were not used to unrolling a book to read it dont be a fool he told himself a book dealer sees more books in a month than you will in ten years the wine has simply made his fingers awkward he certainly reads well enoughhe isnt even moving his lips which is more than you can claim for your reading a passage seemed to please the stranger who began to read aloud his accent was if anything stronger in greek than in latin but he paid scrupulous heed to the complex meter of the tragedians verse despite himself eprius was impressed lucius read silently once more faster and still faster whipping through the scroll now with a speed that left eprius blinking a lamp went out but lucius never noticed he read aloud again stop it is enough to have been called father if indeed i begot you but if not the harm is less for what one believes carries more weight than the truth he turned in triumph to marcusthat clinches it he said this is one of the sections stobaeus quotes and this is the genuine aleadai of course its genuine eprius said in aggrieved tones these fellows had approached him did they now think he was trying to cheat them and who was stobaeus the name was not familiar neither of his guests was listening to him they sprang from their couches lucius carefully put the aleadai down first and capered about in ridiculous fashion they slapped each others backs swatted each others palms and clasped each others wrists all the while making interlocking rings of thumbs and forefingers barbarians after all eprius thought little by little they calmed down marcus glee subsided into wariness but lucius face was lit by that special joy felt when something long sought was at last found this is indeed a treasure he said what price would you put on it eprius smiled a curious sort of merchant you are to let a prospective seller know how much you esteem his goods marcus looked alarmed but lucius said smoothly under any other circumstances you would be right but not today you see i have a standing offer for this work from a gentleman at rome whose name i am sure you would recognize were i at liberty to disclose it quite a sizable offer in fact that made sense many senators and other officials were zealots in the pursuit of culture eprius nodded and as he did marcus watchful mask settled back over his face how sizable an offer eprius asked large enough so that i can afford to offer youhmm seventyfive aurei and still turn a handsome profit seventyfive aurei eprius tried hard not to show how startled he was that was many many times the going rate even for a rare book a princely sum why is your unnamed patron so anxious to acquire the aleadai it is the only play of sophokles he lacks come now do you take me for an utter idiot i doubt if even the library of alexandria could make that claim my friend i do not know what your game is but find someone else to play the dupe do you think we are trying to defraud you this will persuade you otherwise lucius drew out a leather purse and tossed it to eprius he opened it ruddy in the lamplight goldpieces spilled into his palms they clinked sweetly well well he said at last i owe you an apology good sirs both for what i said and for what i thought let me take the roll to our local copyist and you may have either the original or the copy within a week just as you please aemilius ruso is a friend of mine i assure you he has a fine hand and he is careful too i am afraid that wont quite do friend eprius a condition of the sale is absolute privacy and it is a condition on which i have no discretion whatever we must have this work now is the price inadequate i can sweeten it a bit i think money buys men friends and honors too so says the poet in this very play but money will not buy the only copy of the aleadai for it has been an heirloom in my family for eleven generations i see no reason not to share it but i will not give it up a hundred aurei eprius face froze he refilled the purse and threw it at lucius feet you insult me sir i must bid you a good evening he held out his hand for the play reluctantly lucius began to give it back to him but marcus reached out and held him back his smile and his heavily accented voice were deliberately offensive i think we keep this he said what get out you rogues you lashworthy rascals despite graying hair and growing paunch eprius was still fairly quick on his feet his walking stick thudded down on marcus shoulder the aleadai fell to the floor get out robbers get out eprius shouted bastard marcus snarled he ducked the next swing of the stick stars exploded inside eprius head as a solid right sent him spinning back over his couch to the floor somehow he held on to his stick too angry to fear facing two younger men he surged forward crying thieves thieves at the top of his lungs marcus hand snaked under his tunic eprius saw it emerge with a curiously shaped metal object one of marcus fingers twitched on it and eprius heard the beginning of a barking roar something sledged him in the forehead and he never saw or heard anything again lou muller who in vesunna called himself lucius the book dealer stared in horror at the crumpled corpse that had been clodius eprius the gun shot still seemed to echo in the room jesus h christ mark he said and he was not speaking latin at all the patrol lou you can take the patrol and stuff it right on up mark alvarez tucked away the pistol and rubbed his shoulder the old son of a bitch damn near broke my collarbone what was i supposed to do let him yell until all the neighbors came speaking of which he scooped up the aleadai and trotted into the street his partner followed still expostulating oh shut up and listen to me will you please alvarez growled why do we make a good team anyway its not just because youre the fellow who knows his way around the secondcentury empire and im the one with the pull to get a timer ive got the brains to get you out of trouble when you screw up which you did for one thing even i knowyouve told me often enoughstobaeus isnt going to be born for a couple of hundred years yet for another and worse that geezer was never going to sell us the play after you got his back up but i offered him seventyfive aurei that didnt impress him now did it and it doesnt impress me either whatre seventyfive aurei to us thirty credits for the gold always thanking god for fusionpowered transmutation the same for some authentic molds and voila aurei whereas we canand we willget easily fifty thousand credits for a lost play of euripides sophokles muller corrected absently whatever and as for the time patrol why are we here in the boondocks instead of at the library of alexandria why do we insist on so much privacy when we make our deals just so they wont run across us and they wont erasing this fellow wont leave any clues downtime we dont change anyones ancestry because his wifes been dead for years we did check him out you know he glanced over his shoulder did anyone see us leave i dont think so but my god mark a bullet what about it nobody here will ever figure out how he died the local yokelsll call it the wrath of the gods or something and then theyll forget it all we have to do is sit tight for three weeks until the timer recharges and then its back to and lots of lovely money i suppose so muller agreed slowly i kind of liked old eprius though liked him lou he was just a stupid savage like all the other stupid savages here and now look around is there anything here but filth and disease and superstition you couldnt pay me to time if it werent for xanthomycin come on lets get back to the inn like the fellow said my man the plays the thing and weve got it what about the gold you want to go back and get it relax itll confuse the issue anyway they walked on in silence until they came to the inn what a dump alvarez sighed oh well at least it has a bed and i need sleep right now weve had a busy night the sound of a fist crashing against his door hauled gaius tero from the depths of slumber stifling a curse he climbed out of bed and threw on a mantle his wife stirred and muttered drowsilyit sounds like business calvina he said go back to sleep a forlorn hope indeed with his door being battered down im coming im coming he shouted and the pounding stopped as tesserarius of vesunnas sevenman detachment of vigiles he wondered what had gone wrong now had someone knocked over porcius wine shop again or had herennius fundanus firetrap of a stable finally decided to go up in smoke either way the responsibility fell on him for the vigiles were constabulary and fire brigade both he threw open the door just as he had expected there stood the panting figure of larcius afer who had the watch that night well what is it tero demanded adding hopefully i dont smell smoke the siphon which was the citys chief firefighting implement was a pain in the fundament to deploy and use no sir afer agreed he paused to wipe sweat from his face the night was warm and he had plainly run some distance tero who was not the most patient of men glared at him until he continued clodius eprius has been killed what do you mean killed has he been murdered killed sir afer repeated stolidly kleandros is with the body now hell be able to tell you more than i can im sure obviously tero snapped still he was glad the greek doctor would be there they were old friends though they argued constantly the tesserarius ducked back into his house for sandals then accompanied his fellow vigil to the dead mans home it was a couple of hours before dawn and a waning crescent moon shed a wan light over the town nevertheless it was dark enough to make tero glad his companion carried a torch eprius lived or rather had lived at the opposite end of town from teros home he and afer tramped through vesunnas central forum silent save for the sound of their footsteps at its very heart was the temple dedicated to the citys tutelary gods its huge circular cella made it currently the biggest structure in vesunna but the amphitheater being built not far away promised to dwarf it and everything else in the town tero wondered idly what the old petrocorii the celtic tribe that had founded vesunna would have thought of such an incredibly huge edifice magic without a doubt anything was magical to someone who did not know how to do it his thoughts turned back to eprius why would anyone want to kill the old fool tero knew him fairly well and also knew he had not a single enemy in town had some footpad done away with him tero tried to pump larcius afer but afer shook his head saying youll have to see for yourself with a small shock the tesserarius realized his subordinate was frightened that was very strange before settling in vesunna the two of them had served together on the rhine and tero knew full well that the skirmishes there had thoroughly inured afer to the sight of gore it seemed as if most of eprius neighbors were gathered outside his front door well tero thought thats scarcely surprising they all started talking at once when they saw him raining questions down on his unprepared head i dont know a damned thing yet he said pushing his way through the crowd if youll let me by maybe ill find out something kleandros met him at the entrance tero liked the sharptongued physician they had worked together before and once or twice a month they would meet for wine a friendly game of draughts and much good talk still the doctors elegant slimness always made the squarely built tero feel like a poorly trained dancing bear just by standing before him kleandros made him suddenly and acutely aware of his own uncombed hair the patches and stains on his cloak and the ragged bit of leather hanging from one sandal as usual he disguised his feelings with raillery hello quack he said what do you have for me today an opening like that would normally make kleandros sputter and fume but today he did not rise to the bait under the curling black ringlets he combed low on his forehead his face was grim as he answered hello tero im glad to see you youd best come look for yourself he was speaking greek instead of latin something he did only when very upset tero began to worry in earnest the physician led him down the dark entry hall to the dining room someone had refilled and lit all the lamps there the flames cast multiple dancing shadows three couches had been grouped together in one comer of the room one was overturned and the wall behind it bore a sinister stain the vigil looked a question at kleandros who nodded poor eprius is behind the couch kleandros said tell me what you make of him why me youre the doctor tero said but he walked around the couch both on the rhine and as a vigil in vesunna gaius tero had seen the results of more violent deaths than he liked to remember yet the corpse in this quiet room shook him in a way none of the others however grisly ever had he was in the presence of the unknown and little fingers of ice crawled up his back as he viewed its handiwork eprius body lay on its right side its right hand still clutched a stick tero barely noticed for his gaze was fixed in horrified fascination at the ruin that had been its head there was a neat hole about the width of teros little finger over the left eye a small stream of blood ran down over epirius face to join the pool beneath his head already flies were beginning to buzz about it bad as that was it was far from the worst whatever had drilled through eprius forehead had smashed out through the back of his head tearing his skull open much of the left rear quadrant of his head was a sickening soup of brain pulverized bone scalp and hair it was that which had stained the wall blood cemented the gory fragments to the plaster the hobnails of larcius afers sandals clicked on mosaic tiles as he came up dread was on his face his fingers writhed in a sign to avert evil it was jupiters thunderbolt that slew him afer said two or three of the neighbors heard him cry out and then the terrible roar of the thunderbolt itselfand not a cloud in the sky his man titus had the evening free and when he got home he found this tero had never been one to fear the gods unduly but he felt the little hairs on the back of his neck trying to rise as he listened to afer surely nothing in his experience could have produced the ghastly wound he saw to have kleandros throw back his head and laugh was unbelievable tero wondered if the doctor had taken leave of his senses and afer stared at him indignantly how many men has either of you known to be killed by the gods kleandros demanded ive been a doctor for twenty years now and ive never seen one yet theres always a first time afer said i suppose so kleandros conceded but clodius eprius good heavens man use your head for something more than a place to hang your hair the worst thing clodius eprius did in his whole life was to drink so much wine friends had to carry him home if the gods started killing everybody who did that why there wouldnt be five men left alive in the empire by this time tomorrow no im afraid that if the gods left it to nero to kill himself and soldiers to do away with caligula they wouldnt have much interest in clodius eprius afer was still far from convinced what did kill him then he demanded i havent the slightest idea right now but i intend to find out instead of moaning about jupiter the physicians healthy skepticism gave tero the heartening he needed to shake off his superstitious fear and begin thinking like a vigil once more he quizzed eprius neighbors but learned nothing afer had not already told him there had been shouts and then a crash but nobody had seen anyone fleeing eprius home titus proved even less informative than the neighbors he was griefstricken and more than a little hung over when eprius had given him the night off he had not questioned his master but headed straight for the wine and girls of aspasias lupanar where he had roistered the night away when he came back and found eprius body he rushed out to get kleandros and that was all he knew tero left him sitting with his head in his hands and went back to the dining room learn anything kleandros asked nothing maybe jupiter did kill him kleandros oneword reply was rude in the extreme tero managed an answering grin but it was strained his eyes kept going back to the bloodspattered wall in the middle of the spatters was a ragged hole whats this he said how should i know kleandros said maybe eprius used to keep a tapestry nailed there and was clumsy taking it down i dont think so ive been here more than once and i dont remember any wall hangings tero took a knife from his belt and chipped away at the plaster enlarging the hole at its bottom was a little button of metal no not a button a flower for as tero dug it out he saw that little petals of lead had peeled back from a brass base never in all his years had he seen anything like it he tossed it up and down up and down whistling tunelessly give me that kleandros said grabbing it out of the air he examined it curiously what is it anyway i was hoping you could tell me i couldnt begin to any more than i could begin to tell you what killed eprius something almost clicked in teros mind but the thought would not come clear say that again he demanded kleandros repeated he had it look he said where did we find this strange thing is this your day to do sokrates very well best one ill play along we found this strange thing in a hole in the wall and what was all around the hole in the wall clodius eprius brains very good bear with me one more time how did clodius eprius brains get there if i knew that i wouldnt be standing here pretending to be euthyphron kleandros snapped ive seen a fair number of dead men but never one like this he looked at the piece of metal in his hand and his voice grew musing and ive never seen anything like this either you think the one had something to do with the other dont you tero nodded if you could somehow make that thing go fast enough it would make a respectable holeit didnt make a bad hole in the wall you know so it didnt it probably used to have a tip shaped more like an arrowhead too that lead is soft and it would get smashed down when it hit see what a brilliant pair we are we only have one problem left how in zeus holy name does the little hunk of metal get moving so fast two problems tero corrected once you get the little piece of metal moving why do you use it to blow out clodius eprius brains robbery perhaps maybe titus should know if anything is missing until he can figure that out i think im going home and back to bed wait a moment whats this almost out of sight under one of the couches was a small leather bag tero stooped to pick it up and exclaimed in surprise it was far heavier than hed expected he knew of only two things combining so much weight with so little bulk lead and he opened the bag and aurei flooded into his hand so much for robbery kleandros said looking over his shoulder the images of trajan hadrian and antoninus pius looked mutely back answering none of the questions the two men would have put to them the only time tero had ever held so much gold at once was when hed gotten his musteringout bonus on leaving his legion he looked up to find kleandros still studying the coins a puzzled expression on his face what now tero asked it was the doctors turn to have trouble putting what he saw into words does anything strike you as odd about this money he said at last only that no robber in his right mind would leave it lying under a couch apart from that i mean is there anything wrong about the money itself an aureus is an aureus tero shrugged the only thing wrong with them is that i see them too seldom kleandros grunted in exasperation he plucked an aureus of trajan from the pile in teros hand and held it under the vigils nose so close that teros eyes started to cross as he looked at it tero shrugged again to him it seemed like any freshminted goldpiece he said so to me too kleandros said and that is more than a little out of the ordinary since trajan has been deadwhat is it thirty years now i think i was somewhere in my teens when he died and im far from a youth now worse luck yet here is one of his coins bright and unworn more than one in fact he said picking out three or four more they lay in his hand alike as peas in a pod and that was wrong too no coin had the right to be identical to its fellows they were stamped out by hand one at a time there were always differences sometimes not small ones in shape and thickness not here though both men noticed it at the same time but neither was as disturbed as he would have been a few hours before everything weve found here is impossible tero said and this is just one little impossibility among the big ones it was growing light outside tero swore disgustedly i might as well stay up now care to join me for an early cup of wine thank you no but if you dont mind ill cadge a meal from you and calvina this evening we can talk more then and maybe squeeze some sense from all this i doubt it truth to tell but ill expect you a little past sunset fine tero swallowed his last morsel of ham wiped his fingers and sighed loudly why did i ever quit the legions he said id twenty times rather fight the german lurking in his gloomy forest than face another day like this one that bad kleandros asked between bites of apple you should knowyou started me on it the vigil did not feel right about dropping all his troubles on his friend but he had had a bellyful the story of clodius eprius death had raced through vesunna gaining fresh embellishments with each teller it did not take long for people to be saying that all the twelve immortals had visited the town destroying not only eprius but his house and those of his neighbors too more than one panicky citizen hastily packed up his belongings and headed for the country none of that sat well with vesunnas two duumvirs and both of those worthies came down heavily on tero demanding that he find the murderer at once what will this do to the name of our city one said though tero knew that what he meant was i do not want my year in office recalled only for a gruesome killing he promised to do his best though he had few illusions about how good that was going to be late in the afternoon eprius servant titus came in with two more bits of depressing news first the gold the vigil had found was definitely not eprius and second as far as he could tell after a quick search nothing was missing from his late masters home larcius afer was there to hear that and his superior smile made tero want to kick him in the teeth that he did tell kleandros it galled him too much for silence the doctor pursed his lips and said judiciously if a fool laughed at me id take it for a compliment so would i were i sure he was wrong but what do we have here a murder committed for no reason with an impossible weapon that produces an incredible wound i think id rather believe in an angry god who leaves behind a purse full of counterfeit aurei no god would do that no person would either tero pointed out and they arent counterfeits either theyre pure gold rusticius the jeweler checked them for me this afternoon did he how interesting yes kleandros said nothing more but a look of satisfaction spread across his face you know something tero accused i have some ideas at any rate did i ever tell you that i studied medicine under diodoros of alexandria there were times when tero found his friends evasiveness maddening this it seemed was going to be one of them no he said you never did why do you see fit to impart this bit of information to me now i am coming to that never fear you see diodoros himself was learning his skill in alexandria when heron son of ktesibios was at the height of his fame tero had to admit he did not know the name do you not a pity he was a remarkable man probably one of the finest machine makers the world has ever seen diodoros was fascinated by his contraptions and he never tired of talking about them really amazing things a device for dispensing sacramental water that worked only when a copper was inserted a trumpet made to sound by opening a nearby door bronze animals that moved like live ones and many other things he sounds like a sorcerer no he was an artificer and nothing more one of the things he made not really more than a toy was what he called an aeolipile all of this must lead somewhere i suppose what might an aeolipile be kleandros explained a waterfilled cauldron was fitted atop with a hollow ball mounted on a hollow tube directly opposite the tubes entrance into the ball was a pivot which was attached to the cauldrons lid the ball itself was fitted with bent nozzles when a fire was lit beneath the cauldron steam traveled up the hollow tube and out through the nozzles making the ball spin merrily do you see what im getting at the doctor asked in this device the force of the steam escaped continuously but if some way were found to block it up for a time and then release it all at once it could give a little metal pellet a very strong push indeed tero took another pull at his wine while he thought the idea had more than a little appeal for it gave a rational picture of how the killing might have taken place still a cauldron you say how big a cauldron i have no idea ive never seen the machine in action myself only heard diodoros talk about it somehow i find it hard to imagine clodius eprius letting anyone set up a cauldron in the middle of the room and then aim a little ball at him and whoever would be using it would have to wait for his water to boil before it would go off wouldnt he i suppose so kleandros said sulkily not only that anyone hauling a cauldron through the middle of vesunna would get himself noticed even if i dont know what killed eprius i can tell you a couple of things about it you can use it right away and you can carry it around without having it seen im afraid your whateveryoucallit misses the mark both ways seeing his friends hurt expression tero went on if you could make one big enough it might make a good ballista though i wonder why our generals never thought of anything like that he thought a little surprised at himself your logic is convincing kleandros said adding damn it a moment later lets give up on the weapon for now tero suggested it matters less than the person who used it if we had some way of knowing who he was we might catch him thunderbolt thrower or no a good point kleandros said whoever he was we can be fairly sure he was from outside the empire why do you say that we know of no weapons to fit the bill within our land do we also why would a citizen need to carry coins that werent genuine but would pass one by one if they are true gold that only makes the argument stronger a spy you may have something there but who would want to spy on vesunna and why thro opened his mouth for a reply then realized he did not have a good one no one had ever seen a german in the town and parana was at the other end of the world besides he was sure neither the germans nor the parthians had weapons that could blow large holes in mens heads if they did they would have used them on roman soldiers long before in fact anyone who had such a weapon could master the world and surely would have done so by now it made no sense at all what other foreigners were there there were nomads south of roman africa and others east of the germans there was an island off the coast of britain but it was full of savages too there wasmen from atlantis perhaps my dear tero i would be the last to deny platon was a man of godlike intellect and the timaios has always been one of my favorite dialogues still as far as i can see in it he invents atlantis in order to portray an idealized way of life and as aristoteles said he who invented it destroyed it for if youll remember platon says it sank beneath the waves thousands of years ago thats a pity because i dont see how a spy could come from any country we know well he explained his reasoning to the doctor who nodded where does that leave us kleandros asked right where we startedramming our heads into a stone wall a plague on it for now did you bring your iliad with you id sooner bend my brain around that for a while slowly but surely over the course of years kleandros vas teaching the vigil to read greek most cultured citizens of the empire were bilingual tero spoke greek fairly well though more elastic its basic structure was much like that of latin and there were more than a few similarities of vocabulary as well but homer was something else his hexameters were splendid and his picture of the heroes of the trojan war supremely human but his antique vocabulary and archaic grammatical forms often made tero want to tear his hair line by line they fought their way through the opening of book sixteen where patroklos begs akhilleus to let him borrow his armor and drive the trojans from the ships of the akhaians which they had begun to burn akhilleus hesitant at first assented when he saw the fire going up and patroklos armed himself with shining bronze i hate these funnylooking datives tero said but went on first he put wellmade greaves on his calves they had guards of silver on them then on his breast he put the cleverly made shining corselet of aiakos swiftfooted scion he slung his silvernailed bronze sword from his shoulder and after it a great stout shield as well bronze bronze bronze tero said bronze this bronze that one cohort of my legion could have gone through all the heroes of the trojan war akhaians and trojans both in about an hour and a half ten years no wonder it took them ten years with tactics like theirs they run at each other throw their spears and then start looking for rocks to fling and nobody cares about the fellow next to him until the poor sod gets a spear in the groin then they fight over his armor not him you have the soul of a turnip kleandros said he had heard teros complaints many times that we are better at killing people than they were in akhilleus day is no cause for celebrating nevertheless i wonder what shininghelmed hektor would have thought if one morning he woke up and found my old legion around his walls instead of those akhaian cattle thieves can you imagine it earthworks siege towers catapults rams he couldnt have held that town three days against us i think id have paid money to see his face he probably would have been like afer convinced all the gods were angry at him and yet we would just have been men with skills he didnt have not demigods or heroes its very strange tero returned to his home and plowed on doggedly even after his attention began to wander the truth was that he did not want to think about eprius corpse though he suspected he would see it in his dreams for years to come crimes were hard enough to solve at any time but this one had an impossible wound an unknown but highly potent weapon a good many cleverly counterfeited aurei and to make matters worse no visible motive what verb does lelalestho come from he asked kleandros the knock on teros door a few days later was so tentative he was only halfsure hed heard it nonetheless he went to the door and opened it to find eprius valet titus waiting for him come in come in the vigil said what can i do for you thank you very much the servant replied his latin though grammatically perfect still carried a faint guttural touch of his native syriac when comfortably seated he went on ive had the time now to go through my late masters effects more thoroughly and ive found something i think you ought to know ah tero leaned forward tell me more the two time travelers walked through the center of vesunna the tune alvarez was whistling would not be written for another nineteen centuries but he couldnt have cared less in less than a day the timer would recharge itself and hed return to the era where he belonged a richer man he looked about hed had enough of painted marble statues uttering the city square enough of the stink of ordure and the slimy feel of it under his feet enough of drafty clothes bad syrupy wine and a language he barely understood and hed had enough of bedbugs too he scratched under his mantle his fingers brushed the leather of his shoulder holster and he smiled a little the weight of the revolver was a comfort like a paidup insurance policy lou was silent beside him watching the tide of humanity ebb and flow today was market day and the square was packed to alvarez the merchants and their customers were so many gabbling barbarians but for some incomprehensible reason lou chose to regard them as people most of the time this inspired nothing but disdain in alvarez but now his allencompassing good humor even included his partner lou might be a weakling but he knew his stuff he had tracked that play of sophokles from nothing but the vaguest rumor and now it looked as if there would be an unexpected bonus in this squalid town who would have thought a copy of hieronymos of kardias lost history would have ended up here it would be worth plenty not as much as the sophokles perhaps but still a nice piece of change whoever this fellow was this kleandros harmodios son who owned the hieronymos he wanted enough for it aemilius ruso the local scribe had offered what was a good price by hereandnow standards and kleandros had turned him down flat alvarez chuckled he and lou would have no trouble on that score despite directions they got lost more than once searching out kleandros house the streets of vesunna were winding alleyways and one blank house front looked very much like another to the locals display belonged to the interior of a house not the outside alvarez was beginning to mutter to himself when lou stopped at a door no different from half a dozen others nearby and said this is it i think how can you tell alvarez asked but lou was already knocking the door swung open revealing a spare but handsome man wearing a white chlamys and sandals with leather lacings reaching almost to his knees it was greek dress alvarez realized this must be kleandros himself good if kleandros was answering the door himself that must mean he was taking seriously the privacy instructions hed gotten alvarez looked him over in his own time he would have guessed kleandros to be in his midfifties but the wear and tear was harder here so he was probably younger still if he was a doctor he might take better care of himself than most of the locals maybe not thoughsome of the things the second century judged medicinal were amazing come in come in kleandros was saying you must be the gentlemen who inquired about my history lou admitted it very good will you join me in the courtyard the day is far too fine to be cooped up inside without need kleandros was not as rich a man as clodius eprius who had used the income of his country estate to beautify his home in vesunna fewer rooms opened onto this courtyard and it was bare of the elegant statuary that had been eprius delight there was a fountain at the center of the courtyard though and flowers of many kinds and colors grew in neatly trimmed rows bright against drab plaster and pale stone the doctor seated his guests on a limestone bench and offered them wine when they accepted he served it to them in cups of the same redglazed ware eprius had used it was decorated with embossed reliefs and called terra sigillata or sealingwax ware after the color of the glaze the stuff was everywhere in gaul it was made locally and had nearly driven the more expensive italian pottery from the market putting down his cup kleandros said now to business i am not eager to sell the history of hieronymos but i have a need for ready cash what will you give me for it a long haggle ensued lou had learned from his mistake with eprius not to show too much eagerness and as for kleandros he might have been arguing with some farmer over the price of a sack of beans alvarez was stifling yawns when they finally agreed that twentyeight aurei did not seem too unreasonable lou was not yawning he was sweating whew kleandros said you drive a hard bargain my friend i suppose you would like to inspect the work now i would lou agreed wait a moment then and i will fetch it kleandros disappeared into the house while he was gone lou counted out the requisite number of gold coins and made a little pile of them kleandros face lit up when he returned with the scrolls and saw the money splendid he said scooping up the aurei im glad you brought what money you needed with you waiting is hard on the nerves he studied the coins intently so much so that alvarez began to worry perhaps noticing the time traveler watching him the doctor grinned and said its amazing how much more handsome an emperors face is when you see it on gold true mark said and he grinned back for the first time he got a hint of his partners point of view kleandros didnt seem like a bad fellow for a savage the doctor idly flipped a goldpiece in the air once twice three times lou had been reading the work kleandros had given him at first his grin had been as wide as the greeks but little by little it fell from his face replaced first by puzzlement and then by anger what are you trying to palm off on us he demanded of kleandros this is not hieronymos of kardias history its the work of diodoros of sicily who borrowed from him alvarezs newfound liking for kleandros flickered and blew out muscles bunched in his arms as he rose if this downtime dimbulb was trying to cheat them he was going to remember it for the rest of his life a crash behind him made him whirl hand darting for his gun half a dozen fully armored romans had burst from their concealment within kleandros house and were rushing him swords drawn faces grim over their shields lou screamed in terror and started to run barking an oath alvarez snapped off a quick shot it went wild before he could fire again kleandros seized his arm and dragged it down desperate now alvarez smashed at the doctor with his left fist kleandros fell with a groan but by then the soldiers were on the time traveler a sword knocked the gun from his hand it flew spinning into the flowers punching and kicking to the last he was borne to the ground and trussed like a hog on the way to the slaughterhouse lou muller got the same treatment a magnificent flying tackle had brought him down just inside kleandros front door one of alvarezs captors a broadshouldered grizzled fellow of about fifty knelt over him saying i arrest you for the murder of clodius eprius alvarez spat at him in return he got a buffet that loosened his teeth eprius was a friend of mine the roman said you were right tero another trooper said they are human after all i told you so afer you owe me two aurei tero turned to kleandros and helped him to his feet a dark bruise was forming under the doctors left eye but he did not seem badly hurt the byplay went on without much attention from alvarez he was in pain and sunk deep in despair the timer would automatically return to twentyfour hours after it recharged unless someone reset it and it did not look as if he or lou would have the chance he was stuck here and now forever no revise thathis future here looked limited too he realized tero was saying something to him but did not take the trouble to understand tero kicked him in the ribs not unkindly and repeated tell me barbarian how many years lie between our time and yours alvarez felt his world coming apart somehow these savages had managed to seize him and now they knew his secret as well he strained wildly at his bonds trying to break free but one thing the romans plainly knew was how to tie firm knots you are the barbarians he shouted tero and kleandros bent over him faces intent its true then the greek whispered you do come from the future utterly beaten alvarez said yes i thought so tero breathed quite by accident it occurred to me how much more we know now than the heroes of the trojan wars that set me thinkinghow much more still would the men who come after us learn surely they would have powers we do not terrible weapons who knows what simpler things too the ability to make one coin just like another for instance how do you do that anyway molds alvarez said dully ah interesting its neither here nor there though even after i got my notion i still had to figure out why the men of the future would want anything from us in the first place that stymied me for a long long time by my own logic you had to have everything we do and more besides and then eprius body servant found that one of his masters books was missing a rare one rare kleandros interjected if i had known eprius had a copy of the aleadai i might have killed him myself you see tero said its so easy for a book to be lost forever if few copies are made of it works like the aleadai are valuable nowhow much more would they be worth in some future time if between now and then theyd been lost altogether a great deal i have no doubt enough to steal for enough to kill for once we knew the sort of thing you were after it was easy enough to set a trap and you walked right into it kleandros added my apologies for not using an authentic copy of hieronymos of kardia but you see no one in town owns one this was all a bad dream alvarez though it could not be happening to be caught was bad enough but then to be lectured by these stupid barbarians he must have said that aloud for teros lips tightened he realized the english phrase was close enough to the latin from which it had come to let the romans understand him us barbarians tero said on the contrary what are the marks of the barbarian surely one is acting without thinking ahead to see what results might come of what you do did you do that when you used your thunder weapon hardly and because we were ignorant of your device did you think us dolts you were stupid to reveal it to us at all no man from another time if either of us deserves to be called a barbarian it is you he stood and turned to his men take them away he said departures one of the most enjoyable games in science fiction is to imagine how history would have changed if one of its great figures had taken a different path if alexander the great hadnt died young if napoleon had if julius caesar hadnt been assassinated if franklin d roosevelt had but secular leaders are not the only people who shape history here is an example of another sort of figure not performing as he did in the world we know the monks at irruhaiyeh did not talk casually among themselves they were not hermits those who wanted to be pillar sitters like the two saints simeon went off into the syrian desert by themselves and did not join monastic communities still the rule of saint basil enjoined silence through much of the day despite the cappadocian fathers rule though a whispered word ran through the monastery regardless of the canonical hour the persians the persians are marching toward irruhaiyeh the abbot isaac heard the whispers though the monks had to shout when they spoke to him isaac was past seventy with a white beard that nearly reached his waist but he had been abbot here for more than twenty years and had been a simple monk for thirty years before that he knew what his charges thought almost before they thought it isaac turned to the man he hoped would one day succeed him it will be very bad this time john i feel it the prior shruggedit will be as god wills father abbot he was half the abbots age roundfaced and always smiling what from other men might have seemed prophecy of doom came from his lips as a prediction of good fortune isaac was not cheered not this time i wonder if god does not mean this to be the end for us christians the persians have come to irruhaiyeh before john said stoutly they raided they moved on when their campaigns were through they went back to their homeland once more and life resumed i was here isaac agreed they came in the younger justins reign and tiberius and maurices as you say they left again soon enough or were driven off but since this beast of a phokas murdered his way to the throne of the roman empire shh john looked around only one monk was nearby on his hands and knees in the herb gardenone never knows who may be listening i am too old to fear spies overmuch john the abbot said chuckling at that moment the monk in the herb garden sat back on his haunches so he could wipe sweat from his strong swarthy face with the sleeve of his robe isaac chuckled again and can you seriously imagine him betraying us john laughed too that one no you have me there ever since he came to us hes thought of nothing but his hymns nor can i blame him for they are a gift from god isaac said truly he must be inspired to sing the lords praises so sweetly when he knew not a word of greek before he fled his horrid paganism to become a christian and a monk romanos the melodist was a convert too they sayborn a jew some of our brothers hymns are a match for his i think john said perhaps they love christ the more for first discovering him with the full faculties of grown men it could be so isaac said thoughtfully then as the monk in the garden resumed his work the abbot came back to his worries when i was younger we all knew the persians were harriers not conquerors sooner or later our soldiers would drive them back this time i think they are come to stay johns sunny face was not well adapted to showing concern but it did now you may be right father abbot since the general narses rebelled against phokas since germanos attacked narses since the persians beat germanos and leontios since phokas broke his own brothers pledge of safe conduct for narses and burned him alive since germanos was forced to become a monk for losing to the persians isaac took up the melancholy tale of roman troubles our armies now are a rabble those which have not fled who will who can make king khosroes soldiers leave the empire now john looked this way and that again and lowered his voice so that isaac had to lean close to hear him at all perhaps it would be as well if they did stay i wonder he went on wistfully if the young man with them truly is maurices son theodosios even with persian backing he would be better than phokas no john the abbot shook his head in grim certainty i am sure theodosios is dead he was with his father when phokas overthrew them and while the new emperor has many failings no one can doubt his talent as a butcher true enough john sighed well then father abbot why not welcome the persians as liberators from the tyrant because of what i heard from a traveler out of the east who took shelter with us last night he was from a village near daras where the persians have now decided how they will govern the lands they have taken from the empire he told me they were beginning to make the christians thereabouts become nestorians i had not heard that father abbot john said adding a moment later filthy heresy not to the persians they exalt nestorians above all other christians trusting their loyalty because we who hold to the right belief have persecuted them so they may no longer live within the empire isaac sadly shook his head all too often that trust has proved justified what shall we do then john asked i will not abandon the faith but in truth i would sooner serve the lord as a living monk than as a martyr though his will be done of course he crossed himself so did isaac his eyes twinkled i do not blame you my son i have lived most of my life so i am ready to see god and his son face to face whenever he desires but i understand how younger men might hesitate some to save their lives might even bow to heresy and forfeit their souls i think therefore that we should abandon irruhaiyeh so no one will have to face this bitter choice john whistled softly as bad as that his glance slid to the monk in the garden who had looked up but went back to his weeding when the priors eye fell on him as bad as that isaac echoed i need you to begin drawing up plans for our withdrawal i want us to leave no later than a week from today so soon father abbot as you wish of course you know you have my obedience shall i arrange for our travel west to antioch or south to damascus i presume you will want us safe behind a citys walls yes but neither of those the abbot said john stared at him in surprise isaac went on i doubt damascus is strong enough to stand against the storm that is rising and antioch antioch is all in commotion since the jews rose and murdered the patriarch may god smile upon him besides the persians are sure to make for it and it can fall i was a tiny boy the last time it did the sack i have heard was ghastly i would not want us caught up in another such what then father abbot john asked puzzled now ready us to travel to constantinople john if constantinople falls to the persians surely it could only portend the coming of the antichrist and the last days of the world even that may come i find it an evil time to be old constantinople the city johns voice held awe and longing from the pillars of herakles to mesopotamia from the danube to nubia all through the roman empire constantinople was the city every man dreamed of seeing it before he died the prior ran fingers through his beard his eyes went distant as he began to think of what the monks would need to do to get there he never noticed isaac walking away what did call him back to his surroundings was the monk leaving the herb garden a few minutes later had the fellow simply passed by john would have paid him no mind but he was humming as he walked which disturbed the priors thoughts silence brother john said reprovingly the monk dipped his head in apology before he had gone a dozen paces he was humming again john rolled his eyes in rueful despair taking the music from that one was the next thing to impossible for it came upon him so strongly that it possessed him without his even realizing it had he not produced such lovely hymns the prior thought people might have used the word possessed in a different sense but no demon surely could bring forth glowing praise of the trinity and the archangel gabriel john dismissed the monk from his mind he had many more important things to worry about a nomisma for that donkey that piece of crow bait the monk clapped a hand to his tonsured pate in theatrical disbelief a goldpiece you bandit may satan lash you with sheets of fire and molten brass for your effrontery better you should ask for thirty pieces of silver that would only be six more and would show you for the judas you are after fierce haggling the monk ended up buying the donkey for ten silver pieces less than half the first asking price as the trader put the jingling miliaresia into his pouch he nodded respectfully to his recent opponent holy sir you are the finest bargainer i ever met at a monastery i thank you suddenly the monk was shy not the fierce dickerer he had seemed a moment before looking down to the ground he went on i was a merchant one before i found the truth of christ the trader laughed i might have known he monk a shrewd onceover from out of the south id guess by your accent just so the monks eyes were distant remembering i was making my first run up to damascus i heard a monk preaching in the marketplace i was not even a christian at the time but it seemed to me that i heard within methe voice of the archangel gabriel saying follow and follow i have all these years since my caravan went back without me a strong call to the faith indeed holy sir the trader said crossing himself but if you ever wish to return to the world seek me out for a reasonable share of the profits i know you will bring in i would be happy to stake you as a merchant again the monk smiled teeth white against tanned dark skin and graystreaked black beard thank you but i am content and more than content with my life as it is inshallah he laughed at himself here ive been working all these years to use only greek and recalling what i once was makes me forget myself so easily theou thelontos i should have saidgod willingi would have spent all my days here at irruhaiyeh but that is not to be no the trader looked east no smoke darkened the horizon there not yet but both men could see it in their minds eyes i may find a new home for myself as well god grant you good fortune the monk said and you holy sir if i have more beasts to sell be sure i shall look for a time when you are busy elsewhere spoken like a true thief the monk said they both laughed the monk led the donkey away toward the stables they were more crowded now than at any other time he could recall with horses camels and donkeys some the monks would ride others would carry supplies and the monasterys books and other holy gear words and music filled the monks mind as he walked toward the refectory by now the words came more often in greek than in his native tongue but this time perhaps because his haggle with the merchant had cast his memory back to the distant pagan days he did not often think of anymore the idea washed over him in the full guttural splendor of his birth speech sometimes he crafted a hymn line by line word by word fighting against stubborn ink and papyrus until the song had the shape he wanted he was proud of the songs he shaped that way they were truly his sometimes though it was as if he saw the entire shape of a hymn complete at once then the praises to the lord seemed almost to write themselves his pen racing over the page not as an instrument of his own intelligence but rather as a channel through which god spoke for himself those hymns were the ones for which the monk had gained a reputation that reached beyond syria he often wondered if he had earned it god deserved more credit than he did but then he would remind himself that was true in all things this idea he had now was of the second sort a flash of inspiration so blinding that he staggered and almost fell unable to bear up under its impact for a moment he did not even knowor carewhere he was the words the glorious words reverberating in his mind were all that mattered and yet because the inspiration came to him in his native language his intelligence was also engaged how could he put his thoughts into words his fellows here and folk all through the empire would understand he knew he had to god would never forgive him nor he forgive himself if he failed here the refectory was dark but since it was filled with summer air and sweating monks not cool the monk took a loaf and a cup of wine he ate without tasting what he had eaten his comrades spoke to him he did not answer his gaze was inward fixed on something he alone could see suddenly he rose and burst out there is no god but the lord and christ is his son that said what he wanted to say and said it in good greek though without the almost hypnotic intensity the phrase had in his native tongue still he saw it served his purpose several monks glanced his way and a couple having heard only the bare beginning of the song made the sacred sign of the cross he noticed the others in the refectory only peripherally only later would he realize he had heard john say in awe to the abbot isaac the holy fit has taken him again for the prior was right the fit had taken him and more strongly than ever before words poured from somewhere deep within him he is the kindly the merciful who gave his onlybegotten son that man might live the lord will abide forever in glory father son and holy spirit which of the lords blessings would you deny on and on he sang the tiny part of him not engaged in singing thanked god for granting him what almost amounted to the gift of tongues his spoken greek especially when dealing with things of the world was sometimes halting yet again and again now he found the words he needed that had happened before but never like this there is no god but the lord and christ is his son ending as he had begun the monk paused looking around for a moment as he slowly came back to himself his knees failed him he sank back to his bench he felt drained but triumphant the only comparison he knew was most unmonastic he felt as he had just after a woman he rarely thought these days of the wife he had left with all else when he had given over the world for the monastery he wondered if she still lived she was a good deal older than he with very human vanity he wondered if she ever thought of him with his own characteristic honesty he doubted it the marriage had been arranged it was not her first probably it would not have been her last either the touch of the priors hand on his arm brought him fully back to the confines he had chosen as his own that was most marvelous john said i count myself fortunate to have heard it the monk dipped his head in humility you are too kind reverend sir i do not think so john hesitated and went on anxiously i trusti prayyou will be able to write down your words so those not lucky enough to have been here on this day will yet be able to hear the truth and grandeur of which you sang the monk laughedagain he thought as he might have at any small thing after going in unto his wifehave no fear there reverend sir the words i recited are inscribed upon my heart they shall not flee me may it be as you have said the prior told him john did not however sound as if he believed him to set his mind at ease the monk sang the new hymn again this time not in the hot flush of creation but as one who brought out an old and longfamiliar song you see reverend sir he said when he was done what the lord the most bountiful one has granted me shall not be lost now i have been present at two miracles john said crossing himself hearing your song the first time and then a moment later again with not one single change not a different word that i noticed with his mind the monk felt of the texture of his creation comparing his first and second renditions of the hymn there were none he said confidently i would take oath to it before christ the judge of all no need on my account i believe you john said still even miracles i suppose may be stretched too far therefore i charge you go at once to the writing chamber and do not leave it until you have written out three copies of your hymn keep one yourself give me one and give the third to any other one of the brethren you choose for the first time in his life the monk dared protest his priors command but reverend sir i should not waste so much time away from the work of preparing for our journey to the city one monks absence will not matter so much there john said firmly do as i tell you and we will bring to constantinople not only our humble selves but also a treasure for all time in your words of wisdom and prayer that is why i bade you write out three copies if the worst befall and the persians overrun us which god prevent then one might still reach the city and one must i think these words are too important to be lost the monk yielded it shall be as you say then i had not thought on why you wanted me to write out the hymn three timesi thought it was only for the sake of father son and holy spirit to his amazement john bowed to him you are most saintly thinking only of the world of the spirit as prior though i have also to reckon with this worlds concerns you give me too much credit the monk protested under his swarthy skin he felt himself grow hot remembering how moments ago he had been thinking not of the world to come but of his wife your modesty becomes you was all john said to that the prior bowed again discomfiting the monk even more now i hope you will excuse me for i have my work to see to three fair copies mind i expect from you in that matter i will accept no excuses the monk made one last try please reverend sir let me labor too and write later when our safety is assured surely i will earn the hatred of my brethren for being idle while they put all their strength into readying us to go you are not idle john said sternlyyou are in the service of the lord as are they you are acting under my orders as are they only vicious fools could resent that and vicious fools will have to deal with me the prior set his jaw they will do as you say reverend sir the monk said who could dare disobey john but they will do it from obedience alone not from conviction if you take my meaning i know what you mean the prior said chuckling how could i be who i am and not know it here though you are wrong not a man who was in the refectory and heard your hymn will bear you any but the kindest of wills all will be as eager as i am to have it preserved i hope you are right the monk said john laughed again how could i be wrong after all i am the prior he thumped the monk on the back now go on and prove it for yourself with more than a little trepidation the monk did as he had been ordered he was surprised to find john right though he sat alone in the writing chamber from time to time monks bustling past paused a moment to lean their burdens against the wall stick their heads in the doorway and encourage him to get his song down on papyrus the words flowed effortlessly from his penas had told the prior they truly were inscribed upon his heart he took that to be another sign of gods speaking directly through him with this hymn he sometimes found writing a barrier the words that sang in his mind seemed much less fine when written out and other times his pen could not find the right words at all and what came from it was not the fine thing he had conceived but only a clumsy makeshift not today when he finished the first copy the crucial one he compared it to what he had sung it was as if he had seen the words of the hymn before him as he wrote here they were again as pure and perfect as when the lord had given them to him he bent his head in thanksgiving he took more papyrus and began the second and third copies usually when he was copying his eyes went back to the original every few words now he hardly glanced at it he had no need not today he was no fine calligrapher but his hand was clear enough after so long at irruhaiyeh writing from left to right had even begun to seem natural to him the bell rang for evening prayer the monk noticed startled that the light streaming in through the window was ruddy with sunset had his task taken any longer he would have had to light a lamp to finish it he rubbed his eyes felt for the first time how tired they were maybe he should have lit a lamp he did not worry about it even if the light of the world was failing the light of the holy spirit had sustained him while he wrote he took the three copies of the hymn with him as he headed for the chapel john he knew would be pleased that he had finished writing in a single afternoon so much still remained to be done before the monks left irruhaiyeh donkeys brayed horses snorted camels groaned as if in torment isaac knew they would have done the same had their loads been a single straw rather than the bales and panniers lashed to their backs the abbot stood outside the monastery gates watching monks and beasts of burden file past the leavetaking made him feel the full weight of his years he rarely felt them but irruhaiyeh had been his home all his adult life one does not abandon half a century and more of roots without second thoughts isaac turned to john who stood as he so often did at the abbots right hand may it come to pass one day isaac said that the persians be driven back to their homeland so our brethren may return here in peace and may you lead that return father abbot singing songs of rejoicing in the lord john said the priors eyes never wandered from the gateway as each animal and man came by he made another check mark on the long roll of papyrus he held isaac shook his head i am too old a tree to transplant all other soil will seem alien to me i shall not flourish elsewhere foolishness john said for all his effort though his voice lacked conviction not only was he uneasy about reproving the abbot in any way he also feared that isaac knew whereof he spoke he prayed both he and his superior were wrong as you will the abbot sounded reassuringdeliberately so john thought isaac knew john had enough to worry about right now the procession continued at last it came to an end almost three hundred monks were trudging west in hope and fear is everyone safely gone isaac asked john consulted his list now black with checks he frowned have i missed someone he shouted to the nearest monk in the column the monk shook his head the question ran quickly up the line and was met everywhere with the same negative response john glowered down at the unchecked name and muttered under his breath hes off somewhere devising another hymn the prior growled to isaac well and goodon any day but this by your leave he started back into the nowabandoned monastery yes go fetch him isaac said be kind john when the divine gift takes him he forgets all else ive seen john nodded but even for that we have no time today not if we hope to stay in this world so god may visit us with his gifts entering irruhaiyeh after the monks had gone out of it was like seeing the corpse of a friendno john thought like the corpse of his mother for the monastery had nurtured and sheltered him as much as his fleshly parents had hearing only the wind whistle through the courtyard seeing doors flung carelessly open and left so forever made john want to weep his head came up the wind was not quite all he heard somewhere among the deserted buildings a monk was singing quietly to himself as if trying the flavor of words on his tongue john found him just outside the empty stables his back was turned so even as the prior drew near he caught only snatches of the new hymn he was not sure he was sorry this song seemed to be the complement of the one the monk had created in the refectory instead of praise for the lord it told of the pangs of hell in terms so graphic that ice walked johns back for the unbelievers for the misbelievers the scourge their hearts shall leap up and choke them demons shall seize them by feet and forelocks seething water shall be theirs to drink and the monk broke off abruptly jumping in surprise as johns hand fell on his shoulder come brother mouamet the prior said gently not even for your songs will the persians delay everyone else has gone now we wait only on you for a moment he did not think the monk saw him then mouamets face cleared thank you reverend sir he said with the lord giving me this hymn id forgotten the hour the abstracted expression that had raised awe in john briefly returned i think i shall be able to recover the thread good the prior said and meant it but now ill come with you mouamet finished for him sandals scuffing in the dust they walked together out of the monastery and set out on the long road to constantinople islands in the sea ive written a series of stories set in a world where muhammad instead of founding islam converted to christianity on a trading mission into syria and ended his days a monk the previous tale in this book departures shows his monastic life a later one here will look at that world several hundred years after his conversion the world of islands in the sea looks at the other side of the coin and considers what things might have been like had the byzantine empire instead of shielding southeastern europe from islam for hundreds of years collapsed under the weight of an early arab onslaught in our history muslim forces twice besieged constantinople in and but the byzantine capital held and the empire survived as christianitys eastern bulwark holding islam out of anatolia and the balkans for centuries to come while converting the bulgars and russians to faith in christ but what if the empire had fallen in the eighth century instead of the fifteenth the stillpagan folk to the north of constantinople would have had new choices to make ah ad the bulgar border guards had arrows nocked and ready as the arab horsemen rode up from the south jalal addin asstambuli the leader of the arab delegation raised his right hand to show it was empty in the name of allah the compassionate the merciful i and my men come in peace he called in arabic to be sure the guards understood he repeated himself in greek the precaution paid off the guards lowered their bows in greek much worse than jalal addins one of them asked why for you come in peace whitebeard jalal addin stroked his whiskers even without the bulgars mockery he knew they were white not many men who had the right to style themselves asstambuli the constantinopolitan still lived more than fifty years had passed since the army of suleiman and maslama had taken constantinople and put an end to the roman empire then jalal addins beard had not been white then he could hardly raise a beard at all he spoke in greek again my master the caliph abd arrahman asked last year if your khan telerikh would care to learn more of islam of submission to the one god this past spring telerikh sent word that he would we are the embassy sent to instruct him the bulgar who had talked with him now used his own hissing language jalal addin supposed to translate for his comrades they answered back some of them anything but happily they were content in their paganism jalal addin guessedcontent to bum in hell forever he did not wish that fate on anyone even a bulgar the guard who knew greek confirmed his thought saying why for we want your god gods spirits ghosts good to us now jalal addin shrugged your khan asked to hear more of allah and islam that is why we are here he could have said much more but deliberately spoke in terms a soldier would understand telerikh want telerikh get the guard agreed he spoke again with his countrymen at length pointed at two of them this iskur this omurtag they take you to pliska to where telerikh is iskur him know greek a little not so good like me know little your tongue too iskur said in halting arabic which surprised jalal addin and evidently the bulgar who had been doing all the talking till now the prospective guide glanced at the sun which was a couple of hours from setting we ride he declared and started off with no more fanfare than that the bulgar called omurtag followed so more slowly did jalal addin and his companions by the time iskur called a halt in deepening twilight the mountains that made the northern horizon jagged were visibly closer those little ponies the bulgars ride are ugly as mules but they go and go and go daud ibn zubayr said he was a veteran of many skirmishes on the border between the caliphs land and bulgaria he stroked the mane of his elegant arabbred mare sadly my old bones do not jalal addin groaned with relief as he slid off his own horse a softgaited gelding once he had delighted in fiery stallions but he knew that if he took a fall now he would shatter like glass the bulgars stalked into the brush to hunt daud bent to the laborious business of getting a fire going the other two arabs malik ibn anas and salman altabari stood guard one with a bow the other with a spear iskur and omurtag emerged into firelight carrying partridges and rabbits jalal addin took hard unleavened bread from a saddlebag no feast tonight he thought but not the worst of fare either iskur also had a skin of wine he offered it to the arabs and grinned when they declined more for me omurtag he said the two bulgars drank the skin dry and soon lay snoring by the fire daud ibn zubayr scowled at them the only use they have for wits is losing them he sneered how can such folk ever come to acknowledge allah and his prophet we arabs were winebibbers too before muhammad forbade it to us jalal addin said my worry is that the bulgars passion for such drink will make khan telerikh less inclined to accept our faith daud dipped his head to the older man truly it is just that you lead us sir like a falcon you keep your eye ever on our quarry like a falcon i sleep in the evening jalal addin said yawning and like an old falcon i need more sleep than i once did your years have brought you wisdom daud ibn zubayr hesitated as if wondering whether to go on finally he plunged is it true sir that you once met a man who had known the prophet it is true jalal addin said proudly it was at antioch when suleimans army was marching to fight the greeks at constantinople the grandfather of the innkeeper with whom i was quartered lived with him still he was a medinan far older then than i am now for he had soldiered with khalid ibn alwalid when the city fell to us and before that as a youth he accompanied muhammad when the prophet returned in triumph from medina to mecca allahu akbar daud breathed god is great i am further honored to be in your presence tell me diddid the old man grant you any hadith any tradition of the prophet that you might pass on to me for the sake of my enlightenment yes jalal addin said i recall it as if it were yesterday just as the old man did when speaking of the journey to the holy city abu bakr who was not yet caliph of course for muhammad was still alive started beating a man for letting a camel get loose the prophet began to smile and said see what this pilgrim is doing abu bakr was abashed though the prophet did not actually tell him to stop daud bowed low i am in your debt he repeated the story several times jalal addin nodded to show him he had learned it perfectly in the timehonored way daud went on i have this hadith from jalal addin asstambuli who had it fromwhat was the old mans name sir he was called abd alqadir who had it from abd alqadir who had it from the prophet think of itonly two men between muhammad and me daud bowed again jalal addin returned the bow then embarrassed himself by yawning once more your pardon i pray truly i must sleep sleep then and allah keep you safe till the morning comes jalal addin rolled himself in his blanket and you son of zubayr those are no mean works daud said a week later pointing ahead to the earthen rampart tall as six men that ringed pliska telerikhs capital that is a childs toy next to the walls of constantinople jalal addin said a double wall each one twice that height all steep stone well ditched in front and between with all the greeks in the world it seemed battling from atop them across half a century recalling the terror of the day of the assault he wondered still how he had survived i was born in constantinople daud reminded him gently of course you were jalal addin shook his head angry at himself for letting past obscure present that way it was something old men did but who cares to remember he is old daud glanced around to make sure iskur was out of earshot lowered his voicefor pagan savages those are no mean works and see how much land they enclosepliska must be a city of greater size than i had supposed no jalal addin remembered a talk with a previous envoy to telerikh the town itself is tiny this earthwork serves chiefly to mark off the grazing lands of the khans flocks his flocks is that all daud threw back his head and laughed i feel as if i am transported to some strange new world where nothing is as it seems i have had that feeling ever since we came through the mountain passes jalal addin said seriously daud gave him a curious look he tried to explain you are from constantinople i was born not far from damascus where i dwell yet a long journey from one to the other much longer than from constantinople to pliska daud nodded and yet it is a journey through sameness jalal addin went on not much difference in weather in crops in people aye more greeks more christians in constantinople still for we have ruled there so much less time than in damascus but the difference is of degree not of kind that is all true daud said nodding again whereas here aye here jalal addin said with heavy irony the olive will not grow here the sun fights its way through mists that swaddle it as if it were a newborn babe and even a greek would be welcome for the sake of having someone civilized to talk to this is a different world from ours and not one much to my liking still we hope to wed it to ours through islam daud said so we do so we do submission to the will of god makes all men one now jalal addin made sure iskur was paying no attention the nomad had ridden ahead jalal addin went on even bulgars daud chuckled iskur yelled something at the guards lounging in front of a wooden gate in pliskas earthen outwall the guards yelled back iskur shouted again louder this time with poor grace the guards got up and opened the gate they stared as they saw what sort of companions iskur led jalal addin gave them a grave salute as he passed through the gate as much to discomfit them as for any other reason he pointed ahead to the stone wall of pliska proper you see i see daud said the rectangular wall was less than half a mile on a side in our lands that would be a fortress not a capital the gates of the stone wall were open jalal addin coughed as he followed iskur and omurtag into the town pliska stank likestank worse thana big city jalal addin shrugged sooner or later he knew he would stop noticing the stench not far inside the gates stood a large building of intricately carved wood this telerikhs palace iskur announced tethered in front of the palace were any number of steppe ponies like the ones iskur and omurtag rode and also jalal addin saw with interest several real horses and a mule whose trappings did not look like arab gear to whom do those belong he asked pointing not know iskur said he cupped his hands and yelled toward the palace yelling jalal addin thought wryly seemed the usual bulgar approach toward any problem after a little while a door opened the arab had not even noticed it until then so lost was its outline among carvings as soon as they saw someone come out of the palace iskur and omurtag wheeled their horses and rode away without a backward glance at the ambassadors they had guided to pliska the man who had emerged took a moment to study the new arrivals he bowed how may i help you my masters he asked in arabic fluent enough to make jalal addin sit up and take notice we are envoys of the caliph abd arrahman come to your fine cityjalal addin knew when to stretch a pointat the bidding of your khan to explain to him the glories of islam i have the honor of addressing he let the words hang i am dragomir steward to the mighty khan telerikh dismount be welcome here dragomir bowed again he was jalal addin guessed in his late thirties stocky and well made with fair skin a full brown beard framing a rather wide face and gray eyes that revealed nothing whatevera useful attribute in a steward jalal addin and his companions slid gratefully from their horses as if by magic boys appeared to hitch the arabs beasts to the rails in front of the palace and carry then saddlebags into it jalal addin nodded at the other fullsized horses and the mule to whom do those belong pray he asked dragomir the stewards pale but hooded eyes swung toward the hitching rail and returned to jalal addin those he explained are the animals of the delegation of priests from the pope of rome at the bidding of my khan to expound to him the glories of christianity they arrived earlier today late that night daud slammed a fist against a wall of the chamber the four arabs shared better they should stay pagan than turn christian he shouted not only was he angry that telerikh had also invited christians to pliska as if intending to auction his land to the faith that bid highest he was also shorttempered from hunger the evenings banquet had featured pork furthermore telerikh had not attended some heathen bulgar law required the khan always to eat alone that is not so jalal addin said mildly and why not daud glared at the older man as christians they would be dhimmispeople of the book and thus granted a hope of heaven should they cling to their pagan practices their souls will surely belong to satan till the end of time satan is welcome to their souls whether pagan or christian daud said but a christian bulgaria allied to rome maybe even allied to the franks would block the true faiths progress northward and could be the spearpoint of a thrust back toward constantinople jalal addin sighed what you say is true still the true faith is also true and the truth surely will prevail against christian falsehoods may it be so daud said heavily but was this land not once a christian country back in the days before the bulgars seized it from constantinople all the lands the greeks held followed their usages some folk hereabouts must be christian still id wager which might incline telerikh toward their beliefs a knock on the door interrupted the argument daud kept one hand on his knife as he opened the door with the other but no enemies stood outside only four girls two were colored like dragomirto jalal addins eyes exotically fair the other two were dark darker than arabs in fact one had eyes that seemed set at a slant all four were pretty they smiled and swayed their way in telerikh is no christian jalal addin said as he smiled back at one of the lightskinned girls christians are not allowed concubines the more fools they daud said shall i blow out the lamps or leave them burning leave them jalal addin answered i want to see what i am doing jalal addin bowed low to khan telerikh a pace behind him daud did the same another pace back malik ibn anas and salman altabari went to one knee as suited their lower rank rise all of you telerikh said in passable arabic the khan of the bulgars was about fifty swarthy broadfaced widenosed with a thin beard going from black to gray his eyes were narrow hard and shrewd he looked like a man well able to rule a nation whose strength came entirely from the ferocity of its soldiers most magnificent khan we bring the greetings of our master the caliph abd arrahman ibn marwan his prayers for your health and prosperity and gifts to show that you stand high in his esteem jalal addin said he waved salman and malik forward to present the gifts silver plates from persia damascuswork swords fine enamelware from constantinople a robe of glistening chinese silk and last but not least a quran bound in leather and gold its calligraphy the finest the scribes of alexandria could provide telerikh though seemed most interested in the robe he rose from his wooden throne undid the broad bronze belt he wore and shrugged out of his kneelength fur caftan under it he had on a linen tunic and trousers and low boots dragomir came up to help him put on the robe he smiled with pleasure as he ran a hand over the waterysmooth fabric very pretty he crooned for a moment jalal addin hoped he was so taken by the presents as to be easily swayed but telerikh as the arab had guessed from his appearance was not so simple he went on the caliph gives lovely gifts with his riches he can afford to now please take your places while the envoys of the pope of rome present themselves dragomir waved the arab delegation off to the right of the throne close by the turbaned boyarsthe great nobleswho made up telerikhs court most were of the same stock as then khan a few looked more like dragomir and the fair girl jalal addin had so enjoyed the night before fair or dark they smelled of hardrun horses and ancient sweat as he had with the caliphs embassy dragomir announced the papal legates in the throaty bulgarian tongue there were three of them as jalal addin had seen at the banquet two were gorgeous in robes that reminded him of the ones the constantinopolitan grandees had worn so long ago as they vainly tried to rally their troops against the arabs the third wore a simple brown woolen habit amid the bulgar chatter meaningless to him jalal addin picked out three names niketas theodore and paul the christians scowled at the arabs as they walked past them to approach telerikh they bowed as jalal addin had stand telerikh said in greek jalal addin was not surprised he knew that language the bulgars had dealt with constantinople before the arabs took it and many refugees had fled to pliska others had escaped to italy which no doubt explained why two of the papal legates bore greek names excellent khan one of the envoys said also in greek we are saddened to see you decked in raiment given you by our foes as you greet us does this mean you hold us in contempt and will give us no fair hearing surely you did not invite us to travel so far merely for that telerikh blinked glanced down at the silk robe he had just put on no he said it only means i like this present what presents have you for me daud leaned forward and whispered into jalal addins ear more avarice in that one than fear of hell jalal addin nodded that made his task harder not easier he would have to play politics along with expounding the truth of islam he sighed ever since he learned telerikh had also bid the men from rome hither hed expected no less the christians were presenting their gifts and making a great show of it to try to disguise their not being so fine as the ones their rivals had givenjalal addins offerings still lay in a glittering heap beside telerikhs throne here theodore intoned is a copy of the holy scriptures with a personal prayer for you inscribed therein by his holiness the pope constantine jalal addin let out a quiet but scornful snort the words of allah are the ones that count he whispered to daud ibn zubayr not those of any man it was dauds turn to nod as he had with the quran telerikh idly paged through the bible perhaps halfway through he paused and glanced up at the christians you have pictures in your book it sounded almost like an accusation had jalal addin said it it would have been but the christian in the plain brown robe the one called paul answered calmly yes excellent khan we do the better to instruct the many who cannot read the words beside them he was no longer younghe might have been close to jalal addins agebut his voice was light and clear and strong the voice of a man sure in the path he had chosen beware of that one daud murmured he has more holiness in him than the other two put together jalal addin had already reached the same conclusion and did not like it enemies he thought ought by rights to be rogues he got only a moment to mull on that for telerikh suddenly shifted to arabic and called to him why are there no pictures in your book to show me what you believe because allah the one god is infinite far too mighty for our tiny senses to comprehend and so cannot be depicted he said and man must not be depicted for allah created him in his image from a clot of blood the christians own scriptures say as much but they ignore any law which does not suit them liar misbeliever theodore shouted torchlight gleamed off his tonsured pate as he whirled to confront jalal addin no liar i jalal addin said not for nothing had he studied with men once christian before they saw the truth of muhammads teaching the verse you deny is in the book called exodus is this true telerikh rumbled scowling at the christians theodore started to reply paul cut him off excellent khan the verse is as the arab states my colleague did not wish to deny it theodore looked ready to argue paul did not let him continuing but that law was given to moses long ago since then christ the son of god has appeared on earth belief in him assures one of heaven regardless of the observance of the outdated rules of the jews telerikh grunted a new law may replace an old if circumstances change what say you to that envoy of the caliph i will quote two verses from the quran from the sura called the cow jalal addin said smiling at the opening paul had left him allah says the jews say the christians are astray and the christians say it is the jews who are astray yet they both read the scriptures which is to say magnificent khan that they have both corrupted gods word and again they say allah has begotten a son allah forbid when reciting from the quran he had naturally fallen into arabic he was not surprised to see the christians following his words without difficulty they too would have prepared for any eventuality on this mission one of telerikhs boyars called something to the khan in his own language malik ibn anas who was with jalal addin precisely because he knew a little of the bulgar speech translated for him he says that the sacred stones of their forefathers even the pagan gods of the slavs they rule have served them well enough for years upon years and calls on telerikh not to change their usages now looking around jalal addin saw more than a few boyars nodding great khan may i speak he called telerikh nodded jalal addin went on great khan you need but look about you to see proof of allahs might is it not true that my lord the caliph abd arrahman peace be unto him rules from the western sea to india from your borders to beyond the deserts of egypt even the christians who know the one god imperfectly still control many lands yet only you here in this small country follow your idols does this not show you their strength is a paltry thing there is more excellent khan niketas who had been quiet until then unexpectedly spoke up your false gods isolate bulgaria how in dealing with christians or even muslims can your folk swear an oath that will be trusted how can you put the power of god behind a treaty to ensure it will be enforced in what way can one of you lawfully marry a christian other questions like these will surely have occurred to you else you would not have bid us come he speaks the truth khan telerikh jalal addin said he had not thought a priest would have so good a grasp of matters largely secular but niketas did since his words could not be denied supporting them seemed better than ignoring them telerikh gnawed on his mustaches he looked from one delegation to the other then back again tell me he said slowly is it the same god both groups of you worship or do you follow different ones that is an excellent question jalal addin said no telerikh was no foolit is the same god there is no god but god but the christians worship him incorrectly saying he is three not one it is the same god paul agreed once more apparently overriding theodore muhammad is not a true prophet and many of his preachings are lies but it is the same god who gave his only begotten son to save mankind stop telerikh held up a hand if it is the same god what difference does it make how i and my people worship him no matter what the prayers we send up to him surely he will know what we mean jalal addin glanced toward paul the christian was also looking at him paul smiled jalal addin found himself smiling back he too felt the irony of the situation he and paul had more in common with each other than either of them did with the naive bulgar khan paul raised an eyebrow jalal addin dipped his head granting the christian permission to answer telerikhs question sadly excellent khan it is not so simple paul said just as there is only one true god so there can be only one true way to worship him for while he is merciful he is also just and will not tolerate errors in the reverence paid him to use a homely example sir would it please you if we called you khan of the avars it would please me right well were it true telerikh said with a grim chuckle worse luck for me though the avars have a khan of their own very well priest i see what you are saying the bulgar ruler rubbed his chin this needs more thought we will all gather here again in three days time to speak of it further go now in peace and rememberhe looked sternly from christians to muslimsyou are all my guests here no fighting between you or you will regret it thus warned the rival embassies bowed their way out jalal addin spent more time before his next encounter with the priests exploring pliska than he had hoped to no matter how delightful he found his fairskinned pleasure girl he was not a young man for him between rounds meant between days after the barbarous richness of telerikhs wooden palace the arab found the rest of the town surprisingly familiar he wondered why until he realized that pliska like damascus like constantinople like countless other settlements through which he had passed at one time or another had been a roman town once layout and architecture lingered long after overlords changed jalal addin felt like shouting when he found a bath house not only still standing but still in use from what his nose had told him in the palace hed doubted the bulgars even suspected cleanliness existed when he went in he found most of the bathers were of the lightercolored folk from whom dragomir and his mistress had sprung they were hed gathered peasant slavs over whom the bulgars proper ruled he also found that being mostly unacquainted with either christianity or islam they let in women along with the men it was scandalous it was shocking in damascus it would have raised riots jalal addin wished his eyes were as sharp as theyd been when he was forty or even fifty he was happily soaking in a warm pool when the three christian envoys came in theodore hissed in horror when he saw the naked women spun on his heel and stalked out niketas started to follow but paul took hold of his arm and stopped him the older man shrugged out of his brown robe and sank with a sigh of pleasure into the same pool jalal addin was using sergios by his expression still dubious joined him a moment later flesh is flesh paul said calmly by pledging yourself to christ you have acknowledged that its pleasures are not for you no point in fleeing then jalal addin nodded to the christians you have better sense sir than i would have looked for in a priest he told paul i thank you if paul heard the undercurrent of irony in the arabs voice he did not let it affect his own tone which briefly shamed jalal addin paul went on i am no priest in any case only a humble monk here to advise my superiors if they care to listen to me only jalal addin scoffed but he had to admit to himself that the monk sounded completely sincere he sighed hating his opponents would have been much easier were they evil they would be wise to listen to you he said i think you are a holy man you give me too much credit paul said no he does not niketas told his older colleague not just by words do you instruct the barbarians hereabouts but also through the life you live which by its virtues illuminates your teachings paul bowed from a man squatting naked in waistdeep water the gesture should have seemed ludicrous somehow it did not niketas turned to jalal addin did i hear correctly that you are styled asstambuli you did the arab answered proudly how strange niketas murmured perhaps here god grants me the chance to avenge the fall of the queen of cities he spoke as if the caliphs armies had taken constantinople only yesterday not long before he was born seeing jalal addins confusion paul said niketas mother is anna the daughter of leo yes jalal addin was polite but that meant nothing to him and my mother was zinawb the daughter of muin ibn abd alwahhab what of it ah but your grandfather however illustrious he may have been i do not slight him i assure you was never basileus ton rkomaionemperor of the romans that leo jalal addin thumped his forehead with the heel of his hand he nodded to niketas your grandfather sir was a very devil he fought us with all he had and sent too many brave lads to paradise before their time niketas raised a dark eyebrow his tonsured skull went oddly with those bushy brows and the thick beard that covered his cheeks almost to the eyes too many you say i would say not enough so you would jalal addin agreed had leo beaten us you might be roman emperor yourself now but abd arrahman the commander of the faithful rules constantinople and you are a priest in a foreign land it is as allah wills so i must believe niketas said but just as leo fought you with every weapon he had i shall oppose you with all my means the bulgars must not fall victim to your false belief it would be too great a blow for christendom to suffer removing from us all hope of greater growth niketas mind worked like an emperors jalal addin thought unlike many of his christian colleagues he understood the long view hed shown that in debate too when he pointed out the problems attendant on the bulgars staying pagan a dangerous foepope constantine had sent to pliska the best the christians had whether that would be enough jalal addin shrugged it is as allah wills he repeated and telerikh paul said when jalal addin looked at him in surprise the monk went on of course telerikh is in gods hands too but god will not be influenced by what we do telerikh may there is that jalal addin admitted no telling how long all this arguing will go on telerikh said when the christian and muslim embassies appeared before him once more he spoke to dragomir in his own language the steward nodded and hurried away a moment later lesser servants brought in benches which they set before telerikhs throne sit the khan urged you may as well be comfortable how would you have us argue jalal addin asked wishing the bench had a back but too proud to ask for a chair to ease his old bones tell me of your one god telerikh said you say you and the christians follow him tell me what you believe differently about him so i may choose between your beliefs jalal addin carefully did not smile he had asked his question to seize the chance to speak first let the christians respond to him he began where any muslim would with the shahada the profession of faith la illaha illallah muhammadun rasuluilah there is no god but allah muhammad is the prophet of allah believe that magnificent khan and you are a muslim there is more of course but that is of the essence it is also a lie theodore broke in harshly excellent khan the books of the old testament written hundreds of years before gods son became flesh foretold his coming neither old nor new testament speaks one word of the arab charlatan who invented this false creed because he had failed as a camel driver there is no prophecy pertaining to muhammad in the christians holy books because it was deliberately suppressed jalal addin shot back that is why god gave the prophet his gifts as the seal of prophecy the seal of trickery is nearer the truth theodore said gods only begotten son jesus christ said that prophecy ended with john the baptist but that false prophets would continue to come muhammad lived centuries after john and jesus so he must be false a trick of the devil to send men to hell jesus is no son of god god is one not three as the christians would have it jalal addin said hear gods own words in the quran say god is one the christians give the one god partners in the socalled son and holy spirit if he has two partners why not three or four or more foolishness and how could god fit into a womans womb and be born like a man more foolishness again it was theodore who took up the challenge he was a badtempered man but capable all the same god is omnipotent to deny the possibility of the incarnation is to deny that omnipotence that priest is twisty as a serpent daud ibn zubayr whispered to jalal addin the older man nodded frowning he was not quite sure how to respond to theodores latest sally who was he to say what allah could or could not do telerikh roused him from his unprofitable reverie by asking so you arabs deny jesus is the son of your one god eh we do jalal addin said firmly what do you make of him then the khan said allah commands us to worship none but himself so how can he have a son jesus was a holy man and a prophet but nothing more since the christians corrupted his words allah inspired muhammad to recite the truth once more could a prophet rise from the dead on the third day as gods son did theodore snorted clapping a dramatic hand to his forehead christs miracles are witnessed and attested in writing what miracles did muhammad work none the reason being that he could not he flew to jerusalem in the course of a night jalal addin returned as the quran recordsin writing he added pointedly and the crucifixion and resurrection are fables no man can rise from the dead and another was set on the cross in place of jesus satan waits for you in hell blasphemer theodore warned christ healed the sick raised the dead stopped wind and rain in their tracks anyone who denies him loses all hope of heaven and may garner for his sin only eternal torment no that is the fate reserved for those who make one into three jalal addin said you wait both of you telerikh held up a hand the bulgar khan jalal addin thought seemed more stunned than edified by the arguments he had heard the arab realized he had been quarreling with theodore rather than instructing the khan telerikh went on i cannot find the truth in what you are saying for each of you and each of your books makes the other a liar that helps me not at all tell me instead what i and my people must do if we follow one faith or the other if you choose the arabs false creed you will have to abandon both drinking wine and eating pork theodore said before jalal addin could replylet him deny it if he may the priest shot the arab a triumphant look it is true jalal addin said stoutly allah has ordained it he tried to put a bold face on it but knew theodore had landed a telling blow the mutter that went up from telerikhs boyars confirmed it a passion for wine inflamed most nonbelievers jalal addin thought sadly despite the good counsel of the quran it could capture muslims as well and as for porkjudging from the meals they served at pliska the bulgars found it their favorite flesh that is not good telerikh said and the arabs heart sank a passion for wine passion magnificent khan may i ask without offense how many wives you enjoy telerikh frowned i am not quite sure how many is it now dragomir fortyseven mighty khan the steward replied at once competent as usual and your boyars jalal addin went on surely they also have more than one apiece well what of it the khan said sounding puzzled now jalal addin grinned an unpleasant grin at theodore if you become a christian magnificent khan you will have to give up all your wives save one you will not even be able to keep the others as concubines for the christians also forbid that practice what if telerikh had frowned before the scowl he turned on the christians now was thunderous can this be true of course it is true theodore said scowling back bigamy is a monstrous sin gently my brother in christ gently paul said we do not wish to press too hard upon our bulgar friends who after all will be newly come to our observances that one is truly a nuisance daud whispered you are too right jalal addin whispered back still excellent khan paul went on you must not doubt that theodore is correct when you and your people accept christianity all those with more than one wifeor women with more than one husband if any there bewill be required to repudiate all but their first marriages and to undergo penance under the supervision of a priest his easy matteroffact manner seemed to calm telerikh i see you believe this to be necessary the khan said it is so strange though that i do not see why explain further if you will jalal addin made a fist he had expected christian ideas of marriage to appall telerikh not to intrigue him with their very alienness was a potential monk lurking under those fur robes under that turban paul said celibacy excellent khan is the highest ideal for those who cannot achieve it marriage to a single partner is an acceptable alternative surely you must know excellent khan how lust can inflame men and no sin is so intolerable to prophets and other holy men as depravity and sexual license for the holy spirit will not touch the heart of a prophet while he is engaged in an erotic act the life of the mind is nobler than that of the body on this holy scripture and the wise ancient aristotle agree i never heard of this ah aristotle was he a shaman telerikh asked you might say so paul replied which impressed jalal addin the arab knew little of aristotle hardly more than that he had been a sage before even roman times he was certain however that aristotle had been a civilized man not a barbarous pagan priest but that was surely the closest equivalent to sage within telerikhs mental horizon and paul deserved credit for recognizing it the bulgar khan turned to jalal addin what have you to say about this the quran permits a man four lawful wives for those able to treat them equally well jalal addin said for those who cannot it enjoins only one but it does not prohibit concubines that is better the khan said a man would get bored bedding the same woman night after night but this business of no pork and no wine is almost as gloomy he gave his attention back to the priests you christians allow these things yes excellent khan we do paul said hmm telerikh rubbed his chin jalal addin did his best to hide his worry the matter still stood balanced and he had used his strongest weapon to incline the khan to islam if the christians had any good arguments left heand the fate of the true faith in bulgariawere in trouble paul said excellent khan these matters of practice may seem important to you but in fact they are superficial here is the key difference between the arabs faith and ours the religion muhammad preached is one that loves violence not peace such teaching can only come from satan i fear that is a foul stinking lie daud ibn zubayr cried the other two arabs behind jalal addin also shouted angrily silence telerikh said glaring at them do not interrupt i shall give you a chance to answer in due course yes let the christian go on jalal addin agreed i am sure the khan will be fascinated by what he has to say glancing back he thought daud about to burst with fury the younger man finally forced out a strangled whisper have you gone mad to stand by while this infidel slanders the prophet may blessings be upon his head i think not now be still as telerikh said my ears are not what they once were i cannot listen to you and paul at once the monk was saying muhammads creed urges conversion by the sword not by reason does not his holy book if one may dignify it by that tide preach the holy war the jihadhe dropped the arabic word into his polished greek against all those who do not share his faith and those who are slain in their murderous work says the false prophet attain to heaven straightaway he turned to jalal addin do you deny this i do not jalal addin replied you paraphrase the third sura of the quran there you see paul said to telerikh even the arab himself admits the ferocity of his faith think also on me nature of the paradise muhammad in his ignorance promises his followers why do you not speak daud ibn zubayr demanded you let this man slander and distort everything in which we believe hush jalal addin said again rivers of water and milk honey and wine and men reclining on silken couches and being servedserved in all ways including pandering to their fleshly lusts as if souls could have such concernsby females created especially for the purpose paul paused needing a moment to draw in another indignant breath such carnal indulgencesnay excesseshave no place in heaven excellent khan no what does then telerikh asked awe transfigured the monks thin ascetic face as he looked within himself at the afterlife he envisioned heaven excellent khan does not consist of banquets and wenches those are for gluttons and sinners in this life and lead to hell in the next no paradise is spiritual in nature with the soul knowing the eternal joy of closeness and unity with god peace of spirit and absence of all care that is the true meaning of heaven amen theodore intoned piously all three christians made the sign of the cross over their breasts that is the true meaning of heaven you say telerikhs bluntfeatured face was impassive as his gaze swung toward jalal addin now you may speak as you will man of the caliph has this christian told accurately of the world to come in his faith and in yours he has magnificent khan jalal addin spread his hands and smiled at the bulgar lord i leave it to you sir to pick the paradise you would sooner inhabit telerikh looked thoughtful the christian clerics expressions went from confident to concerned to horrified as they gradually began to wonder as jalal addin had already just what sort of heaven a barbarian prince might enjoy daud ibn zubayr gently thumped jalal addin on the back i abase myself before you sir he said flowery in apology as arabs so often were you saw farther than i jalal addin bowed on his bench warmed by the praise his voice urgent the priest niketas spoke up excellent khan you need to consider one thing more before you make your choice eh and what might that be telerikh sounded distracted jalal addin hoped he was the delights of the muslim paradise were worth being distracted about pauls version on the other hand struck him as a boring way to spend eternity but the khan worse luck was not altogether ready to abandon christianity on account of that jalal addin saw him focus his attention on niketas go on priest thank you excellent khan niketas bowed low think on this then in christendom the most holy pope is the leader of all things spiritual true but there are many secular rulers each to his own state the lombard dukes the king of the franks the saxon angle kings in britain the various irish princes everyone a free man but islam knows only one prince the caliph who reigns over all muslims if you decide to worship muhammad where is there room for you as ruler of your own bulgaria no one worships muhammad jalal addin said tardy he is a prophet not a god worship allah who alone deserves it his correction of the minor point did not distract telerikh from the major oneis what the christian says true the khan demanded do you expect me to bend the knee to your khan as well as your god why should i freely give abd arrahman what he has never won in battle jalal addin thought furiously all the while damning niketas priest celibate the man might be but he still thought like a greek like a roman emperor of constantinople sowing distrust among his foes so they defeated themselves when his own strength did not suffice to beat them well arab what have you to say telerikh asked again jalal addin felt sweat trickle into his beard he knew he had let silence stretch too long at last picking his words carefully he answered magnificent khan what niketas says is not true aye the caliph abd arrahman peace be unto him rules all the land of islam but he does so by right of conquest and right of descent just as you rule the bulgars were you were your people to become muslim without warfare he would have no more claim on you than any brother in islam has on another he hoped he was right and that the jurists would not make a liar of him once he got back to damascus all the ground here was uncharted no nation had ever accepted islam without first coming under the control of the caliphate well he thought if telerikh and the bulgars did convert that success in itself would ratify anything he did to accomplish it if telerikh showed no signs of having made up his mind i will meet with all of you in four days the khan said he rose signifying the end of the audience the rival embassies rose too and bowed deeply as he stamped between them out of the hall of audience if only it were easy jalal addin sighed the leather purse was small but heavy it hardly clinked as jalal addin pressed it into dragomirs hand the steward made it disappear tell me if you would jalal addin said as casually as if the purse had never existed at all how your master is inclined toward the two faiths about which he has been learning you are not the first person to ask me that question dragomir remarked he sounded the tiniest bit smug ive been bribed twice jalal addin translated mentally was the other person who inquired by any chance niketas the arab asked telerikhs steward dipped his head why yes now that you mention it his iceblue eyes gave jalal addin a careful onceover men who could see past their noses deserved watching smiling jalal addin said and did you give him the same answer you will give me why certainly noble sir dragomir sounded as if the idea of doing anything else had never entered his mind perhaps it had not i told him as i tell you now that the mighty khan keeps his own counsel well and has not revealed to me which faithif eitherhe will choose you are an honest man jalal addin sighed not as helpful as i would have hoped but honest nonetheless dragomir bowed and you noble sir are most generous be assured that if i knew more i would pass it on to you jalal addin nodded thinking it would be a sorry spectacle indeed if one who served the caliph the richest mightiest lord in the world could not afford a more lavish bribe than a miserable christian priest however lavish the payment though it had not bought him what he wanted he bowed his way out of telerikhs palace and spent the morning wandering through pliska in search of trinkets for his fairskinned bedmate here too he was spending abd arrahmans money so only the finest goldwork interested him he went from shop to shop sometimes pausing to dicker sometimes not the rings and necklaces the bulgar craftsmen displayed were less intricate less ornate than those which would have fetched the highest prices in damascus but had a rough vigor of their own jalal addin finally chose a thick chain studded with fat garnets and pieces of polished jet he tucked the necklace into his robe and sat down to rest outside the jewelers shop the sun blazed down it was not as high in the sky not as hot really as it would have been in damascus at the same season but this was muggy heat not dry and seemed worse jalal addin felt like boiled fish he started to doze assalamu aleykumpeace to you someone said jalal addin jerked awake and looked up niketas stood in front of him well hed long since gathered that the priest spoke arabic though theyd only used greek between themselves till now aleykum assalamuand to you peace he replied he yawned and stretched and started to get to his feet niketas took him by the elbow and helped him rise ah thank you you are generous to an old man and one who is no friend of yours christ teaches us to love our enemies niketas shrugged i try to obey his teachings as best i can jalal addin thought that teaching a stupid one the thing to do with an enemy was to get rid of him the christians did not really believe what they said either he remembered how theyd fought at constantinople even after the walls breached but the priest had just been kindno point in churlishly arguing with him instead the arab said allah be praised day after tomorrow the khan will make his choice known he cocked an eyebrow at niketas dragomir tells me you tried to learn his answer in advance which can only mean you did the same niketas laughed drily i suspect you learned no more than i did only that dragomir is fond of gold jalal addin admitted niketas laughed again then grew serious how strange is it not that the souls of a nation ride on the whim of a man both ignorant and barbarous god grant that he choose wisely from god comes all things jalal addin said the christian nodded that much they believed in common jalal addin went on that shows i believe why telerikh will decide for islam no you are wrong there niketas answered he must choose christ surely god will not allow those who worship him correctly to be penned up in one far corner of the world and bar them forever from access to whatever folk may lie north and east of bulgaria jalal addin started to answer then stopped and gave his rival a respectful look as he had already noticed niketas thought had formidable depth to it however clever he was though the priest who might have been emperor had to deal with his weakness in the real world jalal addin drove that weakness home if god loves you so well why has he permitted us muslims dominion over so many of you and why has he let us drive you back and back even giving over constantinople your imperial city into our hands not for your own sake im certain niketas snapped no why then jalal addin refused to be nettled by the priests tone because of the multitude of our own sins im sure not only wasischristendom sadly riddled with heresies and false beliefs even those who believe what is true all too often lead sinful lives thus your eruption from the desert to serve as gods flail and as punishment for our errors you have answers to everythingeverything but gods true will he will show that day after tomorrow through telerikh that he will with a stiff little bow niketas took his leave jalal addin watched him go wondering if hiring a knifeman would be worthwhile in spite of telerikhs warnings reluctantly he decided against it not here in pliska he thought in damascus he could have arranged it and never been traced but he lacked those sorts of connections here too bad only when he was almost back to the khans palace to give the pleasure girl the trinket did he stop to wonder whether niketas was thinking about sticking a knife in him christian priests were supposed to be above such things but niketas himself had pointed out what sinners christians were these days telerikhs servants summoned jalal addin and the other arabs to the audience chamber just before the time for midafternoon prayers jalal addin did not like having to put off the ritual it struck him as a bad omen he tried to stay serene voicing the inauspicious thought aloud would only give it power the christians were already in the chamber when the arabs entered jalal addin did not like that either catching his eye niketas sent him a chilly nod theodore only scowled as he did whenever he had anything to do with muslims the monk paul though smiled at jalal addin as if at a dear friend that only made him worry more telerikh waited until both delegations stood before him i have decided he said abruptly jalal addin drew in a sudden sharp breath from the number of boyars who echoed him he guessed that not even the khans nobles knew his will dragomir had not lied then the khan rose from his carved throne and stepped down between the rival embassies the boyars muttered among themselves this was not common procedure jalal addins nails bit into his palms his heart pounded in his chest till he wondered how long it could endure telerikh turned to face southeast for a moment jalal addin was too keyed up to notice or care then the khan sank to his knees his face turned toward mecca toward the holy city again jalal addins heart threatened to burst this time with joy la illaha illallah muhammadun rasulullah telerikh said in a loud firm voice there is no god but allah muhammad is the prophet of allah he repeated the shahada twice more then rose to his feet and bowed to jalal addin it is accomplished the arab said fighting back tears you are a muslim now a fellow in submission to the will of god not i alone we shall all worship the one god and his prophet telerikh turned to his boyars and shouted in the bulgar tongue a couple of nobles shouted back telerikh jerked his arm toward the doorway a peremptory gesture of dismissal the stubborn boyars glumly tramped out the rest turned toward mecca and knelt telerikh led them in the shahada once twice three times the khan faced jalal addin once more now we are all muslims here god is most great the arab breathed soon magnificent khan i vow many teachers will come from damascus to instruct you and your people fully in all details of the faith though what you and your nobles have proclaimed will suffice for your souls until such time as the ulamathose learned in religionmay arrive it is very well telerikh said then he seemed to remember that theodore niketas and paul were still standing close by him suddenly alone in a chamber full of the enemies of their faith he turned to them go back to your pope in peace christian priests i could not choose your religion not with heaven as you say it isand not with the caliphs armies all along my southern border perhaps if constantinople had not fallen so long ago my folk would in the end have become christian who can say but in this world as it is now muslims we must be and muslims we shall be i will pray for you excellent khan and for gods forgiveness of the mistake you make this day paul said gently theodore on the other hand looked as if he were consigning telerikh to the hottest pits of hell niketas caught jalal addins eye the arab nodded slightly to his defeated foe more than anyone else in the chamber the two of them understood how much bigger than bulgaria was the issue decided here today islam would grow and grow christendom continue to shrink jalal addin had heard that ethiopia far to the south of egypt had christian rulers yet what of it ethiopia was so far from the center of affairs as hardly to matter and the same fate would now befall the isolated christian countries in the far northwest of the world let them be islands in the muslim sea he thought if that was what their stubbornness dictated one day inshallah that sea would wash over every island and they would read the quran in rome itself he had done his share and more to make that dream real as a youth by helping to capture constantinople and now in his old age by bringing bulgaria the true faith he could return once more to his peaceful retirement in damascus he wondered if telerikh would let him take along that fairskinned pleasure girl he turned to the khan it couldnt hurt to ask not all wolves i got the idea for this one looking out the kitchen window while i was doing the dishes if s far from the only story notion thats come to me in an unexpected place while i was doing something that wasnt even remotely connected to writing the trick is to get the idea down on paper before you lose it again not all wolves is a story of mans inhumanity to man among other things archbishopric of cologne a full moon hung in the clear dark sky dieter ran through the streets of cologne mud splashed under the pads of his feet it flew up to stick in lumps in the matted fur of his tail he turned sharply and dashed down a narrow stinking alley much too close behind turn someone cried there he goes that way a score of men or more were hunting him their high excited shouts reminded him of the baying of wolves had he been in his own familiar body he might have laughed or cried or both at once in the wolfs shape he wore he could only whimper he tried to run faster torches appeared at the mouth of the alley casting a flickering light down its length dieters eyes saw that only as brighter grayness a wisp of breeze brought him the smell of torchsmoke and of his pursuers he could smell their fear and their resolve the men knew nothing of the wondrous things his nose told him any more than a deaf man could follow a minnesingers song but their eyes now were keener than his they were many and they could plan more shouts rang out there he is which way did he turn to the left no to the right you idiot yes to the right i saw him too klaus joachim and hans up to the street of the tailors and quickly dont let the cursed beast get through that way and one more cry over and over again kill the werewolf its not my fault dieter wanted to explain i do no harm but when he opened his wolfs jaws only a wolfs growl came out and those wolfs jaws he could not deny held a full set of wolfs teeth he could feel them jagged against his tongue which hung from the side of his mouth as he panted in the air he needed to run and run and run inside the body of a wolf though he kept the wits he had had as a boy if the street of the tailors was still unblocked he might yet break away from the pack yes that was the proper word he thought at his heels too late too late he heard klaus joachim and hans beat him to the comer they all carried torches two had clubs and the other a woodcutters ax they looked this way and that good dieter thought they did not know he was close by they were only three after all not twenty he sprang at them two screamed like lost souls and fled the third had more courage in him his club thudded against dieters ribs pain flared then died dieters flesh mended with unnatural speed had the fellow thought to swing the torch though he might have done true harm dieter gave him no chance to think of that he snarled horribly and ran by he was ahead of his pursuers again but he was not free of them as he had hoped the brave man pounded after him yelling his cries and the shrieks the other two were letting out were sure to draw the rest of the mob all dieter wanted was a place to be left alone to wait out the night come morning he knew he would be himself again thirteen an orphan making his living as best he could doing odd jobs for weavers and tanners enamelers and smiths was it four months ago the change first came on him other changes had started not long before then his voice bad begun to crack and to deepen fine fuzzy down appeared on his cheeks the second and thirdhand tunics and breeches he wore seemed suddenly to bind and to leave him bare at the wrists and ankles every lad he knew went through those changes but not every lad he knew turned into a wolf when the moon was full the first time it happened by luck dieter had been alone even after he struggled out of the clothes that no longer fit his new shape he did not realize fully what he was it was not until he changed back at sunrise and saw the wolfs prints in the dirt of the empty stable where hed spent the night did he begin to understand and with understanding came fear the next night of the full moon and the one after that he had sought out deserted places to wait through the change when he was a wolf he had no urge to tear the throat out of every man and beast he saw past stealing a flitch of bacon he had gone hungry on nights the change struck him he also had no illusions about the townsfolk believing that he had been on his way to hide this time too but that fat fool of a swordsmith had kept him working late and the moon rose while he was still on the street a woman screamed he could not really blame her had he seen someone turn from boy to wolf before his eyes he thought he would have screamed himself the hunt had been on ever since kill the werewolf he was growing heartily tired of that cry but the one that came after it made the hair along his spine stand up aye burn it in the old market square in front of saint martins church as we did the wizard last year the crowd people said had jammed the square dieter had not gone himself he had no stomach for such spectacles he had not escaped it altogether though the stench of burnt flesh lingered for days in front of the church even then he had taken more notice of smells than most folk no wonder he thought he imagined himselfin wolfs shape or boys it would not mattertied to a stake with little yellow flames licking through the fagots toward his tender flesh he threw back his head and howled a long cry of fear and desolation the shouts behind him redoubled dogs yelped frantically lights appeared in windows as people fetched lamps or candles from beside their beds to try to see what was going on some of them dieter knew would join the chase he should have kept quiet but the mere idea of burning had ripped the wail from him by god they would not bum him by god hope ran through him it was dizzying so much so that he almost stumbled into a pile of garbage at the edge of the street surely a priest could lift this curse from him he seldom went to church he had to worry about keeping his belly if not full then at least with something in iton sunday no less than any other day but he knew where every church in the town was they were likely places for workand handouts even had he been next door to saint martins he would not have gone there not after the shouts of burning him in front of it but saint martins lay close by the rhine far away from the ancient maze of streets through which he was running this central part of cologne he had heard went back to the legendary days of rome of rome he knew nothing save the name he did know he was near the church of saint cacilien if none of the men who hunted him was waiting down this street none was he turned right then left there stood saint caciliens church its doors open to the needy no one dieter thought had ever been more needy than he he climbed awkwardly up the stairsstairs were made for creatures with two legs not fourand into the church it looked different from the way he remembered and not just because he was seeing it only in shades of gray now his eyes were also lower to the ground the pews seemed a forest around him in boys shape too he hardly noticed the incense in the air it was just part of how churches smelled as a wolf though the bitterness of myrrh and frankincenses sharp spicy scent made his nose twitch and tingle he gasped then sneezed once twice three times a priest was walking up the aisle to the altar he carried a long staff with a crucifix on the end at the sneezes he whirled around in surprise good health to he began then stopped in horror when he saw whoor rather whathad sneezed dieter trotted toward him he opened his mouth to ask the priests blessing that showed him the one flaw in his plan as a wolf he could not tell the man what he needed the priest saw only a great hairy beast rushing at him with gaping jaws lieber gotthe gasped with no other weapon he could reach he swung his staff at the wolf the crucifix was silver the blow hurt dieter as much as if he had been human howling in pain and dismay he whirled about and fled from the church tail between his legs a wolf a wolf the priest shouted behind him some of the hunters were just drawing near saint caciliens they yelled and pointed when they saw dieter streak out they ran after him his savage growl though made them think twice about coming close having been hurt already he now acted and sounded fiercer than before but the men did cut him off from the new market square he growled deep in his throat so many streets led off the square he would have had his choice of escape routes instead his pursuers were forcing him awayand the priests hue and cry would only bring more people out after him already he could hear new voices smell new scents among those who chased him he was halfway down a street before it jogged to show him it had only the exit down which he had come a tall barred gate of stout timbers blocked the other end he yelped and whimpered too late to double back now his pursuers had plugged the way out they knew it too we have him now one shouted he cant get into the jews quarter at night come on dieter snarled this time at himself he should have remembered that the jews were closed off from the rest of the city between sunrise and sunset the men were coming closer fast he could not go back through them he stood there panting part of him the exhausted part wanted to lie down and give up the he thought of the flames again no he could not let the hunters take him he ran for the gate and flung himself upward he had imagined himself easily clearing the timbers landing lightly on the far side his head and forelegs cleared sure enough but his belly slammed against the gate hard enough to drive half the wind from him he hung there a moment stunned his hind feet scrabbled for purchase the wood was rough his claws bit leaving skin and hair behind he dragged himself over fell like a stone to the ground his undignified scrabble had let him be seen there he went a man yelled from other side of the gate the fellow pounded on it with his fist here you damned jews open up dieter raced away now he had time to find a hiding place without any of his pursuers liable to spot him diving for cover he would not keep that chance for long several men were battering at the gate one by the sound of it with an axe open up they shouted at the top of their lungs you damned stupid jews theres a werewolf loose among you that would make the gates open if anything did dieter thought he knew he never hurried to do anything for people who cursed him and called him names he suspected the jews were no different from him in that no matter that they had their own strange faith but he would run if someone screamed fire you fool the jews might swallow insults for the sake of hunting him down he rounded a corner and almost ran into an old man crossing the street they both stopped staring at each other the old jew did not run shrieking as many had behind dieter clamor grew either someone would come open the gate or soon the men who hunted him would break it down the frozen tableau that gripped dieter and the man could not last not with shouts of werewolf flying thick and fast dieter was about to run when the old jew spoke come with me and quickly he opened a door gestured urgently dieter hesitated all the wild wolfly instincts in him rebelled at trusting any man the boy he still was had trouble believing anyone would want to help him in his present state but the old man had not known he was coming no trap could be waiting for him inside that house and even if one somehow was what could a frail graybeard do against any wolf let alone a werebeast the sound of the gate creaking open decided him his hunters were in the jewish quarter and the jews likely would be after him too everyone was against him save this one old man he grabbed at that like a drowning man grabbing for a log he darted inside the old man shut the door behind themget under the table there he said when dieter had he draped a cloth over it that hung down to the floor on all sides then he lit a couple of candles at a little brazier and set them on the table dieters world the little square of it he could see went from black to gray the old man rustled about for another couple of minutes then sat down his knees pushed at the tablecloth now we wait he said dieter whined softly to show he had heard they did not wait long a knock came at the door avram are you there a man asked where else would i be with the candles lit the old jew said its late david why do you come around asking foolish questions avram will you please open up the other man david asked some of the good folk from outside the gate are with me they are searching they say for aa wolf the stool creaked as avram rose dieter heard him open the door a wolf in cologne so they say david told him they seemed most urgent we thought it wiser to let them come in no matter the hour is that the commotion i heard avram sounded grumpy and disapproving it was loud enough to disturb my studies too bad old jew dieter shivered at the sound of the new voiceit belonged to the man who had dared swing a club at him when a werewolf is loose in the city we dont care what we disturb to find it others shouted agreement well i have seen no wolves were or otherwise gentlemen ive been at my books since sundown may i go back to them since sundown you say why are your candles so long dieter had to clamp his jaws shut to keep from whimpering in terror not only was this hunter a brave man he also was no ones fool avram just shrugged dieter heard his robe rustle because the last pair guttered out not long ago and i lit these from them why else hrmmp youve seen or heard nothing out of the ordinary you say not till you came avram replied sharply you watch your mouth jew or youll watch the few teeth you have left go flying into the mud but after that the man turned back to his comrades if this old buggers been here all night the cursed beast cant have sneaked in on to the next house dieter heard them tramping away avram shut the door and walked back over to the table he did not lift the cloth very softly he said ill stay down here reading until these candles fail dont come out till then ill leave a dish of water for you youd be wiser to stay the night here i think in the morning in your proper shape youll have an easier time getting back to your own affairs dieter wished he could answer in words he thumped his tail against the floor avram grunted the old jew sat down began turning pages and every so often muttering to himself when one candle went out he got up as he had promised he poured water from a jug and set it by the table he blew out the other candle sleep well wolf he said he went up the stairs in the dark even though no one could see him now dieter did not come out for a long time when at last he did he bent his head over the bowl and lapped it dry then slurped drops of water from his chin and whiskers with his tongue fleeing was thirsty work he went back under the table to sleep if it grew light before he changed back to himself he wanted the concealment the cloth would bring he woke to find one of his feet poking a table leg one of his feet it was hairless clawless with five toes all in a row it was dirty but pink under the dirt he could see it was pink im dieter he whispered his mouth formed words he was a boy again he crawled out from under the table stood up he realized he was naked and saw he had a small scar on his belly that had not been there before a souvenir he supposed of his scramble over the gate he made a cloak of the tablecloth he had just wrapped it around himself when old avram came downstairs so thats what you look like eh the old jew said he handed dieter a bundle of clothes here put these on youre apt to look out of place wearing table linen in the street the clothes were not new but were better than what dieter was used to wearing they fit well enough as he dressed avram cut him cheese and bread for breakfast he had not known how hungry he was until he saw he had finished before avram was even half done with his smaller portion want more avram asked no thank you dieter paused thank you he said again in a different tone of voice the old jew gave a gruff nod it should be safe now to go back to your part of the city boy yes dieter started for the door then stopped he turned back to avram may i ask you something ask avram said around a mouthful of bread and cheese why did you save me dieter blurted i meaneveryone else who saw me wanted to kill me on sight what made you so different from the rest of them avram sat silent so long on his stool that dieter wondered if he had somehow offended him at last the old jew said slowly one thing you should remember alwaysyou are not the only one ever hunted down colognes streets dieter thought about that he never really had before jews falling victim to mobs were just part of life in the city to him like chamber pots being hurled into the street from secondfloor windows or famine one year in four the jews though he realized might not see it like that indeed avram was going on as much to himself as to dieter no lad and not all wolves run on four legs either you ask me the ones with two are worse keep clear of them and youll do all right he opened the door yesterday dieter thought as he stepped into the cool damp air of early morning he would have had no idea what the old jew was talking about now he knew with a last nod to avram he started down the street he would have to find some work to do if he expected to eat lunch clash of arms medieval heralds were endlessly ingenious this story springs from their habit of granting arms to all sorts of individuals every example of heraldry cited herein is genuine hmm if heraldry really is a science does that make clash of arms science fiction the tournament held every other year at the castle of thundertentronckh in westphalia always produced splendid jousting luring as it did great knights from all over europe indeed one tourney year the lure proved too much even for magister stephen de windesore who left his comfortable home outside london to travel to the wilds of germany you must understand at once that magister stephen did not arrive at the castle of thundertentronckh to break a lance himself far from it he was fat and well past fifty while that was also true of several of the knights there no more need be said than that magister stephen habitually rode a mule his sharpest weapon was his tongue and at the castle of thundertentronckh or to be more accurate in a tavern just outside the castle he was having trouble with that the westphalians used a dialect even more barbarous than his own english and his french i fear was more of the variety learned at stratfordattebowe than around paris on the other hand he spoke very loudly me i dont care a fig for cart horses and arrogant swaggerers in plate he declared to anyone who would listen to emphasize the point he gestured with a mug of beer some slopped over the edge and splashed the table he did not miss it it was thin bitter stuff next to the smooth english ale he liked you dont like jousts why did you come asked an italian merchant whose french that was hardly better than magister stephens the italian was chiefly interested in getting the best price for a load of pepper cinnamon and spikenard but he had an amateurs passion for deeds of dought magister stephen fixed him with a cold gray eye the arms man the arms well of course the arms arma virumque cano the merchant said proving that he owned some smattering of a classical education he made cutandthrust motions dear god if you are truly allwise why did you make so many dullards magister stephen murmured but in english returning to french he explained not weaponry what i mean is coats of arms heraldry blazonryd you understand me the italian smote his forehead with the heel of his hand ai the stupidity of me truly i am seventeen different kinds of the hindquarters of a shedonkey heraldry your honor meant and i myself an armigerous man you sir magister stephen eyed his chancemet comrade with fresh interest he certainly did not look as if he came from any knightly or noble line being small skinny excitable and dressed in mantle tunic and tights shabbier than stephens own still it could be the italians were freer with grants of arms to burgesses than were the northern countries indeed yes sir the merchant replied paying no attention to magister stephens scrutiny i am niccolo dello boscoof the woods you would say when i am at home you see i am to be found in the forest outside firenze it is a truly lovely town firenze do you know it unfortunately no magister stephen said he was thinking that it was not unfortunate at all he had been to milan once to watch a tourney and came away with a low opinion of italian manners and cookery that however was neither here nor there and your arms sir if i may ask but of course a proud shield you will agree gules a fess or between three frogs proper magister stephen whipped out quill and ink and a small sketchbook rather than carrying a variety of colors around for rough sketches he used different hatchings to show the tinctures vertical stripes for the red ground of the shield with dots for the broad gold horizontal band crossing the center of the escutcheon his frogs were lumpylooking creatures he glanced up at dello bosco who was watching him in fascination why three frogs proper he asked why not simply vert they are to be shown as spotted ah magister stephen made the necessary correction most interesting master dello bosco in england i know of but one family whose arms bear the frog or rather the toad that of botreaux whose arms are argent three toads erect sable the italian smiled from batracien no doubt a pleasant pun yes hmm magister stephen owned a remorselessly literal mind why so it is his chuckle was a little forced the approaching jingle of harness and clop of heavy hooves in the street told of another party of knights on its way to the castle of thundertentronckh anxious to see their arms magister stephen tossed a coin down on the tabletop and waited impatiently for his change he pocketed the sixth of a copper and hurried out of the tavern to his annoyance he was familiar with all but one of the newcomers shields he was just finishing his sketch of that one when dello bosco appeared at his elbow and nudged him theres something you wont find often the italian said nodding toward one of the stalls across the road a trader who cant give his stock away oh yes him magister stephen had noticed the bushybearded merchant in a caftan the day before he was a greek from thessalonike come to the castle of thundertontronckh with a cartload of fermented fish sauce to northern noses though the stuff smelled long dead now the greek was reduced to smearing it on heels of bread and offering them as free samples to people on the street most of whom took one good whiff and fled timeo danaos et donas ferentis dello bosco laughed watching yet another passerby beat a hasty retreat from the stall you know vergil well magister stephen said yes very well dello bosco agreed and magister stephen sniffed at the ready vanity of an italian another party of knights came clattering up the road toward the castle it seems our day for surprises dello bosco said pointing at one horsemans arms or have you seen pantheons before magister stephen did not answer he was drawing furiously he knew of the pantheon from his study of heraldic lore but he had not seen the mythical beast actually depicted on a shield it had the head of a doe a body that might have come from the same creature a foxs tail and cloven hooves it was shown in its proper colors the hooves sable body gules powdered with golden stars quite unusual magister stephen said at last tucking his sketchbook back inside his tunic then he turned to dello bosco who had been waiting for him to finish sir you astonish me not one in a thousand would have recognized a pantheon at sight the merchant drew himself up stiffly even so the crown of his head was below the level of magister stephens chin i am not one in a thousandi am myself and being armigerous is it not proper for me to know heraldry oh certainly only dello bosco might have been reading his thoughts for he divined the exact reason for the hesitation you think i am stupid for because i am not noble born eh why do i not thrash you for this he was hopping up and down in fury his cheeks crimson beneath their mediterranean swarthiness magister stephen cocked a massive fist i promise you you would regret the attempt do i care a fig for your promises you larded tun have a care with your saucy tongue knave or i will be the one to thrash you not only fat but a fool in my little finger i know more of heraldry than is in all your empty head magister stephens rage ripped freedamn me to hell if you do sir he roared loudly enough to make heads turn half a block away bigtalking pile of suet go home to mama i do not waste my time on you dello bosco gave a theatrical italian gesture of contempt spun on his heel and began to stalk away magister stephen seized him by the shoulder and hauled him back white around the lips the englishman grated dare to prove your boasts little man or i will kill you on the spot contest with me and we shall see which of us can put a question the other cannot answer what stake will you put up for this ah contest of yours dello bosco said wriggling free of the others grip magister stephen laughed harshly ask what you will if you win you shall not as for me all i intend is flinging you into a dung heap to serve you as you deserve for insolence to your betters wind wind wind dello bosco jeered as challenged i shall ask first is it agreed ask away the last question counts for all not the first very well then tell me if you will the difference between a mermaid and a melusine you have a fondness for monsters it seems magister stephen remarked no doubt it suits your character to your answer these german heralds have a fondness for melusines and draw them with two tails to the mermaids one dello bosco shrugged and spread his hands magister stephen said my turn now why is the bar sinister termed a mark of bastardy because all english speak french as poorly as you his opponent retorted barre is french for bend and the bend sinister does show illegitimacy any child knows that bars like the fess run straight across the shield and so cannot be called dexter or sinister magister stephen did his best to hide his chagrin they threw questions there at each other in the street and gave back answers as swiftly magister stephens wrath soon faded to be replaced by the spirit of competition all his wit focused on finding challenges for dello bosco and on meeting the italians some of those left him sweating wherever he had learned his heraldry dello bosco was a master magister stephen looked up amazed to realize it was twilight a pause for a roast capon and a bottle of wine he suggested then to my chamber and well have this out to the end still the belly first is it dello bosco said but he followed the englishman back into the inn from which they had come several hours before refreshed magister stephen climbed the stairs to the cubicles over the taproom he carried a burning taper in one hand and a fresh bottle in the other after lighting a lamp he stretched out his straw palliasse and waved dello bosco to the rickety footstool that was the little rented rooms only other furniture my turn is it not magister stephen asked at the italians nod he said give me the one british coat of arms that has no charge upon the shield a plague on you and all the british with you dello bosco said he screwed up his mobile face in thought and sat a long time silent just as a grinning magister stephen was about to rise he said i have it i think did not john of brittanythe earl of richmond that isbear simply ermine damnation magister stephen exploded and dello bosco slumped in relief then he came back with a sticker of his own what beast is it that has both three bodies and three ears magister stephen winced he frantically began reviewing the monsters of blazonry the lion tricorporate had but one head with the usual number of ears the chimaera hadno it had three heads and only one body the hydra was drawn in various ways with seven heads or three but again a single body having trouble dello bosco asked in the lamplight his eyes were enormous they seemed almost a deep crimson rather than black something that magister stephen had not noticed and that only added to his unease the hot eager gaze made him want to run like a rabbitlike a rabbit he let out a great chortle of joy the cony trijunct on the arms of harry well he exclaimed the bodies are disposed in the dexter and sinister chief points and in base each joined to the others by a single ear around the less point dello bosco sighed and relaxed once more still shuddering at his narrow escape magister stephen cudgeled his brain for the fitting revenge suddenly he smiled tell me the formal name of the steps to be depicted under the cross calvary but dello bosco answered at once grieces he came back with a complicated point of blazonry magister stephen made him repeat it then waded through two and three or a cross gules he finished panting a bit had you blazoned the first and fourth a barry of six instead of azure three bars or i would have had you dello bosco said yes i know yet even though magister stephen had given the correct response the feel of the contest changed he was rattled and asked the first thing that popped into his head dello bosco answered easily then he asked a question so convoluted as to make the one before elementary by comparison magister stephen barely survived it and took a long pull at the wine jar when he had finished again his opponent brushed aside his answering sally again he came back with a question of hideous difficulty the cycle repeated several times at every query magister stephens answers came more slowly and with less certainty dello bosco never faltered the lamp in the little room was running low on oil its dying flickers made dello bosco seem somehow bigger as if he were gathering strength from magister stephens distress every time he hurried a question now he leaned forward hands on his knees waiting for the englishmans stumbling replies like a hound that has scented blood he handled magister stephens next question on the difference between the english and continental systems for showing cadency with such a dazzling display of erudition that the englishman desperate as he was wanted to jot down notes but there was no time for that stretching lazily dello bosco said i grow weary of the game i fear so then a last one for you tell me what arms the devil bears what only the devil knows that magister stephen blurted at that moment the lamp went out yet the chamber was not dark for niccolo dello boscos eyes still glowed red like burning coals when he spoke again his voice was deeper richer and altogether without italian accent i see that you do not know in any case which is a great pity for you nor is it wise to bet with strangersbut then i told you you were a fool dello bosco chuckled and now to settle up the wager what was that you said damn me to hell if you do sir well that can be arranged he strode forward and laid hold of magister stephen his grip had claws dello bosco had not mentioned the mountain by the dark wood outside firenze or the gateway there or the writing above it lasciate ogni speranza voi chentrate magister stephen read as he was dragged through even in such straits he was observant and cried no wonder you said you knew vergil well indeed after all he lives with me then the lesser demons took control of their new charge from their master to show their service they bore his arms gules a fess or between three frogs proper magister stephen found that very funnybut not for long pillar of cloud pillar of fire ive written seven stories that feature the exploits of basil argyros a fourteenthcentury byzantine official in a world where muhammad was monk rather than prophet see also departures and islands in the sea in this volume six of those stories appear together in the collection agent of byzantium new york congdon amp weed this is the seventh chronologically it fits between the second and third chapters of agent of byzantium like the others in the series however it is intended to stand by itself as well basil argyros shadow was only a small black puddle on the deck timbers under his feet the sun stood almost at the zenith higher in the sky than he had ever known it he used the palm of his hand to shield his eyes from its fierce glare as he peered southward past the ships bowsprit the blue waters of the middle sea stretched unbroken before him he turned to a sailor hurrying past did the captain not say wed likely spot land today the sailor a lean suntoasted man who wore only loincloth and sandals gave a wry chuckle likelys not certain sir and todays not done his greek had a strong hissing egyptian accent he was heading home argyros wanted to ask another question but the fellow had not paused to wait for it he had work to keep him busy aboard ship passengers had little better to do than stand around talk and gambleargyros was up a couple of gold nomismata for the trip even so he had been bored more often than not he remembered a time when he would have relished the chance to spend a week or so just thinking those were the days before his wife and infant son had died in the smallpox epidemic at constantinople two years ago now when his mind was idle it kept drifting back to them he peered south again hoping the pretense of purpose would hold memory at bay sometimes it worked sometimes it didnt today it didnt not very well still getting away from the imperial capital helped give distance to his sorrow that was why he had volunteered to go to alexandria his fellow magistrianoi looked at him as if they thought he was mad likely they did anything that had to do with egypt meant trouble right now though argyros relished trouble the more the better a troubled present would keep him too occupied to think back to his anguished past he could a shout from the port rail snapped him out of his reverie the pharos cried a passenger obviously another man with time on his hands i see the stub of the pharos his arm stabbed out argyros hurried to join him looking in the direction he was pointing sure enough he saw a white tower thrusting itself up past the smooth sea horizon the magistrianos shook his head in chagrin i would have spied it before if id looked southeast instead of due south he said the man beside him laughed this must be your first trip across the open ocean if you think we can sail straight to where were going i count us lucky to have come so close we wont have to put in at some village to ask where we are and risk being pirated if the pharos were fully rebuilt its beacon fire and the smoke from it could be spied a days sail away argyros said and the lord went before them by day in a pillar of cloud to lead them the way and by night in a pillar of fire to give them light to go by day and night he and the other man both crossed themselves at the biblical quotation so did the sailor with whom argyros had spoken before he said sirs captains have been petitioning emperors to get the pharos rebuilt since the earthquake knocked it down a lifetime ago theyre only now getting around to it he spat over the rail to show what he thought of the workings of the roman empires bureaucracy argyros who was part of that bureaucracy understood and sympathized with the sailors feelings magistrianoisecret investigators agents sometimes spiescould not grow hidebound not if they wanted to live to grow old but officials with lawbooks had governed the empire from constantinople for almost a thousand years no wonder they often moved slow as flowing pitch the wonder sometimes was that they moved at all the man who had first seen the pharos said seems to me the blasted egyptians are more to blame for all the delays than his majesty nikephoros he turned to argyros for support dont you think so sir i know little of such things the magistrianos said mildly he shifted to latin a tongue still used in the empires western provinces but hardly ever heard in egypt do you understand this speech a little why the passenger asked the sailor not following shook his head because i can use it to remind you it might not be wise to revile egyptians when the crew of this ship is nothing else but the man blinked then gave a startled nod if the sailor had been offended he got no chance to do anything about it just then the captain shouted for him to help shift the lines to the foresail as the ship swung toward alexandria as well were west of the city argyros observed the run into the merchantmens harbor will be easier than if we had to sail around the island of pharos so it will the other passenger nodded then he paused took a long look at the magistrianos for someone who says he knows little of alexandria youre well informed argyros shrugged annoyed with himself for slipping it might not matter now but could prove disastrous if he did it at the wrong time he did know more of alexandria than he had let onhe knew as much as anyone could who had never come there before research seemed a more profitable way to spend his time than mourning he even knew why the pharos was being restored so slowly despite nikephoros interest in having it shine once more that was why he had come knowing what to do about the problem was something else again no one in alexandria seemed to that too was why hed been sent the ship glided into the harbor of eunostoshappy return the island of pharos from which the famous lighthouse drew its name shielded the harbor from storms out of the north while the heptastadion the sevenfurlong causeway from the mainland to pharos divided it from the great harbor to the east the great harbor was reserved for warships the heptastadion was not quite what argyros had expected hed not thought to ask much about it and the ancient authors who had written of it termed it an embankment so it had been in their time but centuries of accumulating silt had made it into an isthmus almost a quarter mile wide houses and shops and manufactories stood alongside the elevated roadway to the island the magistrianos frown drew his heavy eyebrowseyebrow really for the hair grew together above his nosedown over his deepset eyes he wondered what else he would find that was not in the books ships and boats of all types and sizes filled the harbor of eunostos tubby squarerigged merchantmen like the one on which argyros traveled fishing boats with shortluffed lugsails that let them sail closer to the wind manyoared tugs two of those strode spiderlike across the water to argyros vessel as it neared the harbors granite quays brail up your sail there a man called from one of them the sailors rushed to obey the tugs their bows padded with great coils of rope chivied the ship into place against one of the quays sailors threw lines to waiting dockmen who made the merchantman fast to the dock argyros slung his duffel over his shoulder belted on his sword and climbed the gangplank as he stepped onto the quay one of the line handlers pointed to the blade and said you want to be careful whipping that out friend this heres a big cityyou get caught using a sword in a brawl and the prefects menll chop off your thumbs to make sure you dont do it twice the magistrianos looked down his long thin nose i live in constantinoplenot just a city but the city only in alexandria would anyone have disagreed with that but the dockman just grunted and said newcomer he gave the word a feminine ending so argyros knew it meant constantinople and not himself before constantine had turned sleepy byzantium into the new rome alexandria had been the premier city of the roman east its citizens plainly still remembered and resented the magistrianos carried his gear down the quay and into the city he thought about walking along the heptastadion to take a close look at the troubled pharos right away but decided to settle in first the weight of the duffel bag which seemed to grow heavier at every step he took played a large part in his decision he found a room not far from where the heptastadion joined the mainland the crosstopped domes of the nearby church of st athanasios gave him a landmark that would be visible from a good part of alexandria though the towns streets made an orderly grid argyros was glad for any extra help he could get in finding his way around by the time he had unpacked the sun was setting in crimson splendor above the gate of the moon to the west making headway with alexandrian officials he had been warned was an allday undertaking no point in trying to start just as night was falling he bought a loaf of bread some onions and a cup of wine at the tavern next to his lodgings then went back hung the gauzy mosquitonetting he had rented over his bed and went to sleep he dreamed of helen helen as she was before the smallpox had robbed her of first her beauty and then her life he dreamed of her laughing blue eyes of the way her lips felt on his of her sliding a robe from her white shoulders of her intimate caresshe woke then he always woke then the sweat that bathed him did not spring from the weather the north wind kept alexandria pleasant in summer he stared into the darkness wishing the dream would either leave him or just once go on a few seconds more he had not touched a woman since helen died in the first months of mourning he thought long and hard about abandoning the secular world for the peace of the monastery the thought went through him still now and again but what sort of monk would he make when as the dreams so clearly showed fleshly pleasures yet held such power in his mind slowly slowly he drifted back toward sleep maybe he would be luckyor unluckyenough to find the dream again in constantinople a letter with the seal and signature of george lakhanodrakon would instantly have opened doors and loosened tongues for argyros the master of offices was one of the chief ministers of the basileus of the romans argyros was too junior a magistrianos to know the leader of the corps at all well but who could tell thatwho would risk angering george lakhanodrakonfrom the letter it worked in alexandria too but only after a fashion and only in conjunction with some outandout bribery two weeks everything argyros had won on board ship and three nomismata more disappeared before a secretary showed him into the office of mouamet dekanos deputy to the augustal prefect who governed egypt for the basileus dekanos a slight dark man with large circles under his eyes read quickly through the letter argyros presented to him render this my trusted servant the same assistance you would me for he has my full confidence the administrator finished he shoved the pile of papyri on his desk to one side making a clear space in which he set the document from the capital ill be glad to help you uh argyros your business i can hope to finish one day which is more than i can say for this mess here he scowled at the papyri he had just moved illustrious sir argyros said dekanos was important enough for him to make sure he sounded polite this mess here the prefects deputy repeated with a sour sort of pride goes all the way back to the days of my name saint of saint mouamet argyros felt his jaw drop but its whatseven hundred years now since he converted to christianity so it is dekanos agreed so it is if you know that i suppose you know of the persian invasion that sent him fleeing from his monastery to constantinople the magistrianos nodded born a pagan arab mouamet had found christ on a trading run into syria and ended his life as an archbishop in distant ispania he had also found a gift for hymnography his canticles in praise of god and christ were still sung all through the empire after such a remarkable and holy life no wonder he had quickly been recognized as a saint dekanos resumed that was the worst the persians have ever hit the empire they even ruled here in alexandria for fifteen years and ruled by their own laws a good many bequests were granted whose validity was open to challenge when roman rule returned this mess herehe liked to repeat himself argyros noticed is pcheris vs sarapion its one of those challenges but itswhatseven hundred years now it was argyros turn to say the same thing over again this time in astonished protest so dekanos rolled his eyes egyptian families are usually enormous they dont die out worse luck and they love to go to lawits more fun than the hippodrome and with better odds too and any judgment can be endlessly appealed the scribe misspelled this word theyll say or used an accusative instead of a genitive which obviously changes the meaning of the latest decree obviously argyros had never heard it used as a swearword before and so living in an empire that had endured thirteen centuries since the incarnation and was mighty long before that the magistrianos had always thought of continuity as something to be striven for now for the first time he saw its dark side some timely chaos should long since have swept pcheris vs sarapion into oblivion no wonder mouamet dekanos had pouches under his eyes with an effort argyros dragged his thoughts back to the matter at hand as you have read sir the emperor may christ preserve him would be pleased if the rebuilding of your great pharos here proceeded at a more rapid pace through the master of offices he has sent me from constantinople to try to move the process along in any way i can the augustal prefect governed alexandria and egypt from what had been the palace of the ptolemies before rome acquired the province the promontory stood on lokhias point which jutted into the sea from the eastern part of the city by luck the window in dekanos chamber faced northwest toward the halffinished tower of stone that wouldor mightone day become the restored lighthouse at more than half a mile the workers there would have seemed tiny as ants from the office but there were none to see argyros nod and wave said that more plainly than words dekanos frowned my dear sir we have been petitioning constantinople for leave to rebuild the pharos since the earthquake toppled it only to be ignored by several emperors in succession only eight years have gone by since at last we were granted permission to go to work argyros would not have said only but argyros did not have pcheris vs sarapion and its ilk to deal with either weve not done badly since no indeed not on the whole argyros said with what seemed to be agreement still his imperial majesty is disappointed that progress has been so slow these past two years surely in a land so populous as this he feels adequate supplies of labor are available for the completion of any such task oh aye we have any number of convicted felons to grub rock in the quarries and any number of strongbacked brainless oafs to haul it to the pharos dekanos kept his voice under tight controlhe was as wary of argyros as the other way roundbut his choice of words showed his anger skilled workers though stonecarvers and concretespreaders and carpenters for scaffolding and all the rest are not so easy to come by weve had trouble with them he looked as if the admission pained him it puzzled the magistrianos but why surely they must obey an imperial order to provide then services my dear sir i can see you do not know alexandria dekanos chuckle held scant amusement the guilds constantinople also has guilds argyros interrupted he still felt confused every city in the empire has its craftsmens associations no doubt no doubt but does constantinople have anakhoresis withdrawal the magistrianos echoed now he was frankly floundering im sorry but i dont follow you the word means more than just withdrawal in egypt i fear the peasants in the farming villages along the nile have always had the custom of simply running awaywithdrawing from their homes when taxes get too heavy or the flood fails usually they come back as things improve though they may turn to banditry if the hard times last peasants do that all over the empire all over the world argyros shrugged how is egypt any different because here anakhoresis goes a good deal further than that if say a man is executed and the locals feel the sentence was unjust whole villagefuls of them may withdraw in protest and ifdekanos was ahead of the magistrianos objection we try to punish the ringleaders or force the villagers back to their places were apt to just incite an even bigger anakhoresis a couple of times the whole nile valley has been paralyzed from the delta all the way down to the first cataract argyros understood the horror that came into the alexandrians voice at the prospect in constantinople officials feared riots the same way because one once had grown till it had almost cast justinian the great from his throne every province the magistrianos supposed had special problems to give its rulers sleepless nights all the same something did not add up here the peasants are not restless now though or you would not have said you had plenty of unskilled labor available argyros said slowly very good dekanos said plainly pleased the magistrianos had stayed with him you are right sir very good but here in alexandria you see the guilds have also learned to play the game of anakhoresis let something not go to their liking and they walk away from their jobs and that is what has happened with the pharos yes may the virgin preserve us all argyros felt his head begin to ache theres more mouamet dekanos seemed to take morbid pleasure in going on with his bad news as i say this is alexandria weve dealt with guild anakhoreseis beforeor with one guilds withdrawing anyway but all the guilds pulled out of working on the pharos at the same time and none will go back till they all agree theyre happy and this is alexandria where no one wants to agree with anyone about anything well the magistrianos said doing his best to hold on to reason they must all have been happy once upon a time or no work ever would have been done what made them want to uh withdraw in the first place good question dekanos said i wish i had a good answer for you so do i most of the letters on the signs above shops in alexandrias western district looked greek but most of the words they spelled out were nonsense to argyros he knew no coptic as well as confusing his eyes the purring hissing speech filled his ears for the quarter known as rhakotis had for centuries been the haunt of native egyptians the locals eyed him suspiciously his inches and relatively light skin said he was not one of them but those same inches and the sword on his belt warned he was no one to trifle with hard looks were as far as the natives went he stopped into a cobblers shop that advertised itself not only in coptic but in intelligible if badly spelled greek as hed hoped the man inside had a smattering of that language can you tell me how to find the street where the carpenters work the magistrianos asked he jingled coins in his hand the cobbler did not hold out an open palm though why you want to know he growled the leaders of their guild will have shops there surely i need to speak with them argyros said the fellow he noticed had not denied knowing he did not want to get his wind up when the cobbler still said nothing argyros gave a mild prod if i intended anything more would i not come with a squadron of soldiers who know exactly where the guildsmen work the cobbler grinned at that his teeth were very white against his dark brown skin suppose you might he admitted he gave directions so quickly that argyros made him slow down and repeat them several times alexandrias grid of streets helped strangers find their way around but only so much the magistrianos had a good ear for instructions after only a couple of wrong turns he found himself on a street loud with the pounding of hammers and fragrant from sawdust again he looked for a shop with a bilingual sign when he found one he stepped in and waited for the carpenter to look up from the chair he was repairing the carpenter said something in coptic and then after a second look at argyros tried greek what can i do for you today sir you can start by telling me why the carpenters guild has withdrawn from work on the pharos the carpenters face which had been open and interested a moment before froze thats not for me to say sir he answered slowly you need to talk to one of the chiefs excellent argyros said making the man blinksuppose you take me to one outmaneuvered the carpenter set down his mallet he turned his head and shouted after a few seconds a stripling who looked just like him came out of a back room a rapid colloquy in coptic followed the carpenter turned back to argyros my son will watch the shop while we are gone come he sounded resentful and kept looking back at the mallet on the floor then he saw the magistrianos hand resting on the hilt of his sword shaking his head he led argyros out into the street argyros glanced up at the sign again your name is teus he asked the carpenter noddedand who is the man to whom youre taking me he is called khesphmois teus said he kept his mouth shut the rest of the way to khesphmois shop khesphmoismaster carpenter the sign above the establishment declared in greek and argyros supposed coptic the look of the place did not contradict the signs claim it was three times the size of teus shop and on a busier comer to boot people bustled in and out and the racket of several men working carried out to the street teus led argyros through the beaded entrance curtain that did something at least to keep flies outside a carpenter looked up from the dowel he was filing smiled and nodded at teus the fellow did not seem to be khesphmois himself for teus sentence had the master carpenters name in it and sounded like a question the other mans reply had to mean something like ill bring him he got up and hurried off when he came back from behind a pile of boards a moment later he had with him another man one with only a few more years than argyros thirty or so the magistrianos was expecting a graybeard but this vigorous fellow had to be khesphmois so he was teus bowed to him at the same time dropping a hand to his own knee an egyptian greeting argyros had already seen a dozen times in the streets of rhakotis when khesphmois had returned the salute teus spoke for a couple of minutes in coptic pointing at the magistrianos as he did so khesphmois round cleanshaven face went surprisingly stem as teus drew to a close like teuslike all the carpenters in the shophe wore only sandals and a white linen skirt that reached from his waist to just above his knees but he also clothed himself in dignity in good greek he asked argyros who are you a stranger to question the longestablished right of our guild to withdraw from a labor we have found onerous past any hope of toleration i am basil argyros magistrianos in the service of his imperial majesty the basileus nikephoros iii from constantinople argyros replied khesphmois shop went suddenly quiet as everyone within earshot stopped work to stare into that sudden silence the magistrianos went on i might add that in constantinople guilds have no right of anakhoresis longestablished or otherwise seeking as he does to restore what is an ornament to your city and its commerce the emperor does not look with favor on your refusal to cooperate in that work he has sent me herea slight exaggeration but one that would not be wasted on the carpentersto do what i can to move it forward once more the carpenters spoke tobefore long yelled atone another in coptic argyros wished he could follow what they were saying whatever it was it got hotter by the second finally khesphmois who had been less noisy than most raised his hand in an almost imperial gesture of command quiet slowly returned the master carpenter told argyros this is not constantinople sir and you would do well to remember it so would the emperor you may tell him so if you have his ear khesphmois spoke in dry tones seemingly used to officials who boasted of their lofty connections argyros felt his ears grow hot khesphmois continued perhaps you should pick another guild to try to frighten the carpenters stand firm teus and those of khesphmois men who knew greek snarled agreement you misunderstand me argyros began to protest and you misunderstand us khesphmois broke in now go or it will be the worst for you get out just because he hadnt shouted before argyros had judged that he did not care to that was a mistake the magistrianos kept his hand away from his sword this time too many men had too many potential weapons close by the prefect will hear of your intransigence he warned he may try to root it out by force he has known of it for a long time khesphmois retorted and if he uses force there will be anakhoresis by every guild in alexandria we will stop the city he knows that too so he jerked a thumb toward the curtain of beads furious and frustrated argyros turned to go he was reaching out to shove the beads aside when someone behind him called wait he spun around startled it was a womans voice zois khesphmois said naming her and at the same time letting the magistrianos know from the mixture of patience and annoyance in his voice that she was his wife he had used that same tone with helen and she with him many times as always sorrow stabbed him when he thought of her dont zois me the woman snapped her greek was as good as her husbands you are making a mistake if you turn this man from constantinople into an enemy i dont think so khesphmois said also in greek maybe only a couple of his men spoke it argyros thought and he wanted to keep the family spat as private as he could he was sure that was a forlorn hope but grateful because it let him follow the talk i know you dont thats why i came out zois said she was a few years younger than her husband slim where he would soon be portly and quite short her high cheekbones were the best feature of her swarthy face those and her eyes which were very large and dark her chin was delicate but the wide mouth above it was at the moment thin and firmly set the magistrianos waited for khesphmois to send his wife away for interfering in mens business as he would learn though egyptians were easier about such things than was usual at constantinople and even in the capital men who exercised all the control over wives legally theirs were most of them unhappily wed can you afford to be wrong zois demanded her hand went to the silk collar of her blue linen tunic only someone well off could have afforded the ornament if you are wrong we will lose everything and not just us but all the carpenters and all the other guilds if someone comes all the way from constantinople to see to this business he will not just up and leave your lady wife argyros gave her his best bow is right i am not especially wise but i am especially stubborn i should also tell you i am not a good man to sink in a canal in case the thought crossed your mind magistrianoi look after their own no khesphmois said absently that he was still more intent on arguing with zois made argyros believe him to her his hands on hips in irritation the master carpenter went on what would you have me do then call off the anakhoresis now of course not she answered at once but why not show him the reasons for it he is from far away what can he know of how things are here in alexandria when he sees when he hears maybe he will have the influence in the capital to make the prefect and his henchmen easier on us what have you to lose by trying maybe maybe maybe khesphmois mocked maybe i will run into a crocodile and spend the next hundred years basking on a sandbank too but i dont lose any sleep over it still for his wifes last question he had no good answer and so scowling he growled to argyros come along then if you must ill take you to the pharos and well find out if you have eyes in your head to see with teus and a couple of other carpenters started to protest but khesphmois shouted them down in a coptic that sounded pungent thank you the magistrianos said to him and got only another scowl for an answer the magistrianos turned to zois and bowed again and thank you my lady he spoke as formally as if to a constantinopolitan noblewoman as much in the hope of vexing khesphmois as for any other reason he was surprised when zois dipped her head in the same elegant acknowledgment one of those noblewomen might have used he had a moment to notice how gracefully her neck curved then khesphmois repeated come along you without waiting to see whether argyros would follow the master carpenter stamped out into the street the magistrianos hurried after him goodbye zois called goodbye the both of you that nearly brought argyros up short not so much because she was polite enough to include him but because she had used the dual number the specialand most archaicgrammatical form reserved for pairs even coming from his imagined noblewoman the dual would have sounded pretentious hearing it from an egyptian carpenters wife was strange indeed argyros wondered where she could have learned it thinking back he decided that was the first time she became an individual for him at the time though the thought was gone in an eyeblink because he had to hustle along to catch up with khesphmois the master carpenter was short and stocky but moved with a grim determination that argyros even with his longer legs was hardpressed to match he tried several times to make small talk khesphmois answered only in grunts the one thing argyros really wanted to sayyour wife is an interesting womanhe could not not to a man he had known less than an hour and one who was no friend of his he soon walked on in silence which seemed to suit khesphmois well enough the master carpenter might also have been impervious to heat no mean asset in alexandria he tramped along the raised road that still marked the path of the original narrow heptastadion then east on the southern coast of the island of pharos to the base of the lighthouse there the pharos even in its present halfrebuilt state grew more aweinspiring with every step argyros took toward it he had long thought no building could be grander than constantinoples great church of hagia sophia but the sheer vertical upthrust of the pharos had a brusque magnificence of its own already it was taller than the top of hagia sophias central dome and would reach twice that height if it ever was finished khesphmois craned his neck at the towering pillar too it only goes to show he said that alexandria breeds real men argyros snorted suspecting locals had been using that joke on newcomers for all the sixteen centuries since sostratos first erected coming up with that word made the magistrianos snort all over again the phallos pharos he corrected himself sternly ordering his mind to stop playing tricks with words suddenly he felt every day of his two years of celibacy his mental order proved easier to carry out than he had expected as he and khesphmois approached the lighthouse he began to take more notice of the line of men marching in front of it some of them carried placards argyros frowned puzzled are they mendicant monks he asked the master carpenter they are not in monastic garb khesphmois threw back his head and laughed hardly come with me yet a little farther and you will see shrugging the magistrianos obeyed he saw that not all the men by the pharos were marching after all the ones who were just standing around looked like a squad of light infantrythey had no body armor but wore helmets and carried shields and spears they also looked monumentally bored one trooper in fact was fast asleep leaning back against the lighthouses lowest course of stonework the marchers seemed hardly more excited than the soldiers argyros was certain they were doing something they had done many times before then he drew close enough to read their placards and doubted in rapid succession his conclusions and his eyesight this labor is too dangerous for any man to carry out one sign said paltry pay for deadly work another shrieked carpenters and concretespreaders withdraw together shouted a third others were in coptic but the magistrianos had no doubt they were equally inflammatory why dont the soldiers drive them away he demanded of khesphmois why are they here if not for that have the guilds bribed the commander of the watch to let this sedition go on he was shocked to the core such an insolent display at constantinopleor any other town he knew would instantly have landed the marchers in prison at least your questions are to the point the master carpenter said a good thing since you have so many of them may your answers match my questions then argyros felt brief pride at his sardonic response he did not want khesphmois to know just how disturbed he was very well khesphmois said the soldiers are here mostly to see that the marchers do no pilfering and no we have not bribed the watch commander though i must say we tried but cyril is an honest man worse luck for us by then the magistrianos suspected that trying to hide his shock was a losing battle anywhere else in the empire if artisans refused to workin itself unlikelysoldiers would simply force them to return but mouamet dekanos struck argyros as being bright enough to try that if he thought it would work that meant argyros concluded unhappily that khesphmois and the other guild leaders really could immobilize alexandria if these weird privileges of theirs were tampered with egypt argyros muttered nowhere else in the empire would such nonsense as pcheris vs sarapion have dragged on for seven hundred years either the magistrianos gathered himself and turned back to khesphmois why he asked carefully have all you workers chosen to withdraw the master carpenter looked at him with something like respect do you know you are the first official who ever bothered to ask that the prefect and his staff just told us to go back to work the way they do during a usual anakhoresis any other time we would eventually but not now not here so they have waited not daring to set soldiers on us and not knowing what else to do and we have stayed away and nothing has got done that sounded appallingly likely to argyros if a contested inheritance could stay contested for seven centuries what were a couple of years here or there in putting a pharos back together delay would be a way of life for the local bureaucrats here even more than in most of the empire well one of the things magistrianoi were for was shaking up officials too set in their ways im asking the magistrianos said why havent you gone back to work by saint cyril ill show you khesphmois exclaimed follow me if youve the stomachand the headfor it he walked past the signcarriers waving to a couple from the carpenters guild the watchmen only nodded at him by now argyros supposed they must know him as well as their own officers the magistrianos who was on their side got more hard looks than the master carpenter khesphmois walked into the pharos argyros followed still their footsteps echoed in the gloom within khesphmois hurried over to the spiral stair just inside the doorway and started up the stairway was almost as dark as the chamber that led to it though window openings set at intervals into the thick wall gave enough light for the magistrianos to see where he was putting his feet the idea of stumbling and rolling down so long a stairway made his sweat turn cold by the time he reached the top even of the truncated pharos argyros had sweat in plenty ahead of him khesphmois still seemed fresh the magistrianos muttered to himself as he panted up the last few steps his time behind a desk in constantinople was making him soft alexandrias usual northerly breeze helped cool him while he got his breath back he turned his back to the breeze and peered across the great harbor at the city the view was superb he even towered high above the ancient obelisks cleopatras needles the locals called them but they were older than thatnot far from the heptastadions southern root he had no idea how long he might have stood there staring but khesphmois dry cough recalled him to himself i didnt bring you up here to sightsee the master carpenter said look straight down a long stride and a short one brought the magistrianos to the edge of the stone block on which he stood no fence or rail separated him from a couple of hundred feet of empty space he cautiously peered over the edge only the discipline he had acquired in the roman army kept him from going to his knees or belly first far far below the marchers and watchmen looked as tiny as insects argyros was anything but sorry to step back a long way down he observed stating the obvious khesphmois had been watching him closely youre a cool one he said not sounding happy to admit it but how would you like to be working up here instead of just standing i wouldnt the magistrianos admitted at once but then its not my proper trade working this high is no ones proper trade khesphmois said if you take a wrong step if someone bumps you by accident if a piece of scaffolding breaks while youre on it even if you make a bad stroke with your hammer over you go and nothings left of you but a red smear on the rocks there are plenty of them down below and there would have been many more if we hadnt staged the anakhoresis some certainly argyros nodded some trades are dangerous the mines the army and plainly working at heights like this but why do you say many the pharos is square in section thus far yes khesphmois said the magistrianos nodded again well the next part is to be octagonal and narrowera tiny bit narrower the master carpenter went on what would you expect to happen to the carpenters who will have to face inward with almost no room at all to put their feet while they try to set up scaffolds or to the stonecutters who try to climb onto the scaffolding to trim and polish the outsides of the blocks or to the concretespreaders who take away the excess that squeezes out from between the courses of blocks the risks are worse now youre telling me argyros said slowly thats just what im telling you how do we make them less then the magistrianos asked enough less i mean to get the various guilds to come back to work alexandria and the whole empire need this pharos restored and alexandria and the whole empire care not a moldy fig how many workers die restoring it khesphmois said bitterly now youve seen the problem man from constantinople what do you aim to do about it right now i dont know argyros said i truly do not i work no miracles though this is a column any pillarsitting saint might envy khesphmois grunted youre honest at any rate you he stopped the magistrianos had raised a hand i wasnt finished one way or another i will find you an answer i swear it by god the virgin and st mouamet who as patron of changes will be apt to hear my oath so he will khesphmois crossed himself argyros copied the gesture the master carpenter went on whether the augustal prefect and his staff pay you any heed though is something else again without waiting for an answer he started down the stairway after a final long look at the panorama of the city argyros followed that afternoon back on the mainland once more he peered out toward the halferected pharos thinking of it like that reminded him of the bawdy pun he had unwittingly made earlier in the day and thinking of that pun made him come halferect he scowled and clenched his fists trying to force his body back under the control of his will his body as bodies do resisted oh youd make a fine monk he told himself angrily a wonderful monk theyd canonize you after you died under the name st basil priapos this was a fine way to remember helen but he remembered her all too vividly remembered the touch of her lips and the surge of her body against his he caught himself wondering how zois would be that thought made him angrier than ever not only was it shameful lust it betrayed the memory of his dead wife he still wondered though when he dreamed that night as always he woke too soon my dear sir surely you are joking mouamet dekanos eyebrows climbed toward his hairline you want me to sit down and dicker with these these laborers think of the ghastly precedent it would set ghastly ive thought of it argyros admitted i dont like it i dont like seeing the pharos still halfbuilt either nor does the emperor that problem is immediate the precedent will just have to take care of itself dekanos stared at him as if he had just proposed converting the whole population of the roman empire to persian sun worship by force precedent my dear sir is part of the glue that holds the empire together he said stiffly so it is the magistrianos said the grain shipments from alexandria to constantinople are another part and the emperor has lost patience with having ships on their way back here go astray without need in this case he reckons that of greater importance than precedent so you say dekanos retorted so you say would you like me to meet with the augustal prefect and ask his opinion of your attitude the alexandrian functionarys face went dark with anger youre bluffing try me as a matter of fact argyros was in an argument with someone from the distant resented capital he was sure the prefect would back his own aide had he been an intimate of the master of offices instead of merely one of his magistrianoi though not even the augustal prefect could have afforded to ignore him and george lakhanodrakons letter made him seem to be one he rose took out the parchment and unrolled it and flourished it in dekanos face you do recall this i hope well what if i do dekanos was still scowling for that matter he went on angrily how will you be able to gather all these fractious guild leaders together and make them and their guild members abide by anything they might agree to for all you know they will say one thing to ease the pressure on them and then turn around and do just the opposite when the official shifted the basis of the argument argyros knew he had his man if they did that would they not have gone beyond the bounds even of what you alexandrians tolerate in an anakhoresis he asked you could then use whatever force you had to with less fear of bringing the whole city to the point of insurrection perhaps dekanos pursed his lips perhaps as for gathering the leaders of the guilds the magistrianos said persuasively leave that to me i wouldnt think of formally involving you with speaking to them until everything on the other side was in readiness certainly not dekanos said mollified by argyros apparent concern for proper procedure hmm yes i suppose you can go forward then provided you do it on those terms and provided you stress our unique clemency in treating with the artisans in this one special case of course the magistrianos said although he had no intention of stressing anything of the sort he bowed his way out of dekanos office and did not grin until his back was to the alexandrian grinning still he headed for khesphmois shop in the district of rhakotis he did not see the master carpenter when he walked through the beaded curtain only one of the journeymen was there luckily one who spoke some greek the fellow said he not back till tomorrow he helping buildhow you saygrandstand for parade busy all night he say the man chuckled he terrible mad about that i there too but have this cabinet to repair for rich man he want it now no matter what rich men like that yes argyros said though he knew nothing of being rich from personal experience he hesitated then asked what does the parade celebrate feast day for st arsenios oh argyros wondered what the saint a man who had withdrawn from the world to live out his life as a monk in the egyptian desert would think of having his memory celebrated with a large noisy parade he shrugged that was the alexandrians problem khesphmois was his ill come back tomorrow afternoon then i do need to see your master he turned to go thinking that as long as he was in this part of the city teus might direct him to some other master carpenters can i do anything to help you man from constantinople argyros had just put his hand in the entranceway to thrust aside the strings of beads now he jerked it back small spheres of glass and painted clay clicked off one another truly i dont know my lady he said his unspoken thought was that depends on how much influence you have on your husband zois might have picked it out of the air i know you did not come all this way simply to see me she said her eyebrows and the comers of her mouth lifting slightly in a cynical smile eve might have worn that smile argyros thought when god came to talk business with adam and later given adam his comeuppance for the visit he put aside his blasphemous maunderings zois was going on still perhaps we could discuss it over a cup of wine the magistrianos eyes flicked to the journeyman carpenter but the fellow did not look up from the work he had resumed and no wonder with her husband absent zois had not presumed to come out alone to speak with argyros a servant girl stood behind him a pretty little thing who could not have been more than fifteen and who was the magistrianos saw about eight months pregnant he considered thank you he said at last maybe we could this way zois said then spoke in coptic to the servant girl who dipped her head and hurried off dont let fear of lukras spying on us worry you zois told the magistrianos as she led him back toward the rooms where she and khesphmois lived she has no greek my husband did not take her on for that she smiled her ancient smile again like the shop the home behind it was of mud brick the rooms were small and rather dark the furniture was splendid though which surprised argyros until he remembered khesphmois trade lukra came back a few minutes later with wine dates candied in honey and sheets of flat chewy unleavened bread zois waited for the girl to pour the wine then spoke again in coptic lukra disappeared she will not be back zois said nodding to herself she raised her cup to the magistrianos health to you health to you he echoed drinking the vintage was not one he knew which meant it was most likely a local one not reckoned fine enough to export it was not bad though and had a tartness that cut through the cloyingly sweet taste of the dates zois ate then wiped her hands and patted at her mouth with a square of embroidered linen now she said when she was through what do you need from khesphmois his cooperation in getting the other leaders of the carpenters guild and the men who head the rest of the guilds that have withdrawn from work on the pharos to talk with the augustal prefects deputy so they can agree on a way to get construction started again her eyes already large seemed to grow further as she widened them in surprise you can arrange this if the guildsmen will play their part yes i already have agreement from the prefects deputy the pharos is too important not only to alexandria but to all the empire to be delayed by this anakhoresis i agree zois said at once i warned khesphmois from the outset that the guilds were facing too dangerous a foe in the city government because it could crush them if their stubbornness pushed it to the point of wanting to i will help with anything that has a hope of ending the anakhoresis peacefully thank you argyros did not tell her the augustal prefect and his staff were as frightened of the guilds power as she was of the governments having both sides wary was probably a good idea he went on do you think you can sway your husband to your point of view i suspect so khesphmois is more likely to insist on having his own way on matters where there is no risk to him the magistrianos thought that was only sensible and true of anyone then zois went on take lukra for instance khesphmois did bitterness welled forth in her voice did he argyros interest among other things rose so that was why she was seeing him alone he thought for the sake of revenge on her husband that was sinful so was the act of adultery itself at the moment the magistrianos did not care relief would have been easy to buy at any time since helen died despite his bodys urgings he had held back this though zois was attractive in an exotic way clever enough for him to hope to enjoy her mind as well as her body and she might be his for as long as he was in alexandria long enough perhaps for something more than desireor her anger at khesphmoisto bind them together it would not be what he had known with his wife but it could be better than the emptiness that had ruled his life these past years he got up and took a step toward zois chair then he noticed she had not stopped talking while lust had filled his head she was saying but for all his faults he is not a bad man at bottom you know i would not see him hurt in any way and he would be he and many others if the anakhoresis were put down by force yes thats likely so the magistrianos agreed woodenly he sat back down zois sighed if god had not willed that i be barren i am sure khesphmois would have left lukra alone and when the child is born he and i will rear it as if it were our own her laugh was shaky here i am going on about my own life when you came to talk of weighty affairs i do apologize think nothing of it my lady now the magistrianos voice sounded as it should so that was why she was seeing him alone he thought again but this time with a different reason behind the that unburdening herself to a sympathetic stranger had to be easier than talking with a neighbor or friend here a stranger would not be likely to gossip argyros laughed at himself before he married helen he had never imagined himself irresistible to women thinking zois had found him so was bracing it made him proud he knew what pride went before even as he had that thought he felt himself falling you are a kind man zois said as i told you i will do my best to make sure my husband lends his influence to meeting with the prefects men and trying to end the anakhoresis and now would you care for another date she held out the platter to him no thank you when the magistrianos got up this time he did not approach the master carpenters wife im glad i can count on you but now i do have other business to attend to he let her show him out as the beads clicked behind him he wondered what the other business was for the life of him he could not think of any maybe escaping his own embarrassment counted he walked north to the street of kanopos alexandrias main eastwest thoroughfare the one on which saint athanasios church fronted with nothing better to do he thought he would imitate many of the locals and lie down in his room during the midday heat someone plucked at the sleeve of his tunic he whirled one hand dropping to the hilt of his swordlike any large city alexandria was full of lightfingered rogues but this was no rogueit was a girl two or three years older than zois maidservant under the paint on her face she might have been pretty were she less thin go to bed with me she said argyros would bet it was most of the greek she knew no she had a bit more a price twenty folleis a big copper coin for an embrace the magistrianos had rejected such advances before without having to think twice now his blood already heated from what he had thoughtno hoped he admitted to himselfhe heard himself say where the girls face lit up she was pretty he saw at least when she smiled she led him to a tiny chamber that opened onto an alley a couple of blocks from the street of kanopos with the door shut the cubicle was hot stuffy and nearly nightdark argyros knew the muchused straw pallet would have bugs but the girl was pulling her shift off over her head lying down and waiting for him to join her he did afterward he saw her scorn even in the gloom after so long without a woman he had spent himself almost at once but that long denial was not to be relieved with a single round you pay twice she warned but then she was moving with him urging him on harlots had their wiles he knew but he thought he pleased her the second time he knew he pleased himself he knew he pleased her when he gave her a silver miliaresion much more than she had asked of him maybe for a while she would be a little less scrawny his conscience troubled him as he finished the interrupted walk to his room such a sordid way to end his mourning for his wife a skinny whore in a squalid crib but he had not stopped mourning helen nor would he ever he had only proved what he already knewthat wish as he might he was not fit by nature for the single life and knowing that would it have been better he asked himself to have returned to the sensual world with an act of adultery as well as one of fornication he thought of zois of how attractive he had found her and was not sure of the answer with an expression of barely concealed dislike mouamet dekanos watched the guildsmen file into the meeting chamber argyros who was sitting at one side of the table he had left dekanos the head gave him credit for trying to conceal it the guildsmen were not even trying they glowered impartially at both men waiting for them they also frankly gaped at the magnificence of the hall in which they were received even in their finest clothes they looked out of place or rather looked like what they wereworkmen in a palace illustrious sirs khesphmois said nervously dipping his head to argyros and dekanos as he slid into a chair he went on these men with me are hergeus son of thotsytmis of the concrete spreaders guild and miysis son of seias of the guild of stonecutters yes thank you khesphmois dekanos said of course i have had dealings with all you gentlemenhe spit out the word as if it tasted badbefore but your comrades will be new to argyros he is here all the way from constantinople itself to help us settle our differences illustrious sir hergeus and miysis murmured as they took their seats like the other alexandrians argyros had met they made a good show of looking unimpressed at the mention of the capital miysis the magistrianos thought carried it off better the stonecutters leader was a squat powerful man in his midfifties his nose had been broken and a scar seamed one weathered cheek but the eyes in that bruisers face were disconcertingly keen after sizing argyros up he turned to dekanos and demanded hows he going to do that illustrious sir when we already know whats going on and cant see any way out though his voice was a raspy growl he did not speak bad greek i will leave that to the magistrianos to explain for himself dekanos answered thank you argyros said ignoring the tone that made dekanos reply mean i havent the slightest idea sometimes gentlemen ignorance is an advantage both sides in this anakhoresis i would say have clung so long and stubbornly to their own views that they have forgotten others are possible perhaps i will be able to show you all something new yet acceptable to everyone pah was all miysis said to that hergeus added perhaps ill swim the length of the nile tomorrow too but i wouldnt bet on it his grin made the words sting less than they would have otherwise like khesphmois he was young to be a guild leader but there the resemblance between them ended hergeus was tall for an egyptian and as skinny as the trollop argyros had bedded a few days before we are here talking together khesphmois pointed out that is something new the master carpenter argyros knew was to some degree an ally if only because this meeting set his prestige on the line the magistrianos had trouble caring memories of the way he had abandoned his selfimposed celibacy kept crowding in on him the act itself shamed him less than the thoughtless way he had yielded to his animal urges hergeus had said something to him while he was woolgathering frowning he pulled himself back to the matter at hand im sorry sir i missed that seeing things we cant again eh but the concretepourer was smiling still in a way that invited everyone to share his amusement well i just want to know how you can make the risk of death and maiming worth the niggardly wages we got for work on the pharos we pay as well as anyone else dekanos snapped nettled but i can make chairs and cabinets without the fear of turning into a red splash on the ground if i sneeze at the wrong time khesphmois said would higher pay bring you back to the pharos argyros asked the three guild representatives looked at one another then they all looked at mouamet dekanos out of the question he said the precedent that would set is pernicious its not just the silver anyhow miysis said my lads would sooner do other work and thats all there is to it were tired of using guild fees to pay for funerals we had as many in the work on the pharos as in a couple of generations before enough silver might tempt some concretespreaders back hergeus said the young ones the bolder ones the ones with families to worry over the ones up to their chins in debt too i suppose aye some of us too i would say khesphmois agreed enough silver yes and let us grant your first demand here and what would come of it dekanos said youd make another and another till youd hold out for a nomisma every hour on the hour who could afford to pay you then hergeus chuckled its a problem id like to have its not one the powerful men of the city would like to have dekanos retorted that brought things down to basics argyros thought naturally dekanos worried first about alexandrias upper classes they were the men he had to keep happy even the augustal prefect needed to worry about what they thought though his responsibility was to the emperor if they turned against him what could he accomplish that was also true of the guilds however at least this time although dekanos seemed unwilling to recognize it argyros did not care one way or the other all he wanted to see was the pharos getting taller again he said i think we can keep the problem of precedent from getting out of hand if we establish a special rate of pay for the specific task of rebuilding the lighthouse then we will not have to worry about it again unless the earth trembles again which god prevent i dont care what we get paid miysis said so long as we have any other work at all we wont go near the cursed pharos moneys no good to a dead man and id like to see you make it go up without us stonecutters argyros felt like kicking the stubborn guildsman under the table purely for the sake of discussion he said to khesphmois and hergeus how much of a boost in pay would it take to bring your comrades out once more the two locals spoke together in rapid coptic khesphmois switched to greek twice as much and not a single copper follis less dekanos clapped a hand to his forehead cried you made a mistake argyros you summoned men from the thieves guild to meet with me to the guildsmen he said if you hope to gain anything from this meeting you must show reason i might perhaps under the special circumstances the magistrianos described seek authorization for a raise of ah say one part in twelve but surely could not gain approval for any more than that one part in twelve is no raise at all look at the wealth around you khesphmois exclaimed waving his hand at the chamber in which they sat far from being overawed the master carpenter was clever enough to use that splendor as a weapon for his cause argyros was impressed dekanos was plainly discomfited you are willing then illustrious sir to raise our pay hergeus asked as i said under these special circumstances dekanos began the concretespreaders leader cut him off with a wave of the hand you said before that you wouldnt give us any raise at all if a woman says she wont and then does after you give her ten nomismata shes just as much a whore as if she did it for a follis the only difference is her price and that you can dicker over thats what were down to now illustrious sir dickering over the price and i stand with khesphmoisone part in twelve is no raise at all mouamet dekanos glowered at hergeus your tongue is altogether too free the official glowered at argyros too presumably for putting him in a position where he had to listen to blunt talk from a social inferior argyros hardly noticed every mention of whores brought his mind back to the girl he had bedded and seemed calculated only to lacerate his conscience reality returned when dekanos began drumming his fingers on the table whos best to declare what a fair raise would be the magistrianos said quickly to cover his lapse neither side here trusts the other why not let hmm the patriarch of alexandria arbitrate the dispute he had been thinking out loud nothing more but the words seemed a happy inspiration the moment they were out of his mouth he smiled waiting for dekanos and the guildsmen to acclaim his solomonic wisdom instead they all stared at him er which patriarch of alexandria dekanos and khesphmois asked at the same time the first time they had been more than physically together since they had sat down at the same table which patriarch the magistrianos scratched his head for politeness sake i will assume all three of these gentlemen are of orthodox faith dekanos said and also because assuming otherwise would bring down on me one more trouble than i need right now surely however many of their followers adhere to the dogmashe did not argyros noticed say heresyof the monophysites and thus would not trust the orthodox patriarch to be disinterested and i certainly cannot grant official recognition to the monophysites ah leader dekanos did not say patriarch either not in the same breath with monophysites argyros felt his face grow hot he gave an embarrassed nod the monophysitesthose who believed christ to have had only one nature the divine after the incarnationhad been strong in egypt for nine hundred years ecumenical councils to the contrary notwithstanding of course they would have a shadow ecclesiastical organization of their own and of course dekanos could not formally treat with it doing so would imply that orthodoxy was not the only possible truth no official of the roman empire could ever admit that argyros was reluctant to think it even as a condition contrary to fact this is all so much moonshine miysis rumbled the stonecutter got to his feet and stomped toward the door adding over his shoulder i already said once its not the money and i meant it my ladsll find other things to do thank you very much illustrious sir he walked out damnation mouamet dekanos glared after him then slowly turned back to the other two guild leaders do you gentlemen feel the same way if you do youre welcome to leave now and well let the city garrison try to return you to obedience youd not do that khesphmois exclaimed calling out the soldiers would set all alexandria aflame dekanos finished for him i know but what good are soldiers if they cannot be used the emperor wants this pharos built if i have to choose between offending the alexandrian guilds and offending the basileus of the romans i know what my choice will be if he was bluffing he was a dab hand at hiding it argyros would not have cared to find out and he had far more experience with officials ploys than did either khesphmois or hergeus the two guildsmen exchanged appalled glances they had been confident dekanos would not try to coerce them back to work if they were wrong i think we might talk further hergeus said quickly especially since your illustriousness has shown himself willing to move on the matter of wages not any too willing having gained an advantage dekanos looked ready to hold on to it khesphmois saw that clearly if it pleases the illustrious sir he suggested we would agree to leaving the matter of how large our raise should be in the hands of the magistrianos here he represents the emperor who as you say is eager to have the lighthouse restored if it werent for him we wouldnt be talking at all i expect hed be fairer than any local man i can think of argyros wondered if khesphmois would have said that if he knew how badly the magistrianos had wanted to go to bed with his wife still the master carpenter had a point i will make this settlement argyros said if all of you swear by father son and holy spirit by the virgin and by your great alexandrian saints athanasios cyril and pyrrhos to abide by the terms i set down he was pleased with himself for thinking to add the alexandrian saints to the oath monophysites revered them along with the orthodox i will swear that oath for myself and on behalf of my guild khesphmois said at once and did so when he was through hergeus echoed him their eyes swung to dekanos he let them stew for a while then said gruffly oh very well time to have this cursed anakhoresis settled he swore the oath thank you gentlemen for your trust in me i hope i can deserve it argyros said he was stalling events had piled up faster than he was quite ready for after some thought he went on as for the matter of pay justice i am sure lies between the demands of the two sides therefore let pay for work on the pharos henceforth be half again the usual rate for all guilds let it be so dekanos said promptly the nods from hergeus and khesphmois were reluctant the master carpenters expression showed him unhappy with the choice hed made argyros raised a hand i am not finished as we have all agreed work on the pharos is uncommonly dangerous therefore if a guildsman should die of an accident while doing that work let the city government of alexandria rather than his guild pay for his funeral this time khesphmois and hergeus quickly agreed while mouamet dekanos sent the magistrianos a sour stare argyros bore up under it unlike dekanos he had looked down from the top of the pharos he could imagine with gutwrenching clarity what the results of even the smallest slip would be and if a worker did slip he would bring disaster not just upon himself but also on his family argyros thought of the troubles helen would have had bringing up sergios as a widow had he rather than his wife and son perished in the smallpox epidemic he said finally if a married worker should die of an accident while working on the pharos let the city government of alexandria settle on his widow and children if any a sum equal to ah six months pay for he will have died in service to the city and it is unjust to leave his family destitute on account of that service no dekanos said you go too far much too far remember the oath you swore khesphmois shouted at him while hergeus added will you turn a profit on dead mens blood argyros sat silent waiting dekanos out finally the official said as i have sworn an oath i must abide by it but sir i shall also send a letter to the master of offices setting forth in detail the manner in which you have overstepped your authority in detail my authority illustrious sir is to get work started on the pharos once more when you write to george lakhanodrakon do please remember to mention that i have done so the magistrianos turned to khesphmois and hergeus your guilds will end the anakhoresis on the terms i have set forth yes they said together khesphmois muttered something in coptic to hergeus then catching argyros eye he translated i said id told him you could be trusted the magistrianos dipped his head pleased by the compliment he even forgot for a moment what hed wanted to do with zois two weeks later not another stone had gone into place on the pharos argyros stood in front of a halfbuilt church miysis mallet and chisel in hand stared down at him from the top of a large limestone block i told you no before and i still mean no the stonecutter said but why argyros said craning his neck the carpenters and cementspreaders have agreed to end the anakhoresis and agreed gladly half again regular pay and compensation to widows and orphans is nothing to sneeze at miysis spat though not the magistrianos had to admit in his direction the carpenters and cementspreaders are fools if you ask me what good does pay and a half do a dead man or even blood money for his family me im plenty happy to work a safer job for less money and my lads think the same we stay withdrawn as if to show that was his last word on the subject he started chiseling away at the limestone block again chips flew one landed in argyros hair he stepped back thinking dark thoughts when he walked off miysis lifted the mallet in an ironic farewell salute the magistrianos head down walked north between the museions three exedra and the sema of alexander the great without glancing at either the lecture halls to the left or the marble tomb to the right only when he almost bumped into one of the men lined up to see alexanders remains in their coffin of glass did he take a couple of grudging steps to one side miserable muttonhead he mumbled happy to work his cursed safer job while the pharos goes to perdition he stopped dead in his tracks smacked fist into palm happy is he lets just see how happy hell be then instead of glumly walking argyros was trotting sometimes running toward the augustal prefects palace he arrived panting and drenched in sweat but triumphant mouamet dekanos raised an eyebrow when the magistrianos burst past lesser functionaries into his office whats all this in aid of he asked i know how to end the anakhoresis at last i know this i will believe when i see it and not before i see it dekanos said you came close i grant you that but how do you propose to move the stonecutters to the pharos if they are content with lesser pay for other work argyros grinned a carnivore grin how content will they be with no pay for no work i dont follow dekanos said suppose an edict were to go out in the augustal prefects name suspending all construction in stone in alexandria for say the next three months dont you think the stonecutters would start to get a trifle hungry by then hungry enough even to think about going back to work on the pharos dekanos eyes went wide they might they just might and since they werent party to the agreements with the other guilds we wouldnt even have to pay them extra the magistrianos had thought about that too in the third of an hour it had taken him to get to the prefects palace he would enjoy revenge for miysis insolence still he said no i think not the contrast between those who do work on the pharos and have extra silver to jingle in their pouches and those who do not and have none a distinct point dekanos said very well let it be as you say some wealthy men will scream when their houses stand a while halfbuilt the emperor of the romans is screaming now because his pharos has stood too long halfbuilt a distinct point dekanos repeated he shouted for scribes not even a journeyman carpenter was working at khesphmois shop when argyros pushed his way through the curtain of beads only a servant lounged in the open courtyard as far as the magistrianos could see the fellows main job was to make sure no one came in and made off with the partly made or partly repaired furniture there the servant scrambled to his feet when argyros came in he bowed and said something in coptic the magistrianos spread his hands what you want the servant asked in broken greek is your master at home argyros asked speaking slowly and clearlyand also loudly i wish to pay my respects to him him not here the servant said after argyros had repeated himself a couple of times him everyone athow you saypharos work there all time you want you come sabbath day after prayers maybe here then i wont be here then argyros said my ship sails for constantinople day after tomorrow he saw the servant had not understood him and sighing began casting about in his mind for simpler words he was just starting over when he heard a familiar voice from the living quarters behind the shop is that you basil argyros of constantinople yes zois it is she came out a moment later its good to see you again would you care for some wine and fruit nodding the magistrianos stepped toward her the servant started to come too zois stopped him with a couple of sentences of crackling coptic to argyros she explained i told nekhebu that khesphmois wants him out here keeping an eye on the furniture not inside keeping an eye on me i can take care of myself the furniture cant im sure you can my lady argyros let her lead him into the chamber where they had talked before this time she brought out the wine and dates herself lukra had her brat last week and shes still down with a touch of fever she said i expect she will get over it her voice was enigmatic argyros could not tell whether she wanted the serving girl to recover he said i came to thank khesphmois for all he did to help end the anakhoresis since im lucky enough to see you let me thank you also for helping to turn him in that direction im grateful she sipped her wine nibbled daintily on a candied date the pink tip of her tongue flicking out for a moment as it toyed with the fruit did i hear you say you were leaving alexandria day after tomorrow yes its time for me to go the pharos is abuilding again and so i have no need to stay any longer ah she said which might have meant anything or nothing after a pause that stretched she went on in that case you can thank me properly properly somehow argyros thought zois eyes suddenly seemed twice as large as they had just before she leaned back in her chair he admired the fine curve of her neck then he was kneeling beside that chair bending to kiss the smooth warm flesh of her throat even if he was wrong said the calculating part of him that never quite slept khesphmois had already returned to the pharos but he was not wrong zois breath sighed out her hands clasped the back of his head the bedroom argyros whispered sometime later no lukras chamber is next to it and she might overhear for all her sighs zois still seemed very much in control of herself we will have to manage here the room had neither couch nor of course bed but not all postures required them manage they did with zois on her knees and using her chair to support the upper part of her body she was almost as exciting as argyros had imagined in this imperfect world he thought before all thought fled one could hardly hope for more she gasped with him at the end but he was still coming back to himself when she turned to look over her shoulder at him and say pull up your breeches as he did so she swiftly repaired her own dishevelment then she waved him back to his own chair remarking khesphmois must not know what weve done i do which is what matters so you were only using me to pay back khesphmois he asked more than a trifle nettled here he had thought he was desired for his sake but instead found himself merely an instrument to zois this he realized uncomfortably had to be how a seduced woman felt zois reply reinforced his discomfort we all use one another do we not she softened that a moment later adding with a smile i will say i enjoyed this use more than somemore than most even something that but not enough how many was most argyros did not want to know he got to his feet id best head back to my lodging he said i still have some packing to do for a ship that sails in two days zois smile was knowing go then if you think you must as i said though i did enjoy it and i will give khesphmois your thanks id not be so rude as to forget that im so glad argyros muttered zois giggled at his ostentatiously held aplomb which only made him cling to it more tightly the bow he gave her was as punctilious as if hed offered it to the master of offices wife she giggled again he left hastily on the way back to his roomhe really had no better place to gohe reflected on the changes he had made since coming to alexandria from celibate to fornicator to adulterer all in the space of a few weeks he thought filled with selfreproach then he remembered that he would eagerly have become an adulterer before had he thought zois willing now he knew just how willing she was and found something other than delight in the knowledge yet he also knew how sweet her body was and the whores as well having fallen from celibacy he doubted he would ever be able to return to it as well then that he had not let grief drive him into a monastery his instinct there had been right he was much too involved with the things of this world to renounce it for the next until he drew his last breath best to acknowledge that fully and live with the consequences as best he could thinking that he let himself take some pride in his success here one day before too many more years had passed alexandrias beacon would shine again saving countless sailors as time went by had he not come to help set things right that might have been long delayed or accomplished only through bloodshed and preventing such strife might earn him credit in heaven to set in the balance against the weight of his sins he could hope anyway argyros wait the magistrianos set his duffel on the planking of the dock turned to find out who was shouting at him he was surprised to see mouamet dekanos hurrying up the quay toward him i thought youd be just as glad to have me go far away he said as the alexandrian bureaucrat came near dekanos smiled thinly i understand what you mean still the pharos is going up and i did have something to do with that besides which i stay here while you are going far away my contribution will be remembered he checked to make sure no one was listening and lowered his voice i will make sure it is remembered i daresay you will argyros chuckled he understood dekanos logic perfectly well what he did not understand was why the official was carrying a duffel bag larger and fuller than his own he pointed to it what have you there i was most impressed with your ability to bring together two sides neither of which was truly interested in finding a solution to their dispute until you intervened dekanos said obliquely argyros gave a polite bow youre very kind illustrious sir still you dont think i answered you dekanos finished for him no ah but i did for you see ive brought you another longstanding dispute which neither side seems interested in solving what i have here illustrious sir is pcheris vs sarapionall of it with a sigh of relief he set his burden down it was heavier than argyros sack through his sandals the magistrianos felt the dock timbers briefly quiver at its weight youre sure thats all he asked intending irony the attempt failed i do think so dekanos answered seriously if not the documents you have should refer back to any that happen to be missing oh very well argyros said laughing ill take it on as you say after the pharos something this small should be easy the winds wont favor my ship as much on the way back to constantinople god willing i should be to the bottom of your case by the time im there it will make the voyage less boring thank you dekanos wrung the magistrianos hand thank you the alexandrian official bowed several times before taking his leave argyros shrugged quizzically as he watched him go in his days in the imperial army hed sometimes received less effusive thanks for saving a mans life he shrugged again as he carried the two sacks onto the ship he opened the one full of legal documents long before the pharos of alexandria slipped below the southern horizon he suspected mouamet dekanos had done him no favor long before he reached constantinople again he was sure of it report of the special committee on the quality of life ancient and medieval societies struggled along without most of the benefits we moderns take for granted anesthesia plumbing refrigeration and the telephone and television our ancestors were far more racist sexist violent and fanatical than we are today i dont care who you arego back enough generations and youll prove me right enough in most cases is a number smaller than five but our ancestors also did not burden themselves with certain other things we take for granted nowadays their world would have been rather more complicated if they had november to their hispanic majesties fernando ii and isabella from the special committee on the quality of life re the environmental impact upon spain of the proposed expedition of the genoese navigator cristobal colon styled in his native italian cristoforo colombo the commission of learned men and mariners established by your majesties under the chairmanship of fr hernando de talavera during the period studied exhaustively the proposals set forth by the genoese captain colon and rejected them as being extravagant and impractical in the present year a second commission headed by the grand cardinal pedro gonzalez de mendoza has also seen fit to decline the services of colon the present special committee on the quality of life finds itself in complete accord with the actions of the previous two bodies of inquiry it is our unanimous conclusion that the rash scheme advocated by this visionary would if adopted do serious damage to the finances and ecology of spain that this damage if permitted would set a precedent for future more severe outrages of our environment that even if successful it would unacceptably alter the lifestyle of the citizens of spain and most important that the proposed voyage would expose any sailors engaged thereon to unacceptable risks of permanent bodily illness and injury and even death certain people may perhaps suggest that the sea program of this kingdom is essential to its future growth to this uninformed view we may only offer our wholehearted opposition the atlantic sea program offers extremely high expenses and hazards in both men and materiel for gains at best speculative but most likely nonexistent now more than ever resources need to be concentrated at home to bring the long war against the heathen moors of granada to a successful conclusion at such a crucial time the state should waste no money on a program whose returns if any will not be manifest for some decades if funding must be committed to the sea program it should be earmarked for national defense goals in the mediterranean sea not spent on wildeyed jaunts into the trackless and turbulent atlantic unless and until we succeed in overcoming the corsair gap now existing our southern coast will remain vulnerable to attacks from algeria and morocco even after the moors of granada are brought under our control moreover if we fail to move against the heathen states of africa they shall surely fall under the aegis of the expansionist ottoman sultanate with potential profound consequences to the balance of power in the area as strong infidel forces will then be able to strike at our routes to our italian possessions it may be argued that shipbuilding will aid the economy of those areas near ports this view is superficial and shortsighted true jobs may be provided for lumberjacks carpenters sailmakers etc but at what cost to the world in which they live barring reforestation projects for which funding does not appear to be forthcoming any extensive shipbuilding venture will inevitably result in the deforestation of significant areas of the kingdom and the deformation of the longestablished ecological patterns of the wildlife therein in any case it is questionable if shipbuilding represents the ideal utilization of our limited timber resources the quantity of wood required to construct an oceangoing vessel could better be used to provide lowincome housing for whole villages of peasants or could furnish many underprivileged citizens with firewood sufficient for an entire year further especially for long voyages such as that urged by colon ships must carry extensive stores this point will again be alluded to later in the report the question must be posed as to whether our agricultural industry is even adequate to care for the needs of the populace of spain itself surely an affirmative answer to this question such as cannot with assurance be made at present is necessary before expansion can be contemplated and resources diverted for it we must put a halt to these environmentally disadvantageous programs before they become so ingrained in our lifestyle that their removal presents difficulties there is yet another factor to be considered one closely related to that referred to in the previous sentence even if colon precisely fulfills his expectations what will the consequences of this success be for spain many substances about which we know little and which may well be hazardous will begin to enter the kingdom in large quantities and control over their sale and distribution will be difficult to achieve we run a substantial risk of seeing our nation filled with addicts to toxins now unknown nor is it possible to discount the dangers of ideological contamination which is as much to be feared as is physical it is doubtful if the inhabitants of the distant lands the genoan plans to visit share our religious and cultural benefits yet it is probable that some of their number may settle on our soil and attempt to disseminate their inadequate but perhaps seductive doctrines among our populace as we are now on the point of expelling the jews from our state and have nearly overcome the muslim moors why should we hazard the homogeneity we have at last achieved after almost eight centuries of sustained effort the sudden influx of new goods will also disturb our traditional economic organization there can be no doubt that there will be an increase in the monetary supply because of the profit made by reselling eastern goods throughout europe but can a corresponding increase in the volume of goods and services be predicted if the answer to this question is in the negative as all current economic indicators would imply then the success of colon would seem to bring with it a concomitant inflationary pressure which would tend to eat into the profits of that success and would make life more difficult and expensive for the average spaniard also any substantial increase in the sea program would entail the diversion of labor from its traditional concerns to maritime activity such a shift could not help but further disjoint our economy and cannot be anticipated with anything other than trepidation the dislocation could even be so severe as to cause emigration to the eastern lands which would of course entail a drain of the best of the kingdoms populace from its shores finally if the government of spain is to approve fund and provide manpower for the colon expedition it must have some assurance that it is not dangerously imperiling the health and future wellbeing of the members of that expedition such assurance is not at all easy to come by the dangers of a seamans trade are well known and he performs his duties on what can only be described as a diet of junk food hardtack salt meat and dried peas with perhaps a bit of cheese this regimen is manifestly unhealthful and colon and the men under his charge would be unable to supplement it except by fishing they would not enjoy the advantage as do sailors of the mediterranean sea and also the portuguese in their journeys down the coast of africa of replenishing their supplies at relatively brief intervals but would be compelled to make do once having departed the canary islands nor is the situation in regard to potables much better these being restricted to casked water and wine the probability is extremely high that at least some of the former will go bad the latter not only faces this danger but if drunk to excess has the potential of severely compromising the efficiency of ships operations and thereby reducing an already low safety margin sleeping arrangements are equally substandard indeed for almost everyone they are nonexistent ships are so designed that only the captain has a cabin with a bunk and even this private space is scarcely more than that to be found in a closet ashore sailors and underofficers sleep where they are able to find room in the same clothing they have worn during the day thus the lifesupport systems of any expeditionary force at the current level of technology must be deemed inadequate navigational instruments are also crude in the extreme quadrant and astrolabe are so cumbersome and so likely to be grossly affected by ships motion as to be little more useful than dead reckoning in the determination of latitude dead reckoning alone serves in estimating longitude for a voyage of the length anticipated by colon these factors in combination with the stormy nature of the atlantic and the likelihood of meeting unanticipated hazards with no support facilities upon which to fall back give the genoans proposals a degree of risk so high no merciful sovereign could in good conscience allow his subjects to endanger themselves in the pursuit thereof therefore it is the determination of the special committee on the quality of life appointed by your hispanic majesties as per the environmental protection ordinances of the realm that the proposals of colon do in the several ways outlined above comprise a clear and present danger to the quality and security of life within the kingdom and that they should for that reason be rejected respectfully in triplicate submitted by jaime nosehada chairman of the special committee on the quality of life batboy ive loved baseball since i was a kidnot just playing and watching it but its lore its history it is i suppose the game for someone who like me trained as a historian it has more respect for its past and more detailed records of that past than any other major american sport this story is a ring lardner pastiche save that its hero encounters problems on and off the field that none of lardners southern boys ever had to deal with boston september dear willie youll see by the address and the picture that was took of me the other day what has happened sure enough the browns has bought my contract and i am in the bigs at last the way i found out was like this i had just finished shutting out knoxville when old charlie told me the owner wanted to tell me somethin i thot i was in dutch again especially when he ups amp says rip were gonna have to get rid o you this time but he had a grin and a train ticket amp so here i am they is all dam yankees up here excepting some of the ballplayers the country is pretty but its full of rocks they do feed you good i have had scrod which is almost as good as catfish i have a roommate for the hotel his name is laszlo kovacs or some bohunk thing like that hes a rook too up from syracuse he plays second mostly not a bad fellow i guess dont say much tho well i can talk enuf for two as you has told me before this got to stop now they is yelling for me to go down to this fenway park where the red sox are at it is a nice place to play pass my love on to ma amp say hello to sally for me i wouldnt ask you to do that if you wasnt married amp my brother show her the picture of me in my uniform if you get the chance your loving brother rip a big leaguer even if it is the browns boston september dear willie well i must say they surely do things backards in this american league i got me the chance to pitch yesterday on account of the red sox was hitting line drives off everybody what stuck his head out the dugout so the mgr says come on kid get loose lets see what you can do i did amp he stuck me in figuring since they had us down i couldnt make things no worse so in i come and just to keep me interested its nd amp rd amp no outs i popped up the st fellow i pitched to amp the next one hits right back to me this is easy im thinking cause the next spot is the pitcher big lefty name of george somethina girls name i think well he hit my curve like he knew it was comin amp winds up on rd with a big grin on his ugly mug then i get the leadoff man which is why i say this is a backards league the pitchers hit and the hitters dont come to that the browns is backards too they do not do too poor at first amp then get weaker amp weaker as the season goes along lazlo or however you spell it was talkin about that with a newspaper fellow in the hotel last night fellows name is gyula nagy so i guess he is a bohunk too in fact i know he is part of the time they was using bohunk lingo which sounds like nothin i have heard before i can tell you this gyula has a son called zoltan which is a heathen sounding name if ever i heared one because his pa travels with the team amp all they let him wear a little uniform amp fetch balls amp bats around amp the like an all right little tyke i think tho my roomie didnt rightly take to him i will say he is funny looking with just the one eyebrow growing acrost his forehead like that we go to new york next i will rite you from there your brother rip psremember none of the runs what scored counted against me on account of they was on base already when i come in new york september dear willie i thot the towns in the southern assn was big this year till i seen boston but i can tell you this new york makes boston look like opelousas back home beside it every kind of furriner lives here amp i think a few yankees too no i dont mean the baseball team tho they been giving us fits since we got in town well they might cause we is into our september swoon which is what that gyula fellow calls it but you got to remember he is a riter this polo grounds where the yankees i mean the baseball ones this time play has fences even shorter down the line than sulphur dell in nashville but could we reach em not a prayer of it never did you see so many little squibs amp pops in all your born days we is dead on the field too balls that should ought to be caut or picked up easy go thru which makes the pitchers cuss but they aint throwin hard either it looks like to me maybe ill get some work on account of it about the bounciest thing on the whole team is that zoltan which i told you about in my last letter he was kind of sollemlike in boston but has perked up remarkable on the train ride south its a caution to see him jumpin amp carryin on in the dugout his little cheeks is just as red as a couple of boiled crawdads funny i didnt spy that before will close now as laszloo which as you can see i still dont ritely know how to spell is taking me to a bohunk restaurant he found out about some ways i would sooner have grits but cant find em up here again pass on my love to ma amp affecktion to sally for you too now as i think of it your brother rip new york september dear willie now that i have ate bohunk food i see why they was so eager to cross the ocean amp come over here to get away from it is why the stuffed cabbage was not too bad amp there was beer to wash it down but what is done to pork chops is a caution i tell you you could smell em coming before they was out of the kitchen they had that much garlic on em i was a blame fool to let laslo order for me well even he made heavy going my eyes was watering fit to kill as i made shift to eat em if ma hadnt always taut me to clean my plate i would of gived up after the st bite ma never tried eating these tho which is lucky for her i like to died when we got back to the hotel we stunk up the lobby good two of our ballplayers who was in there lit up cheroots amp i mean big ones the second we walked in between the smoke amp us a sweet young thing which had been makin eyes at doc our shortstop passed out altogether it was what they call a sensation just then gyoola amp his boy zoltan come out of the elevator i went over to say hello thinking as how bein bohunks their own selves they wouldnt mind what i smell like amp gyoola does say hello nice as you please but zoltan his eyes rolled up in his head amp for a second i thot he was going to faint like the lady if thats what she was then he kind of run away from me i dont think his pa knew what to make of it amp i surely didnt laslo his eyes got very big but he didnt say nothin here is another funny thing a good half a dozen of the fellows on the team say they seen a bat flapping round their winders in the middle of the night me i call that right peculiar on account of bats not much favoring towns amp especially not one the size of new york i didnt see no bats this morning i turned to laslo amp said probably we scared em away the way we stunk last nite amp without batting an eye which is a joke i guess he says probably these furriners amp almost furriners is peculiar people love to you and ma rip ps i will be home in time to help with the harvest so dont you worry about that none new york september dear willie well it was a big day for this here hotel room yesterday lazlo got to start when del our reglar nd baseman turned up sick i dont know what was rang with him but he was pale as a fishbelly you could see the spot where he must of cut hisself shaving under his chin just like a coal on a snowbank i hope it aint catchin but about lazlo he sure dont seem tired he got hits amp stole a base amp was robbed another time amp played good in the field we lost again but it was not his fault nor mine neither the mgr throwed me in in the th when we was down already but had men on so he batted for graver who had started not that it helped on account of the pinch batter hit into a double play but i pitched innings amp did not give up a run amp would have got a win if our hitters had been good for anything which reminds me of somethin that right ticked me off remember how i said the other day how zoltan would hop around amp cheer for us in his little brownie suit well he didnt do no cheerin for lazlo even tho they is both bohunks means he was quiet all day seein as how the rest of them didnt do nothin like i said after the game i says somewhat to lazlo about it but he dont seem the least bit fazed he says his rootin i can do without you make heads or tails of it for i cannot your brother rip detroit september dear willie seems as how lazlo amp gyoola amp zoltan is filling up all my letters but there has been another dustup among em since i rote you last the latest hoorah commenced on the train between new york amp here it might not of happened if lazlo had not got hisself likkered up he is fond of whiskey but not much for holding it i had a few myself but having started on corn squeezins no storebought whiskey can shift me which i know you will understand i was takin lazlo back to our pullman when who shd we run into but gyoola my roomie like to spit in his eye he rears back and comes out with do you know what kind of unnatural monster your son is your drunk says gyoola which was true amp your crazy which i did not think too far off either but lazlo goes crazy am i amp shouts something in that furrin tongue o theirs gyoola gapes at him like a newcaut fish amp says you are crazy sharper this time but lazlo comes back in that old country lingo amp pretty soon they was slangin each other for all they was worth if the noise ment anything i wish i knew what they was sayin cause it sounded lively then lazlo ups amp swings on him which proves gyoola was rite on account of gyoola would make of him i give him credit gyoola didnt swing back he is a gentleman i got my arms round my roomie at last amp hauled him to bed by the time he was in the bunk he got the upper this trip he had went from fightin drunk to cryin drunk carryin on about how gyoola is a fine fellow but deseeved amp changelings amp i dont know what all his yams what i could make out of em is wilder than anything i ever heered old jacob tell who was a slave before the states war well when i climed into the lower they was somethin in the bed with me i thot it was roaches but it was cloves of garlic i found when i pulled one out i says how did this get here and lazlo answers back i put em there amp you leave em i want no track with your heathen superstishun i says amp do you know what he does next he hands me down a crucifix like the papists use amp says take this then thank you i will keep the garlic i tell him amp he shuts up more of the team is down with whatever it is del has if it hadnt come on so sudden id call it hookworm they are all washed out amp listiess like people with the worm suckin on em but i heered somewheres the yankee parts o the country dont have hookworm so it cant be that it is a terrible thing to happen to us because with ty and wahoo sam and the rest the tigers whale the ball against the best of teams amp how are we supposed to stay with em with half the players sick amp the rest draggin if we lose they will blame the pitchers they always do love to you and ma and your kate your brother rip psgot your telegram in new york i am glad to hear sally says she is proud of me detroit september dear willie i am commencing to wonder if maybe i am the crazy one amp not laszlo after all it is on account of what i seen or rather didnt see in the hotel this morning it is a fine place much fancier than the ones we stayed at in boston or new york one wall of the lobby is a mirror i suppose to make it seem bigger then it is not that it needs to because it dont we come in erly in the morning draggin our tails some because tho you can sleep in a pullman its not near as good as a bed players amp reporters amp such was mingled with porters totin our bags amp a few o what the reverend would call scarlet wimmin you neednt mention them last to ma or sally either anyways to make a long story short while we was all checkin in amp the clerks was yellin for bellhops amp the like i happen to look round in the mirror to see if my new panama which you must see was strait on my head it was but what should i spy in the glass but a little boys suit without a little boy in it if you iake my meaning there was nothin like that in our crowd only zoltan smiling at me his teeth is uncommon white amp long amp sharp like i say he was smilin but not real frendly like i didnt think i says if that dont beat all amp point out what i seen to laslo who was standing by me cause were roomies as you recollect and he looks too amp dam me if his eyes dont near roll back in his head but when he catches zoltan lookin our way he makes out like everything is alrite hes good remember me not to play poker against him nobody else seemed to notice nothin amiss when we was up in our room laslo rounds on me amp says this is the last proof now do you see what sort of feind it is it is a vampire what on earth is that i ask amp he tells me more then i bargined for seems this vampire crechur is a kind o bloodsuckin hant the bohunks has which ifn you fail to kill itll leech a man to death we got to kill it laslo says all rile up i says well that may be a good idear but how do you aim to go about it it dont sound easy from what he says amp i know from old jacob as how hants is never easy to be rid of but bein a bohunk hisself laslo has a skeme which may work i hope so the browns is ragged enuf with all the blood in em amp purely hopeless without the tigers done trounced us today amp look like doin it again tomorrow we had reglars out o the lineup this has got to stop so i am with laslo all the way tho there is likely to be some risk but no hant is a match for a good southern man i will tell you how we done in my next letter love to you from yr brother rip psif it goes rong give the picture of me in uniform to sally to remember me by dont read this part to ma the more i think the scareder i get detroit september dear willie the lord be praised the deed is like they say done laszlo and i is well tho the thing turned out much more tighter than either one of us reckoned it wld what we done was take down all the garlic amp other heathen charms laszlo been usin to keep the hant away amp the crucifix too amp wait for it or rather zoltan i mean to pay us a call nite before last he didnt either on account of he suspected a snare or because he was eatin somewheres else the whole team is so peaked these days i couldnt cipher out which ones was fed on last well we left the hoodoos down again last nite amp sat up waiting for whatever was going to happen we did not want to be caut napping for sure as we had done this the nite before too amp slept a little of the day i confess i was yawnin then lookin out the winder i seen the bat what had been seen round before i reckon thats what it was anyways for it seen me too amp flied closer i just had time to give laszlo the sign amp let him get out of sight longside the winder afore it come up i dont quite know how to tell what happened next i was lookin into its eyes amp its like i heered a voice in my head saying let me in let me in and i couldnt of said no even if i wanted to which at the time i didnt that vampire hant charmed me with them red opticks of its just like a snake charmin a bird down out of a tree for it to swaller laszlo said after i was like a machine when i up and opened the winder i dont hardly recollect one way or the other all i remember is them eyes in my head i heered that voice again give me your neck it was sayin amp i twisted my chin to one side like a shote which dont know its about to be slaughtered then its like there was a scream only it werent a noise at all only in between my ears laszlo had sprang out from where he was hidin amp landed the hant a smart one with his crucifix we didnt know what that would do neither him or me but we found out right quick they was a thump a real one this time amp insted of the bat at my neck there was zoltan on the floor naked as the day he was bom only i reckon he werent bom at all when you think about it he was still part hant tho i had thunk his teeth was long before well now he had a set the bobcat we ketched last winter would of been proud of he was smilin like a wild crechur amp i got to tell you them eyes still dragged at me somethin fierce not at laszlo i reckon the cross saved him maybe them catholics is not as rong as we think anyways he hauls out a railroad spike amp slams it into zoltans chest i heard that shreek again in my mind amp i reckon in laszlos too on account of his hands was shakin but he did not let go he shoved that spike in harder amp deeper zoltans mouth was open so wide i thot itd go clean round to the back of his head i was moving like a man in a dream still but when laszlo cussed at me i done the last thing we planned out which was fling a whole garlic down his i mean zoltans trap i dont know if that shifted him or the spike but then he give a last riggle amp his eyes well if they was lamps youd say they was blowed out all a sudden i was alrite again laszlo and me the both of us yelled then on account of it wasnt no little boy on the spike any more but a bat the same size zoltan had been amp just as dead too amp then the bat melted away like snow in a thaw amp there was nothin on the rug excepting the spike which laszlo had dropped and the garlic so its done i reckon i wish i eld sleep for a week but we got a game tomorrow i bet we whup em too your brother safe amp sound rip detroit september dear willie well whup em we didnt i am afraid the tigers they is a good team amp that ty runs amp hits like a madman amp you cant pitch around him either or sam or bobby will kill you if he dont so we lost again but the boys which was most bloodsucked are looking better amp so i have no douts things will get better soon amp heres a funny thing nobody remembers nothin about zoltan amp what he was doing to em but for me and lazslo come to that nobody remember nothin about zoltan at all laszlo amp me we run into gyula at breakfast amp was not sure what to say or nothin finally lazslo asks him hows your son amp he looks at my roomie like he was off his head amp says i aint got no son nor never did lazslo amp me look at each other amp press it no farther i can tell you amp you remember how zoltan was in the dugout with us and all well his little uniform is plumb disappeared amp nobody knows where it has gone nor misses it neither when i asks the mgr what become o the batboy he gives me the same look gyula done gave lazslo amp says this team aint never had no batboy thats what you think i says but dont worry he done flied out for the last time amp i laughs amp laughs even tho hes reamin me up one side amp down the other sometime there aint no point in tellin people things anyhow is all i can say your loving brother rip the last reunion this story sprang from the research that produced the novel the guns of the south indeed captain thorpe briefly appears in the novel he truly was captain of company a of the fortyseventh north carolina and did write its regimental history he was in fact still alive in the s when he did more historical work on the regiment he may even have attended the confederate reunion at richmond in the train pulled to a stop richmond the conductor shouted all out for richmond the man in the long gray coat with the brass buttons slowly got to his feet made his way down the aisle a porter walked behind him with his bags people waited respectfully until he had passed then began filing out after him the conductor touched a finger to the brim of his cap in salute watch your step as you get out general let me give you a hand suh john houston thorpe waved away the offered assistance if i cant manage a couple of steps young fellow you may as well bury me and im no general im proud i was a captain and ive never claimed anything more taking some of his weight on his stick he descended from the passenger car without difficulty richmond in june was warm and muggy but so was rocky mount north carolina from which hed come the weather was not what made his shoulders sag for a moment it was the weight of the past hed come through richmond in with the rest of the fortyseventh north carolina hot and eager to join lees army of northern virginia in the great invasion of the north that would set the confederacy free forever hed been dapper and handsome with slickeddown black hair and a thin little mustache of which hed been inordinately proud nowhow had sixtynine years slid by inside he felt like a dashing youth still the body that moved only slowly the thick spectacles the gnarled hand he often cupped behind one ear were they truly his surely it was the world that had changed not himself a flashbulb exploded in front of his face filling his vision with purple spots no flashbulbs when hed been here before in those days having a photograph taken meant standing solemn and statuestill until the long exposure ended he nodded yes it was the world that had changed welcome to richmond general the fellow behind the flash camera shouted have you come here other times since the end of the war never once thorpe answered with a sort of pride but now i thought if i dont come nowwhen shall i have another chance what do you think of the city general the man asked as his eyes cleared thorpe saw the fellow had a press tag tucked into his hatbanda reporter then im no general he repeated a bit testily a reporter was supposed to know such things what do i think of richmond ive not seen much yet but it strikes me as a big city of course it did that a while ago too the laugh that once rang musically was now a rusty croak but he loosed it all the same when hed first come north to richmond not a town in north carolina had held as many as five thousand inhabitants no wonder the confederate capital then near forty thousand seemed to him a metropolis swollen past belief these days rocky mount was on its way to being a city of the size richmond had been then he wondered why he failed to find it large perhaps because he and rocky mount had grown together but his town had grown up while he somehow he had just grown old from behind him the porter said you come on with me suh ill take you to the cab stand the colored man picked up his suitcases again and raised his voice make way fo the general here make way folks and people did clear a path following in the porters wake thorpe reflected that the illegitimate promotion people insisted on foisting on him was worth something at any rate if it got him through the crowded train station so easily he laughed again whats funny suh the porter asked when i was a soldier here i doubt the people would have moved aside so readily for any real general save maybe robert e lee as they do now for me i led no great armies only a ragtag company my only claim to notice is my span of years theres worse ones than that suh the porter observed thorpe slowly nodded judging by what hed seen in the second half of his long life there were many such worse claims most of them trumpeted uncommonly loud the negro dropped thorpes bags for a moment to stick his fingers in his mouth and give forth with a piercing whistle a taxi driver waved to show hed heard the porter grabbed the suitcases again and headed for the boxy chevrolet behind him thorpe made the best speed he could pretty girls paused to stare wideeyed at him as he went by he remembered that from his soldier days too then he wouldnt have minded getting some of those girls alone he fondly remembered a couple of leaves spent in the citys seamier districts the most respectable girls nowadays showed more rounded flesh than any shameless woman had in his youth but desire was only a memory too between them the porter and the taxi driver tossed his bags into the back seat of the cab thorpe dug in his pocket and pulled out a quarter the porter beamed a quarter was worth far more in these hard times in than it had been in the inflationraddled richmond of the war between the states god bless you suh god bless you too thorpe said back in the old days he would have tipped a slave who served as well as this porter had negroes had been free now long enough for a man to go from birth to old age in that span of yearsnot old age like his own of course but age old enough it hadnt worked out as dreadfully as longago fireeaters feared it would so perhaps abe lincoln was right all along right or not lincoln prevailed the proof of it was that thorpe couldnt even recall the last time hed wondered about the justice of emancipation where to general the taxi driver asked camp de saussure wherever that may be thorpe answered he didnt bother correcting the man apparently he was to be a general for the duration whether he liked it or not if that was so he decided he might as well like it hed grown used to far worse things over the years thats what theyre calling the lee camp soldiers home for the reunion the driver said as he held the car door open for thorpe in honor of general de saussure of the united confederate veterans isnt it yes i think so thorpe slowly carefully bent to sit down in the taxi ca de saussure actually called himself a general because he headed the veterans organization thorpe did not think much of that all the real generals whod worn gray and those whod worn blue as well were dead the taxi pulled away from the curb soon it was tooling along at an effortless thirtyfive miles an hour the john houston thorpe who had visited richmond not far past the midpoint of a vanished century would never have believed such a thing his greatgrandchildren took it utterly for granted to them a horseback ride was an hours amusement at a fair not the only way to go from one place to another thorpe himself rarely thought about automobiles these days this afternoon though he was seeing new things in an old mirror the driver had his window open to bring in the breeze thorpe was halfdozing until a loud roar overhead jerked him back to full awareness damned airplanes the taxi man said they fly so low sometimes one of emll come right down in the middle of traffic one fine day mark my words thorpe didnt answer the taxi driver was young men had probably been flying his whole life to thorpe cars were wonderful and usefulbut easy enough to take in stride at airplanes he would never cease to marvel if he lived another ninetyodd years he knew quiet pride that the very first one had left the ground less than a hundred miles from where he lived as the reporter had the driver asked him whether hed been in richmond since the states war when he answered no the fellow said bet its changed a fair bit since then that it has thorpe said in those days there wasnt a paved road in richmond the town was either full of mud or full of dust the flies swarmed fit to drive a man mad and everything smelled of horse manure he chuckled to watch the taxi drivers jaw drop every town south and north was like that then though i dont suppose it gets into the history books they didnt have flush toilets in those days either youre lucky to be a young man in such a marvelous time the chevrolet was far from a new automobile its springs had seen better days nevertheless on the asphalted highway it rode smoother than any carriage over dirt thorpe tried to imagine what a carriage would have felt like had he whipped a twohorse team up anywhere close to the speed he was making now pointless efforta carriage at full tilt would have overturned the second it hit a stone or a pothole but the glory then the driver began thorpe broke in no glory to dying in camp of smallpox or measles or scarlet fever no glory to typhoid either or to perishing of fever after your wound went badand it would for we had no medicines no glory to having your arm cut off and tossed on a pile outside a tent or under a tree while the surgeon shouted next no sir dont speak to me of glory the taxi driver chewed on that for the next couple of minutes as if it were a piece of meat stuck between his teeth at last he said hesitantly now general if thats how you feel why did you come to see the men who went through it with me one last time before i die thorpe said no one who didnt can possibly imagine what it was like it was true enough as far as it went but thorpe wondered if it went far enough take away the remembered dirt and pain and hunger and terror and something remained behind something that had drawn him from rocky mount after all these years he scorned the idea of glory as most men did who had seen war face to face but something was there even if he didnt care to try to name it for a taxi driver the taxi stopped in front of the soldiers home low cottages on greensward with a few bigger buildings among them a hospital a dining hall a chapel the driver got out opened thorpes door for him and hauled his bags off the back seat what is the fare thorpe asked thirtyfive cents general anywhere inside richmond city limits when i was here last young man this was far to the west of the city limits the first coin that came into thorpes hands was a half dollar here you are i have no need for change thank you general smiling the taxi driver carried the suitcases toward a cottage with a large sign in front of it welcome confederate veterans a colored man standing by the door hurried forward here ill take charge of those suh he told the driver who relinquished the bags nodded to thorpe and hurried back toward his automobile the colored man held the cottage door open you go right on in general so as they can get your name and figure out which cottage you belong in well make you right comfortable here i promise you that im certain of it thorpe said through the door he saw several old men several other old men he reminded himself in gray suits talking with some younger folks who sat behind tables and shuffled through file boxes he got in line behind one of the veterans the fellow turned around his beard was bushy and white but his eyebrows had somehow stayed black as coal he chuckled rheumily might as well be waitin my turn at mess call makes me think i really am back in the army after all yes i remember that thorpe said the four words were plenty to push him back in time to make him smell the cook fires hear the chatter of men around him even to taste the hot cornbread that had been so much of what he ate for so long he got to the head of this line sooner than he usually had at mess callbut then so many fewer men were here now one of the young men asked his name went through a box marked tz and pulled out a badge youll be in cottage c general thorpe pick any vacant bed there i hope you enjoy your stay do you need help pinning that on sir no thank you thorpe proceeded to prove it the rheumatism doesnt have hold of me too badly cottage c you said thats right general its also on your badge below your name in case the young fellow thought twice well just in case in case you forget hed started to say thorpe declined to take offense so many men his age had wits that began to wander his though so far as he knew were still sound hed written the history of his regiment back around the turn of the century and only a handful of years had passed since hed compiled a roster of men from nash and edgecombe counties whod served in the fortyseventh north carolina now he thought he was the only soldier of his regiment left alive the colored manone of the helpers at the soldiers home no doubtwas still waiting when thorpe came back outside cottage c is it he said reading the badge you just follow me general its not far thorpe followed in the old days teaching a negro to read had been against the law some had thought blacks too stupid to learn anyhow obviously they hadnt known everything there was to know the beds in the cottage proved to be steelframed army cots with scratchy woolen blankets and stiffly starched sheets and pillowcases thorpe chose one by the window to get the benefit of whatever breeze there might be sorry we cant put you folks up in higher style general the attendant said as he set down the suitcases most of the time though theres just a dozen or so old soldiers in the home and we got seven eight hundred of you all comin to visit dont worry thorpe said every man of us here will have known worse accommodations than these i promise you he looked at his army cot in his army days no such creature existed hed slept on pine boughs piled in a frame rolled in his blanket a far more ragged and threadbare specimen than the one on the cot or just on bare ground and even a pillow back then such had been undreamedof luxury the colored man declined a tipthis heres my job suh and hurried away to help some other newly arrived veteran settle in thorpe left the clapboard cottage too and walked slowly over to the dining hall it wasnt yet supper time but several veterans were in there passing time with a deck of cards a couple of them paused between hands to squirt jets of tobacco juice at a spattered spittoon looking at the white beards the bald heads the gnarled fingers thorpe wondered why hed come wasnt it better to remember the men whod fought under the stars and bars as young and dashing and brave rather than seeing what time had done to themand to him then someone tapped him on the shoulder hello stranger you look like you could do with a nip of something bettern water thorpe turned of course the man behind him was wrinkled and old everyone here was wrinkled and old but the fellow looked alert and cheerful in fact behind goldrimmed spectacles his eyes held a gleam that said hed probably been a prime forager when he wore the gray in earnest a nip eh thorpe said i have been wondering where i might find one not being from these parts prohibition didnt stop drinking but made it harder to get started in a town where you didnt know somebody the other veteran set a finger alongside his nose then produced a silver flask from a waistcoat pocket help yourself but leave enough for me too the whisky wasnt very good but thorpe had drunk whisky that wasnt very good for a great many years he squinted at the other mans badge i am in your debt mr uh ledbetter what unit if i may ask army of northern virginia eighth alabama call me jed im john then you fought in hills corps too i was fortyseven north carolina henry heths corps you were in mahones am i right so i was by god your memory still works john so does mine even if my pecker dont yeah i was there for all of it ah hell not quite the yankees caught me two days before appomattox i stayed with it till the end thorpe said then he fell silent even after a span of years close to the biblical threescore and ten some memories remained sharp enough to wound ledbetter let him be as any of the veterans would have after a while he said well it aint what we wanted it to be back then but it aint too bad neither thorpe nodded gratefully that much was true ledbetter changed the subject a little i got in here last night and they feed you royal that they do if wed had rations like these when we were in the field wedve won that goddamn war no doubt about it i was thinking the same thing about the beds thorpe said ledbetters laughter was not a croak but the hearty cackle of a laying hen john you have that one dead on and im not jokin why i remember the time i had to sleep in a tree four nights runnin that werent the worst of it neither i the story went on for some time thorpe believed not a word of it he suspected most of the old men here had stories like that several of the poker players wore coats studded with badges from so many past reunions that they looked like field marshals from some balkan army better at bragging than fighting their yarns would have grown in the telling every time they were trotted out too by now few would resemble anything that had actually happened jed ledbetter shuffled off toward the bathroom thorpe stood around for a while watching the men playing cards sure enough they had stories by the trainful as the shadows lengthened one of them got up and turned on the electric lights in the old days thorpe thought it would have been an oil lamp or a candle and endless eyestrain no one else seemed to notice the change from then to now again hed wondered why hed come what he had in common with these garrulous oldsters the only answer he could find was that the war had defined their lives as it had his hed been with them at their beginnings seeing them at the end of things seemed fitting too generals please a woman in nurses whites called over and over till she had the veterans attention we need you to go out for a little while so we can set the room up for supper thorpe left without complaint the poker players followed more slowly grumbling all the way he smiled that took him back across the years some of the men in his company had left their cards back in camp when they went into battle so as not to have to explain the devils pasteboards to st peter if they got killed but others like these old fellows would sooner have played than eaten as six oclock drew near more and more veterans gathered on the grass outside the dining hall quite a few of them had flasks which they werent shy in sharing after three or four had gone by thorpe began to feel merry he joined in the cheernot quite a real rebel yell but closewhen the doors opened as if at one of those longago mess calls the men formed a single line as they filed in since he didnt know anyone here thorpe took a seat at random he found himself across the table from jed ledbetter the alabamian grinned at him displaying tobaccostained false teeth was i right john or what aint this finelookin grub that it is jed thorpe meant itplatters of ham and chicken alternated with bowls full of green salad peas and mashed potatoes and gravy along with the unofficial liquids lurking in hip flasks there were milk and cocacola and ice water he filled his plate full he was eating better here than he had lately down in rocky mount times were no less hard there than anywhere else in the country he heard so much talk of picketts charge and what might have been at gettysburg that he couldnt help himself dont you forget pettigrews boys he said at last we went up the hill on picketts left and a whole great lot of us never came down again maybe hed touched glory then he wasnt quite sure he did remember being too excited to be afraid even when the federal guns on the flank tore great bleeding holes in the tight gray ranks somebody said reckon they call it picketts charge on account of his fellas got to the top o the hill and in amongst the yankees and pettigrews didnt one of the reasons they got to the top is that we shielded them most of the way with our bodies thorpe retorted hotly then he stopped amazed at the anger he could still feel sixtynine years after the fact he managed a laugh its water under the bridge now thats for certain so it is the other veteran answered and bodies under the ground too the whole table fell silent for a moment then that shot had landed too close for comfort almost all the bodies were under the ground by now and the ones that werentthose at this reunion for instancewould be soon though tired thorpe found he wasnt sleepy along with dozens of other veterans he sat in the dining hall for hours after supper was done drinking coffee some of it spiked smoking and listening to and telling tales as his regiments historian he knew a lot of them the ordinary passing of day and night seemed far away its always like this at these things a graybeard with a chestful of reunion badges said when youre with your own kind you want to spend all the time you can on doin and talkin your bedll always be there and you wont thorpe thought now that he was here he wished hed started coming to reunions long ago well that was water under the bridge too a few at a time the old men slipped out of the hall and made for their cottages a little past midnight someone made a horrifying discovery in his program book he clambered up onto a chair and teetering dangerously waved his arms and waited for quiet when he got it he said loudly theres gonna be a goddamned band playin us goddamned reveille at seven oclock in the goddamned morn in tomorrow they must think were still in the goddamned army assisted by two of his comrades he descended from his perch the dining hall emptied quickly after that thorpes ears were not what they had been but he didnt think he could sleep through a bands worth of reveille sure enough at seven sharp the music blared out along with the rest of the men in cottage c thorpe dressed and returned to the dining hall this time he made a point of finding jed ledbetter the alabamian looked up grinned his yellowed grin then resumed his attack on a plate of bacon and eggs thorpe had been reading his own program book he said i dont mind getting up early today because the mornings event is the united confederate veterans business meeting ledbetter grinned again evilly an you reckon youll just doze right through it you mean it has to be easier than sleeping in a tree dont you think thorpe asked deadpan remind me to watch out for you john ledbetter said you may be a quiet one but you got yourself a devil hidin there inside the two veterans sat side by side on the bus that took them to the mosque auditorium at sixth and laurel confederate battle flags flew everywhere in richmond a forest of them waved in front of the mosque an enormous one was stretched behind the speakers platform the buildings ceiling fans stirred the thick air but did little to cool it the introductions of aged uc v dignitaries by other aged uc v dignitaries went on and on some of them seemed hardly more lively than stonewall jacksons horse old sorrel whose stuffed carcass was on display back at the soldiers home as hed thought he might thorpe dozed through the speeches every so often his head would fall forward onto his chest and wake him in those moments he saw he was far from the only old soldier having trouble staying awake after lunch the confederate veterans filed onto the buses that took them across town for the dedication of the richmond battlefield parks they rolled east along the section of franklin street called monument avenue past the memorials to matthew fontaine maury to jackson to jefferson davis to lee and to jeb smart thorpe hadnt been with the army of northern virginia for the seven days campaign whose sites took up much of the battlefield parks but hed fought at cold harbor two years later holding grants men away from the confederate capital his bus was one of the first to arrive so he got a spot near the speakers stand a solidly built darkhaired us army colonel was leaning down and shaking hands with a good number of veterans whos he thorpe asked lets have us a look jed ledbetter checked his program behind his thick reading glasses his eyes widened god damn me if it aint us grant iii thorpe waited to hear no more but began trying to make his way through the crowd it wasnt easy too many other exrebels had the same idea but at last he got to clasp hands with the federal commanders grandson and namesake thank you for coming here sir he said im pleased to do it colonel grant answered i wasnt sure what kind of reception id get seeing what my name is but everyones been very kind your grandfather was doing the job he thought right sir so were the men who fought for him thorpe answered we knew that then and we know it now nothing could have shown it better than his kindness and theirs at appomattox when the federals fed us and let us keep our horses and mules he always felt you southern men were doing the same and doing it bravely grant said we always were brothers even when we fought yes thorpe said by then though colonel grant had turned to another old soldier thorpe went back to his place without resentment it was just the reverse that a grant would come here to pay tribute to his grandfathers former foes said all that needed saying about reconciliation between north and south perhaps not quite all jed ledbetter played the part of the unreconstructed rebel i wont shake his hand he said when thorpe had returned from the buntingdraped platform i wouldnt have shook his grandpappys hand neither general ha he just kept throwin bluecoats at us till he wore us to death is all they were brave men too thorpe saidwhen they came across the open country at us here at cold harbor shooting them felt like murder he paused a moment in surprise and realization i expect they felt the same about us the third day at gettysburg didnt stop em ledbetter growled then he made a sour face all right john i see your point god damn if i have to like it though as the afternoons speeches wore on a couple of confederate veterans passed out from the heat but doctors and nurses were at the ready and soon revived them thorpe noticed that jed ledbetter clapped as loud as anyone else after colonel grant spoke in fact the colonel got the loudest hand of the afternoon ledbetter pulled out a pocket watch as the old soldiers reboarded the buses we better be back by six he said somebodyll pay hell if i miss amos n andy on the radio he sounded much fiercer at that moment than he had when he was grumbling about general grant several men echoed him some profanely but the organizing committee had taken into account the nearly universal passion for the show no reunion events were scheduled while it was on fortunately the buses did return on time thorpe listened to amos n andy along with everyone else in his cottage then went to dinner and then to the mosque for a reception honoring the veterans to his surprise he actually got asked a sensible question there a man in his middle thirties came up and said sir do you think what you went through was as hard as the fighting in france thats a hard question to answer young fellow you were over there thorpe asked the man nodded thorpe watched his eyes go distant and watchful yes hed seen the elephant the confederate veteran said we werent up against the big cannon and the machine guns and the gas as you boys were but we didnt have your supply train or your doctors either wars hard any which way i expect true enough the great war soldier nodded again thank you general thorpe stayed away from the next days business meetings at the mosque talking with the assembled veterans at the soldiers home was more enjoyable when he let out that hed been a captain a lot of them gave him a hard time most in those days had been youths with no rank to their name at one point that afternoon he asked jed ledbetter to move so he could get past him and go to the bathroom ledbetter sprang to his feet with alarming spryness yes sir captain sir he cried coming to a brace surely stiffer than any hed used back in his soldier days thorpe looked around at the grinning veterans if its all the same to you gents i think id sooner be demoted back to general so i can be like everybody else he said amid raucous laughter the rest of the confederate soldiers gave him his wish around four ledbetter got up and left the talk of old battles won and old battles lost im gonna take me a nap he announced when a couple of eyebrows went up i wanna be at my best fo the ball tonight do some fancy steppin with the pretty young things thorpe looked forward to the dance too but the talk was even better with names that echoed across the decades like faroff musketry some hed been through gettysburg and the wilderness cold harbor and appomattox some were from before the days when the fortyseventh north carolina had joined lees army antietam fredericksburg chancellorsville and some came from the west shiloh stones mountain vicksburg one whitehaired texan had fought at palmito ranch more than a month after the surrender at appomattox yeah we whupped the yankees he said but if wedve knowed yall had done give up we wouldntve bothered jed ledbetter came back to the dining hall in time for supper he made a point of sitting by thorpe for the trip to the ball at the grays armory as the bus rattled down the street they exchanged addresses sure ill write to you john ledbetter said what the hell else i got to do all day he cackled with laughter a flask came by thorpe sipped from it passed it to his new friend he said we can put all weve got into the dance tonight seeing as well be in cars for the grand parade tomorrow i heard tell about that ledbetter said nodding dont know as i like it much i marched in plenty o these down through the years he paused and loosed that cackle of his again course i was younger then the ballroom swept thorpe back to the days when hed been younger much younger had the girls been in crinolines and hoop skirts that swept the floor had the gallants been without gray beards and canes the scene might have been one from his first stay in richmond all those years before the moment the music started he even forgot his comrades age most of them forgot it too swinging their partners through the grand march as if they were going off to battle in the morning several of the young ladies exclaimed in pleasure they might not have expected the old soldiers to have so much vim left no sooner had that idea crossed thorpes mind than a girl behind him let out an indignant squeak and exclaimed why general you forget yourself no missi remember by god the veteran retorted fiddlers played tunes that went back to the war between the states thorpe discovered his feet still knew how to jig he was out of breath and his heart pounded heavily in his chest when the music stopped but the applause from his partner a very pretty little strawberry blonde about the age of his oldest greatgranddaughter resolved him to dance all night the american legion band played square dance music thorpe felt lighter on his feet than he had in thirty years maybe more he knew he was cutting a sprightly figure some of the veterans wilted as the evening went on and retired to the sidelines but he stayed out on the floor just as hed told himself he would general shouldnt you take a rest asked the blond girl her name hed learned was marjorie he shook his head miss i havent so many nights of dancing left in me that i can afford to waste even part of one marjories laugh displayed small even white teeth all right general since you put it that way lets cut us a rag thorpe was one of the last veterans still dancing when the band played dixie the armory echoed with shouts and cheers and old mens voices cracking as they tried to turn loose rebel yells thorpe yelled with the best of them pumping his fist in the air marjorie stared wideeyed not just at him but at all the old soldiers maybe just for a moment she too saw them as theyd been so long ago emboldened by that thought thorpe leaned forward and pecked her on the cheek she smiled and squeezed his hands between hers thank you general she said ive enjoyed this evening much more than i thought i would so have i miss marjorie he said oh im tired ill not deny but i dont grudge a minute of it but when a little past midnight he got into a nightshirt and pulled back the covers on his steel cot he felt a dull pain in the left side of his ribcage he curled his lip in mild scorn at the weakness of his flesh though he hadnt done so much in years he was sure hed be fine come morning he lay down prayed briefly and fell asleep he awoke in darkness amid old mens snores the pain was back and suddenly seemed big as the world he sat up started to get out of bed thorpe looked down at the cuff of his gray coat it bore the double twist of braid that showed captains rank he looked at the hand protruding from the cuff the flesh was smooth and unspotted the tendons no longer upraised like old tree roots pushing through thin soil he had no time for surprise he and the rest of the men in gray and butternut and occasional looted yankee blue hurried through the cover afforded by a stand of old pine woods the trees thinned ahead he could see the line of the weldon railroad the burned ruins of what had been reams station south of petersburg the low parapet the federals had thrown up twenty or thirty yards east of the train tracks keep your ranks boys he called to the men of company a the troopers of the chicora guards just grinned and nodded theyd been through enough fights to know what to do without being told the federals held their fire no doubt waiting for their foes to reach a point from which they would be unable to get away cheaply suddenly from not far behind thorpe brigadier general william mcrae shouted dont fire a gun now but dash for the enemy the soldiers in gray traded grim looks if mcraes ploy failed they were the ones who would pay the butchers bill no choice though but to obey drawing his army colt thorpe cried forward and ran to the attack at the head of his company the rebels burst out of the pine woods yelling like fiends the northern soldiers yelled too in surprise and alarm muzzle flashes stabbed outward from the parapet thick clouds of blackpowder smoke rose above it a mini ball cracked past thorpes head confederate soldiers fell screaming and writhing in pain but the charge was across only a couple of hundred yards of ground since the rebels did not pause to fire and reload their rifle muskets always deadly dangerous out in the openthey drew near the parapet before too many of them fell thorpe tripped on a crosstie as he ran across the railroad track he stumbled almost fell caught himself just in time then he was at the low federal earthwork a man in blue scrambled up to meet him thrust with a bayoneted springfield thorpe fired the colt pistol at pointblank range the federal wailed and reeled backward clutching his belly other southern men were up on the union works now too some fighting hand to hand others shooting down into the trenches behind the parapet some bluecoats fired back but more threw down their guns and threw up their hands in token of surrender the cheering confederates swarmed forward a ragged private seized a flag from a color bearer who seemed too stunned to stop him a glum federal who wore a majors shoulder straps on the plain blue blouse of a private turned to thorpe and said captain your men fight well that was a magnificent charge thank you sir thorpe said nodding to his courteous captive the rebels began hustling more prisoners off to the rear they must have bagged a couple of thousand yankees thorpe thought proudly but the cost was not light men of the chicora guards whod seemed to have charmed lives all through the companys hard fighting were down now dead or wounded no doubt the story was the same all through the fortyseventh north carolina the surgeons would be busy tonight thorpe peered east the federals not hit or captured were abandoning their works and retreating in that direction they wouldnt tear up any more of the weldon railroad here not for a good while to come confederate cavalrywade hamptons boysgalloped up from the south to speed the yankees on their way the rattle of gunfire slowed to a lethargic poppoppop and finally petered out thorpe glanced back over his shoulder the sun was almost down hard to believe the fighting had lasted most of the day in the middle of the action from the moment it began hed had no time to think about what he was doing here at reams station about how hed returned to august to his youth again thats over he said to no one in particular all over so it is agreed the union major who he somehow hadnt gone back with the rest of the prisoners so it isin a way welcome john weve been waiting for you a long time youre one of the last to join the ranks under the orange light of the setting sun dead and injured men of both sides their wounds suddenly vanished sprang to their feet and went around slapping one another on the back that was a good shot you nailed me with eb just luck willie just luck fact is i was aiming for joseph there next to you proud bullettorn battle flags from north and south fluttered together in the evening breeze under them the men of both sides gathered all sound and well as they had been before the battle started i got me some good coffee here a yankee announced wholl swap me some baccy for it a rebel stepped forward smiling to make the trade thorpe stared not fully understanding not yet the northern major touched him on the forearm did it not seem real john he asked quietly was it not as in the old days then thorpe knew beyond any doubt yes by god it was he said he woke next morning in a shelter tent he shared with benjamin bunn and george westray the lieutenants were already up and bent over a chessboard they set the game aside to go out with him and take morning roll for the company he smiled as he walked in front of the drawnup men so many faces he hadnt seen in so many years after the roll was taken the chicora guards lined up for mess call and then for drill before they could begin their evolutions though the drummer began the monotonous patter that summoned soldiers gray and blue to battle dismissed to get your war gear thorpe called cheering the men trotted back to their tents and bedrolls snatched up rifles and cartridge boxes thorpe followed a little more slowly he wondered which fight it would be today poor old john jed ledbetter said as the hearse pulled away from the soldiers home he took off his hat and held it over his heart poor old john he went and missed the grand parade designated hitter as ive said i love baseball if i were the athletic type i would have tried to play since im not i sometimes play beer league softball which is not the same thing at all at all those of you who have done likewise will recognize that a good deal of this story is drawn straight from life i never met anyone like michael though i wish i had you find all kinds playing beer league softball i ought to know they let me play for instance ive been a baseball nut since i was a kid unfortunately im also a klutz i can hit a little i cant field at all as soon as they saw me with the leather the rest of the gatorsthats my team in case you hadnt worked it outtook to calling me dr strangeglove after dick smart a notorious nonfielding first baseman with the pirates and red sox back in the sixties i have to say i earned the name so when we go out there ill catch some of the time thats pretty safe for the teamtheres no stealing in slowpitch if were way ahead or way behind ill get in an inning or two at first mostly im a designated hitter the leagues we play ina lot of beer leagues come to thatall fifteen guys on the team get to hit even if only ten can be on the field at any one time im also our official scorer statistician what have youdamn sight better at that side of the game than playing worse luck and at beer and pizza im a champ thats as important as the game just about besides my girl thinks i look good in the uniform which is more than i can say for some of the gators who are nine times the ballplayer ill ever be joe humphreys our real first baseman looks like an avocado with a beard in his dark green softball togs and stuart boileau at short is skinny enough to be a lizard he has this habit of licking his lips all the time too which doesnt hurt the image once at shakeys we ordered him a pepperoniandbugs pizza if they wouldve served it he wouldve eaten it all of which brings me around by easy stages to the oddestlooking ball player i ever saw this was at the start of last years spring leagues and my gators were in deep bandini a couple of guys have been transferred out of state since last fall and two or three more were working nights for a while we were plain strapped for troops a bare ten had shown up for our opener and our archrivals the tomcats trounced us i didnt exactly cover myself with glory in that game either i was a fat for though i got on my last time up when their pitcher embarrassed himself by throwing my comebacker eight feet over the first basemans head i razzed him as i stood out there and he gave it right back thats the only way youll ever reach against me he said which was near enough true that i shut up after me came our leadoff hitter stuart did us proud with a sharp single to center like an idiot i tried to go to third on it even though the other guys had a fellow with a rocket for an arm out there gave it all i hadheadfirst dive into the bag well actually shoulder firstsomething went crunchpop when i hit ouch isnt what i yelled i jammed it good my right arm was in a sling for the next couple of weeks to add insult to injury i was out sling and all i showed up at the park next tuesday night even if i couldnt play i liked hanging around with the guys and i can drink lefthanded it didnt look like there was going to be a game though only nine of us were there counting me which you shouldnt youre supposed to field ten in softball but its legal to go out there with nine eight or fewer and you forfeit wheres roy i asked wes humphreys joes little brother hes only sixthree and our manager called me this afternoonhes got the flu sounded like hell bad without roy we didnt have a prayer of fielding a team and with a forfeit wed be two games back of the tomcats right off the bat in a tengame season thats death wes knew all this better than i did he hates losing and wont take it lying down so now he called to this fellow sitting in the bleachers watching us loosen up hey man you play this game me the guy looked startled a little maybe he had an accent that wasnt spanish not a good sign if we were after a ballplayer well he had to be foreign or else the melting pot had gone and melted down id noticed him watching us the week before too i couldnt help it he was a mediumdark mediumheavy black guy maybe thirty but his hairhe cornrowed it very neatlywas irishman red i mean flaming and hung past his shoulders he wore a mustache and goatee that were even brighter i went to high school with a japanese kid who spoke pure hushmamouf arkansasturned out his folks had been resettled there during the war and stayed a while afterward he jolted me every time he said something looking at this guy now was like thathis hair and his hide spectacularly didnt match wes would have taken him if he was a giant panda covered with chocolate feathers come on down he said waving weve got open roster slots you can join us for the season if you want or sign up and then duck out after tonightwell have more people here next week whatever you want wes is a good talker he has to be he sells glassware for a living you could see the guy thinking it over finally he shrugged and ambled on over to us he didnt have a uniform of course but his clothes were grubby enough to play in faded levis a coors tshirt and beatup running shoes about what we wear to practice he said his name was michael with a bit of a guttural on the ch he shook hands with everybody lefthanded with me then wes dug our ancient spare glove out of the bottom of his duffel bag michael hadnt been stretching when he said he played a little he lunged awkwardly for balls when he was playing catch blocked grounders with his shins or his feet as often as he fielded them cleanly he threw from the elbow girlstyle not too straight i could see wes regretting things already but michael was a warm body anyhow and catching he wouldnt be all that much worse than i was when it was michaels turn to hit in our warmups wes who was pitching bp waved him to the plate he looked worse up there than he had in the field he stood straight up and down with his left foot so far in the bucket it wasnt ever pointing at third base more like at our dugout off third he held his bat at a funny angle with his hands a couple of inches apart yeah i know ty cobb did the same thing but ty cobbs grandmother had to be a more stylish hitter than this michael wes gave him a nice fat pitch to hit he took a clumsy swing missed he muttered something under his breath and tossed the ball back next pitch he hit a little ground ball that dribbled between stuart at short and pete sadowski our third baseman a hit sure enough not impressive but itll look like a line drive in the box score as the saying goes attaboy wes yelled next pitch was another clean miss michael took the one after that then hit a bloop just past first that joe couldnt quite reach in a game that would have been a double then a grounder straight at pete on third except it hit a pebble and kicked away from him another miss then a pop fly over smart but too short for the outfielders then a big bouncer right at smart but on the last hop it flattened out and went between his legs then another bloop that sent joe puffing down the line he couldnt catch that one either this must have gone on for another five minutes every so often michael would miss and those incandescent cornrows would fly as he shook his head in annoyance but when he hit it would be one little bleeder or bloop or bad hop after another nothing like art but nothing like outs either finally our left fielder ted canter who was far and away the best athlete on the team slid six feet on his belly to snag one of those pops maybe two inches off the ground good catch michael shouted he tossed the bat to somebody else nobody said anything for a few seconds we werent quite sure what wed seen or what to make of it wes stood on the rubber scratching his head at last he said remind me not to play poker with you man youd probably draw four to a ten and end up with a royal flush yeah flush pete yelled so michael got his nickname he smiled and looked a lot younger he was pretty sober most of the time we let the other team have the field for their warmups they were an outfit called snafu they played like their name a lot of the time too still they were pretty cocky seeing us short a guy we gathered around wes while he made out the lineup sheet he was still scratching trying to figure out where to bat michael on form he deserved to hit last but if all those hits were legit he was a clear third hitter wes finally compromised and put him sixth it turned out to be a busy sort of game snafu got two runs in the first and another four in the second michael got knocked ass over teakettle in a play at the plate the throw was high and as he went up for it the runner a big samoan built like a linebacker cut the legs out from under him he was safe michael never did get the ball he found it and threw it back to wes way to hang in there flush wes said nodding michael just dusted himself off and went back into his crouch we were hitting too scoring as fast as snafu i was in a slowpitch game once but most of them arent like that we finally won this one when snafu made backtoback errors the first one with the bases loaded in the last inning michael damned if he didnt go four for four a soft liner over second another one of those dinkers back of firstthough he got thrown out trying to stretch that oneand a couple of ground balls with eyes the second one started our big rally he scored a couple of runs in fact at shakeys afterward pete got a pitcher of bud and set it in front of michael you got a choice flush he said as threatening as you can be with a big grin on your facetell me youll be back next week and you can drink it otherwise ill pour it over your stupid head when do we play michael said we all cheered it got pretty drunk out thats an advantage early games havethey give you more time to party afterward i remember asking michael what he did he thought about it it took a few seconds he had nothing against beer finally he said some of this some of that i spend a lot of time looking i backed off in a hurry say no more id been unemployed not too long before that a bad feeling by the next game i had that miserable sling off thank godever try to bathe in one im glad i wear a beard shaving lefthanded is something id sooner not think about i was still combing my hair that way though the arm wasnt ready for anything serious it twinged whenever i lifted it higher than my shoulder we had enough people there this time and wes made michael a dh he was awful shaky in the field he knew it too and didnt say boo but in warmups he put on another hitting show he looked terrible up there but he wasnt making any outs wes threw his hands in the air all right im convinced he batted flush third it worked too he was up three times got three more cheap but effective hits and we won again not only that for once snafu kept their act together for a whole game and knocked off the tomcats so we were tied with them again even the postgame pizza wasnt as greasy as usual a fine week i was up for the next game we had some momentum we were going against another weak teama gang called the mother truckersand i was well enough to play my arm still grumbled but i could use it to make sure i didnt hurt it again i went through warmups doing just what i would have done anyway throwing knuckleballs typical of me to have my one baseball talent be absolutely useless what good is someone who can throw a knuckler only with a slowpitch ball but ive got a mean one if i say so myself and a knuckleball is the easiest thing in the world on your arm look at hoyt wilhelm or phil niekro or charlie houghbig leaguers all well into their forties a knuckleball comes up to the plate or to whoevers trying to catch it with about as much oomph as a marshmallow but if youve thrown it right youve killed almost all the spin on the thing and every tiny little air current can have fun with it as if flies if youre a batter its like a drunken moth heading your way itll dance itll float itll shimmy the best one i ever threw seemed to stub its toe halfway there and hop on one leg the rest of the way marvelous fun hitters have no idea what itll do next thats fair neither does the guy who threw it catchers hate itthey cant handle it either trouble is sometimes it doesnt knuckle then it might as well be batting practice think of a hanging curve only more so tonight though playing catch with pete i had a good one he caught it the first time i threw it barely it looked like a scoop of ice cream sitting right at the top of his glove damn thing has the staggers he said and fired it back to me harder than i can throw even when my arms fine my mitt popped my hand started burning but i had my revenge petes a pretty fair ballplayer he caught most of what i threw lunging and stabbing and guessing which way the rabbit would hop but he dropped a couple missed one clean and had to chase it and took one right in the leg its hard to hurt anybody with a knuckler especially with a slowpitch ball but he did the stanislavsky routine yelling and bouncing up and down and generally malting an ass of himself when he was done with that nonsense he flipped the ball to michael who was next to him loosening up with ted here flush he said trade places with me this bastardwhich was the nicest thing hed called me since i plunked himthrows like you hit one of michaels gingery eyebrows went up really he said and threw me the ball he was better than hed been a couple of weeks before starting to get his whole arm into it but with that funky old glove he was still using he couldnt have hung on to the first knuckler i gave him if he were johnny bench i was proud of it it wobbled seven different ways and the last one caught him right in the chest he picked up the ball and looked at it as if itd taken a bite out of him do that again he said like he didnt believe what hed seen he couldntve picked a better way to flatter me the next one wasnt as good it only broke once but down and away and zigged under his glove and past him he ran after it hard and burned it back to memustard on it if he ever learned to throw right hed have a good arm how do you do that he said it made me proud mind over matter i told him grandly flexing what passes for my right bicep his eyes got big and round they were a light golden brown an interesting color let me have another one hell id throw that thing all night if somebodyd catch it for me i give him credit he fought it all the way catching the ones that didnt knuckle too much even a couple of good ones getting his glove on most of them but several got by him and im afraid i nailed him a few more times the last one in a tender spot knuckleball or not he doubled over so did pete but he was laughing ohh that stings he sang out in falsetto wes came rushing over he wasnt mad at pete he was mad at me dont you go racking flush up dr strange he growled and he meant every word of it hes worth more to this team than youll ever be you goddamn clown do not blame him michael said when he could talk again that is a remarkable talent he has and the ball eluded me time after time pete is right i think he does pitch like i hit remarkable my left one wes snorted you okay yes yes michael sounded impatient it was about time to play we started crowding into the dugout michael slapped me on the back congratulations i doubted your people could do such a thing huh i said but just then stuart tied out and michael had to go out on deck when he came up he singled between second and firstnobodyd got him out since he had joined us he promptly scored when wes brother joe boomed one past the center fielder he tried to stretch it into a triple slid hard into the mother truckers third baseman and they started wrestling joes all right off the field but he plays rough he picked on somebody his own size that third baseman had whale lettered on the back of his shirt both benches emptied we managed to pry em apart without any punches getting thrown in the fun and games i forgot about michaels peculiar remark i didnt make anything much of it anyway he had the same right to life liberty and the pursuit of weirdness as any other gator sure enough he ended up going for two rollers and a humpbacked liner nobody could reach we won i think it was at shakeys afterward i remembered again hey flush i said and looked around for him he took off man ted told me gulped a beer and split probably afraid you were gonna clunk him some more smartass something i wanted to ask him oh well if i think of it ill catch him with it next week but when next tuesday rolled around michael didnt show he hadnt called he hadnt left word he just wasnt there wes cussed me up one side and down the other he had no more idea than i did whether it was my fault but he took no chances and when we lostnobody hit a lickhe reamed me all over again he plain hates to lose michael didnt come back either and it took us a couple of games to get used to having him gone we lost one of those and then lost to the tomcats again and ended up tied for third with snafu lord wes was furious we played in two summer leagues then a fall one then took a rest for wintersun belt or not its too damn cold life went on joe got married again wes got divorced again teds wife had twins pete got busted for drunk driving and spent a night in jail we were going to get together last week for our first spring practice but it got canceled of coursethat was the day the aliens showed up god knows how they did it from somewhere out around the orbit of uranus but they sent every country their message in its own number one language naturally you saw the one who was talking to us here m the states the same way i did humanoid sure but not from here even if he did wear a pinstriped threepiece suit to reassure the natives i suppose not with elephantgray skin and bright blue hair those first few awful seconds with everyone wondering whether they were going to blow us away i was too freaked to notice that he cornrowed it then i saw a couple of the others going back and forth behind him they were a little out of focus but brown skin and brickred hair isnt a combination you forget in a hurry ohmygod i said all one word the one in front started talking his english had the same raspy accent as michaels but he knew how to handle himself in front of a camera i greet you in peace he said and you believed him he had a presence dan rather would kill for i greet you he said again and congratulate you and extend to you the invitation of the confederacy of sentient beings to join our ranks you have fulfilled the three criteria for membership you have gained control of the atom true you use it in war but your national struggles are over now yes and this ship itself is armed that is only proper danger must be guarded against you seek to explore space a race without the curiosity to step outside its cradle is not worth knowing and you have at last begun to master your own minds and use them directly not merely through the clumsy mediation of the body he glanced at something on the desk in front of him whatever an alien uses for a paperweight maybe it lifted up about six inches and hung in the air i didnt think it was special effects what i thought was more like no wonder michael was such a good place hitter of the three he went on this last is the key for without control of the mind no race can truly be said to be mature we searched for it long in you and began to fear you lacked it then one of our investigatorsremember how the picture cut away to a redheaded black man in a gators cap thats flush all rightfound a member of your folk using the talent in one of your games where it exists it can be trained we shall do this for you it is the least we can do to welcome you among us we will be landing soon my friends you are no longer alone the screen went blank after that right and youve seen the broadcasts since everything well gain by joining this confederacy of theirs the trade the ideas far horizons when wed almost forgotten what that meant everybodys going nuts celebrating the end of war the end of poverty the end of everything bad i sure hope theyre right but im a little worried that mature thing grayface was talking about all ive been thinking of is that goddamn knuckleball and what it must have looked like to michael especially when he was used to shoving things around with his own mind and looking for evidence we could do it too well soon is tomorrow now but their ship is armed they said so i wonder what happens when they realize we cant like i said im a little worried gladly wolde he lerne what could be more important for any society than making its next generation better and smarter people than the current one yet to whom do we entrust so much of the task of raising our children all too often to daycare workers who cant find work much above the minimum wage and to teachers who majored in education because it was easy we get what we pay for though here as anywhere else the probability of gladly wolde he lerne reflecting reality is effectively zero too bad only the cold greenblue glow of mercury vapor lamps lit the campus lot when ted collins pulled in he had to park a long way from the lecture hall he hauled his attach case off the front passenger seat and locked the car then already weary from a full days work he trudged over the asphalt toward the hall it was more than half full when he came in even so it was quiet the rest of the educators there were as worn as he was some of the superintendents administrators program specialists and supervisors looked fresh out of college others like him were a few years older already experienced in managing school district affairs whatever their backgroundscollins himself was an assistant superintendent for education planning and researchthey all had one thing in common they were all ambitious enough to go to night school to learn what they needed to know to advance in the educational bureaucracy professor vance walked in she strode briskly to the podium and tapped at the microphone to make sure it worked collins took out his notebook and a pen hed heard from people who had been through this course that vance didnt believe in wasting time she didnt as soon as she found the mike was live she plunged straight into her lecture anyone can be a success at the district level policies are blurred there responsibilities vague very often you never see the actual clients who depend on you for educational services if you hope to go farther in education youll have to lose that pervasive vagueness you got by with it at the university you can get by with it at district offices but its a fatal handicap in an actual school setting heres what i mean by the time that first lecture was done collins wondered what had possessed him to want to become a principal in the first place he thought about dropping the class and staying comfortably in his present job he shook his head when he started something he wasnt the sort to back away from it he ended up acing vances course he took the others he needed one or two a semester always at night as he could fit them into the rest of his life he went through an internship program at an actual junior high school campus he took the staterequired examination for certification before long he got an interview the committee let him hang for two weeks before they let him know hed been accepted kranz elementary school had itself a new principal when collins got the news he threw the biggest party hed ever givenand ended up with the biggest hangover hed ever had the hangover eventually went away as for the size of the partywell what the hell with the raise hed get from his promotion he could afford it and then some he started his new job in the fall it was as challenging as hed hoped it would be budgeting for a single school was a much more complicatedand as professor vance had warned so long ago a much more precisebusiness than planning for districtwide programs where you could always shuffle money between dozens of different accounts human relations counted for more at the schoolsite level too little by little he learned how to build rapport with the faculty as principal he also came into contact with pupils something hed never done back in the district office dealing with them made the problem of handling a staff look simple but again he learned he got on with the rest of his life too he married a curriculum specialist from the district office where hed worked before he took up golf after a while he was shooting in the mid eighties he grew a mustache after a while it turned saltandpepper satisfying as his principals assignment had been he slowly decided it didnt give him everything he needed he hated the idea of being in a rut for the rest of his life he talked things over with his wife go for it she said i know itll be tough even if you dont make itand so many people dontyoull be better for the experience but i think you will i think you can do it youre wonderful he said and kissed her the very next day he enrolled in night school again the moment he walked into his first class he saw most of his fellow students were folks a lot like him solid men and women whod already built up solid careers but wanted something more oh there were a couple of people in their early thirties but only a couple he knew they were the ones hed have to watch out for the whiz kids the ones on the fast track to the top he was no whiz kid he was a grinder that had always worked till now he had to hope it would keep on working congratulations dr de la vega said as he walked to the front of the classroom and sat down on the table by the podium congratulations just for being here and for wanting to be the best his mild smile turned savage now well see how many of you i can run out of the program over the next twenty weeks he meant it too nothing was watered down here nothing simplified to let the slower people keep up if you couldnt keep up too bad grimly collins buckled down to do the work he ended up with a high b in the course and felt prouder of it than of most as hed earned every course in the whole program turned out to be like that collins learned to live on coffee and four hours of sleep a night at a physical his doctor warned him all that coffee could bring on an ulcer he kept drinking it without it he would have had to quit and hed come too far to do that as time went on he became ever more conscious of the responsibility that came with jobs at the top of the hierarchy he had to look hard at himself to find out whether he truly wanted it without false modesty he decided he did before he was even allowed to take the exams at the end of the program he had to convince an interview board he was worthy the exams themselves made the ones hed taken to qualify for principal look like a pop quiz when he learned hed passed everybody at his school gave him a party he got his picture in the local paper along with half a dozen other tiredlooking people more interviewsnow he could pick and choose because there were always more jobs than people qualified to fill them he finally settled on one not far from where he lived in a topnotch school were delighted to have you the principal there said shaking his hand once his exams were over collins had cut way back on his caffeine intake even so he hardly slept the night before his first day on the new job am i really good enough he asked his wife as he picked at breakfast that morning you bet you are she said now go get em for all her encouragement he needed a deep breath to still the fear inside him as he walked up to the enameled door with the tarnished brass on it he opened the door he went inside good morning class he said forcing his voice to steadiness good morning teacher the children chorused teacher he felt ready to burst with pride after so long after so much hard work at last hed reached the pinnacle of his profession the barbecue the movie and other unfortunately not so relevant material part of this one comes from driving over forty miles each way back and forth to work for seven years part of it comes from having an unusual last name myself and part of it is just pure silliness when i sit down to write i usually have an ending firmly in mind this time i just had an opening scene and let things roll from there the results are intended to amuse if any deep profundity lurks herein i certainly havent found it tg kahn looked out the window at the traffic going by on imperial highway he wished he were under the warm los angeles summer sunshine instead of sitting here cooped up in an office trying to put a newsletter together he sighed he had gone through some impressive finagling just to get an office he could see out of until a few weeks ago he had worked in an enormous interior room the kind where you needed to leave a trail of bread crumbs to find your way through the maze of partitions cubicle sweet cubicle one typists sampler read which perfectly summed up the place the newsletter he was writing bored even him he sighed again it beats sleeping on a park bench i suppose he said out loud and mounted another dispirited attack on his word processor the phone rang its chime booming like big ben over the soft incessant muzak kahns fingers jerked a rash of consonants broke out on the screen he stared at them reproachfully as he picked up the receiver tg kahn someone here to see you mr kahn thank you doris his secretary still worked across the corridor in the huge office from which he had recently escaped send him in yes sir doris said and giggled kahn wondered if his ears were playing tricks on him doris hadnt even cracked a smile for the limerick about the crypt at st giles whereupon he had given her up as a hopeless case the door to his office came open so did his mouth the door closed his mouth stayed open the man who walked into his office was in his late twenties a few years younger than kahn and looked vaguely semitic he had a thick fu manchu mustache and the strangest hairdo kahn had ever seenand living in los angeles kahn had seen some lulus the top of the mans head was shaved so was a strip that ran from ear to ear through the bare spot on top and an inch or so on the forehead the rest grew long in greasy braids the man wore a heavy fur coat over leather trousers and boots he must have been dying out there in the heat kahn thought two scabbards hung at the fellows belt one holding a knife the other a curved sword he smelled of sweat and rancid butter the worst thing was that kahn recognized the costume though not the person in it he rose from his chair feeling hot blood rush to his face he had not been in a fight since the sixth grade but he wanted to punch this fellows lights out if youre not a singing telegram pal youre in big trouble he said between clenched teeth the man did not burst into song kahn who tended to think too much for his own good took another look at the cutlery the fellow was carrying and decided that trying to kill him might not be such a good idea after all he stood irresolutely and the moment passed his shoulders sagged very goddamn funny he said bitterly hearing the weakness in his own voice and hating it i presume you know my father to his amazement the man in front of him went down on his knees then thumped his forehead on the cheap indooroutdoor office carpet the door clicked shut at the same time that made the stale greasy stench worse but it also kept anybody walking down the hall from seeing what was going on inside fat lot of good that would do kahn realized he clapped a hand to his forehead in horrified dismay doris damn her blabbing soul would spread this all over the office and so would everyone else who had sported this kowtowing weirdo how would he ever be able to look people in the face again he had to drag his attention back to the fellow who his face still against the nubby knit nylon had started to talk no excellency he was saying in a voice kahn seemed to hear between his ears rather than with them never did i have the privelege of meeting that great hero yesugei i say you are good kahn said with grudging admiration not one in a million knew who yesugei was or cared he wishedoh how he wishedhe didnt himself what are you one of dads grad students if you wanted to get hold of me why didnt you just call the man lifted his head from the rug and looked at kahn with as much perplexity as kahn was giving him i had not thought to find the phrase grad student on your lips mighty lord kahns head was starting to spin the most likely idea hed hadand it wasnt verywas that the maniac who would not get off the rug was some syrian or egyptian studying with his dad who wanted a favor from him that would explain the flowery speech at least why the fellow had to get into costume for that though was beyond him look tell me what you want and take off okay he said the strangers head went thump on the carpet again merely the boon of observing you for a brief while mighty lord that was so far from anything kahn had expected that he blurted who the devil do you think i am anyway surely your excellency can be no one else but temujin genghis khan yes thanks to my old man i am temujin genghis kahn khan said wishing for the nine millionth time that his father had dug ditches for a living instead of being a professor of mongol history it had made him the only firstgrader at oakdale ever to be called exclusively by his initials the fellow on the floor went on as if he had not spoken unifier of the mongols conqueror of north china subduer of the khwarizm shah ravager of russia builder of the hugest s ever see tech writher in debt divorced driving an old toyota kahn finished the litany he looked down at the stranger groveling before him youre carrying on as if i were the real one or something the hangdog puzzled look was back on the mans face again you use strange terms o khan assure me i pray the pangloss properly renders my words into the mongol speech mongol kahn was too far out of his depth not to come with the automatic truth this is english english the strangers eyebrows rose ive heard of it i think then this is not the imperial yurt at karakorum its los angeles where they stared at one another each plainly convinced the other was crazy at last the stranger said in a small voice tell me the date please huh its july th the year now positive he was humoring a madman kahn gave it to him the next question confused him for a moment in what era is that he finally figured out the meaning christian ad anno domini the common eraceif you dont care for christian dating of any flavor one of those terms must have been familiar to the stranger he screwed up his face and began to swear in a style that was bizarre but effective just the same kahn filed a couple of the choicer epithets to use himself lizard piss could come in handy almost any time but he decided to save sucker at the tit of a syphilitic sow for when he really needed itsay when a mercedes cut him off on the freeway when the stranger finally ran out of oaths he turned a face full of storm clouds on kahn you are certain this is not central asia in what you would calllet me thinkthe early thirteenth century not the last time i looked kahn said solemnly he wished he could remember the security guards extension but instead of turning violent the man in the mongol clothes burst into tears kahn watched amazed as he unashamedly wept until he had cried himself out at last the stranger pulled himself together he smacked fist into palm in frustration oh to have come so close and still missed what are seven hundred miserable little years against fifty or sixty thousand kahns head was aching badly by now he had had as much of this exchange as he could stand im so sorry he said with exquisite ironic politeness you must be a time traveler sir and all this time i took you for a nut the stranger waved it aside a natural error however if i were a nut i would not be able to do this for instance afterward kahn would have sworn the fellow only pointed his finger at the office window the window he had schemed so long and hard to get a ray of blue light shot from the strangers fingernail the next moment the glass wasnt there anymore july smog immediately started competing with the bland but breathable product the air conditioner turned out kahn coughed the strangers eyes went ecstatic they also began filling with tears that had nothing to do with emotions the scent of burning hydrocarbons he exclaimed breathing deeply at least until he choked undoubtedly from buildings torched in the search for loot no from dinosaurs torched in the search for a parking space kahns tongue led its own life wild and free while he tried to figure out whether he believed what he had just seen he decided he did his eyes might fool him but he trusted his lungs no way they could hurt so much unless the window glass really had disappeared to have come so close the stranger said again now that he was no longer abasing himself kahn saw that the motions of his lips did not match the words the tech writer was hearing the fellow shook his head in chagrinthere goes my academic career all because the scrofulous temporal phase link dropped me into the late middle first primitive instead of the midmiddle he started to cry again he seemed to be talking more to himself than to kahn but hiswhat had he called ithis pangloss kept working i cant understand it i was supposed to home on the mental vibrations of temujin genghis khan he and kahn realized at the same time what must have happened fury replaced the tears kahn waited for that finger to blast him to wherever the window had gone the look on the fellows face said that might not be good enoughthe sword might come out instead then the stranger tried to master himself it was a visible process and audible because i observe savages kahn heard must i behave as one his earlier wild mood swings made yes an all too likely answer to that kahn said quickly cant you just go on to the temujin you really wanted to see it doesnt work that way the stranger answered bleakly once i am out of the temporal flow returning only snaps me back to my own time and then what am i a graduate student in ancientest history without fieldwork without a dissertation and a laughingstock for the entire collegium for the first time he seemed a real person to kahn because the tech writer understood what he was feeling his own education had ground to an ignominious halt a few months after hed got his bachelors degree when he had to admit his brain simply was not up to graduate work in physicsthat being a subject as remote from mongol history as possible he said maybe you could do your work on twentiethcentury america instead of the mongols i dont know anything about the late middle first primitive the time traveler said petulantlynarrow specialization looked to be a universal constant maybe if you had a guide anything kahn thought to get the fellows mind off his anger and off his ferocious finger i could do it if you like weve come a long way since the thirteenth century you know i doubt it stung by the morose dismissal kahn snapped im going home in a few minutes come along if you want or else dont ill come the stranger said sighing i may as well it wont help though nothing will help he was so woebegone that kahns sympathy revived it wont be so bad youll get to see just about all of los angeles during the ride as far as he could remember that was the first time he had ever had anything good to say about his daily commute he lived in reseda in the western part of the san fernando valley about fortyfive miles northwest of where he worked some days it felt as if he spent more time in his car than on the job after saving the document he had been working on when the time traveler had arrived kahn undid his tie slung his sport coat over his shoulder and said well lets go uhwhat do i call you anyhow my name is lasoporp rof my friends would call me rof you call me lasoporp so there kahn thought as they walked out of the building the security guard gave lasoporp rof an odd look but only a brief one clothes did not make the man not in la the time traveler showed a small revival of interest in the parking lot this is your trusty mongol steed temujin genghis kahn able to travel long distances without tiring you can call me tg kahn said pleased to get a little of his own back and this is my trusty japanese toyota lasoporp able to travel long distances without running out of gas lasoporp rof grunted and got in how far must we fare to your yurt he asked when the tech writer had joined him my condo kahn corrected absently how is it you know all this mongol history without knowing anything else some records of the mongols survived the first great lacuna to be translated into snoit thats your language gods and goddesses no but it was a liturgical language all through the first intermediate and the second primitive up to about nineteen thousand years before my time oh how long will the journey to your yurt take tg lasoporp rof asked as kahn got on i going north the tech writer ignored the slip he was concentrating on his driving an hour if there were no traffic an hour and a half on a regular sort of day two hours if things jam up bad close to a dozen different combinations of freeways would get him home none was much faster than any of the others the first choke point was on the santa ana freeway where it narrowed from four lanes to three a little south of the junction with the long beach freeway traffic crawled along but by moving from lane to lane kahn was able to stay right at sixty he blinked he couldnt remember holes opening up so conveniently he was not about to complain though we are passing cattle lasoporp rof asked were passing trucks kahn said he glanced over at his passenger dont you know the difference between animals and machines what is a machine defeated kahn gave his attention back to the road the santa monica and hollywood freeways branched off the santa ana a little east of downtown he took the hollywood that was the shortest route even if it always did knot up just north of the civic center and it was knotted except that as before spaces kept appearing like magic for kahn other drivers looked at him with envious disbelief as he slid from one to the next he had never seen anything like it the second time he had that thought his head snapped around toward lasoporp rof hed never ridden with a time traveler before eitherdo you have anything to do with this he demanded with what lasoporp rof asked oh do you mean am i helping us get through the herd i find this nomadic excursion grows boring after a while so im exerting a slight probability distortion to help us along i can take it off if you like thats all right kahn said hastily he did not even bother correcting lasoporp rof about the right name for the traffic jam plenty of times hed felt like one wandering sheep in a million i wish i could do it thats all cant you lasoporp rof said surprised yet again here let me induce you it will help pass the time he put his hand on the back of kahns head as the tech writer drove he began to have a feel for where a hole in traffic might be could be would be was guiding the car into that hole was as easy as breathing they were nearly at the junction of the hollywood and ventura freeways when lasoporp rof said now youre doing it all yourself am i by god i am maneuvering the toyota as if it were a halfback dodging clumsy tacklers kahn felt grateful enough to do anything this side of human sacrifice for lasoporp rof he even thought about putting the time traveler on a plane to north carolina to meet his father to him though anything to do with his dad was not this side of human sacrifice he had an idea instead of staying on the westbound ventura he went north on the san diego freeway several miles to devonshire got off went up to chatsworth boulevard then headed west he was whistling when he pulled into the parking lot this is your yurt no your condo you called it lasoporp rof asked no this is a mongolian barbecue place a restaurant that serves mongolianstyle food kahn said when lasoporp rof looked blank kahn went on when you go back to whenever your own time is wont you want to be able to tell everyone about the authenticwell sort of authentic he amended mentallymongol feast you had back in the first primitive you wouldnt even be lying for the first time since lasoporp rof had discovered kahn was not a world conqueror and mass murderer the time traveler actually looked happy thank you tg perhaps i may yet bring some valuable knowledge with me after all yes let us go in a bored oriental woman seated them and handed them menus she does not even recognize my costume lasoporp rof said plaintively how can she be a real mongol she probably isnt mongolia and the united statesthis countryarent friendly with each other ah still you live in fear of the savage mongol horsemen not quite kahn said and was saved from disappointing lasoporp rof with further explanations when the waitress came back he ordered tea for both of them and steamed rice then pointed to the trays of meats and vegetables lined up in front of the barbecue saying well build our own that was what most people did she nodded and left kahn led lasoporp rof up to the food after they had taken bowls the tech writer said theres lamb beef pork and turkey help yourself he wielded the set of aluminum tongs in each tray imitating him lasoporp rof said these are sliced thin so as to cook quickly thats right kahn grinned it was the first question the time traveler had asked that actually made sense kahn added sliced onions bean sprouts celery and cilantro to his bowl then splashed hot barbecue sauce and curry sauce over the contents spicy he warned but lasoporp rof again followed suit then kahn handed his full bowl to the cook behind the round barbecue griddle that was the most nearly genuine part of the whole operation the cook grinned displaying gold teeth he upended the bowl meat and vegetables snarled as they hit the hot iron the cook stirred them with a longhandled wooden spoon chivvied them threefourths of the way around the griddle and deftly put them back in the bowl kahn returned to his seat while the cook barbecued lasoporp rofs dinner the time traveler watched fascinated when he rejoined kahn the tech writer had to show him how to use a fork he held it as if it were a dagger his eyes watered at the first mouthful but he bravely emptied his bowl exclaiming i feel as if im tasting history having no atmosphere the place was not expensive kahn peeled off a ten a five and a couple of singles and left them on the table as he and lasoporp rof walked out the time traveler said though you are enemies of the mongols i see your people has adopted their custom of paper money uh yes lasoporp rof looked around as they were getting back into kahns car the landscape was typical valley urban sprawl a couple of gas stations a eleven a donut shop streetlights and cars cars cars the time traveler sighed this is not the steppe i suppose does it look like the steppe kahn asked he had meant it as a rhetorical question but realized it wasnt how would lasoporp rof know what the steppe looked like i really wish i could see the steppe lasoporp rof sounded so sad that kahn wished he had kept some of the books his father had pushed on him instead of unloading them because they reminded him of his godawful name they would have given the time traveler some picture of mongol life picture the force of his inspiration made kahn want to hug himself with glee he fired up the toyota come on lasoporp ill show you the steppe by god it is close by the time traveler asked eagerly kahn drove through several lights that probably should have turned red but stayed green he was learning he pulled into a small shopping center wait for me here i wont be long amuse yourself quietly till i come back he hurried into the record store across the way when he got back with his package he gasped and thanked his lucky stars he hadnt parked by the big display window close your coat he shouted you told me to amuse myself i said amuse not abuse sweating kahn shook his head in relief that no one had happened by never mind not your fault its not our custom to do that kind of thing in public thats all lasoporp rof let out an audible sniff the drive back to kahns condominium went faster than it had any right to lasoporp rof was sulkily silent until they were actually inside and kahn flicked on a light that is not fire ive seen fire it flickers its done with electrically heated wire when kahn saw that meant nothing to the time traveler he asked well what do your people use for artificial light sun pills of course was what he heard through lasoporp rofs pangloss it made no more sense to him than his explanation had to lasoporp rof he gave up waving the time traveler to his couch he said sit down make yourself at home can i get you a beera cold mildly alcoholic drink kahn laughed at himself he was starting to give definitions without even thinking about it yes thank you when the tech writer came back with two cans of coors he found lasoporp rof examining the israelimade menorah that decorated his coffee table what a strange coincidence the time traveler said picking it up if you had one of these in my own time i would think you were jewish very strange kahn mumbled with some reluctance he let it go at that it was either let go or spend the next three weeks asking questions he tamed on the television lasoporp rof watched curiously as the screen lit up in bright colors and music came out of the speaker it was a dentureadhesive commercial feeling his cheeks grow hot kahn was glad to get rid of it and turn on his vcr the warning about unauthorized duplication at the front of the tape meant nothing to lasoporp rof and this time the tech writer did not bother to explain then the movie came on a epic starring james mason omar sharif robert morley and a telly savalas who still had hair kahn realized the time traveler could not read the credits rolling across the screen its called genghis khan he said helpfully lasoporp rof almost jumped out of his furs and leathers this is a real record of his life no a drama based on it how could it be a real record lasoporp we cant travel in time first primitive lasoporp rof said as if reminding himself that did not keep him from being a spellbound audience for the far eastern horse opera kahn had only seen parts of it on latenight tv the knowledge of mongol history his father had crammed down his unwilling throat made him wince at the inaccuracies but lasoporp rof was plainly eating it up battles overwritten love scenes and all when it was done the time traveler said let me see it again so i am sure i have the sense impressions fixed in my memory together with the meal it should give me enough material to keep my professors happy kahn blanched watching this twohour turkey once had been bad going through it twice came too close to cruel and unusual punishment as he watched he felt a twinge of guilt at what he was doing to far future historiography he stifled it but it made him wonder how much of what his father called historical fact was based on similarly trashy sources a good bit probably he smiled liking the idea at last the ordeal was over lasoporp rof leaned over and kissed kahn on both cheeks then square on the mouth thank you tg thank you thank you he said and then he was gone vanishing suddenly and silently as a popped soap bubble kahn blinked and shook himself like a man emerging from a dream he wondered if the evening had been just that or an outandout hallucination but his living room still reeked of rancid butter there were beer cans on both ends of the coffee table and never in his wildest nightmares would he have rented genghis khan besides tomorrow morning the janitor would be asking him where his office window had gone and there was that probability distortion stunthe looked at his watch and saw to his surprise that it was only a little past ten thanks to lasoporp rofs trick he really had made good time on the road he got out his address book picked up the phone and punched buttons hello jennifer hi this is tg feel like dinner and a movie saturday he held his breath with the effort of bending the odds then let it out in a disappointed gust as she said she was going to a party that night that made the third time shed told him no but id love to the weekend after she finished kahn made the arrangements and hung up feeling a bit like a world conqueror after all in the presence of mine enemies in the course of research for an upcoming novel set in i read albert speers memoirs and also some of those left behind by the jews of the warsaw ghetto combining speersand hitlers grandiose vision of the berlin that would rise after germany won the war with the desperate reality of jewish life under nazi rule led to this story thank god its fiction heinrich gimpel glanced at the report on his desk to see again how many reichsmarks the united states was being assessed for the wehrmacht bases at new york chicago and st louis as hed thought the figures were up from those of well the americans would payand in hard currency too none of their inflated dollarsor the panzer divisions would move out of those bases and collect what was owed the germanic empire and if they collected some blood along with their pound of flesh the prostrate united states was hardly in a position to complain gimpel typed the new numbers into his computer then saved the study on which hed been working for the last couple of days the zeiss disk drive purred smoothly as it swallowed the data he turned off the machine then got up and put on his uniform greatcoat in berlins early march winter still outblustered spring lets call it a day heinrich willi dorsch said willi shared the office with gimpel he shook his head as he donned his greatcoat how long have you been here at oberkommando der wehrmacht now going on twelve years gimpel answered buttoning buttons why his friend cheerfully sank the barb all that time at the high command and a fancy uniform and you still dont look like a soldier i cant help it gimpel said he knew too well that willi was right a tall thin balding man in his early forties he had a tendency to shamble instead of parading and wore his greatcoat as if it were cut from the english tweeds some professors still affected he tried to set his highcrowned cap at a rakish angle raised an eyebrow to get dorschs reaction willi shook his head gimpel shrugged spread his hands i suppose ill just have to be martial for both of us dorsch said his cap gave him a fine dashing air doing anything for dinner tonight the two men lived not far from each other as a matter of fact we are im sorry lise invited a couple of friends over gimpel said lets get together soon though wed better dorsch said erikas saying she misses you again me im getting jealous oh quatsch gimpel said using the pungent berliner word for rubbish maybe she needs her spectacles checked willi was blond and ruddy and muscular none of which desirable adjectives applied to gimpel or maybe its just my bridge game dorsch winced you know how to hurt a man dont you come on lets go the wind outside the military headquarters had a bite to it gimpel shivered inside his overcoat he pointed off to the left toward the great hallthe oldtimers say the bulk of that thing has messed up our weather oldtimers always complain his friend answered thats what makes them oldtimers but willis gaze followed gimpels finger he saw the great hall every day but seldom really looked at it its big all right but is it big enough for that i doubt it his voice though was doubtful too you ask me its big enough for damn near anything gimpel said the great hall built sixty years earlier in the great flush of triumph after britain and russia had gone down before the guns and tanks of the third reich boasted a dome that reached over two hundred twenty meters into the sky and was more than two hundred fifty meters across sixteen st peters cathedrals might have fit within the enormous monument to the grandeur of the aryan race the wealth of a conquered continent had brought it into being the dome itself sheathed in weathered copper caught the fading light like a great green hill atop it in place of a cross stood a gilded germanic eagle with a swastika in its claws atop the eagle a red light blinked on and off to warn away lowflying planes willi dorschs shiver had only a little to do with the chilly weather it makes me feel tiny its a temple to the reich and the volk its supposed to make you feel tiny gimpel answered set against the needs of the german race or the state any one man is tiny we serve them not they us willi agreed he pointed across the adolf hider platz toward the fhrers palace on the far side of the immense square when speer ran that one up he was worried the size of the building would dwarf even our leader himself and indeed the balcony above the tall entranceway looked like an architectural afterthought gimpels short laugh came out as a puff of steam not even speer could look ahead to see what technology might do for him better not let the security police hear you talk that way about one of the reichsvaters dorsch tried to laugh too but his chuckle rang hollow the security police had to be taken seriously still gimpel was right when the fhrers palace was erected another huge germanic eagle had surmounted the balcony from which the germanic empires leader might address his citizens the eagle had been moved to its present position on the roof when gimpel was a boy in its place went an enormous televisor screen adolf hitler platz had been built to hold a million people now when the fhrer spoke every one of them could get a proper view a bus purred up to the oberkommando der wehrmacht building gimpel and dorsch filed aboard with the rest of the officials who greased the operation of the mightiest military machine the world had known one by one the commuters stuck their account cards into the fare slot the buss computer debited each rider eightyfive pfennigs the bus rolled down the broad avenue toward south station berlins myriad bureaucrats made up the majority of the passengers but not all a fair number were tourists come from all over the world to view the most wonderful and terrible boulevard that world boasted blas as any native gimpel normally paid but scant attention to the marvels of his home town today though the oohs and ahhs of those seeing them for the first time made him notice them also sentries from the grossdeutschland division in ceremonial uniform goosestepped outside their barracks tourists on the sidewalk took photos of the fuhrers guards inside the barracks hall where tourists would not see them were other troops in businesslike camouflage smocks assault rifles in place of the ceremonial forces obsolete gewehr s and enough armored fighting vehicles to blast berlin to rubble visitors from afar were not encouraged to think about them neither were most berliners but gimpel reckoned up grossdeutschlands budget every spring he knew exactly what the barracks held neon lights came on in front of theaters and restaurants as darkness deepened dark or light people swarmed in and out of the huge romanstyle building that held a heated indoor pool the size of a young lake it was open at all hours of the day and night for those who wished to exercise to relax or simply to ogle attractive members of the opposite sex its berlin nickname was the heiratbad the marriage baths sometimes amended by the cynical to the heiratbett the marriage bed past the pool the soldiers hall and the air and space ministry faced each other across the street the soldiers hall was a monument to the triumph of german arms among the exhibits it so lovingly preserved were the railroad car in which germany had yielded to france in and france to germany in the first panzer iv to enter the kremlin compound one of the gliders that had landed paratroops in southern england and behind thick leaded glass the twisted remains of the liberty bell excavated by expendable prisoners from the ruins of philadelphia old people in berlin still called the air and space ministry the reichsmarschalls office in memory of hermann goring the only man ever to hold that exalted rank willi dorsch used its more common name when he nudged gimpel and said i wonder whats happening in the jungle these days could be anything gimpel answered they both laughed the roof of the ministry had been covered with four meters of earth partly as a protection against aerial bombardment and then planted partly to please gorings fancy his private apartment was on the top floor the old reichsmarschall was almost half a century dead but the orgies hed put on amid the greenery remained a berlin legend willi said we arent the men our grandfathers were in those days they thought big and werent ashamed to be flamboyant he sighed the sigh of a man denied great deeds by the time in which he chanced to live poor us doomed to get by on matteroffact competence gimpel said the skills we need to run our empire are different from those hitlers generation used to conquer it i suppose so dorsch clicked his tongue between his teeth i envy you your contentment here and now heinrich i almost joined the wehrmacht when i was just out of the hitler jugend sometimes i still think i should have theres a difference between this uniformhe ran a hand down his doublebreasted greatcoatand the one real soldiers wear is that your heart talking or did you just all of a sudden remember youre not eighteen years old anymore gimpel said his friend winced acknowledging the hit he went on me id fight if the fatherland needed me but im just as glad not to be carrying a gun were all probably safer because you dont dorsch said this is also true gimpel took off his thick goldframed glasses in an instant the street outside the interior of the bus even willi beside him grew blurry and indistinct he blinked a couple of times returned the glasses to the bridge of his nose the world regained its sharp edges the neon brilliance of the street outside dimmed as the bus passed by the theaters and shops and started picking up passengers from the ministries of the interior transportation economics and food more uniforms that dont have soldiers in them gimpel thought the buildings from which the new riders came were shutting down for the day two of those ministries though like the oberkommando der wehrmacht never slept a new shift went into the justice ministry to replace the workers who left for home german justice could not close its eyes and woe betide the criminal or racial mongrel upon whom their omniscient gaze lighted himself a thoroughly lawabiding man gimpel still shivered a little every time he passed that marblefronted hall the colonial ministry was similarly active much of the world these days fell under its purview the agricultural towns of the ukraine the mining colonies in central africa the indian tea plantations the cattle herders on the plains of north america as if picking that last thought from gimpels mind willi dorsch said how many americans does it take to screw in a light bulb the americans have always been in the dark gimpel answered he clucked sadly your father was telling that one willi if he was he sounded more relieved than i do the yankees might have been tough mighthavebeens dont count fortunately isolation and neutrality had kept the united states from paying heed as potential allies in europe went down one after another it faced the germanic empire and japan alone a generation laterand its oceans were not wide enough to shield it from robot bombs just ahead lay another monument to german victory hiders arch of triumph gimpel had been to paris on holiday and seen the arc de triomphe at the end of the champs elysees it served as a model for berlins arch and was a model in scale as well the arc de triomphe was only about fifty meters tall less than half the height of its enormous successor the berlin arch was almost a one hundred seventy meters wide and also a one hundred seventeen meters deep so that the bus spent a good long while under it as if traversing a tunnel through a hillside when at last it emerged south station lay not far ahead the station building made an interesting contrast to the monumental stone piles that filled the rest of the avenue its exterior was copper sheeting and glass giving the traveler a glimpse of the steel ribs that formed its skeleton the bus stopped at the edge of the station plaza along with everyone else gimpel and dorsch filed off and hurried across the plaza toward the waiting banks of elevators and escalators they walked between more displays of weapons that had belonged to germanys fallen foes the wreckage of a british fighter carefully preserved inside a lucite cube a formidablelooking russian tank the conning tower of an american submarine into the bowels of the earth dorsch murmured as he reached out to grab the escalator handrail the train to stahnsdorf boarded on the lowest of the stations four levels signs and arrows and endless announcements over the loudspeaker system should have made it impossible for anyone to get lose in the railway station gimpel and dorsch found their way to their commuter train almost without conscious thought so did most berliners the swarms of tourists however were grit in the smooth machine uniformed youths and maids from the hitler jugend helped those for whom even the clearest instructions were not clear enough even so the natives grumbled when foreigners got in their way dodging around an excited italian who had dropped his cheap suitcase so he could use both hands to gesture at a hitler youth in brown shirt swastika armband and lederhosen dorsch growled people like that deserved to be sent to the shower oh come on willi let him live gimpel answered mildly youre too soft heinrich his friend said but then they rounded the last corner and came to their waiting area dorsch looked at the schedule board on the wall then at his watch five minutes till the next one not bad no gimpel said the train pulled into the station within thirty seconds of its appointed time gimpel thought nothing of it as he followed dorsch into a car he noticed only the very rare instances when it was late as the two men had in the bus they put their account cards into the fare slot and then took their seats as soon as the computers count of fares matched the cars capacity the doors hissed shut three more cars filled behind them acceleration pressed gimpel back against the synthetic fabric of his chair as the train began to move twenty minutes later the engineers voice came over the roofmounted speakers stahnsdorf all out for stahnsdorf gimpel and dorsch were standing in front of the doors when they hissed open again the two commuters hopped off and hurried through the little suburban station to the bus stop outside another five minutes and dorsch got up from the local bus see you tomorrow heinrich say hello to erika for me im not sure i ought to willi said both men laughed dorsch got off the bus and trotted toward his house which was three doors down from the comer gimpel rode for another few stops then descended himself his own house lay at the end of a culdesac so he had to walk for a whole block its healthy for me he told himself a consolation easier to enjoy in spring and summer than in winter the snick of his key going into the lock brought shouts of daddy from inside the house he smiled opened the door and picked up each of his three girls in turn for a hug and a kiss they ranged down in age from ten by twoyear steps then he lifted his wife as well lise gimpel squawked that was not part of the evening ritual the girls giggled put me down lise said indignantly not till i get my kiss she made as if to bite his nose instead but then let him kiss her he set her feet back on the carpet held her a little longer before he let her go she was a pleasant armful a greeneyed brunette several years younger than he who had kept her figure very well when he released her she hurried back toward the kitchen i want to finish cooking before everyone gets here all right he said smiling as he watched her retreat while he hung up his greatcoat and took off his tie his daughters regaled him with tales out of school he listened to three simultaneous stories as best he could lise came out again long enough to hand him a goblet of liebfraumilch then started away the chimes rang before she got out of the front room she whirled and stared indignantly at the door i am going to boot susanna right into the net she declared gimpel looked at his watch shes only ten minutes early this time and you know shes always early so you should have been ready hmp lise said while he went to let in their friend meanwhile the girls started chorusing susanna is a football aunt susanna is a football heinrich why are they calling me a football susanna weiss demanded she craned her neck to look up at him im short yes and im not emaciated like you but im not round either she shrugged out of a mink jacket and thrust it into his hands here see to this chuckling he clicked his heels jawohl meine dame she accepted the deference as no less than her due fraulein doktor professor will suffice thank you she taught medieval english literature at humboldt university suddenly she abandoned her imperial manner and started to laugh too now that youve hung that up how about a hug lises not watching i suppose i can get away with that he put his arms around her she barely reached his shoulder but her vitality more than made up for her lack of size when he let go he said why dont you go into the kitchen you can pretend to help lise while you soak up our glenfiddich scotch almost justifies the existence of scotland she said its a cold gloomy rocky place so they had to make something nice to keep themselves warm if thats why people drink it your boyfriend is lucky he didnt set himself on fire here a couple of years ago my former boyfriend danken gott daftir susanna said all the same she blushed to the roots of her hair her skin was very fine and fair which let him watch the blush advance from her throat i didnt know he was a drunk heinrich i know he said gently if he teased her too far shed lose her temper and nothing and nobody was safe if that happened go on lises trying that recipe you sent her the girls waylaid susanna before she made it to the kitchen though shed never been married she made an excellent ersatz aunt she took children seriously listened to what they had to say and treated them like small adults gimpel smiled come to that she was a small adult herself he knew better than to say so out loud walther and esther stutzman arrived a few minutes later along with their son gottlieb and daughter anna anna promptly went off with the gimpel girls she was a year older than alicia the eldest of the three heinrich gimpel stared at gottlieb good heavens is that a mustache the younger male stutzman touched a finger to the space between his upper lip and his nose its going to be one i hope at the moment the growth was hard to see for one thing he had only just turned sixteen for another his hair was even fairer than his fathers and for a third hed chosen to keep untrimmed only a toothbrush mustache the first fuhrers style was newly popular again walther stutzman differed from his son in appearance only by the presence of twentyodd years and the absence of any vestiges of a mustache as he handed gimpel his topcoat he asked quietly tonight yes i think alicias ready gimpel answered as quietly i told her she could stay up late how has anna done the past year well enough her father said were still here after all esther stutzman put in a slim woman with light brown hair she peered at gimpel through glasses thicker than his own somehow in spite of everything her laugh managed to hold real mirth and if she hadnt done well we assuredly wouldnt be wouldnt be what aunt esther alicia gimpel asked a doll under one arm wouldnt be standing out here in the hall talking if we expected the curlyhaired gestapo to be listening in esther said her grin took all sting from the words imitating her father alicia said oh quatsch anna stutzman tried to sneak up behind her but she whirled before she got tickled both girls squealed they ran off together alicias brown curls bobbing beside annas blond ones they were very much of a height though anna was a year older alicia was tall for her age dinner lise called from the kitchen everyone went into the dining room heinrich gimpel and annas brother gottlieb dropped the leaves on the table to accommodate the unusual crowd walther meanwhile fetched a couple of extra chairs while susanna weiss arranged them around the table they all paused to admire the fragrantly steaming pork roast before gimpel attacked it with fork and carving knife with onions potatoes and boiled parsnips it made a feast to fight the chill outside and leave everyone happily replete most of the talk that punctuated the music of knife and fork was praise for lises cooking smooth wheat beer mixed with raspberry syrup accompanied the meal the two younger gimpel girls who usually were allowed only small glasses got grownupsized mugs they proudly drained them dry and were nodding by the time their mother brought out dessert they munched their way through the little cakes stuffed with prunes or apricots or mildly sweet chocolate but the filling sweets only made them sleepier the food slowed alicia down too but she was buoyed by the prospect of sitting up and talking with the adults seeing her daughters excitement lise gimpel said she doesnt know yet how boring we can be with our chatter of children and taxes and work and whos going to bed with whom who is going to bed with whom esther asked its more interesting than taxes and work thats for certain susanna parodied a hider jugend song in the fields and on the heath we lose strength through joy gottlieb stutzman blushed almost as red as she had before teasing him she said why gottlieb dont you hope to meet a friendly maiden when you go to work your year in the fields it is not practical not for me he answered stiffly rubbing a finger over his peachfuzz mustache it is not practical for any of us as susanna knows walther stutzman gave her a severe look it is also not practical for us to sing that song anywhere but among ourselves if the security police hear it its wiser not to draw the attention of the security police in any case lise gimpel said with her usual solid good sense even children know that she looked at her own two younger children who were valiantly trying not to yawn after i get the table cleared away time for the little ones to go to bed heinrich gimpel nodded to walther and gottlieb stutzman nice to have some other men in the house for a change he said you are outnumbered arent you walther said me i kept the numbers even but then thats what they pay me for he had a moderately important post with the computer design team at zeiss everyone even the men pitched in to help lise cart dirty dishes and leftovers not that there were many of those back to the kitchen the two younger gimpel girls took off their party dresses and put on long cotton nightgowns they collected kisses from the grownups then went off to their bedroom not without a couple of sleepily envious glances at alicia who got to stay up alicia herself looked curious and excited she sat on the edge of the couch her eyes now on her parents now on susanna or esther or walther or gottlieb as lise gimpel had said her eldest daughter didnt know what the grownups talked about after she went to sleep and could hardly wait to learn her gaze swung to her friend anna youve found out what the secret is she said accusingly yes i have anna sounded so serious that heinrich gimpels heart went out to her alicia though put on what he thought of as her angry face anna also saw that quickly she added after tonight youll know too all right alicia said part way mollified then she said why are all of you staring at me like that i dont like it she twisted around to bury her face against a sofa pillow its an important secret dear her mother answered come out please its such an important secret you cant even tell it to your sisters that got through to alicia heinrich saw her eyes go wide he said you cant tell it to anybody at all we waited until you were old enough so we could tell you because we wanted to be sureas sure as we could be he glossed mentallyyou wouldnt give us away by telling someone you shouldnt ive known for a year now anna said to alicia and i didnt even tell you see how important it is hearing the pride in her voice gimpel glanced over to esther and walther they looked proud tooproud and frightened the fear never went away though showing it anywhere in public was also dangerous what is it then alicia said youre right anna i never knew you had a secret and im your best friend she sounded hurt but only a little her time to learn had come she repeated what is it heinrich and lise did not answer not right away now that the moment was here all the gentle introductions they had planned seemed worthless yet coming right out and saying what had to be saidthat gimpel feared was likelier to horrify alicia than to enlighten her while they hesitated susanna weiss did the job with one blunt sentence you are a jew alicia the girl stared then shook her head as if at a joke dont be silly aunt susanna there are no more jews not anywhere theyre kaput finished she spoke with the assurance of one reciting a lesson well learned in school heinrich gimpel shook his head too to contradict her you are a jew alicia your sisters are jews too so is susanna so are esther and walther and gottlieb and anna and so are your mother and i the color slowly drained from alicias cheeks as she realized her father meant what he said butbut she faltered and then rallied but jews were filthy and wicked and diseased and racially impure all the textbook lessons heinrich remembered how he had learned them too perhaps trying to convince herself alicia went on thats why the wise reich got rid of them thats what my teacher says one of the hardest lessons anyone learns is that not everything your teacher tells you is true walther stutzman said for us its doubly hard is anna filthy lise gimpel asked of course not alicia said indignantly she looked to her friend as if wanting anna to tell her this was all just a game but anna looked back with impressively adult solemnity she knew what rode on holding this secret close are your father and i wicked lise persisted is susanna diseased i can get to feel that way the morning after too much scotch susanna said hush susanna lise said butwhat happens if anyone else finds out imim a jew alicia said she pronounced the name with difficulty it was too strong a curse to find in the mouth of a wellbroughtup tenyearold if my friends at school know they wont like me anymore it will be worse than that dear if your friends at school find out heinrich gimpel said if anyone learns youre a jew the einsatzkommandos will come for you and for your sisters and for your mother and me and for the stutzmans and for susanna he made his voice hard and implacable impressing on his daughter that he meant exactly what he said lise tried to soothe alicia no one has to find out my little one no one will unless you give yourself away and us with you we are well hidden these days those few of us who are left even her sunny spirit was not proof against the memory of the millions who had died first in europe and then a generation later in the vernichtungslagers outside new york and los angeles shaking her head she repeated we are well hidden my father helped there walther said he altered the reichs genealogical data base to show us all to be of pure aryan blood no one looks for us any more not here in the heart of the germanic empire no one thinks there is any reason to look we are safe enough unless we give ourselves away one day maybe not in our time but when your sons or grandsons have grown up alicia it may be safe for us to live openly as what we are once more till then we go on alicia tossed her head wildly back and forth her eyes were wide and staring like those of a trapped animal it will never be safe never the reich will last for a thousand years and how can there be room in it for jews maybe the reich will last a thousand years as hitler promised heinrich said no one can know that until it happens if it does but there have been jews alicia for close to three thousand years already even if the germanic empire lives out its whole time it will still be a baby beside us one way or another as uncle walther said we go on its hard to pretend not to be what we really are i hate it susanna weiss broke in we all hate it gimpel continued but when times are dangerous for jews as they are now what other choice do we have this isnt the first time jews have had to be what they are only in secret esther stutzman said in spain a long time ago we pretended to be good catholics now we have to pretend to be good national socialists but underneath we still are what we are i dont want to be a jew alicia shouted so loud that heinrich looked nervously toward the windows if one of the neighbors heard the security police were only a phone call away he took a deep breath you have a way out alicia she stared at him tears and questions in her eyes he said you can just pretend this night never happened you know we will never betray you no matter what you decide if you choose not to tell your husband one day if he is not one of us and if you choose not to tell your children they will never know youand theyare jewish theyll be just like everyone else in the germanic empire but one more piece of something old and precious will have gone out of the world forever i dont know what to do alicia said the most adult sentence that had ever crossed her lips its not so bad alicia anna stutzman said i cried too when i found out so did i gottlieb added which made alicias eyes widen he was so much older than she that she thought of him as practically a grownup anna went on but its special in a way like being part of a club that wont take just anybody and its not like what we are is written on our foreheads or anything like that even though it does feel that way at first but if we keep the secret no one will find out what we are we even have our own special holidaystoday is one whats today alicia asked today is the festival of purim her father answered the germans and the spaniards aunt esther was talking about were not the first people to want to get rid of the jews weve always stood out a little because were different from the other people in a country and a long time ago in the persian empire he got out the bible to help tell alicia the story it had both old and new testaments of course keeping one that didnt would have been suicidally dangerous having a bible at all entailed a certain small risk although the national socialists having won their wars were more inclined to tolerate quiet christianity these days and so heinrich finished king ahasuerus hanged haman on the very gallows he had built for mordecai and mordecai and queen esther lived long happy rich lives afterward alicia caught up in spite of herself by the ancient tale laughed and clapped her hands very softly susanna weiss said i wish someone had built a gallows for hitler and himmler so many of our people gone she stared down into her snifter of scotch sometimes gimpel thought she felt guilty for living on where millions had died i wish i could tell my sisters alicia said walther stutzman grinned at heinrich who smiled back the year before anna had said i wish i could tell alicia gimpel knew more than a little relief that his daughter was beginning to adjust to the new and shocking knowledge he remembered his own confusion when hed learned of his heritage but what alicia had just said was also dangerous he told her you cant tell them yettheyre too little theyll learn when their time comes just as you have now but if the secret reaches the wrong ears were all dead just because there arent many jews left doesnt mean people have stopped hunting us were still fair game are wethe people in this roomare we all the jews who are left alicia asked no her father said there are others all through greater germany and the rest of the empire in time youll meet more and some may startle you but for now the fewer jews you know the fewer you can give away ifif the worst happens alicias eyes went far away gimpel knew what she was doing thinking about family friends and wondering which were of her own sort hed done the same thing himself finding out about walther stutzman had been his biggest surprise the stutzmans looked like perfect aryans and a generation before much more had been made of jews allegedly grotesque features lise said even though we have our own holidays alicia we can only celebrate them among ourselves the little threecornered cakes we had tonight are special for purimtheyre call hamantaschen hamans hats i like that alicia said serves him right yes lise said but thats why you wont be carrying any of them to school for lunch people who arent jewish might recognize them for what they are we cant afford to take any chances at all do you see not even with anything as little as cakes alicia exclaimed not even lise said not with anything not ever all right mama the warning about hamantaschen seemed to have impressed alicia about the depth of the precautions shed have to take to survive gimpel was glad something had his own father had shown him photographs smuggled out of the ostlands to warn him how necessary silence was he still had nightmares about those pictures after more than thirty years but he still had the photos too hidden in a file cabinet if he thought he had to heti show them to alicia he hoped the need would not arise for her sake and his own is it all right alicia he asked her i know this is a lot to put on a little girl but we have to you see or there wont be any jews at all anymore its all right father it really is she answered itsurprised me i dont really know if i like it yet but its all right she nodded in a slow hesitant way that said she thought she meant it but wasnt quite sure that sufficed for heinrich gimpel finding out you were a jew in the heart of the national socialist germanic empire was not something anyone child or adult could fully take in at a moments notice a beginning of acceptance was as much as he could hope for alicia had given him that his daughter and anna stutzman yawned together then giggled at each other susanna weiss got up grabbed her handbag walked over to alicia and kissed her on the cheek welcome to your bigger family dear were glad to have you she turned to heinrich id better get home i have an early class tomorrow morning we ought to go too esther stutzman said either that or well wait till anna falls asleepwhich shouldnt be more than about another thirty secondsand bundle her into the broom closet her daughter let out an indignant sniff lise and heinrich passed out coats the friends stood gossiping on the front porch for a last couple of minutes as they chattered a brightly lit police van rolled by alicia gasped in horror and tried to bolt inside her father held her arm until the van turned a comer and disappeared everythings fine little one he said they know of us only if we give ourselves away do you understand ithink so father good the stutzmans and susanna walked off toward the bus stop the gimpels went back inside lise went with alicia to get her ready for bed heinrich rinsed off the dishes and started loading them into the washer he was still busy when alicia came out for a good night kiss usually that was just part of the nighttime routine tonight it felt special he said you dont have to be frightened every second darling if you show youre afraid people will start to wonder what you have to be afraid of keep on being your own sweet self and no one will ever suspect a thing ill try papa when she hugged him she clung for a few extra seconds he squeezed her then ran his hand through her hair good night she said and hurried away lise walked into the kitchen a couple of minutes later she dragged in a chair from the dining room sat down and waited till the sink was empty and the washer full then as the machine started to chum she got up and gave him a long slow hug and so the tale gets told once more she said as he had with his daughter heinrich held on to his wife and so we try to go on for another generation he said weve outlasted so much god willing well outlast the nazis too and of course now that the tale is told the risk well get caught also goes up lise said you did well there keeping her from running from the police van couldnt have that gimpel agreed but shell be nervous for a while now and shes so young he shook his head strange how our greatest danger lies in making sure our kind goes on no one would ever suspect you or me why else buy pork i know gimpel took off his glasses wiped his forehead with his sleeve set the spectacles back on his nose why else do all the other things we do to seem like perfect germans i can quote mein kampf more easily than scripture but its not so easy for a child and we have two more yet to go he let out a long worn sigh hugged lise again im so tired i know she said its easier for me staying home with the kinder like a proper hausfrau but you have to wear the mask every day at your office its either pretend to others im not a jew or pack it in and pretend the same thing to myself im not ready for that i remember too well he thought again of the hidden yellowing photographs from the east we will go on in spite of everything lise yawned right now i think im going on to bed im right behind you ohspeaking of the office on the way home today willi said he admired how content i was here and now good lise said at once if you must wear the mask wear it well i suppose so he also asked if we were busy tonight i told him yes since we were but well be going over there one evening soon ill arrange for my sister to stay with the girls lise said lets give alicia a little more time to get used to things before we take her out sensible you generally are though ha lise said darkly id better be so bad you i know he chuckled besides well be able to play more bridge thats true lise also laughed both of them were long used to the strangeness of having good friends who if they knew the truth might well want to send them to an extermination camp heinrich was looking forward to getting together with willi and erika dorsch for an evening of talk and bridge within the limits of his upbringing willi was a good fellow gimpel pondered the limits of his own upbringing which were a good deal narrower than willi dorschs in one way telling alicia of her heritage was transcending those limits in another it was forcing them on her as well in still anotherhe gave up the regress before he got lost in it didnt you say something about bed youre the one whos been standing here talking lise said lets go the r strain although im jewish im not particularly observant i eat pork for instance one morning after a breakfast of bacon and eggs i thought thats so good i wish it were kosher the r strain followed shortly thereafter curiously after stan schmidt bought it but before it saw print there was a story in science news about the babirusa a southeast asian pig that actually does more or less chew its cud one of the scientists who was working on the babirusa saw the story in analog and thought her work had given me the idea it didnt but who knows it might have even in los angeles it is out of the ordinary for the star of a press conference to be a small pink pig peter delahanty had been anxious about how lionel would react to the sv lights but the shoat was doing just what hed hoped ignoring them he was happily feeding his face from a plastic washtub full of potatoes and carrots delahanty beamed at him like a proud father which as he headed genetic enterprises in a way he was still cameras flashed and stereovision cameras whirred but there were after all only so many pictures to be taken of a pig after a while delahanty took the tub away from lionel and put it on a table by the lectern following it with his eyes lionel let out a grunt of piggy indignation sorry pal delahanty told him maybe later as if he understood lionel settled backhe really was a goodnatured beast his throat and jaws began to work more flashes went off thats what you came to see ladies and gentlemen delahanty said lionels one of genetic enterprises new r strain of pigsr for ruminant of course in other words unlike ordinary unimproved swine he chews his cud just why is that an improvement asked a lady reporter in the second row it makes him and his brothers and sisters more efficient food processors ruminant animalscattle sheep goats deer antelope are some of the ones occurring in naturepartially digest food then store and regurgitate it for rechewing and more complete digestion they get more out of a given amount of food than nonruminants lionel will gain weight on less feed or lowerquality feed than an unimproved pig which means lower cost to the farmer someone asked exactly but of course buying your r strain is going to be more expensive for the farmer whats the net savings delahanty turned to a chart behind himhere you have costs for the r strain compared to those for ordinary swine as you can see the breakeven point is at three and a half months if the farmer buys piglets its even sooner if he chooses to have fertilized ova implanted in his own sows and the extra expense is all in the first generation the r strain breeds true will they interbreed with unmodified pigs a man with a gray mustache wondered no delahanty said there may be matings but no offspring from them the genetic changes are too great for interfertility another woman had a question how hardy are your new pigs can they survive the poor treatment they may get say in a third world country at least as well as any other pigs delahanty said firmly probably better since theyll thrive on less food one of the reasons genetic enterprises developed the r strain was to provide more protein for overpopulated developing nations he fielded more queries about costs and several on the genetic engineering techniques that had gone into lionel and his ilk after half an hour or so the reporters ingenuity flagged finally though someone asked the question delahanty had been hoping for what do these beasts of yours taste like he smiled ill let you all be the judges of that the chops and hams on the buffet to my left here come from the r strain if there arent any more questions the surge forward was so sudden and urgent that lionel snorted in alarm but somebody was still waving a handnot a reporter but a cameraman a fellow with curly brown hair and a big nose yes you want to ask me something delahanty called yeah if i could the man said my names stan jacoby heres what i want to know delahanty had been ready for every question the reporters and a good many they hadnt now though he felt his jaw drop mr jacoby he said in the most spontaneous answer of the press conference ill be goddamned if i know the phone rang three times before ruth picked it up its for you dear she shouted rabbi aaron kaplan muttered something unrabbinic that his wet beard mercifully swallowed unless its an emergency get a number and say ill call back he called over the hiss of the shower he expected to be dragged out drippingwhen did anyone calling a rabbi not think it was an emergencybut he got to finish bathing in peace somewhat mollified he surveyed himself in the steamy bathroom mirror as he dried off there were gray threads in the beard and a bald spot at his crown but his stocky frame had not changed too badly since his days as a high school linebacker twentyfive years before ruth came in with a scrap of paper he smiled at her thinking how lucky he was if she had not been a rabbis daughter she would have been a rebbitzin decorative enough to make half his congregation nervous at the moment she was giggling whats so funny he asked she gave him the paper he recognized peter delahantys name they had worked together on a couple of fundraising committees underneath were a phone number and a onesentence message wants to know if pigs can be kosher he laughed a practical joke i dont think so he seemed very sincere well all right ill call him hes got chutzpah if nothing else kaplan went into the bedroom put on a tshirt and pair of shorts not for the first time he was glad he hadnt added video to his phone system he punched the number genetic enterprises dr delahantys office a woman said he asked to speak to dr delahanty may i ask whos calling the secretary said when he gave his name she answered one moment ill connect you oh rabbi kaplan thanks for returning my call delahanty sounded young and earnest if he was a practical joker he was firstrate kaplan said my wife tells me you were inquiring about the possibility of uh pork being acceptable under jewish dietary law yes thats right you see kaplan cut him off im afraid its out of the question leviticus and are the relevant passages here let me give you the exact wording he reached for the bible on the nightstand whatsoever parteth the hoof and is clovenfooted and cheweth the cud among the beasts that shall ye eat and again and the swine because he parteth the hoof and is clovenfooted but cheweth not the cud be is unclean to you the fourteenth chapter of deuteronomy repeats the same prohibitions so i really dont see how it was delahantys turn to interrupt forgive me rabbi kaplan but i do know that under normal circumstances jews are not supposed to eat pork let me tell you about lionel though lionel kaplan echoed confused yes this would have been easier if youd caught the news last night lionel is a pig who chews his cud are you there rabbi kaplan im here kaplan said after a long pause i think youd better tell me more he felt a headache coming on the easiest thing to do would have been to say that pigs is pigs whether they chew their cuds or not that would have been that ruth said when he finally got off the phone with delahanty and still wearing a bemused look explained the dilemma to her simplest yes but would it have been right kaplan said shaking his head it goes against everything ive been brought up with to say kosher and pig in the same sentence but if a pig has a cloven hoof and chews its cud doesnt it meet the criteria the bible sets for permitted beasts it meets the criteria for trouble his wife said practically if you start saying pork is kosher youd best thank god theres no jewish inquisition because if there were it would burn you at the stake at the chop actually said kaplan who had a weakness for bad puns ruth did not groan as he had hoped she would she set her hands on her hips saying im serious aaron do you want to make yourself a laughingstock for the congregation to say nothing of other rabbis of course not just the same he winced as he imagined the headlines only in los angeles rabbi kaplans favorite ham recipes a caption under a picture of a pig funny he doesnt look jewish oh he was opening a can of worms and no mistake but it was such a pretty problem kaplan had been a rabbi going on twenty years now a teacher a counselor a preacher a social worker sometimes even a scholar not since his student days though had he had a chance to be a theologian his wife recognized his faraway stare and it alarmed her she chose a question close to the issue at hand aaron have you ever tasted pork as she had intended that snapped him out of his reverie he looked at her in surprise he was conservative not orthodox he did not pretend to observe all the minutiae of dietary law pork however was something else it was like asking if he had ever been unfaithfulexactly like that he thought uncomfortably once he admitted i was eighteen in my senior year in high school and out to do anything my father didnt want me to do and so one morning i stopped for breakfast with some friends and i ordered bacon and eggs was it good you know i really dont remember he supposed that was like a lot of infidelity toohe had been too nervous to enjoy it whats all this about if you decide this meat could somehow be kosher i was just wondering how you were going to react when people said you did it because you liked pork yourself and wanted an excuse to eat it thats ridi he began and then stopped it was not ridiculous even in the twentyfirst century it might very well be one of the kinder things orthodox rabbis would say they would he thought with a curiously mixed metaphor crucify him if he had anything at all good to say about pigs the only thing they could not do was excommunicate him judaism didnt work that way it was something of a relief but not much ruth was still watching him youre going ahead with this you know me too well he sighed im going to investigate it anyhow i wish you wouldnt i sort of have to he said but he was talking to her back sighing again he went into his study his books would not argue with him he went first as would anyone unraveling a problem of jewish law to the shulkhan arukh the ready table of joseph karo published in it was still basic almost five centuries later and its commentators reached to modem times chapter sounded promising laws concerning forbidden food he turned to it in some hope it had nothing to do with pork but dealt with meat and milk dishes with eating food prepared by gentiles or from utensils used by gentiles with wormy fruit vegetables and fish karo reasonably enough had never entertained the prospect of a pig that chewed its cud nor had the rabbis who came after him kaplan did find a reference to swine in chapter laws regarding the cleanliness of the place for holy purposes there karo remarked the mouth of a swine is considered like a chamber pot for the reason that it pecks at excrement the rabbi frowned in modem times pigs were no more filthy than any other domestic animals perplexed he got down the guide for the perplexed maimonides great twelfthcentury effort to reconcile religion and science he found the reference to pork in chapter of part iii i maintain that the food which is forbidden by the law is unwholesome there is nothing among the forbidden kinds of food whose injurious character is doubted except pork and fat but also in these cases the doubt is not justified for pork contains more moisture than necessary and too much of superfluous matter the principal reason why the law forbids swines flesh is to be found in the circumstance that its habits and its food are very dirty and loathsome it has already been pointed out how emphatically the law enjoins the removal of the sight of loathsome objects even in the field and in the camp how much more objectionable is such sight in towns but if it were allowed to eat swines flesh the streets and houses would be more dirty than any cesspool as may be seen at present in the country of the franks the saying of our sages is well known the mouth of a swine is as dirty as dung itself again the medical argument that swines flesh was inherently dirty a physician himself maimonides would naturally reason thus and again it did not necessarily apply now or indeed even in maimonides day chickens hardly had cleanlier habits than pigs the quotation from the talmud was in the same vein if of even weightier authority than maimonides who else had spoken of the pig he thought of one source and pulled a wellthumbed book from a shelf apart from the religious tomes as usual ambrose bierce had a word for it hog n a bird remarkable for the catholicity of its appetite and serving to illustrate that of ours among the mahometans and jews the hog is not in favor as an article of diet but is respected for the delicacy of its habits the beauty of its plumage and the melody of its voice smiling he put the devils dictionary away bierces mordant wit helped put things in perspective he was certain his predicament would have amused the old cynic immensely and perhaps inspired a fresh verse or two from that worthy bard father gassalasca jape sj at that the mythical father jape might have sympathized with kaplan in bierces time catholics refrained from eating meat on fridays somehow the catholic church had survived when the prohibition was lifted but the ban against pork was centuries older than christianity itself and judaism unlike christianity these last seventeen centuries was mostly a minority religion all too often a persecuted one jewish dietary laws expressed and emphasized the separateness of the jews of the diaspora from the peoples among whom they lived because they helped jews maintain their cohesion they became emotionally ingrained in believers that was why even the thought of modifying them brought such a wrench with it and yet he thought judaism always retained a certain flexibility other faiths lacked in the middle ages jewish thought never accepted aristotelian science as part and parcel of the tenets of the faith as the church hadand therefore never had to go through a painful repudiation when renaissance scientists showed that aristotle did not after all know everything adaptation to a changing world had been going on ever since among the observant in both israel and the united states a common item was a switch that could be set in advance to turn electrical appliances on and off on the sabbath when kindling a light was forbidden sothere was the question was eating one of delahantys r strain an accommodation to be gratefully accepted or was it abomination whichever way he decided he was going to be in trouble he wondered if he ought to call another rabbi someone older and maybe wiser he thought it over decided not to it felt too much like passing the buck the problem had been dumped in his lap and he had to deal with it now the time for others to judge would be later ruth knew better than to disturb him in his study but she pounced when he emerged well he spread his hands i dont have any answer yet im afraid wonderful he did his best not to notice the sarcasm the trouble is the authorities so automatically think of pigs and pork as being beyond the pale that they dont even discuss conditions under which it might be permissible shouldnt that tell you something ruth asked pointedly the rabbis of the talmud didnt have modem technology to complicate their lives all they had to worry about was famine insurrection and roman legionsthey didnt know when they were well off now what i think ill call delahanty back maybe he can tell me something that would make this all make sense i can tell you something that would make this all make sense forget ft but kaplan was already hitting the phone buttons the chief of genetic enterprises came on the line at once he seemed so bright and eager kaplan thought and almost as intrigued as the rabbi over mutual problem it had to be honest intellectual curiosity even if every jew in the country started eating the new product it wouldnt bump consumption up more than a couple of percent damn too bad delahanty said when kaplan told him of the unpromising turn of the research without being asked he went on how about this then suppose i shoot you all the information about the r strain that might help so it might kaplan paused and continued i want you to understand dr delahanty no matter how intriguing the possibilities are here theres no guarantee i can find these beasts of yours acceptable well of course delahanty sounded surprised you have to do what you think is right rabbi im just glad you didnt laugh at me and hang up youre lucky you didnt talk with my wife delahanty laughed am i do you have your floppy ready just a second the rabbi loaded a disk into the base of the phone unit all right go ahead there was a faint whir from the drive as the floppy recorded the data delahanty was sending when it was done kaplan said thanks ill get back to you i ought to be thanking you nonsense i havent had this much fun in a long time after they said their goodbyes kaplan took the floppy over to the computer and played it back most of it he discovered consisted of genetic enterprises advertising videos if half of what they said about the r strain was true as soon as the first little porker turned thirtyfive it was going to get elected president rhapsodies over how nutritious the meat was however did not matter to kaplan ordinary pork was perfectly edible the problem lay elsewhere the rabbi learned that the r strains digestive tract was modeled after that of cows sheep and goats but was not created from their genetic material from the tone of the video he gathered others had tried that approach and failed he was glad genetic enterprises had done something new it was a minor point in favor of the r strain leviticus said thou shaft not let the cattle gender with a diverse kind in the shulkhan arukh karo extended that to working with a team of different animals such as a horse and an ox and said that two mules working together should be examined to ensure that both were the get either of a stallion and jenny or of a jack and mare otherwise they were animals of diverse kind some authorities in fact noted karo reckoned one mule an animal of diverse kind and forbade its use if the r strain had some of the genes say of a sheep that argument could have been raised against it kaplan waded through a series of charts and graphs extolling the r strains ability to put on flesh quickly again that was beside the point moreover while it was important to farmers the rabbi found it mindnumbing after a while he hit the fastforward button he jabbed the stop control there stood peter delahanty he hadnt changed in the year or so since kaplan had seen him last he was fair just past thirty goodlooking in an abstracted way and very sincere this had to be the press conference he had mentioned maybe kaplan thought hopefully it would give a tidy summary of all the data with which he had been bombarded lionel was certainly cuter than a pie chart the questions delahanty had gotten were interesting and his answers did help clarify matters but only from a dollarsandcents standpoint kaplan listened for fifteen minutes or so he was about to give up and turn off the disk when a reporter with a bushy gray mustache stood up and asked will they interbreed with unmodified pigs when delahanty said no kaplan felt like archimedes in his bath for that matter a naked dripping man running through the streets shouting eureka would attract no more attention in los angeles than back in ancient syracuse unless the police decided he was on angel dust and shot him he called genetic enterprises again by now he did not have to look up the number i have the determination he said when delahanty came on the line and in my opinion jews may eat animals of the r strain as they may any other beasts that have divided hooves and chew a cud do you really think so do you mind if i ask you why you say so i was hoping you would kaplan said truthfully he had enough ego to want his reasoning appreciated the key is that properly speaking these r strain beasts are not pigs at all no what would you call em then they look like pigs they oink like pigs they taste like pigsthough i dont suppose youd know about that you told me you werent going to find the r strain kosher just to be doing it it seems to me thats what youve done i dont want that rabbi kaplan kaplan almost burst out laughing of all the ridiculous situations in the world for him to be explaining to an irishman why a pig wasnt a pig had to fall into the top ten he said i was going to say no until i heard you tell the press that the r strain and ordinary swine werent fertile with each other no theyre not delahanty agreed he sounded doubtful then suddenly excitedoh i follow you i think one scientific justification for calling two populations distinct species is that they cant breed together is that it wouldnt it just make the r strain a different kind of pig though admiring his quick wits kaplan quoted leviticus thou shalt not let thy cattle gender with a diverse kind the clear implication there of course is with a diverse kind of cattle but the r strain cant gender at all with pigs and if they cant gender with pigs how can they be pigs no matter what they took like after a minute delahanty said youd make a good jesuit rabbi kaplan grunted being a good jew struck him as quite hard enough without the added burden of lifelong chastity despite all his other strictures karo did not enjoin anything of that sort in chapter he recommended cohabitation nightly for married men of strong constitution twice a week for laborers working in the town where they lived and once a week for those working in a different town his injunctions included scholars although rabbi eleazar said that he used to have cohabitation with such awe and fear that it appeared to him as if a demon was forcing him to do it while he was musing on karos prescriptions delahanty said something he missed im sorry he said embarrassed i asked how serious you were about all this giving an opinion is easy but do you mean it of course i do kaplan said indignantly then delahanty hesitated went on look if you think im out of line tell me and ill shut up and i certainly wont think any less of you but i would like to ask having said what youve said would you eat meat from the r strain yourself he should have guessed the question was coming but it took him by surprise just the same suddenly and bitterly he understood how ruth felt intellectually he had convinced himself that the r strain was acceptable emotionally lionel pink and plump and curlytailed was a pig no two ways about it rabbi delahanty said when he did not reply at once having given the response he had kaplan saw he had no choice now i would eat it he said i will eat it by your phone code genetic enterprises is in westwood or somewhere close by give me your address i can be there in a half hour i dont care to make commercials for you though if you dont mind i put you on the spot delahanty said i apologize that was nasty of me dont let me make you do anything you wouldnt want to youre not tell me that address now please are you sure im sure kaplan said firmly he wrote down the street number delahanty gave him exchanged another minute or so of small talk and hung up he threw on a battered corduroy jacket and was on his way down the hall when ruth called where are you going from the den sheepishly under the circumstances he thought that was not quite the right word he explained he stayed right where he was at that moment he didnt feel much like facing her you told him his pigs were kosher she said in a voice so flat he could make nothing of it yes and this is what it got me he heard her get up what are you doing he asked in some alarm getting a hat what for so i can come with you of course he was still gaping when he stepped into the hall he finally found his tonguewhat are you coming with me for you were the one who told me to say the r strain was trafe and have done with it you cant want to go eat pork with me but its not pork or thats what you told delahanty but to you it is whos the rabbi in this house she said and laughed at his thunderstruck expressionbesides she added softly itll be easier if youre not alone thank you he said that wasnt nearly strong enough he went over and hugged her have i told you any time lately i think youre wonderful yes but i never mind hearing it again come on lets get this over with traffic on the santa monica freeway never moved fast old gasolinefueled cars alcoholburners and electrics crawled along together kaplan had just about decided to make his next car somewhere in the indefinite future an electric with more and more fusion plants coming on line they were definitely the coming thing smog was down too not out but down they drove past billboards in spanish english korean japanese and hindi every decade it seemed some new group of immigrants settled in southern california in droves kaplans neighborhood supermarket stocked nine different chutneys and seventeen curries with their superior climate westwood and santa monica had long dominated the la area leaving the old downtown to stagnation again after its rebirth in the s skyscrapers flung long afternoon shadows across the san diego freeway as kaplan and his wife swung norm the parking garage in the building that housed the headquarters of genetic enterprises went down eleven levels underground the elevators surge was like a rocket lifting off but it was not the only reason the rabbis stomach had for lurching genetic enterprises kept its labs elsewhere in the city where rents were lower this was where the executives worked when kaplan opened the door to the receptionists office a delicious smell rolled over him like a wave it was not really unfamiliar one could not live in los angeles without coming across it now and then but it had never had anything to do with him before delahanty came out almost at once to shake his hand good to see you again he said politely adding a pleasure to meet you when kaplan introduced him to ruth shall we get on with it she said harshly of course delahanty said thank you for coming both of you i understand how difficult this must be for you you dont begin to kaplan thought but he and his wife followed delahanty back into his office on the desk lay a meatfilled platter bladecut poruh chops delahanty said here let me heat them up for you he popped them into a microwave oven which obviously had been brought in for the occasion as the microwave hummed kaplan sighed inaudibly to himself perhaps even without meaning to delahanty had eliminated a possible lastditch excuse to chicken outanother inappropriate phrase the rabbi thought ruefully he might have begged off by saying that the beast now reheating had not been slaughtered by a shokhetany ritual butcher would have laughed himself silly at the notion of practicing his skill on a pig but kaplan did not insist that his beef and mutton come from the shokhets knife he bought them at the supermarket and so he could not honestly apply a standard to the r strain different from the one by which he judged other acceptable meat but he did avoid cuts from the hindquarters of the carcass the section of meat through which the sciatic nerve passed was not kosher in memory of the laming blow the angel of the lord had inflicted on jacob when they wrestled through the night bladecut chops though came from far forward on the beast the reverie was done long before the microwave turned itself off when it chimed delahanty took out the platter and produced some plastic cutlery from a desk drawer would you like me to step out for a few minutes he asked no thats all right kaplan began but ruth broke in yes please of course delahanty said quietly and shut the door behind him as he left the fantasy that flitted through kaplans mind this time was frankly paranoid he wondered if this was all an elaborate practical joke to get him to eat forbidden food he and ruth looked at the gently steaming chops and at each other gathering his pride the rabbi said me first and picked up knife and fork the meat was tougher grainier than veal which to his eye it most closely resembled he speared it with his fork and brought it toward his mouth chapter of the shidkhan arukh dealt with laws concerning one dangerously ill and one forced to transgress a precept karo wrote if one who is dangerously ill requires meat and only forbidden meat is obtainable an animal should be slaughtered for his sake in order not to feed him with forbidden meat as it is apprehended lest he will become aware of having been fed on forbidden meat and he will become nauseated thereby kaplan had come across that passage before now he had no doubt it described something real when a couple of hours of theoretical knowledge came up against forty years of ingrained practice distress was inevitable he clamped his jaw shut to hold down his gorge then realized he could not eat that way he took a deep breath chewed swallowed then set his jaw again well ruth demanded how is it he laughed shakily you know its just like the time i ate bacon and eggs when i was a kid i have no idea what it tasted like well lets find out shall we ruth cut a large piece and chewed with deliberation not bad she said reflectively nothing to write home about but not bad the second bite kaplan found came much easier than the first this time he too was able to consider the flavor of the of the r strain he told himself firmly different he agreed they ate a chop apiece not with any great speed or relish but steadily looking at the meat still on the platter kaplan asked still hungry not especially neither am i even honestly believing that was acceptable food it was harder than i ever thought it would be ruth nodded you did very well thanks so did you and thanks for that too he hugged her again shall we give delahanty his office back and show him the dreadful deed is done just a second she took a tissue from her pocket and brushed at his beard now okay not surprisingly the head of genetic enterprises had been hovering just outside in the hallway he hurried in saw the bones on the platter rabbi mrs kaplan thank you very much he said shaking hands with them both its all right kaplan said youve given me one of the more ah interesting afternoons of my life that i can tell you i really didnt mean to pressure you delahanty said but like any scientist he was curious by nature and could not help asking how did you like it we got through it kaplan said later driving home he wondered if he had been short with the man then he thought of twentyfive hundred years of history of conquest and captivity under babylon persecution by the greeks savage and futile war against rome european ghettos and christian mobs dreyfus the holocaust still too appalling for any sane mind to take in round after round of war in the middle east and no end in sight no end to jews in sight either though without much thought he had managed to sum up the history of a people in four words that wasnt bad he changed lanes lure this one is in large measure my wife lauras fault she gave me the ending of course im partly to blame too because im the one who went and wrote a story around it miocene italy to be precise a swamp in miocene italy in what would be tuscany ten million years from now give or take a few thousand it certainly smelled like a swamp harvey cutter thought as he squelched through the mud to check his latest trap the smells of mud stale water and rotting vegetation never changed much the hunter thought as he scraped his hip boots one after the other on a branch or was that never would change despite a hundred years of commercial time travel english tenses remained illadapted to the phenomenon the branch on which hed cleaned his boots was part of a myrtle shrub maybe an uptime botanist could tell the difference between it and its modem equivalent but cutter couldnt the mosquitoes he thought resentfully as one bit him on the arm also hadnt changed much but he wasnt hunting plants and he wasnt hunting mosquitoes even if they were hunting him he was hunting primates for the san diego cenozoic zoo and he wasnt having a whole lot of luck things had been easier on his last run when hed brought back a dozen notharctusplenty to start a breeding colony from eocene north america notharctus looked like a lemur and wasnt much smarter than a squirrel he could have caught a hundred if hed wanted them now he was after largerand smartergame hominoids even offbeat miocene hominoids like the ones he was after now were nobodys fools that wasnt surprising people and the great apes were the survivors of the hominoid clan something squealed in pain and terror out on the firmer ground farther east cutters head whipped around a diceratherium was down and kicking with several wolfish cynodesmus scrambling over its bulky body and already beginning to feed cutter was glad cynodesmus preferred dry ground they would have attacked him just as cheerfully as they had the big rhinolike diceratherium they had no fear of man in the miocene primatesany primateswere prey not predators calling cynodesmus wolfish and diceratherium rhinolike did not really do the beasts justice cutter knew unlike the plants and the bugs miocene mammals resembled their modem equivalents about as much as would clay models made by a talented tenyearold with a little more imagination than he really needed as if to prove the point a small herd of syndyoceras daintily picked their way around the gorging pack of cynodesmus they looked something like deer and something like antelopes with their striped hides resembling those of zebras but they had two horns above their eyes and two more halfway down their noses which made them different from anything that had gotten past the pleistocene cutter squelched on he could see the stand of willow where hed set this new trap he could see the net too undeployed and empty he said something rude under his breath he got up to the trap and saw footprints by the fat juicy red apple hed set out as bait they were the right kind of footprints he said something rude out loud loud enough in fact to scare a flock of miocene moreorless sparrows off their perches they flew away chirping angrily hell with it he said out loud he looked around for a reasonably dry patch of ground took out a ration pack and ate lunch he scattered paper and cellophane over the landscape with reckless abandon all the wrappers were aggressively biodegradable none of them would show up in the seam of lignite that would memorialize this landscape in the distant present temper somewhat restored he examined the footprints round the snare again they were the prints of his quarry all right marks about half as big as his own bare feet would have made and of the same general shape the imprints of the beasts opposable great toes though were slightly set off from those of the others and not quite in line with them only men and their immediate ancestors had feet fully adapted to walking erect the hunter started off toward the next stand of willows a couple of miles away that one was bigger than this little outpost and held his camp and three traps none of them had caught anything either though one had been robbed the day before yesterday several sluggish streams ran between the two copses cutter forded them with care the other day he had watched a crocodile drag a young ancestral hippo off a stream bank and into the water he corrected himself the little hippo hadnt lived long enough to be ancestral to anything he got to the base camp without being bitten by anything more ferocious than more mosquitoes then he checked his traps in this strap of trees they were all unsprung though two of them had fresh prints nearby no wonder the italian hominoid had a reputation for being hard to catch cutter thought he found droppings under a big shaggy willow and set another trap there when he suddenly looked up in the middle of the job he saw brown eyes watching him through the leaves a moment later they were gone he walked back to his camp that was really too dignified a name for it he thought it was just a clearing where hed pitched a light tent to keep the rain off his sleeping bag the sun was still in the sky but he decided to eat anyway he got out another radon pack but for the degradable packaging he knew the packs were adapted from old military food prations trations something like that he didnt remember the letter if theyd made soldiers eat stuff like this all the time he thought disparagingly no wonder nobodyd fought a war in a long time he threw away the cup of what for a lack of a suitably noxious word was called stew what dessert comes with this pack he wondered feeling rather like little jack horner instead of a plum however he pulled out a cellophane package with four cookies in it sighing resignedly he started to eat one then stopped and gave it a long lookbe damned he said and started to laugh he glanced back toward where his traps were set then looked at the cookie again why the hell not how could it make things go worse harvey cutters nostrils twitched as he walked toward the new exhibit be damned he said it even stinks like miocene mud good job lucy durr beamed at him she was second assistant curator in the primates section of the zoo and had designed the enclosure glad you approve she said the photos you gave us helped a lot in putting it together good i hoped they would lucy put her hands on the rail and leaned on it as she peered across the moat at the pair of brownfurred creatures on the far side theyre interesting beasts miocene hominoids that arent part of the dryopithecid group that led to the great apes or the ramapithecids humans are descended from theyre justby themselves im glad we have them hardly any zoos do i believe that theyre bloody hell to catch from the fossils theyre supposed to have been common around there you couldnt prove it by me i saw one in a tree for half a second and i finally managed to catch these two other than that forget it cutter reached into his pocket pulled out some creamfilled chocolate sandwich cookies and threw them across the moat to the animals hed captured the beasts were nimble enough on the ground on all fours they hurried over to the cookies they grabbed them with hands not much different from cutters and greedily gobbled them up lucy clucked the horrified cluck of any zookeeper who catches a visitor feeding the animals then she glanced over at the hunter how do they know those are good to eat they havent had any here i know that and they certainly never had any back in the miocene oh but they did cutter said now lucy was frankly staring at him he went on i wasnt having any luck with fruit for bait and so you tried something else sure but why cookies he grinned at her well what would you use if you were going after oreopimecus secret names i havent the slightest idea whether this story is fantasy or science fiction i think it might have fit well in the old unknown which often walked the fine pixilated line between the two genres madyu was boiling up a batch of willowbark tea when jorj the tribes chief hunter poked his head into the shamans tent what do you want madyu asked crossly not caring to be interrupted in the middle of his spells he was convinced they added to the painrelieving value of the tea we will be setting out shortly wizardry sir jorj answered he was a big broadshouldered man of about forty with strong features and a brown beard just beginning to go gray his skill with a bow had made him rich he wore a silver quarter from the old time in each ear and owned a necklace strung with many more he did not have it on now for fear of a mistimed jingle spooking the prey he went on some magic to bring the beasts to us would be welcome oh the spells on the willowbark tea would have to wait it was no cure for the ache of an empty belly madyu said ill set to work at once jorj rainbowstar the shaman kept his voice low but jorjs head whipped around in alarm all the same no one in the tribe save madyu and perhaps a favorite woman had any business knowing the hunters secret name should an enemy somehow come into possession of it he might use it to wreak all sorts of baneful sorcery jorj said i hope the gods are more in the mood to listen to you than they were last moonquarter we came back almost emptyhanded madyu knew the chief hunter was obliquely criticizing him for having used his secret name he dipped his head to acknowledge the rebuke i shall do my best i promise you magic is chancy and imperfect as you no doubt know oh aye if it werent wed all be fatter than we are and thats a fact jorj laughed a big booming manly laugh that finished the job of putting the shaman in his place madyu who was scrawny clumsy and nearsighted to boot felt his ears turn hot laughing still jorj left the tent and started shouting to the rest of the hunting band with a last mournful look at the bronze tea kettle madyu decked himself in the raiment required for hunting magic he too had a coin necklace his unlike jorjs was made of quarters silvery on the outside but with a copper center most shamans preferred those to silver for one thing they had to have been made by sorcery no modern smith could turn out anything like them for another the numbers they bore were consistently bigger than those on silver coins each shaman had his own explanation for why that was so but all agreed it had to have some sort of magical import madyu bowed to north and south east and west he patted the ground to show his reverence for the earth powers waved his hands through the air to draw the attention of the sky gods then he began the first prayer of the ritual the one to make keen the noses of the hunting hounds he was a conscientious craftsman and did his best to ensure the hounds success not only did he call the beasts dawgs after the fashion of his own tribe and those closest to it he also named them sheeyas as did the kayjun clans to the east and perros as did the makykanoes to the west and south he did not know or presume to guess which language the gods spoke but preferred to cover as many bets as he could he went on to bless the hunters boots to ensure that they slipped through plain and woods without making a sound he also blessed their bows and arrows to make the shafts fly straight and true again he used all three local languages and a couple more besides when tribes met to swap pots and horses and women and metal shamans generally went off by themselves and traded names things were after all merely things and manifested themselves only in this world but their names now their names held power for names echoed through the spirit world as well at any rate true names secret names created those echoes madyu remembered the war hed headed off by ascertaining the secret name of a rival tribes chieftain and threatening to do dreadful things to the mans ghost unless he called off his warriors while never easy that sort of coup was at least possible with human beings who acquired their secret names from one another but who could be sure what the secret name of a dog was or a willow or a shoe that was why shamans swapped names back and forth in the hope of hitting the one true one among the many having done his utmost with the hunters animals and gear madyu cast the best spells he knew on the beasts they hunted as he incanted he thought that any visiting shaman would have admired his technique he had the cup made from the tip of a wild bulls horn the turkey feather the whitehaired deer tail the rabbits foot and the squirrel skin all ready where he could reach them without interrupting his ritual he summoned the prey by every name he knew no matter how exotic as he did whenever he said the word he wondered what tribe called a simple ordinary squirrel a bepka he was hot and tired and covered with sweat by the time he finished the hunting magic heat and sweat had to be lived with in eestexas legend said that in the old time people could make the air around themselves cool whenever they wanted madyu a thoroughgoing realist did not believe the legend for a minute if people had ever enjoyed such a useful skill they wouldnt have been stupid enough to lose it when he went outside he squinted against the glare the sun beat down with almost physical force the tribal encampment was nearly deserted with most of the men at the hunt and the women out in the fields children ran between tents raising hell one of them stopped to grin at madyu look look look he squealed pointing proudly his grin had a gap in it i see hozay madyu answered gravely what did the tooth fairy leave you as he spoke his hand twisted in the gesture that kept the fairy from stealing teeth that werent ready to leave their owners head hozay reached into his belt pouch and took out two good iron arrowheads look look look he said again very nice indeed madyu fought down a stab of jealousy the tooth fairy hadnt left him anything so fine when he was a boy but then hozays parents were close kin to ralf the chief and the tooth fairy seemed to favor people who were well off those that have get even from fairies the shaman thought resentfully he couldnt stay mad at hozay though for one thing he looked almost irresistibly cute with his missing tooth and for another he didnt stick around as a focus for madyus piquehe dashed off yelling after his friends the shaman walked over to the creek stripped off his linen shirt and buckskin leggings and dove in he came up snorting and blowing and at least a little relieved then he went down again swam underwater over to a rock on which a redear turtle was sunning itself the turtle stared in disbelieving reptilian horror when he splashed up in front of its pointy nose it leapt off the rock and into the creek frantically churned away in the water it was more graceful than madyu he swam a while longer then went back to reclaim his clothes he discovered they were not there to be reclaimed none of the small boys was in sight either which gave him more than a little reason to suspect the clothes had not ambled off by themselves the shaman said a couple of choice things under his breath added a couple of choicer ones out loud the shirt and leggings failed to reappear swearing and dripping madyu went back to his tent without them a few of the women had come back to the encampment for a midday meal they giggled when they saw madyu ralfs tribe had no strong nudity taboo nor did its neighbors given the eestexas climate nudity was often more comfortable than clothes but a wet angry naked shaman had obviously just fallen victim to a prank and so became fair game among the gigglers was hozays older sister neena that only made madyu more furious some shamans eschewed marriage believing a celibate life made their magic stronger of those who did take a woman or two most chose from outside their own tribe that was not a law but it was fairly strong custom knowing as he did the secret names of his tribesfolk a shaman might be tempted to try using sorcery to win a girls heart madyu would never have stooped to such a thing however pleasant he found the picture of auburnhaired softly curved neena sharing his tent he resolved to go courting at the trade fair a couple of moons hence but despite that resolution which he had made and broken before he did not care to have neena laughing at him even a scrawny clumsy nearsighted man has his pride as the shaman had expected his missing garments lay close by the tent the imps whod absconded with themand if hozay wasnt one of them madyu would go out and eat grass for supperknew how far they could go in provoking him had leggings and shirt vanished for good some small backsides would have had an encounter with the switch madyu sighed as he got dressed this one was a clean win for the boys toward evening a commotion announced the return of the hunting band madyu put away the old time book hed been trying to decipher ever since hed traded another shaman a sixtool pocket knife for it the man was a cheat if madyu ever learned his secret name hed regret the day he was born the books faded cover proclaimed that it had to do with medicine but instead of talking about how to fix a broken leg or what to do about measles or lockjaw it went on and on about genes and enzymes and other such incomprehensibilities madyu was sometimes tempted to use its pages for kindling but keeping it around and looking through it every now and then reminded him not to be too eager in a deal with some trepidation he came out of the tent if this hunt proved as bad as the last one had been jorj was liable to clout him into the middle of next week but the chief hunter wore a grin as wide as a longhorns span when he saw madyu he clouted him all right but it was a happy clout not an angryone the shaman staggered just the same jorj caught him steadied him and patted him on the back look at the fine wizard we have here he shouted to anyone who would listenand he hadnt even been into the blackberry wine look at all the ducks we brought back thanks to his spells ducks madyu quacked but his startled voice was drowned by a chorus of cheers from the rest of the hunters and from the women of the tribe madyu looked from one smiling hunter to the next sure enough they were carrying two or three or even four fat ducks apiece with some of the shining feathers now dark with blood hardly ever seen such a big flock before jorj boomed they were tipping up in that pondyou know the one near whats left of the old time roadand they were so busy eating they barely noticed us shooting at em till they were dead wonderful spells madyu i wish theyd work that well all the time so do i madyu said in a hollow voice hed magicked rabbits and squirrels turkey and cattle and deerhe hadnt said word one to the gods about ducks but here they were dozens of them the tribe would feast for a week he saw neena looking right at him and cheering as loud as anybody when he smiled at her in a tentative way she smiled back not tentatively in the least all at once the world seemed a brighter place maybe he hadnt asked the gods for ducks but if they sent ducks his way hed take credit for them he puffed his chest out as far as it would go standing there beside jorj he still looked like nothing much i tried something new this time he declared it had to do with genes and enzymes never knew ducks wore jeans jorj said joke as he would though the meaningless and therefore necessarily magical words impressed him whatever those enthings are use em some more they were something else im glad madyu said bemused still by then the women of the tribe were busily plucking the ducks putting aside feathers for ornament and for fletching arrows and the soft underdown for pillows quilts and jackets as casually as he could the shaman strolled over to neena and asked her for one of the metallic green feathers from a male mallards head their fingers brushed for a moment when she gave it to him he felt a spark and from her friendly expression she might have too before long the savory odor of roast duck drove even lustful thoughts from his mind some of the women took out crocks of currant jelly to accompany the feast crisp skin crackled under madyus teeth as he bit into a juicy thigh rich hot fat filled his mouth he ate until he could hold no more then licked every finger clean the rest of the tribe stuffed themselves dogs yapped and snarled over gnawed bones thrown in the dirt a little girl hit her baby brother over the head with a drumstick he toddled off crying their mother paddled her she ran after him crying even louder here wizardry sir jorj passed madyu a skin of wine always goes good madyu took a pull then another one he smiled nodded his thanks and belched enormously not to be outdone in politeness jorj belched back then the chief hunter said oh what with all the ducks and everything i almost forgot forgot what madyu asked absently he was watching neena again even if she had been his woman he was too gorged to imagine anything but watching at the moment yet watching was a pleasure too albeit a small one jorjs answer brought back his full attentionwe came across an old time building nobodys ever seen before far as i know did you the descendants of the handful of people who had survived the big oops a term that had as many interpretations as there were shamans had been picking their ancestors bones for the past two hundred years there were a lot of bones to pick though every so often somebody came across one with meat still on it madyu glanced at the dogs which were still quarreling over remnants of roast duck he wondered if the godlike men of old time would look at his scavenging tribesfolk the same way no matter where is it how do i get to it its on a patch of fairly high ground that overlooks the pond where we took all those ducks thanks to your magic jorj thumped madyu on the back and almost knocked him over even though he was sitting on the ground its surrounded by oaks and creepers i suppose thats why nobody noticed it before oh madyus spirts plummeted so many old time buildings were nothing more than tumbledown ruins hardly worth going through by the way jorj had spoken hed hoped for something better from this one the chief hunter was better at noting animals vagaries than those of his fellow men but he saw how disappointed madyu looked cheer up shaman i didnt mean there are oaks and creepers growing up through the building theyre just around it one must have blown down in the last storm to let us see the walls through the new gap the building is in halfway decent shape maybe better part of the roof still looks to be on at that madyu did feel better if it was truelet the gods make it true he bent his head muttered a quick prayer then he said will you take me to it tomorrow me jorj frowned but finally nodded i suppose i owe you that much after you brought us all those lovely ducks what i find in there might make me a better wizard yet madyu declared the ducks hadnt been his doing but if jorj insisted on giving him credit for them he wasnt too proud to take it after a breakfast of duck soup and porridge madyu followed jorj into the woods the chief hunter moved as confidently as if he were walking down the old time road not far from camp toting a spear he wasnt used to madyu blundered along behind him peering this way and that at every noise he didnt know why he bothered he never could see what made them he thanked the gods he didnt have to go out hunting all the time he would have been the laughingstock of the tribe because he didnt hunt all the time he was soft hed been puffing and panting for quite a while when jorj stopped and pointed there it is do you see no madyu had to walk a fair way in the direction jorjs finger gave before he could make out a smear of lighter color against the greens and browns of the woods ill come along if you like jorj said but he didnt sound as if he meant it the magic that often lingered in old time buildings was dangerous even to shamans the chief hunter wanted nothing to do with it you dont need to madyu told him if anything worth having did rest inside the building he wanted it all to himself but after a moment he added could you stay within earshot in case there are snakes instead of demons in there fair enough the chief hunter agreed he reached into the pack he wore on his back figured youd say that so i brought along a songbird net the ducks wont last forever however much we wish they would pigeons and starlings arent bad eating either while jorj looked for a likely spot to string up his net madyu scrambled over the mosscovered trunk of the fallen oak when he made it to the other side he let out a soft whistle jorj had been right the newly revealed building wasnt badly overgrown at all after a moment he saw why it was surrounded by a stretch of the same hard black tarry stuff the men of old time had used to make their roads hed seen other buildings protected that way they never failed to puzzle him for a road the black hard stuff was almost ideal even if it was too hard for horses hooves it kept the roadway from being overgrown but why offend the earth powers by slapping it over what could have made a perfectly good vegetable plot it made no sense that he could see for the moment though whys did not matter the black stuff had cracked here and there allowing some bushes to push up through it but enough remained to hold the worst of the woods at bay windows bare of glass stared blankly out at madyu like dead mens eyes hefting his spear he advanced on the building he tried the door once when it didnt open he went over to one of those windows old time locks were tougher by far than any made these days had he not known for a fact that the men of old time enjoyed both godlike power and godlike goodness that might have made him wonder about their integrity before he scrambled in through the window opening he paused to sniff his nose caught none of the rank order of cat piss so no cougarotherwise known as puma catamount or though eestexas had no mountains mountain lionhad denned in there any time recently just to stay on the safe side the shaman thrust in his spear and poked around as far as he could reach nothing screeched or hissed or writhed under the point so he scrambled in himself his boots scrunched on drifted leaves he stood still for a couple of minutes letting his eyes adjust to the gloom then he looked around to see what sort of building this was a few feet ahead stood a closed door the frosted glass panel inset into its upper half still miraculously intact when madyu saw that door hope that hed come upon a real find began to flower in him if this place had been looted before the door would have been ajar the glass broken or more likely both gilded letters marched across the glass some had peeled away but the shaman could still read the words they made veterinarians office all at once his breath came quick and short as if he and neena lay joined together on his pallet in the old time veterinarians had been shamans specially charged with healing animals an unplundered veterinarians office might yield anything he said aloud in soft wondering tones anything at all he went up to the door and twisted the knob he let out a whoop when it refused to turnwould a looter have locked a door behind him when he was through it seemed anything but probable he smashed the glass with the butt of his spear after the rest of his searching was done he would gather up the sharp shards to use in cutting blades and as arrow points nothing from the old time went to waste he reached into the opening hed made and opened the door from the inside the chamber thus revealed was better lit than hed expected a quick look showed why part of the roof had fallen in baring the office to the skyand the rain oh a pestilence madyu groaned everything that had lain anywhere near floor level was long years ruined cobwebs lay thick upon every shelf they covered countless jars of pills madyu would have fought shy of those no matter what old time medicines whether meant for animals or men were likelier to kill than cure when given by someone who did not thoroughly understand them which in the days since the big oops meant everybody the shaman went over to a low cabinet with a great many drawers he pulled one open tearing more cobwebs he felt like shoutingin fact he did shoutwhen he discovered it was full of little sharp knives of several sizes and shapes they were as bright and unrusted as if theyd been forged the day before he scooped them out of their neat pigeonholes stuffed them into the stout leather sack hed brought for booty then tried another drawer this one held hollow needles attached to glass cylinders no one these days knew why the men of old time had chosen to imitate rattlesnake fangs but they had the shaman took a few of the bigger ones sometimes women in the tribe used them to stick sauces deep inside a joint of meat other than that so far as he knew they had no use other drawers were full of things that had no use whatsoever that he knew about a lot of them however were made of metal and glass so they were valuable even if not useful in and of themselves but next to the cabinet stood a real prize a metal bookcase full of books or rather almost full of books those on the bottom two shelves had at some time in the unknown past been chewed up and turned into rats nests the bookcase though was sheltered from the elements and had kept its smooth coat of paint rodents hadnt been able to get at the volumes on the upper shelves madyu pulled one out dusted it off held it close to his nose to read the title on the spine collected numbers of the journal of american veterinary medicine that looked as if it might be interesting but when he opened the volume the collected numbers flaked to pieces under even the gentlest touch poxridden paper madyu growled so many books from old time were like girls who teased but wouldnt deliver instead of giving up the precious information they contained they crumbled away to nothingness scowling at yet another such betrayal the shaman pulled out another volume this one also labeled collected numbers he opened it even more cautiously than he had the first all at once he grinned in startled pleasure the numbers collected here were not what the title claimed bound inside the spine were half a dozen copies of an old time magazine with which he was already familiar one whose pictures displayed not only incomprehensible ancient artifacts like cameras cd players and toyotas but also a good many perfectly comprehensible ancient pretty girls in various interesting states of undress he closed this volume with the same care hed used to open it then stowed it in his leather sack he had more than a little hope that he would be able to get it safely back to the encampment unlike the real journal of american veterinary medicine the magazines that had hidden behind the lying binding were made from a shiny coated paper that was better at withstanding the ravages of time than was the more common kind the shaman plucked out more books searching for others printed on the coated paper he found a couple and put them into the sack several others made from the ordinary variety disintegrated as soon as he opened them he murmured a prayer of regret at having destroyed so much irreplaceable wisdom but did not know what else he could have done he picked up the heavy sack closed the office door behind him and left the ruin by the window through which hed entered he was surprised to note how far the sun had crawled across the sky he hadnt paid attention to the shadows as he ransacked the old time office he hallooed for jorj and felt a good deal of relief when the chief hunter hallooed back a moment later jorj had the knack for moving quietly through the undergrowth in a couple of minutes he simply seemed to appear in front of madyu out of thin air he pointed to the bulging leather sack ha no demons eh none that i saw anyhow madyu answered hed only meant to be strictly accurate but saw hed also succeeded in frightening jorj well that wasnt such a bad thing hiding a smile he went on no snakes either good good what do you have in there anyway some little knives of good steel some hollowed needles glass and metal junk and some books books jorjs voice informed the word with scorn why bother bringing out books shaman what good are they like almost everyone else in the tribe the chief hunter was illiterate youll like some of them pictures from old time madyus hands shaped curves in the air as they did so he thought again of neena jorjs eyes lit up youll trade some why not madyu said i see youve also done pretty well for yourself more than a dozen dead songbirds their little yellow legs bound together with twine hung head down from jorjs belt along with a possum and a couple of chipmunks could be worse the chief hunter allowed i just wish there was more meat to each one but as long as i do even this well we wont be down to eating grubs and grasshoppers the way we had to a couple of years ago the gods be praised for that madyu said and meant every word of it grasshopper stew was vile no matter how long the insects cooked they crunched horridly between the teeth and chief raff had been about to run him out of the tribe for weak magic before the famine finally broke madyu never had figured out why the gods got so angry at him or why they finally decided to relent shaman and chief hunter walked back to the encampment in companionable silence each well enough pleased with his days work thanks to his tasty burden jorj got the big half of the wishbones worth of greetings but madyu created some enthusiasm among the men when he told them about the pictures of old time girls hed found neena happened to be standing close by just then and let out a sniff loud enough to make him regret for a moment having come across the volume with pictures soon enough though thoughts of profit ousted regret it wasnt worse luck as if neena were his woman after supper but before sunset made reading impractical madyu settled down with the other two books hed brought back from the ruin one of them its title page proclaimed was about the diseases of cats he read three or four pages then put the book down with a grunt of disgust it was as incomprehensible as the one with which the other shaman had cheated him he wondered if he was the problem but shook his head he read pretty fluently and the old time language wasnt that far removed from the english his tribe spoke he never had figured out why the language bore that name he didnt know of a place called eng anywhere within shouting distance of eestexas but this book was crammed full of words he not only didnt know but couldnt define from context what did distal mean for instance or pancreatic function he thought about trading the book to a maykano maybe the peculiar words were spanyol not english at all if they were someone from a southern tribe might get more out of the volume then he could and if not well it wouldnt be the first time hed diddled someone in a trade he picked up the other volume with a certain amount of resignation convinced from the outset that it would be even worse than the one hed just set aside even its tide looked like a nonsense word taxonomy taxonuhme he said sounding it out he had some idea what taxes weretribute that you paid to your chief or that a weak tribe paid to a strong one next door he couldnt see why anyone would want to write a book about that or why a veterinarian would need it once it was written he also doubted old time folk had had to worry about anything so mundane as taxes but being a stubborn sort he decided he would keep going in the book until he found out what its name meantnames after all were powerful he turned to the preface and found to his surprise that not only did it tell him what he wanted to know it did so in a fashion he had little trouble understanding taxonomy he gathered was a way of organizing living creatures by how they were related to one another something like the genealogical charts some shamans drew for their tribes he whistled softly to himself the old time folk thought big if they aimed to keep track of how everything was related to everything else he admired their presumption without wishing to emulate it just to begin with how did they propose to keep track of all the different names every living thing had two paragraphs further on the preface told him binomial nomenclature that formidable pair of words almost made him put down the book then and there but the preface went on to explain what it meant two names one generic to tell what sort of creature an animal was and the other specific to tell exactly what sort it was that had the shaman scratching his head again but this taxonomy book despite its intimidating title did a much better job of explaining things than did the volume on the diseases of cats it gave the example of the dogwhich for no reason madyu could see it called canis familiarisand the wolfwhich it styled canis lupus the generic name they shared said they were closely related to each other while their different specific names said they werent the same makes sense of a sort madyu admitted it made enough sense at any rate for him to keep reading his eye lit on a sentence in the next paragraph and would not go away the socalled scientific name attached to any organism remains constant throughout the world enabling researchers to communicate effectively and accurately regardless of their native languages he stared at those words until darkness made them illegible if they meant what he thought they did hed just stumbled across the biggest old time treasure ever bigger than gold bigger than jewels bigger even than the usable firearms and ammunition that still turned up every once in a while if the whole world had once recognized a single or rather double true appellation for every animal and plant was he not holding a book full of secret names he wanted to run screaming through the encampment shouting ive got it ive got it he wanted to get drunk he wanted to get laid he wanted to beat chief ralf at checkers and then laugh in his face he wanted to do all those things at once but none of them or even all of them at once would have given him a tenth part of the exaltation he felt sitting there quietly in the dark he did his best to keep a sense of detachment for one thing he might have been wrong though he didnt think he was for another even if he was right he didnt know which secret name went with each animal that night he slept with the book beside him on his pallet when he woke up the first thing he did was make sure it was still there when he saw it was he couldnt have been happier even if it had been neena there looking back at him with her big green eyes full of love he weighed that thought was a little surprised to find it true and stroked the books faded cover as tenderly as if it had been neenas soft smooth skin without bothering to break his fast he opened taxonomy he felt like cheering when he discovered that many of the scientific names contained therein had more familiar ones alongside them though the latter were written in brackets and in smaller letters as if to show they really werent quite as good or as scientifica word to conjure with he thought and smiled to himself inside his tentas the impressive products of binomial nomenclature navigating through classes orders families and genera took some doing but before too long he found that the whitetailed deers scientific name its secret name was odocoileus virginianus he said it several times it filled the mouth in a way that whitetailed deer never could saliva filled his mouth too at the thought of venison roasted with bacon and wild onions he left mammalia and went over to aves he ran his finger down each column of names until he found what he was looking for meleagris gallopavo he intoned reverently and then again meleagris gallopavo not only were the secret names true they were also beautiful he knew hed never be content just to say turkey again at this point hunger excitement and a bursting bladder drove him outside after imagining the rich savor of odocoileus virginianus and meleagris gallopavo duck hash made from rather stale duck proved a disappointment he was even more disappointed to see jorj sitting around fletching arrows youre not going out today he asked in tones of despair hadnt planned to no the chief hunter said his big blunt fingers picked with surprising delicacy through a pile of feathers he found one that suited him and began trimming it to fit the groove in an ashwood arrow but if you doif you give me time to make a proper magic a scientific magic firstif you do youll bring back deer and turkey both madyu said jorj stared at him hed never made that definite a prediction before i promise he added thinking hed already said enough to ruin himself if by some disastrous mischance he was wrong how can you promise what well catch jorj demanded you dont know what well stumble on out there in the woods you dont know the first thing about what hunting is like youre only good for stumbling over yourself but i know what im talking about when it comes to magic i truly do madyu said the hunter shook his head and started to go back to feathering his arrow desperately madyu added did i help you bring in all those ducks he knew the real answer to that was no but since jorj didnt know it he played the card without compunction jorj looked at the bright blue duck feather he held in his hand then back up at madyu slowly deliberately he set aside the feather and put away his tiny fletching tools when he got to his feet he towered over the shaman all right he said well hunt but if youre wrongif youre wrong wizardry sir youll not have the chance to make many more such mistakes do you understand me madyu i understand youjorj the tiny pause there should have reminded the chief hunter that madyu knew and might have used his secret name it was not as good a threat as jorjs big hard bunched fist however even with a secret name magic had a way of going wrong madyu suddenly wished he hadnt remembered that just before the most important conjuration of his life brute force was inelegant but always worked still shaking his head jorj went off to gather the hunting band madyu hurried back to his tent he began to incant as hed never incanted before whatever his doubts and worries they washed away in ritual chants and passes dances and prayers again and again he intoned the majestic secret names hed learned when he held the whitefurred deer tail his cry was odocoileus virginianus when he pranced with a turkey plume meleagris gallopavo rolled trippingly off his tongue as an added touch he tried to pronounce the secret name as if he were a turkey himself gallopavo he gobbled gallopavo being a meticulous man he did not forget some magical encouragement for the pack of canis familiaris that coursed with the hunters the dogs had as much to do with a hunts success as the men sometimes more they were more susceptible to magic too as they lacked the wit that sometimes blunted it when it was turned against people at last he had done all he could do he stayed in his tent regardless not caring for the loss of dignity that would come from the women of the tribe watching him pace nervously back and forth while he waited for the hunters to return staying inside didnt end up helping his dignity either hozay and some of the other boys started chanting madyu dont dare show his face show his face show his face with the insane persistence small boys would sooner show in mischief than in honest work they kept chanting it for a good part of the afternoon madyu looked through the taxonomy book again if the secret name for pest or infernal nuisance appeared therein however he could not find it after much too long hozay got tired of singing his old song if hed kept quiet because of that madyu might possibly have found it in his heart to forgive him instead though he came up with a new one which he proceeded to bellow out in a boys falsetto that hurt like a sore tooth neena says madyus too skinny neena says madyus too skinny neena says the shamans temper went up in flames like a dead dry pine struck by lightning he burst out of the tent aiming at nothing less than hozayicide neenas little brother ran like a rabbit dodging madyus every effort to lay a hand on him and as he ran he kept singing his new and infuriating oneline ditty finally puffing and defeated madyu drew to a halt at almost the same time hozay decided to shut up the one had nothing to do with the other hozay had heardas madyu did too a moment laterthe hunting band coming back from the woods little boys know instinctively that adults do not take kindly to their mocking other adults this does not stop little boys but it will sometimes make them cautious adults however commonly do not care in the least about punishing mockery when they are the ones dishing it out madyu stood alone in the middle of the encampment waiting for the hunters scorn to land on himand to obliterate him the way the rest of the day had gone he knew his sorcery had to have failed jorj came into the clearing spotted the shaman pointing at madyu he looked back over his shoulder and yelled here he is his bass bellow made madyu cringeby the sound of it the hunters would not be content with mere insults theyd want his blood had he thought running would do any good he would have run shouting the rest of the hunting band followed jorj into the open space around the encampment they roared down on madyu he needed a few seconds to realize they were cheering him not cursing the ones who came out of the woods first were carrying turkeys some more than one bird the ones who came later had tied gutted deer carcasses to spearshafts that they bore on their shoulders two men to a spear all in all they were bringing back three or four times as much meat as they usually did even on a good day jorj who as chief hunter did not have to haul prey hurried into his tent he came out with his necklace of silver quarters which he proceeded to throw around madyus neckbest magic since old time he shouted loud enough to be heard in the next encampment the turkeys waddled right up to us the deer just stood there waiting to be killed just the way our great shaman said they would madyu hadnt quite said anything like that he hadnt really expected to achieve anything like that he thought he knew what magic could and couldnt do but i never made hunting magic with real secret names before he thought dizzily he let a big grin stretch itself over his face and did not bother setting the record straight well wizardry sir what do you have to say for yourself jorj boomed the shaman blurted the first thing that came into his head lets eat the hunters cheered again louder than ever boys and girls came running to gape at the enormous catch among them was hozay madyu was so full of triumph that gazing at his tormentor only made him wonder how much the tooth fairy would bring if he knocked all the little monsters teeth down his throat the racket the hunters and children made brought the women in from the fields early they stared at the young mountain of meat too and then sent up their own screams of joy jorj yelled were rich do you know that rich we have more food than we know what to do with we have so much we can smoke some and sell it to tribes that arent lucky enough to have a shaman as clever andwhat was that fancy word you used madyuas scientific thats it as ours we can madyu stopped listening about then because neena threw herself into his arms kissed him and exclaimed oh madyu youre wonderful the shaman came up for air stunned and gasping but his hands knew what to do they grabbed neena here and there an instant later his idiot mind yammered that she would surely pull awayafter all hadnt she said he was too skinny but she didnt in fact she snuggled closer off to one side hozay looked as if he were about to be sick that felt almost as good to madyu as neenas warm and yielding softness by way of experimenthe was a scientific manhe kissed her this time not only did she return the kiss but he noticed dimly hozay looked even sicker since the experiment was successful he repeated it emboldened further still by the results of the second trial he whispered will you come to my tent tonight of course i will she whispered back her breath moist in his ear then she went on why didnt you ask me a long time ago he stared at her ii didnt think why ever not wellwell the more he pondered that the more he wondered himself he found only one answer that made any sense whatever after all neena i know your secret name so what she tossed her head so her shining hair flipped back over her shoulder then she pointed to one of the gutted deer carcasses did you use it in a spell on me the way you did with those of course not he said indignant at the very suggestion i d never do such a thing well then she said as if that settled everything by the way she was looking at him maybe it did her premise wasnt even slightly scientific madyu knew that but however scientific he thought he was he was a shaman first and also knew logic sometimes didnt matter this felt like one of those times his arms tightened around neena again she sighed against his cheek he nodded happily pleased at the logical confirmation of his illogic sure enough this was one of those times les mortes darthur when i wrote this story in early i used as my guide to the names of the features on mimas the map in the back of the nasa publication voyages to saturn these names however had not yet been formally approved by the international astronomical union mimas biggest crater ended up being named for the moons discoverer rather than being based on the arthurian theme that dominates the rest of its nomenclature les mortes dherschel however doesnt make much of a title so ive decided to leave well enough alone the slope the spacesuited runner was climbing would have been impossibly steep even on luna the tracking camera relayed her image to the studio a few kilometers away lovely isnt she murmured rannveig aasen she certainly is bill bennett agreed moving with grace on a very low gravity world is a skill few people have occasion to acquire as if to prove his point the runner made a slight misstep instead of gliding smoothly forward she bounced a good five meters up off the ground she had the presence of mind to hold her pose for the eleven seconds it took for her to return that could happen to anyone bennett said sympathetically mimas surface gravity is onlyg to put that in perspective for you folks back home luna pulls more than twenty times as strongly the transmitter flung his words and picture across one and a third billion kilometers toward earth at light speed they would reach perhaps that many sets an hour and a half later with the slightly misleading legend livefrom saturn superimposed the girl reached the summit without further mishap she paused for a moment before the large bronze bowl there then reached up and thrust the rod she carried in her right hand over the edge of the caldron a great sheet of yelloworange flame twice as tall as a man sprang into being its a hologram of course rannveig said the same principle that makes stereovision possible mimas is almost nothing but ice and has no atmosphere at all but it still makes me want to reach out and warm my hands over it me too bennett said well return to our coverage of the sixtysixth winter olympic games in a moment but first these words bennett disappeared from the monitor screen to be replaced by the interplanetary broadcasting companys keynote symbol for this part of the games an ancient blackandwhite voyager image of mimas with the great crater arthur dramatically shadowed near the terminator when the commercial break was done the camera cut away from the broadcasters to the icy plain at the foot of arthurs central peak for the opening parade of athletes bright blue eyes twinkling rannveig aasen undid the belt that held her in her chair pushed off and caromed around the studio like an insane billiard ball with a cometary tail of long blond hair the director howled curses into her earphone but she always managed to keep an eye on the monitor and did not miss a beat in her commentary the two men and two women at the head of the procession the ones in the light blue and white spacesuits are the greek contingent she explained for her distant audience greece has been part of united europe for more than a hundred fifty years now but still fields an independent team at every olympic games in keeping with its place of honor as the homeland of the olympic ideal bennett listened to her with nothing but admiration a word also describing his feelings as he watched the female form does not sag at all ing the terrestrial portion of the winter games was being held at klagenfurt in united europe that year so the athletes crossed the ice in their national groups in french alphabetical order that put the united statesor rather etatsunisnear the front just after the chinese empire instead of toward the end this is the first time in four olympiads that the americans have sent a teamif i can call one man and one woman a teamto mimas bennett remarked they havent had much lowg training and arent expected to contend for medals but its good to see them competing here again private contributions raised enough money for two berths aboard the arab world ship nasser several larger groupings passedeastern europe the anzac federation japan luna the team from the arab world looked smart in spacesuits of green white and black security is tight here bennett said thanks to threats from israeli turkish and armenian nationalists moscow had fielded a strong group so had siberia there were a couple of swiss athletes in red suits with white crosses they had traveled with the united europeans in the same way the americans had with the arabs united europe as the host nation came last just behind the contingent from zaire rannveig was finally back in her seat personally she said i think the united european uniforms are busy so do i bennett nodded but then they almost have to be since theyre blending so many sets of former national colors some of the rivalries that went with those old colors arent dead yet either and the newer one between united europe and eastern europe is also no laughing matter im afraid you europeans are a contentious lot he said to rannveig who came from oslo no were not she replied in mock anger you certainly are they pythoned it back and forth for another minute or two before rannveig started the wrapup of openingday coverage remarking our viewers may be wondering why only a relative handful of teams are represented here as compared with klagenfurt cost is the villain bennett said fares from earth to the saturn system still run over fifteen hundred ounces of gold thats one of the major reasons weve seen so little from the united states in recent years for example if spaceflight were cheaper wed see many more nations participating something to look forward to perhaps in games to come rannveig closed out thanks for joining us for the opening ceremonies from the mimas winter olympic venue tomorrow well be bringing you firstround coverage of the most spectacular of all olympic events the fivekilometer ski jump program your sets to olympics now so you wont miss a moment of the action see you then the old voyager picture of mimas reappeared on the monitor this time though a bright red line superimposed on the image showed the skijump track descending from the summit of arthurs central peakthe largest athletic arena in the solar system ten kilometers away a red oval showed the landing area that went off very well the director said adding all things considered with a pointed glower rannveigs way she paid no attention leaning back in her chair to let a makeup man scrub her face clean bennett did the same enjoying the damp sponge on his forehead cheeks and chin he was very little changed when the ministrations were over an openfaced light brown man in his early thirties burnsides popular after a lapse of fifty years looked good on him so did his engaging smile even if it was a touch smug at the moment he had a right to feel selfsatisfied ibc did not hire many americans most were too parochial to do well outside their own small bailiwick and few spoke anything but english or spanish but his french once again the dominant international tongue was fluent as any native speakers to his own way of thinking at least he had a better accent than rannveig did care for a drink he asked and she gave an eager nod they swung hand over hand from the rings set in the hallway ceiling toward the bar brachiating was the easiest way to get around on mimas the gravity was really too weak for walking especially indoors but just enough to make freefallstyle gliding impractical too i wonder why we ever came out of the trees rannveig said darting ahead the studio was part of the same complex that housed the olympic athletes the two broadcasters sped past pressure doors and spacesuits in niches like any structure exposed to vacuum the olympic village was divided into hundreds of gastight segments the front door to every suite was a bulkhead in its own right once she had hooked her feet under the brass rail rannveig ordered aquavit with a beer chaser bennett chose rum and coke since the rediscovery of the original formula in the ruins of atlanta cocacola was all the rage again the drinks came in squeeze bulbs with nipples as they would have in freefall an incautious lift would have sent the contents of glasses flying the monorail shuttle returned to the olympic complex from the parade ground athletes and coaches began drifting into the bar most of the competitors knowing they would have to be at their best tomorrow were moderate their mentors had fewer compunctions the muscovite coach in a red and gold sweater and his siberian counterpart who wore his teams snowy white challenged each other to a duel of vodka empty squeeze bulbs accumulated in epic numbers around them the two of them argued more or less amiably as they drank the muscovite spit slavic consonants at his opposite number the siberian replied in french letting bennett follow his half of the conversation for a czarist nobleman russian was fit only for talking with servants infants and pets it seems hardly fair for peasant upstarts to have better accommodations than we do he said the muscovite coach answered the siberian rolled his eyes all quarters are equal indeed merdewhy has the olympic committee placed us where we cannot even see the competition area no one could see the competition area the window in the bar was the only one in the olympic village the muscovite must have pointed that out because the siberian said it is the principle of the thing though principle i suppose is something a marxist cannot be expected to understand the muscovites only comment to that was a belch he fell asleep a few minutes later his counterparts triumphant smile also quickly dissolved in snores except for one jew the members of the arab worlds team were teetotalers they sipped fruit juice and passed a pipe back and forth a ski jumper was turning cartwheels in midair rannveig touched bennetts hand look at the loonie showing off you can hardly blame her this is the only place where she can compete against earth people on even termsmimas makes everyone strong he finished his drink do you mind if i drift around a bit heavens no have a good time i certainly intend to she looked at him archly dont do anything i wouldnt enjoy he grinned that doesnt leave much out they had ended up in bed a couple of times during the trip to mimas more out of boredom and simple propinquity than anything else it had been fun but nothing on which to build a grand passion the ski jumper from luna landed on her head laughing was that half a turn too many or too few bennett asked her i sort of lost track up there she said she looked at him curiously trying to place him most of the athletes were still in the tight pullovers and hose they had worn under their spacesuits which made his conservative green velvet doublet tunic and paisley neck scarf stand out by comparison i know she exclaimed after a moment youre from ibc he admitted it she insisted on buying him a drink not much happened in the controlled environment of luna so stereovision was even more popular there than it was on earth im just a media addict she said nonsense he said gallantly how could you get into that kind of shape sitting in front of a set all the time he bought the next round himself and the one after that he was sure his expense account was stretchier than hers he glanced over and saw rannveig deep in conversation with a big man as blond as she was another scandinavian was his first thought but then he noticed the fellow was wearing the eyesearing blue red and green of eastern europe they did not seem to be having any problems getting along though nor was he with the girl he had met a promising evening all the way around he thought and now rannveig said id like to introduce our expert analyst angus cavendish bronze medalist for united europe in the fivekilometer ski jump in the winter games i thank ye very much cavendish said he was a small dapper man in his early forties just beginning to gray at the temples and on his cheeks the scots burr with which he flavored his french should have given his voice an air of impressive deliberation it probably would have too if he spoke a little slower but he was too excitable for that he always reminded bennett of a tape recorded at eight centimeters a second and played back at sixteen tell us angus whats the most difficult thing about this event bennett asked he had the slightly too good feeling hangover pills always brought the training for it cavendish said at once for where dye find the like conditions in the inner solar system its only the rich countries can afford to ship their skiers out here for the sake o the exercise the arab world luna japan siberia then how do you account for your own medal rannveig asked me lass i was assistant engineer on a supply ship to the mimas saturn station and borrowed my skis from a computer tech there you look down the rosters of the teams and youll find a great lot of spacers among em were the ones who come to mimas on our own business and learn a bit while were here following the script they had roughed out bennett said why dont athletes from nations that cant afford to send them here train on the moons of mars those have an even lower surface gravity than mimas so they do but they dont have arthur theyre too puny look here now the screen behind the broadcasters displayed the trademark image of mimas cavendish used a pointer the crater is a hundred thirty kilometers across and ten deep with the central peak six kilometers high the body that struck mimas to make it must have been ten kilometers across almost the size of deimos mind if it had been any bigger it wouldve cracked the moon apart from what youve told us then i take it the technique for jumping on mimas is quite different from the one skiers use back on earth rannveig said the screen showed the ninetymeter jump at klagenfurt a skier appeared at the top of the slope pushed off and went into her tuck theres the first difference already cavendish cried you cant simply tuck and run here or youre done for in the jump at g you see you dont build up the velocity even in five kilometers that you do in the ninety meters on earth you have to use poles all the way down but there are risks in that too arent there bennett asked that there are in the low gravity each push sends you off the slope the more you bounce about ysee the less time there is to be pushing you have to dig in at just the right angle to come down again quick as you can if youve done it right you spring off at the end with about the same speed as off the ninetymeter hill back homenear a hundred kilometers an hour as if on cue the jumper in the monitor screen launched herself into space with the local gravity so low youd think youd almost be able to jump clean off mimas rannveig said tisnt so cavendish snorted the escape velocitys over a hundred seventy meters a second you scarcely reach the sixth part of that nay with the ramp angled up at fortyfive degrees you take about four minutes to sail up two and a half kilometersthree and a half over the floor of arthur then its down again overall youre flying between nine and ten minutes it must be a marvelous view bennett said that it is the line was planned but cavendishs eyes went genuinely misty you think you can see forever in fact its about thirtyfive kilometers the screen behind the scotsman showed the jumbled vista of the crater floor small pits and mounds of ice began lazily flowing out of the picture at the edges what remained grew larger and larger of course eventually you have to think about landing bennett said so you do cavendish said dryly theres the rub you hit the slope at more than a hundred and ten kilometers an hour and you dont dare tumble they have subsurface pipes to heatif thats the word i wantthe landing zone a hundred degrees or so up to centigrade same as the runway still rip your suit and youre gone almost every games it seems they add a name or two to the memorial plaque at the peak of arthur is it worth it then bennett asked that line was in the script too but he meant it risking ones life unnecessarily struck him as insane cavendishs reply caught him by surprise it came from the man not the commentator lad for the feeling you get when youre up there why dyingd be a small price to pay there was a moment of dead air before rannveig took up the slack saying quietly all the athletes here today would agree with you angus the broadcast going back to earth cut away from the studio to the pressurized lodge at the top of the runway like the olympic village complex below it rested on pylons sunk in the ice the camera focused on the airlock door which opened to let out the first contestant she wore the deep blue of the anzac federation her clear faceplate showed intense concentration on her features this is marge olbert rannveig said shes twentysix from canberra a junior ecology officer aboard the wirraway one of the anzac lines asteroidbelt freighters ah then shell have some work at very low gravity cavendish said a plus for her the starting light went from red to green marge olbert dug her poles into the ice a good pushoff cavendish cried see shes still low enough to take a second shove thats the way to do itkeep the polework as near parallel to the runway as you can the ski jumper landed pushed flew landed pushed flew each thrust of the ski poles added to her velocity so little by little did mimas weak pull oh excellent formshell be close to that hundredkilometeranhour mark cavendish said marge olbert was rocketing down the slope now a shame were in vacuum bennett said the wind shrieking by ms olbert would give the audience an added sense of her speed cavendish chuckled they can tell shes going fast never fear she used her poles powerfully on the short upslope at the end of the run gave a last great spring and launched herself into the void red numbers appeared on the monitor a splendid takeoff velocity cavendish said he unobtrusively checked a chart he was holding in his lap shell be out past ten and a quarter kilometers the womens record only could well be the longest womens jump of the first day shell give the other lassies something to think on the flick of a switch brought the transmission from olberts suit radio into the studio oh my she was saying again and again oh my a reminiscent grin spread over cavendishs face marge olbert was soaring up toward her maximum altitude when coverage cut back to the slope where another jumper had already begun his run theyll be going about every five minutes bennett explained so one will be landing another just past high point and a third jumping at about the same time thats right bill rannveig said on the runway now is jozef jablonski of eastern europe bennett wondered at the sudden warmth in her voice until a closeup showed the face of the man she had been with the night before she went on hes twentynine an air force captain from gdynia his hobbies include basketball chess and wargaming not all of that was on jablonskis personal data sheet bennett smiled a little hes a stronglooking brute cavendish said rannveig jerked her head whether in agreement or indignation bennett could not tell the scotsman carried the narration good form into the upslopeaye a mighty push there and now the leap kilometers an hour a fine first jump itll go well past eleven kilometers a tight telephoto showed the expression of almost religious awe that jablonski was wearing as he sailed high over the frozen surface of mimas with a shot like that you dont need words cavendish murmured the monitor split into thirds simultaneously tracking marge olbert hurtling down toward her landing jablonski nearing apogee and the next contestant on the runway a siberian woman who crossed herself before she began her descent dreamsmooth the girl from the anzac federation touched down steadying herself with her ski poles heres her distance now cavendish said its metersa splendid opening jump as marge olbert killed her momentum on the reverse slope beyond the landing zone a crawler came out to pick her up and take her back to the olympic village her raised fist said she knew what she had done then jozef jablonski was landing not as gracefully as his predecessor but safe enough red numbers superimposed on his image gave the length of his jump meters astonishing that only a fourkilometeranhour difference in takeoff velocity will produce so much extra distance rannveig said she did not sound astonished she sounded proud its enough to send jablonski over two hundred meters higher than marge olbert and keep him over the ice twenty seconds longer bennett said echoing the quick calculations one of the technical people was feeding into his earphone one after another the jumpers flew through their parabolas with sixtyeight competitors in all the first round was scheduled to last nearly six hours as cavendish had guessed marge olberts distance kept holding up though the girl from the united states making her first jump off earth startled everyone by coming within seventeen meters of it on the mens side jozef jablonski stayed in solid contention if not among the very leaders they were down to the last half dozen competitors when bennett remarked so far weve had one of the safest first days ever for the mimas venueonly a couple of minor spills and no serious injuries what do you think accounts for our good fortune angus nothing but luck so far cavendish said if were as well off after all three days of jumping are done then well have something to brag about the dismissal irritated bennett but at that moment another jumper soared off the ramp his annoyance instantly turned to excitement look at that he exclaimed well have a new leader if shukri alkuwaffy lands safely he was a favorite aye cavendish said but who wouldve thought hed have a takeoff velocity of kilometers an hour that comes to a jump of over meters enough to put him in front by more than meters watching his form i own i didnt think hed be off so strong back at the top of the runway a muscovite in red and gold waited for the starting light rannveig said it has to be disheartening for dmitri shepilov to stand up there knowing what his predecessor has just done i suspect hes been through worse bennett commented reading from shepilovs data sheet he comes from a guards regiment of muscovite ski troops and he saw combat against the siberians in the ural skirmishes a couple of years ago after that a ski jump should be small potatoes i wonder angus cavendish said with a grinthen it was only the eye of his sergeant on him not the whole of earth and luna shepilovs speed down the ramp was slower than alkuwatlys at every checkpoint but still respectable he launched himself at just over a hundred kilometers an hour a jump that projected out close to an even eleven kilometers coverage of the next athlete a man from united europe was brief attention switched away to alkuwatly who was heading down toward his landing i dont look for any trouble from him cavendish said hes still half a kilometer up almost two minutes away from putting his skis to the ice but already hes in good position as he should be nothingll go wrong here the slowmotion shots of what happened next would be replayed endlessly seeing everything live bennett was chiefly conscious of how fast sportcasting banality turned to horror he had actually been laughing at cavendish for no sooner were the scotsmans words out of his mouth than they were all watching alkuwatlys hands open and his ski poles drift away everyone in the studio stared in consternation at the sudden misty globe around alkuwadys head the rime forming on his faceplate and the sides of his helmet his suits failed rannveig cried a split second ahead of bennett and cavendish they could do nothing but watch had it been he up there bennett knew he would have been thrashing wildly clawing at his helmet to try somehow to maintain the pressure but the jumper from the arab world held the posture he had been in at the moment of disaster only very slowly did his bent arms begin to straighten and slump to his sides as a veteran spacer cavendish was the first to recognize what that meant murder he shouted thats a killed man up there else hed be making shift to save himself he might have been reading bennetts mind but he generalized where the younger broadcaster had not alkuwadys flight path did not could not change trailing vapor he plunged toward the landing slope he hit the ice like a thrown cloth doll then bounced and tumbled bonelessly if he had not been dead already the impact would have killed him sickened bennett turned away from the big monitor screen behind the broadcasters as a result he was the only one of them looking at the bank of screens to one side that showed what all the active cameras were picking up he saw dmitri shepilov raise his right arm it looked as if the muscovite was starting to point then vapor spouted from his helmet too shepilovs hit he cried no one had paid any attention to louisphilippe guizot the jumper who came after the muscovite perhaps because he was from united europe bennetts yell made rannveig check another of the side screens for his safety guizot was only a few hundred meters from the takeoff ramp when his image was also shrouded by fog on no rannveig cried and covered her face with her hands bennett learned to hate mimas low gravity shepilov had been near the apex of his jump when he was hit he flew on a corpse for five dreadful minutes before crashing on the landing slope as alkuwatly had before him it was even worse with louisphilippe guizot propelled by the leap he had taken before the assassin struck he soared above mimas as if still alive then spun down in a hideously lazy descent this is madness bennett saidwho but a madman could think to mar the olympic games with violence even in wartorn ancient greece the olympic truce held good the modern games have been the victim of attack only twice and the last time was more than a hundred years ago the director spoke in his ear his voice went hard as he relayed the news to his distant audience we have just received a radio transmission claiming responsibility for the atrocity that has taken place here today here is a recording of that transmission the tape was scratchy the transmitter must have been a tiny one and saturns radio emission chopped up the signal but it was perfectly understandable as it is the olympic language this year i shall speak french a mans voice said it had a faint guttural accent and was full of irony and a good humor that chilled bennett shukri alkuwady was but the beginning we of the second irgun vow to continue our war against arab tyranny until the star of david once more flies above israel we regret the need to harm others but those who share pleasures with oppressors must also share their fate a very good day to you all the voice cut off leaving behind only the impersonal hisses and pops of background noise the director cued bennett through the earphone three two oneall right youre on the light above the camera lens turned red welcome once again to the mimas venue of the sixtysixth winter games he said competition of course has been suspended after yesterdays tragic events when and if it will resume remains unknown that largely depends on whether the coldblooded killer who so callously took the lives of three athletes can be detected and apprehended for any of you who may not have been with us yesterday here is rannveig aasen with a review of what took place thank you bill she said gravely she summarized the previous days jumps behind her the big monitor screen reran in quick succession the deaths of alkuwatly shepilov and guizot rannveig said examination of the bodies has shown that each of the three athletes was murdered by a burst from a highpowered laser weapon they were killed instantly none of course had any chance to defend himself how could such a thing happen bennett said as we noted before security is supposed to have been tight with us now is major katayama hitoshi head of mimas security come join us major katayama moving smoothly in the low gravity the security chief came over and sat down by the two broadcasters then strapped himself in thank you for being with us at this difficult time tell me if you will where did your precautions break down katayama grimaced not caring for the blunt question he was a stout hardfaced man with irongray hair after a moments thought he said i am afraid this will seem selfserving but much of the failure took place on earth when a killer was allowed to board a ship for mimas once that happened his or her success was probably inevitable how can you say that rannveig challenged surely you searched everyones baggage for arms of all sorts i know mine was opened and bills too yes that is so katayama said he spoke slowly he was very tired but was still picking his words with care explosive guns and missile weapons are easy to detect with lasers sadly the same is not the case laser tubes are too ubiquitous they are at the heart of your stereovision equipment of stillpicture holocameras of computers scanning devices and in dozens of other everyday tools skilled terrorists find it all too simple to improvise deadly weapons it is an unfortunate fact of life even so rannveig persisted why didnt your force of guards keep the assassin from reaching cover or track him down after he did his work let me point something out ms aasen katayama said coolly rannveig bridled but he went on before she could interrupt i have twenty men here as your colleague mr angus cavendish pointed out on an earlier broadcast at the peak of a jump an athlete can see for thirtyfive kilometers which means he can be seen and shot at from that distance the area of a circle with a radius of kilometers is more than square kilometers or about square kilometers per guard i hope you see my difficulty offcamera bennett winced katayama was not an easy man to shake the broadcaster had no intention of giving up without a fight though he asked have you had any luck with photos from the observation satellite in synchronous orbit above arthur a very intelligent question sir the security chief nodded unfortunately the answer is no we were in dark phase at the time of the attack with the only light outside the area of competition coming from saturns other moons they are either small or distant or both and in any case received only a bit more than one percent of the sunlight per unit area than luna does and exactly because it is in synchronous orbit the satellite is over six hundred kilometers above us perhaps computer processing of its images will show more that is our best hope i think bennett gave up katayama seemed to have all the answers and a depressing lot they were rannveig however was still smarting from the rebuff she had taken she said forgive me for one last question why didnt any of your guards spot the flash of the laser when it was fired the security chiefs smile was like a sharks in vacuum of course there is no flash he said as if to a foolish child we only see beams of light because they shine through dust and vapor floating in air i wish it were otherwise but it is not thank you major katayama bennett said quicklywell be back with more after these messages as the commercials began katayama departed looking pleased with himself rannveig shook her head in disgust well he put me away didnt he thats what i get for forgetting my homework bennett touched her hand dont worry about it its the same question almost everybody on earth would have been asking himself do you think so she said doubtfully but she looked a little happier when they returned to the air they replayed the tape claiming responsibility for the attack for the reaction of the second irgun ibc correspondent jorge martinez visited the groups headquarters in buenos aires bennett said here is his report the tape filled the monitor screen along with a flock of other reporters martinez was standing in front of a gray stone building in a rundown part of the city out came a slight curlyhaired man with a mustache too big for his face and fierce everwatchful eyes the second irguns spokesman is known only as menachem martinez said quietly they watched menachem begin to read from a card he pulled out of his hip pocket we applaud the blow against the arabs who have stolen our homeland from us but we did not strike it that is all we have to say what proof do you have for your denial one of the reporters shouted menachem fixed him with an icy glare i have said that is all we have to say then with the air of a man making a great concession he went on had it been us we would have chosen itzhak zalman the apikoros who loves his masters better than his people and joined the arab team his time may yet come if not on mimas then when he returns he went back into the headquarters building slamming the door behind him not the most convincing denial on record rannveig commented hardly bennett said the only thing to say in its behalf is that the second irgun is not in the habit of ducking the blame for its terrorist acts the notorious baghdad bombings of a few years ago are a case in point if not the second irgun though who benefits from the killings savage as they were they have succeeded in embarrassing the arab world thanks to the disclosure of shukri alkuwatlys illegal suit there youre right rannveig bennett said cheating is almost as old as the olympics im afraid drug use and such things as electronically rigged fencing foils go back to the twentieth century alkuwadys suit is just the latest in a long line and one of the more ingenious it was discovered to have a gas vent opening in the small of his backin effect a small reaction motor to add to his speed down the runway with a surface gravity as low as mimas even a few extra centimeters per second could have been decisive yes alkuwatly would have been the leader at the end of the first day of competition rannveig said in the rash of speculation surrounding him however we shouldnt lose sight of the other two athletes who were slain our sincerest condolences go to the families and friends of dmitri shepilov and louisphilippe guizot who also fell victim in this savage attack as happens all too often in acts of terrorism it is the innocent who suffer rannveig agreed thats true not only of the men who died yesterday but also in a lesser way of all the athletes who came to mimas in hopes of victory and instead find themselves encompassed by tragedy for the competitors reaction to yesterdays events lets go to angus cavendish thank you rannveig the scotsman was sitting at the olympic village barwith me here is itzhak zahnan the arab world jumper who as you heard has been threatened by the second irgun also with them unmentioned but plainly visible was one of major katayamas security guards a sidearm on her hip cavendish said tell me itzhak what are your thoughts on the menacing statement read by menachem zalman ironically looked rather like a younger version of the terrorist leader but his face was more open calmer he spread his handsid sooner accept the present as it is than live in the dead past ive been threatened before you cant let it worry you or itll affect your performance spoken like a true competitor cavendish said let me ask this then how do you feel about what your teammate alkuwatly had done to his suit he was a fool zalman said flatly i knew nothing about that and i can still hardly believe it my own jumping suit conforms to every standard what good is a medal youve cheated to win aye thats a poser though theres some who dont care im sorry to say am i right in thinking youre doing your best to stay in condition during the delay in the jumping oh of course i cant go out on the ramp naturally but im doing both stretching and weight work the weight rooms have been packed whats the atmosphere there about what youd expectnervous after all none of us knows whether the person working out beside him is a killer zalman thought for a moment amended his last statement noone of us does youve put your finger on the true calamity of these games cavendish said olympics may have been disrupted before this but never by people connected with them thanks for joining us itzhak and best of luck when the competition resumes zalman nodded soberly i will take all the luck i can find thank you being who i am i need it he bounced away cavendish said wed hoped to have a member of the team from moscow with us but theyve all declined to speak on camera joining us instead is nikolai yezhov of siberia welcome and thank you for being with us today my pleasure yezhovs french had less of an accent than cavendishs short stocky and solid he looked formidable in his spotless white tunic with the cross of saint george on an embroidered patch on his left shoulder did ye know shepilov well cavendish asked not very im afraid aristocratic contempt showed briefly in the siberian eyes the muscovites always stick close to themselves not cultured er yes cavendish changed the subject in a hurry from a russianspeaker not cultured was the kind of insult that started fights the scotsman said what reaction have ye noticed among the athletes to word of alkuwatlys suit yezhovs smile seemed genuinely amused the only sin is to be found out is it not every question cavendish asked was getting him into trouble gamely he tried again after a glance at yezhovs fact sheet this is your first time off earth nay oh certainly i was a simple stereovision installer in kolyma by the sea of okhotsk a weekend skier i think the saying is when the little father honored me by including me on this years team aye just as ye say a weekend skier cavendish finally let himself smile the czars recruiting and training methods were notoriously effective and started at about age six a coincidence then that you took the siberian downhill championship four years ago and have held it ever since yezhovs expression was bland yes as a matter of fact or at least my first win the favored skier broke his leg in a fall opening the door for me how lucky for you cavendish sighed despite his best efforts yezhov remained opaque he might claim greater sophistication than his muscovite counterparts but he was no more forthcoming cavendish thanked him again for appearing then passed the show back to the studio with obvious relief rannveig handled the signoff well be returning you to your regular programming now she said stay tuned to this station for developments as they break when and if competition resumes of course youll see all of it here the monitor cut to a commercial glancing at it bennett said meanwhile our advertisers are out slitting throats because they just lost five hours of guaranteed high ratings i wish katayama had said more rannveig said adding with a curl of her lip he was so busy pointing out how none of this was his fault that i think he hardly cares whether he ever catches up with the killer if his precious satellite didnt show him anything hes got damnall to go on bennett said no wonder hes asked for copies of our tapes he paused i wonder think back to shepilov didnt it seem to you that hed spotted something in that split second before the laser got him what if he did our job is to report not to investigate theres still a bit of a different tradition left in the united states ive never had much of a chance to go ferreting things out but i think it would be interesting to try she shrugged if your idea of fun is trying to do the same thing the professionals are doing dont let me stop you but i expect ill have a better time with jozef than you will staring at tapes youre probably right bennett admitted rannveigs expression said she was sure she was right she detached her seat belt and bounded out of the studio faintly envious of her carefree attitude bennett made a copy of yesterdays event and fed it into a stereovision set in a way watching death for the second third or twentieth time was harder than seeing it when it actually happened there was always the dreadful futile impulse to cry look out bennett sped through the murder of alkuwady at fast forward the athlete from the arab world had never known he was in danger shepilov though bennett got up holding tight to the arm of his chair to keep from drifting to the ceiling he studied the hologram from several angles and became more convinced than ever that the muscovites arm motion had been deliberate and if it wasbennett interfaced the stereovision set with the big ibc computer it took several false starts before he got the machine to do what he wanted to give him a printout showing what section of mimas surface shepilov had been trying to point at the circle that came out shaded in the printout was north of the jumpers flight path much closer to the landing area than to the runway depressingly it was also about two kilometers across but bennett did not stay depressed for long major katayama had been grousing about trying to cover square kilometers bennett only planned to examine a bit more than three he checked his spacesuits systems with the caution of a neophyte then cycled through an air lock and bounded down onto the surface of the moon looking about he could almost have thought himself on luna dirty ice looked very much like rock and one set of jumbled craters much like another yet there were differences after all aside from the very low gravity the sun while still too bright to look at was hardly more than an incandescent point in the sky and one could never see several moons at once from lunanot natural ones enceladus dione rhea and orange titan all showed visible disks though none could compete with even the attenuated sun as a light source remembering angus cavendishs comments on the jumpers form on the runway bennett tried to stay as low to the ground as he could while he loped along even so his motion was swift and almost dreamlike he began to understand however dimly the feeling the athletes had as they soared into space the reporter steered by the inertial compass in his helmet to his surprise he saw people with lights moving about in the area he had decided to search one of them saw him too and came bounding his way a challenge rang in his earphones who the devil are you and what are you doing snooping around here bill bennett ibc he replied and added pointedly i might ask you the same question but the words were hardly spoken when he saw that all the people he was approaching wore the robinsegg blue spacesuits of security bennett eh the guard was close enough to peer through his faceplate so you are she admitted lowering her side arm i think youd better come talk to major katayama the security chief greeted bennett with a smile as chilly as mimas ice how did you find out where we were searching he demandedif one of my people has been blabbing i ll send him out here without a suit bennett explained his method he saw katayama relax slightly the broadcaster tried to retake the offensive suppose you tell me why you decided to look here i dont have to tell you a damn thing katayama said bennett was aware of how true that was it had been a good many years since what had once been called freedom of the press got more than lip service from officials public relations though still mattered katayama relented basically we used a more sophisticated version of what you did he said once we had autopsy data we could plot the trajectories of the beams that killed the three jumpers this is where the lines came together all the same we still have a couple of square kilometers to go over bennett hid his smile the security chiefs technique hadnt narrowed the area down much better than had his own any luck so far were still busy no bennett translated do you mind if i join you he asked after a brief hesitation the security chief shook his head suit yourself you might be lucky who knows katayamas people were working in pairs one would leap twenty or thirty meters off the surface shining a spotlight down onto the ice to light a large area for the other team member to examine the spots were brighter than the feeble sun and illuminated inky shadows that might otherwise have made perfect hiding places the security personnel also carried metal detectors without any such special gear bennett had to do the best he could using his helmet lamp and his eyes he quickly learned not to look straight down being mostly ice mimas reflected seventy percent of the light that struck it more than enough to dazzle there were enough minerals in the ice to give the terrain some color beyond pure cold bluewhite some chunkswas that the word bennett wondered or would rocks be betterwere grayish others brown the broadcaster nearly shouted for katayama when he saw a rusty streak but it had nothing to do with blood it was only a tiny inclusion of iron ore trapped for ages in the surrounding ice bennett squatted to peer into a cave he spied the edge of something green hidden almost out of sight he did not let excitement run away with him green beryllium compoundsemeralds if you likewere a fairly common part of the stew of light elements from which mimas had been made but if it was a crystal it was very large and regular excitement shot through bennett as he looked more closelyno crystal ever had writing on it he scrambled into the cave and reached down for it the cold bit at his gauntlets which were not as well insulated as his boots he did not mind though not when he was holding an expended heavyduty charge cube in his hands then he keyed his suit radio and security personnel converged as if drawn by a magnet they scoured the cave from one end to the other and discovered two more of the plastic cubes both better concealed than the one bennett had found katayama held out his hand for that one reluctantly bennett surrendered it its one of the standard sizes he said but not a type i know he was looking at what were presumably instructions on the side of the cube they were written in the roman alphabet but in no tongue he recognized whatever the language was it went in for wild combinations of consonants made in praha the security chief said he seemed more willing to be informative now that bennett had done something useful for him seeing that the name meant nothing to the broadcaster he actually unbent far enough to explain prague you would call it i think an eastern european brand then yes katayama fairly purred we have some interesting new questions to ask wouldnt you say you certainly do shepilov must have seen the light leakage here when the killer fired at alkuwady pity the cave roof kept the observation satellite from picking it up yes still we make progress katayama put his people back on the search to see if there was anything else to be found bennett helped for a while but lightning did not strike twice he headed back toward the olympic complex one disadvantage of spacesuits was the difficulty of getting out of earshot katayamas voice rang in his helmet as if the security chief were still standing beside him dont use this until you get clearance from me do you understand when bennett tried to ignore the order katayama snapped acknowledge acknowledged the broadcaster said sulkily but most of his pique had evaporated by the time he returned to the olympic village katayama had not said anything about poking around on his own when he got back to the studio he checked a list he already knew pretty well it confirmed what his memory told him most of the eastern european jumpers had had their turns toward the middle or end of the first days run they would not have had a lot of time to make any murderous preparations and there would have been enough people about so that they could hardly have counted on not being noticed when they went to use an air lock he frowned the conspicuous exception was jozef jablonski rannveig was not going to like hearing that unfortunately she was probably going to if not from bennett then from katayama if the broadcaster could follow his nose this far so could the security chief as it happened he got a chance to broach the subject when rannveig came over to share a table with him at dinner she bristled just as he had known she would he spread his hands placatingly im not telling you what i think only what i found he said and wondered whether he was lying but we can both guess what major katayama will make of it in his shoes id do the same who else would use an obscure brand of charge cubes made in prague but an eastern european someone trying to put the blame on one bennett made shushing motions she had spoken so loudly that heads had turned he said security men wont look at it like that they shave with occams razor do you know what your ah friend did after he jumped does it leave him in the clear no she said her voice low now and troubled he told me he went back to his room and fell asleep he was laughing at me he said id kept him awake too long the night before not good no rannveig said again bennett could see her wondering she had after all met jablonski only the other day but then she shook her head as if coming to a decision i cant believe it hes just tooopento kill from ambush and what about the tape from the second irgun they denied it he reminded her thats not like them usually theyre only too happy to take credit for their outrages but why would jozef want to kill any of the men who were shot she demanded whats the point what would it gain him what would it gain anyone he asked neither of them could find a answer bennett did not tell anyone but rannveig about the find north of the jumpers flight path and he had no reason to think she had noised it about nevertheless rumors of all sorts raced through the olympic village overnight at breakfast bennett heard claims that three different people had been arrested one of them was drinking a bulb of coffee not three meters from him at the time he also heard that jozef jablonski was a secret jew which probably would have infuriated the skier from gdynia that the assassin was a renegade ronin from japan now there was a delightful prospect he thought that moscow was about to declare war on siberia or the arab world or eastern europe or the chinese empirewhich it did not border but then moscow was always about to declare war on someone brachiating back to the studio bennett almost ran into itzhak zalman as they both slowed to avoid the collision the jumper winked and said so tell me have i been elected pope in there yet twice bennett said solemnly as the athlete burst out laughing he added some of them also have you as a member of the second irgun with menachems threat part of your masquerade he thought he saw zalmans amusement slip for a moment then told himself he was letting his suspicions run away with him pretty soon he wouldnt be able to look in a mirror and trust the face he saw how much the rumors about arrests were worth was proved when the second round of jumping was canceled again the program that went back to earth was correspondingly short because bennett had been muzzled there was next to nothing to say beyond repeating as many variants on the investigation continues as a skilled team of scriptwriters could concoct well theres the easiest day of work ive had in a while angus cavendish said when the shortened broadcast was over i think ill check out a suit and do a bit of walking about i havent had the chance to play sleuth like you bill where did you hear about that the scotsman laid a finger by the side of his nose a wee birdie told me a birdie in a security suit that was rannveig however you please cavendish grinnedcome with me if you care to and share the glory when we find the kern to blame for all this thank you but no whatever bill may fancy himself as im no detective cavendish turned to bennett are you game sherlock why not im at loose ends good nothing like a few brisk laps around the village to get the blood going bennett tried to swallow a groan that meant angus was going to run the legs off him the scotsman was older but he was also in better shape more used to spacesuits and had his bronze medal to prove himself a master at effective motion on mimas rannveig curse her was giggling as she left the studio the only exercise she was likely to get was more fun than anything you could do in a suit twentyfive laps suit ye cavendish asked when they were outside when they were by themselves they spoke english but his burr was still strong whatever you say bennett answered shall we be off men the scotsman bounded away bennett followed cavendish held back to let him stay close dont forget to kick up your oxygen flow he warned remember youre working hard i know bennett said his breath was loud in his helmet he would be panting soon cavendishs breathing sounded perfectly even in his earphones he gritted his teeth and tried to keep up but he kept bounding too high off mimas and metaphorically spinning his wheels while he waited to descend the view on the far side of the olympic village showed the moon as it had been for billions of years before men had come to it a giant lump of ice much bombarded by cosmic debris in its early days the far side of the village looked much like the near although it had nothing to match the big view window in the bar and although most of the air locks led out toward the competition site bennett hardly glanced at the enormous boxy structure as he puffed along behind cavendish the scotsman had gone around a good many times himself before he grunted what a queer thing that is and did his best to come to a quick stopnot easy with the velocity he had to shed still he did better than his companion who stumbled to a halt a quarter of a kilometer beyond him whats the matter pull a muscle bennett asked that would be funny to have cavendishs athletic body let him down but the scotsman answered nay lad nay and pointed at the side of the building following his finger bennett saw a ring of frost high on the wall he wondered if it indicated a problem but laughed at himself for the thought its probably been there since the village was built he said no cavendish said at once because i didnt see it when i was here as a jumper i made the laps then same as were doing now thats crazy nothing ever changes in vacuum are you sure you havent just forgotten i am cavendish sounded so positive bennett had to believe him bloody odd i call it with a shrug he resumed his interrupted exercise he shook his head the next several times the two of them bounded by the curious patch by the time they went back in to clean up though he seemed to have stopped worrying about it bennett on the other had was still chewing on it as he stepped out of the shower cubicle in his quarters that was a piece of plumbing that had required less adaptation to mimas conditions than he would have expected though a stream of warm air not gravity kept the water moving naturally the phone chimed while he was drying himself in his annoyance he forgot to cancel the video feed rannveig nodded appreciatively as good as i remembered more pleased than embarrassed he draped himself in his towel whats going on he asked adding i thought youd be with jablonski hes being questioned she said bleakly oh im sorry so am ii still think hes innocent but theres evidence that points at him and none leading anywhere else so what choice does katayama have i dont blame you for finding the charge cubes or anything childish like that and that reminds meyou really are turning into a firstclass troublemaker arent you am i how itzhak zalmans asked for political asylum he has my god with whom why with the chinese of all people i think the chinese coach must have been the first person he saw after he decided his cover was no good anymore his cover bennett floundered rannveig gave him an incredulous lookyou mean you dont even know he panicked when you told him there was a rumor about him being a member of the second irgunbecause it happens he is a member of the second irgun i will be damned bennett said that had never occurred to him i suppose katayamas grilling him too hed like to but the chinese coach hasnt let zalman out of her suite shes up on her hind legs over diplomatic immunity that wont last not in the face of murder bennett predicted he could understand the chinese coachs worry though no quarter was given on either side in the clandestine war between the arab world and the exiled israeli nationalists bennett dressed then called katayama the security chief came on the line after a delay of a few minutes his face was impassive but there was something like warmth in his voice and the fact that he was talking to bennett in person showed how the broadcasters stock had risen well mr bennett youve helped me twice now what can i do for you whats the story with itzhak zalman katayamas smile touched only his lips news travels quickly i see we have a recording in which he states he planned no violence only a loss of face for the arab world upon the disclosure of its slipshod security procedures the value of this statement of course remains problematical we would like to interrogate him in greater detail but ah ive heard bennett nodded what about jablonski about what you would expect he denies any knowledge of the killings says he was alone asleep and that if he were guilty he would have a better alibi a slight lift of one eyebrow showed how often katayama had ran into that sort of infinitely regressing logic bennett thanked him and let him go no point in using up his store of goodwill by keeping the security chief away from his job for half an hour there had been something else the broadcaster had been thinking of doing when rannveigs call drove it out of his head he snapped his fingers in annoyance trying to remember he was on the point of giving up when it came back to him he punched the chief maintenance engineers number he did not get the head of the engineering department that worthy had no reason to drop what she was doing on account of his call the assistant he talked to was a blond young man whose anzacflavored english was amusingly different from cavendishs he described the frost he and the scotsman had seen well check it out mate never fear dont get browned off the engineer said cheerily what was that bennett snapped sensitive to anything that sounded like a racial slur then he recognized the idiom nevermind he said lamely would you call me back when you find out what it was will do mate gday to you the screen went dead having done everything he could think of bennett settled down to wait for the return call he checked the computer for a listing of entertainment programs and found on one of the stereovision channels a docudrama he hadnt seen the show was based on the works of a great twentiethcentury author and harrowingly realistic characters got killed off one after another even the hero ended up in a cancer ward the blizzards made bennett feel colder than anything on mimas had he jumped at the chime of the phone switching off the stereovision was something of a relief the anzac engineer looked out of the screen at him thanks for the call mate bloody funny thing that he said unconsciously echoing cavendish is it dangerous bennett asked thats what i was worried about shouldnt be cant cipher out how the hell it got there thoughit wouldve taken enough outgassing to suck all the air from a set of rooms but weve had no exploding guests for which im bloody grateful i can tell you whose rooms would it have been ill have to check mate let me feed the outside wall coordinates into the computerhe turned away and fiddled with a keyboard for a minute or two here we go he said and gave bennett the name thanks said the broadcaster he had to stop himself from adding the anzacs infectious mate he broke the connection and went back to the stereovision docudrama with the nagging feeling he was missing something maybe something important there he could have kissed the ugly unshaven zek on the stereovision screen he broke a fingernail punching katayamas phone code the woman he talked to had been one of the security people closest to him when he found the expended charge cube she smiled and went to fetch her chief without any argument this time katayama took longer to come to the phone when he finally did he growled no matter what you think mr bennett i am not at your beck and call i am trying to do an important job and your interference does not help now and quickly what is it i beg your pardon bennett said sincerely but i wonder if you might answer me one question the security chief heard him out yes of course thats still true he said as if surprised anyone needed to ask i suspect it will be true two hundred fifty years from now too some things dont change now i wonder if youd tell me what possible importance there is to that he framed the last sentence as a request but it came out a command bennett explained as he did he half expected his jerrybuilt structure of logic and wild guesses to come crashing down on his head and leave him looking like an idiot katayama listened in silence not showing what he was thinking when bennett had finished the security chief ran a hand through his hair i take it you write thriller plots he said at last no below the cameras angle of vision bennett clenched his fists this was what he had set himself up for trying to help but katayama was saying i can find out quickly whether or not you are rightno small virtue in my line of work will you call me back the broadcaster asked tensely he knew he had had to do as he did but he hated the idea of being excluded as soon as things came to a head he still had too much of the old american reporters itch to be in on the action instead of just talking about it katayama on the other hand had no use for reporters unless they served his own purposes i make no promises mr bennett he said and hung up ing it was impossible to pace but bouncing off the walls floor and ceiling as rannveig had in the studio was not the worst way to get rid of tension bennett had worked up a good sweat by the time the phone chimed again hello he panted his disheveled appearance managed to wring a blink out of katayama what have you been doing the security chief asked then said at once never mind i am not interested in knowing i have called to tell you what you are going to do listen carefully bennett and rannveig took their places in the ibc studio when the red light on the camera flashed on bennett began a very pleasant good day to you out there wherever you may be there have been a number of important developments since we spoke with you last thats right bill rannveig said we expect this to be the last day of shortened coverage of the games the jumping should resume tomorrow the arrest of jozef jablonski has lifted a great burden of fear from everyones shoulders bennett agreed rannveig nodded a little glumly bennett went on the evidence against jablonski is overwhelming the site from which the killer fired from ambush has been discovered and the discarded charge cubes found there were manufactured in eastern europe it is most unlikely that anyone from another country would have had such an obscure brand in his or her possession moreover jablonski cannot account for his whereabouts at the time of the murders rannveig saidhe is currently being subjected to intensive interrogation and his confession is expected shortly by major katayama bennett said as you can imagine ladies and gentlemen the people most relieved are the athletes themselves for some of their reaction lets go to angus cavendish thank you bill the scotsman said as before he was sitting at the bargetting to be quite a fixture there bennett thought almost everybody there was watching the stereovision set in a corner of the room and thus at the moment watching themselves watching themselves for any news more reliable than rumor they depended on the ibc broadcasts as much as earth did cavendish alluded to that point id think almost all the athletes on mimas are tuned to us now along with the set here theres another in the weight room and of course in all the suites whos that with you angus rannveig said marge olbert the firstround womens leader tell me mademoiselle olbert what are your feelings now that an arrest has been made i am how does one say it full of relief she replied in halting french eager to jump again are you but yes naturally and i hope to do well it could be to win a medal her sudden and unexpected smile transformed a rather plain face into a pretty one and if i do at the least they will know what flag to fly for me when i am on the platform of the winners for monsieur zalman this is not true is it not so an interesting point you bring up lass cavendish had the minutiae at his fingertips as a matter of fact there is a precedent in the summer games of a woman from the united states defected to indonesia after the first two events of the modern pentathlon she won a silver and took it under indonesian colors ah marge olbert hesitated then went on i only hope they have arrested the right man this second irgun it is supposed to be very bad no if somehow there is a mistake that would not be good theres confidence itzhak zalman had naught to do with the killings cavendish said even if there werent hes been too closely guarded for his own protection to let him go off doing mischief i hope you are right the anzac jumper replied she left and cavendish interviewed several other athletes they were all of them polite but none said a great deal thats one of the abiding problems of sports journalism rannveig said when the show came back to the ibc studio the clichs were invented in the twentieth century and theyve been repeated ever since perhaps we can get a fresher perspective from a competitor with a different background bennett said he made the call he had set up the night before thank you for joining us again monsieur yezhov the siberian dipped his head in a courtly gesture of acknowledgment not at all he said his french excellent as usual would you care to give us your reaction to the arrest of jozef jablonski i was to be frank surprised he seemed a very decent fellow though i did not know him well yezhov paused considering his next wordsbut if he is truly the one who perpetrated these abominable deeds then i am glad to see him in custody i look forward to the recommencement of the games bennetts heart was pounding in the effort to stay natural are you he began then broke off at the sound of a knock on the outer door of yezhovs suite i shall ignore that the siberian said politely no need bennett assured him we dont want to inconvenience you when you are kind enough to talk with us well cut away and then come back to you when youre finished if your visitors business isnt too personal though perhaps you might leave the vision link open with us while you turn down the sound so we can tell when youre coming back a capital idea i shall do as you suggest yezhov reached out for the volume toggle then turned his back on the phone camera and glided toward the door instead of going to a commercial or a taped segment though the director kept the siberians image in the big screen behind bennett and rannveig welcome to those watching all over earth rannveig said quickly we apologize for starting our coverage late but at that moment the siberian touched the door control switch the door slid open a security guard thrust a pistol in yezhovs face half a dozen more including major katayama rocketed past him into his suite one doubled back to wrench the siberians hands behind him and clap manacles on him the rest began tearing the place apart somehow the impact of everything was greater because on the screen it all took place in silence at this moment you are watching the capture of nikolai semyonovich yezhov the assassin whose crime has marred these winter games rannveig went on im proud to say that my colleague here at the ibc sports desk bill bennett played a key role in yezhovs arrest how did that happen bill lets wait a moment before going on with the details rannveig he said modesty was not what held him back far from it he felt full to bursting with triumph but the story came first heres our camera crew arriving at yezhovs door lets watch as the security patrol searches the suite the picture on the screen behind the broadcaster shifted from the view out of yezhovs phone to one from the ibc crew one of the security women tore down a rug on the far wall of the suite to reveal a circular scar two meters wide cut in the metal and ceramic and inelegantly patched there you see how the killer avoided being spotted or perhaps even being captured at an airlock when he returned to the olympic village after he had committed his three murders he did not use the locks either to leave or enter the village complex instead he cut his way out of the building with a laser torch undoubtedly the same one he used to kill shukri alkuwatly dmitri shepilov and louisphilippe guizot once he had the opening cut out he simply jumped to the ice below and went to his ambush point of course rannveig nodded a fall of forty meters here is nothing the same as less than a half a meter on earth thats right and the return jump is the sameeasy for anyone in yezhovs excellent condition to go without being noticed all he had to do was close the door to his suite like all doors here its gastight so there would have been no pressure drop outside his rooms to give him away afterward sealing compound let him repair the damage hed done as we can see now where did he go wrong then over something he had no way to hide some of the water vapor and c that escaped from his suite condensed against the side of the building the slab hed cut out was free of the crystalsonce replaced it looked like a bullseye but it was on the side of the village away from the jumping where hardly anyone ever goes and even it they did theyd think the deposit of ice had been there forever angus cavendish knew better though i suppose he was also aided by siberias national colors rannveig said thinking fast on her feet his white spacesuit would have made him hard to spot both on the ground and from the observation satellite yes while they talked in the studio the security team was examining the case of the stereovision set in yezhovs room the ibc camera crew caught a technicians exclamation theres tampering here no doubt about it take it to the lab someone else said if theres more inside well have nailed down where he got his laser tube yezhov said he installed stereovisions in where was it kolyma rannveig remembered unhhunh bennett said that was something else that should have made us take a hard look at him but didnt why should it have rannveig asked the question was not just for the audience but for herself bennett simply had not had time to explain everything to her although she was coming through like a trouper he said kolyma was one of the biggest slavelabor camps in the days of the old soviet union from what ive been able to learn thats still true in czarist siberiaand slaves need guards both siberia and moscow he felt sure would censor this part of the broadcast but the rest of the world needed to know he would never have found out himself if he had not seen the show about aleksandr solzhenitsyn the day before on the screen behind the broadcasters nikolai yezhov directed an ironic bow toward major katayama his head being the only part of him still free to move my compliments he said with as much aplomb as if they had met at a banquet rather than as killer and captor i take it the announcement of jablonskis arrest was for my benefit and not sent on to earth katayama nodded brusquely you admit this then my dear sir at this stage of affairs what good would it do me to deny it the security chief grunted not much do you have anything to say before we deal with you may i request a lawyer both yezhov and katayama smiled at that the world was a harder place than it had been a couple of hundred years before having been caught the siberian could not expect to live long get on with it katayama told him yes how should i put it perhaps that i chose to strike a blow for holy mother russia against the godless marxists who still disgrace us all by holding moscow we in siberia have cast them down even china and eastern europe overthrew their ilk years ago i do not care if peace was sworn between us and them there can be no peace that led inevitably to katayamas next question if your fight was with moscow why did you also kill the other two and why cover your tracks now yezhov looked at the security chief as at any fool to avoid embarrassing my country of course too many people in the world would not understand how honor compelled me to act as i did at last something angered katayama when he answered bennett could hear in his words the revived tradition of bushido that had gone with japans emergence as a military as well as an economic power in the late twentyfirst century there is no honor in shooting men from ambush he said implacably he turned to the security people who held the siberian snapping get him out of here the camera crew followed them down the corridor and almost ran into the coach of the siberian team who came swinging from one ceiling handhold to the next like a desperate ape when he spotted the camera he almost threw himself in front of it he started speaking in russian a true measure of how upset he was he checked himself after half a sentence and began again in french i must say on behalf of siberia and the czar that what nikolai yezhov has done is the act of a solitary madman i condemn him as strongly as any man alive my heart goes out to the dear ones of the menall the menwhose deaths he caused our russian brothers of the peoples republic of moscow must know the firmness of the treaty of sverdlovsk he went on for some time after a while he began repeating himself but the director did not cut him off the chance that his apology might be heading off a war was too real to disregard and the urgency behind that apology made for incomparably dramatic stereovision the siberian coach finally finished and departed to give his condolences to his muscovite opposite number his head still hanging in shame the directors finger stabbed toward rannveig the camera in the studio swung her way she said once again the specter of nationalism has wounded the olympic games the games that should be the chief symbol of cooperation between nations nationstates have existed for more than six hundred years now if they havent yet learned to live together in that time will they ever i think that may be too dim a view rannveig bennett said your own united europe is a case in point and eastern europe and the arab world step by step we make progress but will it be enough he shrugged the only answer is that were here we havent managed to blow ourselves up quite and tomorrow in spite of everything the games begin again thats worth remembering you know cut the director said last favor this one is a thought experiment if you put people or animals in an environment where cold can kill them theyll adapt by becoming short and stocky with small appendages less vulnerable to frostbite look at arctic foxes and eskimos for instance if you put people or animals in an environment where heat can kill them theyll also adapt becoming long and lanky sometimes with large appendages to help radiate heat look at bigeared fennec foxes and the tutsi people for instance what i wondered was what happens if you put peopleit has to be people this timein an environment where stupidity can kill them jerome carver glanced at the enrico dandolos westfacing view panel it seemed awash with flame spectacular sunset the big black man remarked what else is new patrice boileau was the only other person in the tradeships control room she did not bother looking up from the screen where she was checking a computer subroutine youre spoiled carver said in mild reproof patrice shrugged therell be another one along tomorrow maybe i wont be busy then she was likely right carver thought with an oranger sun and thicker air than earths the whole world of ephar ran to glorious nightfalls and early mornings the towers and spires of the city of shkenaz silhouetted blackly against the glowing sky added a touch almost of arabian nights fantasy to the scene as the trader watched ephars sun slid below the horizon full darkness though was still some time away carver had no trouble spying the figure dashing from shkenazs walls toward the greenskin town outside or the mob at the fugitives heels he groaned oh god theyve caught a late one this time patrice did join him in front of the view panel of themselves her hands knotted into fists maybe hell make it she said if he gets back to his own kind before they catch him theyll let him goits not the gods will that he die this time if carver said grimly greenskin towns by law had to be more than three gibyats from the walls of a city say a kilometer and a half the trader thought he wondered what misfortune had stranded the luckless runner inside shkenaz so late he must have known the risk he was taking patrice stepped up the gain on the panel the distance between the fleeing green centauroid and his blueskinned pursuers seemed to swell but that was only electronic illusion run damn you run carver muttered it was no good a thrown stone made the greenskin stagger that was all the fastest members of the mob needed to catch him and drag him down bodies thrashed one of them not for long after a while realizing there was no sport left to be had the troop began walking back to shkenaz every so often a blue would spring into the air in sheer high spirits carver swung the westfacing camera to look at the greenskin village sure enough two or three males stood near the boundary stone they must have seen everything they made no move to retrieve what little was left of their fellow though they would not till morning if a blue patrol caught them coming out at night the whole village might die to expiate their sin with a wordless sound half fury and half frustration carver stabbed a finger at a button under the view panel the panel went dark three thousand years the trader said patrice had never been on ephar before three thousand years of what that carver waved to the blank view panel maybe even longer but three thousand years the locals have records for the separate villages the night ban the murders in the six months since the enrico dandolo had landed he had seen three now that accorded fairly well with the data other ships visiting the araite empire had gathered i dontwant to believe that patrice said believe it he told her the best part is under the code we cant do a damn thing about it either now she stared at him what why not no complainants traders rarely meddled in the affairs of worlds without spaceflight when they did they needed ironclad documentation mat a local group not only seemed oppressed but felt itself to be judging from a purely offplanet perspective was sensibly in most cases against the rules i dont believe it patrice exclaimed carver shook his head helplessly believe it its true never one in the two hundred years since tradeships have been coming here not the blues of coursewhy should they complain but not the greenskins either they just shrug and say they are all guilty by inheritance and deserve whatever the blues hand out to them they believe it as long as they believe it officially theres nothing we can do officially patrice said there was precedent for bending the code when it needed bending on ephar it looked to need more than bending i understand you carver ran a hand down his dark forearm reminding her of his race dont you think i of all people want to see the greenskins free the night ban is just the worst of a whole set of restrictive laws greenskins cant hold land they cant intermarry with the blues they cantoh a raft of things basically they live by their wits because thats all theyre allowed to own and he slammed the flat of his hand down on the console in complete frustration they wont do a damned thing about it youve tried my last trip in im not the only one either its never done a beans worth of good they wont take weapons they wont learn civil disobedience they arent interested in our trying to change attitudes among the blues theyrecontent and it drives me crazy i dont blame you a bit patrice said what are you going to do now keep trying what else carver tramped toward shkenaz a few puffy clouds floated in the greenblue sky the breeze was at the traders back and full of strange sweetnesses had it been blowing the other way it would have brought him the stink of the city only a long trampled swath of foliage abruptly ending showed what had happened the evening before as soon as the sun was up the greenskins had taken away their dead fellow carver felt his eyes keep sliding back to the mute evidence of violence walking along beside him lloyd michaels noticed carvers fellow trader did not miss much nothing we can do about it he said i know carver ground out he stopped to adjust his pack the straps were digging into his shoulders heaven knows weve tried it galls me though to watch a lynching and then deal the next day with the lord who condoned it i daresay we do that on a lot of primitive worlds and on a good many that arent michaelss face looked too round and pink and innocent for him to be as cynical as carver knew he was a fact he used to shameless advantage on every planet where the locals were sophisticated enough to try to read human expressions they dont usually get their victims to agree they should have been lynched the black man retorted there is that michaels agreed mildly if we knew how they did it we could make a fortune selling the secret offworld carver glared at him a little less than half sure he was joking im going to talk to nadab today he said at last old baasas pet greenskin sure go ahead i expect hell be there michaels cocked an eyebrow at his companion it wont do you one damn bit of good ill do it anyhow carver said he walked on looking neither to the left nor to the right plainly ready to ignore anything more lloyd michaels might say michaels kept his mouth shut the most annoying thing he could do the walls of shkenaz drew near the gates were open the guardsblues of courseleaned back their weight supported by hind legs and stiff thick tails they were bored carver thought somenot allof that boredom fell away as the traders drew near even though humans had been going in and out of shkenaz since the enrico dandolo landed they were still strange enough to be interesting the guards came forward and down onto all four running legs held spears across the entranceway to block the traders path with whom have you business in the city one of them demanded sternly carver studied the male as if seeing him for the first time centauroid was only a vague description of the locals body plan the guards hindquarters were not much like a horses and his upthrust torso even less like a mans his face was most alien of all with a wide toothless beak of a mouth twin nostril slits and insectile compound eyes the trader wondered how strange he looked in those eyes michaels said we meet today with the mighty lord baasa representative in shkenaz of the araite emperor may his reign be long and prosperous the guttural local language was made for sounding arrogant the guard swung up his spear pass then into shkenaz and may our governors graciousness shine upon you change the style of architecture and the shape of the inhabitants carver thought and shkenaz was much like any other primitive town on a preindustrial world intelligent beings needed places to live to trade to worship and arranged those places in fairly standard patterns differences though counted too because of the way the locals were made shkenaz seemed spacious to a biped like carver although the townsfolk probably would have disagreed few animals shared the streets with the natives who were strong enough to do their own hauling on a street corner a greenskin scribe wrote a letter for a blue another blue waited his turn carver pointed theyre polite enough now but i wonder how many wolf packs theyve run in after dark as many as they could i have no doubt michaels said by now most of the locals were used to seeing humans in town and gave them no more than casual glances the trumpetshaped ears of a farmer in town with a piece of scrap iron on his back though rose in surprise and his head whipped around to follow the traders as they walked toward the main market square the junk shop owner with whom he was dickering a greenskin took advantage of his surprise to close the deal on the spot carver who was in earshot when he did felt like cheering we got that fellow some extra silver there he said so we did michaels agreed we also may have got him in trouble some time down the line for cheating a poor honest yokel who had come into shkenaz to cheat him when youre a blue here you can afford a long selective memory for such slights black skin as carver had discovered had its uses he felt his cheeks go hot but his companion could not see him flush shkenazs central agora had the air of barely controlled chaos usual to marketplaces sellers loudly sang the virtues of sixlegged meat animals knives perfumes fruits grains pots of clay and brass wouldbe buyers just as loudly named them liars and thieves business got done all the same a bookseller waved a threefingered hand to draw the humans attention when he had it he held up a leatherbound codex illuminated by that painter from the eastern provinces whose work you like he called cajolingly do you want to stop carver asked not with baasa expecting us keep the powers that be happy first michaels turned to the waiting greenskin another time harhas we go now to an audience with the august governor of your great city harhas dipped his head may it be prosperous for you temples and shkenazs town hall fronted one side of the agora before the town hall as before public buildings in every town of the araite empire stood a statue of peleg peleg was the ancient king of a citystate somehow carver was not sure how no human was connected with the rise of the empire more than three thousand years before a greenskin had assassinated him greenskins had been paying for it ever since a servant was waiting outside the hall i am to take you to his excellency the humans followed him up the ramp a mosaic that ran the whole length of the wall showed in gruesome imaginative detail what had happened to pelegs murderer golden tesserae gave the work its title justice an artisan was replacing a few tiles that had fallen out of a particularly lurid scene the artisan was a greenskin nice to be reminded of where you stand in the publics esteem isnt it michaels murmured carver grunted too mortified for the greenskins sake to say a word baasas servant glanced back at them they did not translate for him locals most of them blues bustled by too intent on their own affairs even to notice the craftsman at work to carver somehow that was the worst part of the whole business the servant ducked into a chamber and emerged a moment later his excellency will see you now good day good day baasa rumbled from behind his desk as the humans came in an icon of the reigning emperor hung on the wall behind him a reminder of the power that sprawled halfway across this continent baasa needed no more than such a symbolic reminder to administer shkenaz he was shrewd and fairly able and if that did not suffice carver thought he had nadab the greenskin stood at a table to one side of his masters desk like most of his kind he had eyes a little larger than those of blues and ears of not quite the same shape still even taking skin color into account the visible differences between nadab and baasa were less than those between michaels and carver shall we begin carver said yes let us baasa answered nadab merely dipped his head a couple of centimeters to show he was ready the humans unslung their packs as with longdistance caravans on ancient earth trade goods worth hauling across lightyears had to combine low bulk and high value michaels went first he was a jeweler and offplanet baubles had grown popular on ephar over the years pearls sold especially well as they had no local equivalent while michaels and baasa haggled carver made small talk with the governors aide at last seeing baasa deeply involved in a hot dicker carver dared say i am sorry one of your people perished last night nadab it has happened before the greenskin said with a fatalism that never failed to chill carver it will happen again in the end we are the better for it as near as the trader could remember nadab had used exactly those words the last time a greenskin had died from missing the sunset curfew now though he seemed on the point of going on when baasa interrupted to ask how much of the kohath spice did we set as value for a shimmerstone the name the locals gave to pearlsof this size sir let me see it nadab walked over to michaels who held out the gem the greenskin examined it seven measures he said at once literally it came out oneone the locals used six as their counting base oh you thief baasa and michaels said together they pointed fingers at each other and laughed one had been claiming five the other ten neither though cared to argue with nadab the greenskin returned to his place when carver tried to pick up the conversation where the two of them had left off he deftly changed the subject a few minutes later another disputed point cropped up nadab settled it with the same quiet competence he had shown before at last michaels said thats about it for me your excellency why not let jerome take his turn very well baasa swung his unwinking gaze on carver what have you to offer me today knowledge itself carver replied in what he hoped was an impressive voice what could be more valuable to you and to the empire than knowledge it is by knowing many things after all that we humans learned the art of flying from star to star baasas ears quivered and came to attention you would sell the secret of your flying ship he demanded reading tone into an aliens words was always risky but carver thought he heard disbelief warring with greed before he could say anything nadab broke in my lord if he makes that claim he seeks only to befool you we lack too many of the mechanic arts known to his people to hope to duplicate what they can do the araite empires technology was about on a par with that of rome in earthly history like the romans also the locals were more sophisticated intellectually than they were with thenhands knowing there were things one could not do was a realization many societies never reached carver dipped his head to nadab and turned back to baasa your esteemed counselor is right of course your excellency the governor gestured impatiently i pay the greenskin to be right what good is he to me if he is wrong so you cannot tell me how to fly eh what knowledge do you sell then knowledge that will put you on the road to learning such things for yourself and that will show you the direction that road takes riddles baasa muttered local science again like romes was of two sorts collections of random facts with little theory unifying themwhat passed for chemistry was like that and more common huge forests of speculation springing from an acorns worth of knowledge medicine and physics were both tarred with that brush not so carver said here for instance he drew from his pack translations of galileo bacons novum organum and his prize an edition of on the origin of species with its concepts intact but examples drawn from ephars biology none of the three was so far beyond local thought as to be incomprehensible taken together they ought to stir things up a good deal that was what carver had in mind the best way to help the greenskins he had decided was to change the society of which they were a part it was slower than more open forms of aid but in the long run much more certain baasa was working through the summaries printed on the flyleaves of the books see what you think nadab he said passing them on to his aide he turned back to carver give me a price the ideas may be interesting though the style is rather flat carver winced he hoped that was a ploy to knock down the price but suspected that it was not some good linguists and computer people had put his translations together but it took more than competence to be elegant in a language not ones own it took inspired genius and joseph conrads did not come along every day or every century either nadab read faster than baasa he set the books on the table in front of him quite abstract he said still if they are affordable perhaps you might seek to acquire them as curiosities yes perhaps so the governor agreed curiosities they certainly are well trader what do you say to five measures of bulun powder apiece for them your excellency who is esteemed throughout the empire for his generosity is pleased to joke with me carver was appalled for a couple of reasons the first was the paltry offer the translations had not come cheap fifteen measures of bulun powder would not begin to pay off what they had cost him even lloyd michaels who had kept out of his fellow traders dicker till then was moved to protest surely savants throughout the empire should have the chance to learn of these ideas for themselves and you your excellency carver said to baasa and your assistant deserve the credit you will gain for being the first to pass this new knowledge on to your people baasa swung his head nadabs way nadab said quickly i deserve no credit i am but a greenskin all that i have i owe to my lord the governor without him i am as nothing nor do i seek any acclaim for aiding him in any way i can the hell of it was carver thought that he sounded as if he meant it he would have been much easier to deal with were he only mouthing polite phrases nadabs selfeffacement out of the way baasa proved a little more interested in dealing he upped his offer to eight measures of bulun powder a book then to ten which was about half what carver needed to break even when at last he got up above ten measures the haggling turned serious baasa said twelve measures then and four parts and three parts of parts twelve and threequarters by your reckoning nadab said to carver while the trader was still wrestling with the fraction that needed converting he ruefully shook his head and stuck his calculator in his hip pocket if nadab felt like showing off that was fine with carver in the middle of the dicker a servant poked his head into the chamber and said to baasa your pardon excellency but the delegation from asnah has arrived oh a pestilence i did not expect them until tomorrow i suppose i must formally greet them as protocol requires the governor started to walk out then turned back to warn carver think not that i shall forget where we stand seventeen and three parts per volume and i doubt you will squeeze another measure from me and a half that is nadab supplied as baasa hurried away yes of course carver said abstractedly he had baasa gauged now and did not think he would end up losing money nadab though was harder to figure may i ask a question without fear of giving offense he said to the greenskin how can seeking to learn give offense carver could have named twenty different ways from twenty different worlds but forbore he said only i hoped you might see the advantage to your people of helping to spread enlightenment in the empire that you do not surprises and disappoints me if you have some reason i cannot see i would be grateful for your telling me what it is the greenskin was some time silent the trader could make nothing of the steady gaze that met his at last nadab said you tread on overgrown ground outlander be careful lest you stumble carver waited something like a sigh hissed through nadabs nostril slits he picked up the adaptation of on the origin of species and turned it over and over in his hands again he was a long time finding words when he did speak he sounded as if he was choosing them carefully i did not know oudander that this notion of change over time was familiar to your people carvers eyes slid to michaels his comrade was staring back at him of all the things he had thought he might hear this was the last he said i did not know the folk of the empire had come across it either he started to go on then stopped anything he said might be wrong but no one in the couple of centuries of fitful contact between ephar and the universe outside had had any clue that the locals were within lightyears of developing the concept of evolution ah yes the folk nadab murmured carver thought he heard irony in the locals voice and warned himself not to let his sympathiesor his imaginationrun away with him then abruptly he was sure he had not in the language of the empire folk and blue sprang from the same root excitement flowered in him he had brushed against something more important than bulun powder here he was sure of it tell me he said have you greenskins writings of your own ones the folk of the empirehe used the term with deliberate emphasisknow nothing about if nadab said yes to that but he did not he only asked outlander how could it possibly matter to you if for no other reason then as trade items carver said before the words were out of his mouth he knew he had made a mistake nadabs eyes might be unreadable but there was no mistaking the finality with which he said i see little point to discussing what are in any event shadows the trader cast about for a way to put things right nadab stonily rebuffed his efforts baasa came back assuring that the subject would stay closed distracted carver ended the dicker too soon the city governor fairly glowed with selfsatisfaction he did not often get the better of a bargain with humans if i may suggest something excellency nadab said yes go on say what you mean baasa was in a magnanimous mood you have been gracious enough to speak kindly of my prose style inadequate though it is perhaps before you release these works to learned males all over the empire i might do my poor best to make them conform to the rhetorical standards such publication requires a capital suggestion baasa exclaimed see you to it nadab only make sure you proceed with it i would not want the works long delayed certainly not excellency it was all perfectly smooth perfectly respectful and from the locals point of view perfectly sensible somehow though carver was sure that whatever sprang from nadabs pen would be flawed not obviously flawed maybe or no one would look at the books at all but with enough errors to keep them from having the influence for which hed hoped he could not say that out loud not with no proof not with the greenskin enjoying his overlords deserved confidence but for whatever reasons nadab was plainly unenthusiastic about letting real science come to the attention of the empire as a whole if carver had been frustrated before about the way greenskins acted now he was bewildered as well and more man a little annoyed he did what he could saying if you have any trouble with the concepts in the books nadab please feel free to call on us humans for help that is generous of you the greenskin said if i encounter difficulties be sure i shall consult you i believe however that my grasp of what is after all my own language should prove adequate to the task what task do you have in mind carver said but in trade english so that only michaels understood well of course we havent had a great deal to do with the greenskins captain chen remarked that evening over tea and cakes she was a tiny very competent woman whose size belied her strength of will she went on they arent rich enough to trade with the likes of us some of them must be michaels said nadab has been baasas righthand man for years are you telling me he hasnt spent some time lining the pockets he doesnt wear i would doubt that myself the captain said dryly so would i carver agreedbut even if he has he doesnt dare show it what do you suppose happens if somebody in a greenskin village starts looking too prosperous the blues come out and burn his house down around his ears michaels supplied and probably his neighbors houses too just on the off chance that theyre thinking wicked thoughts about living above subsistence level youve got it carver said we have tapes to prove it it doesnt happen very often though the greenskins have been pariahs for a long time now they know how to lay low pariah isnt quite the right word captain chen said precise as usualthe greenskins play an important part in local society shopkeepers scholars artisans merchants they arent menials by any means so long as the sun is in the sky carver said they arent menials after dark eithertheyre fair game still i take your point its just because of the role they play that i wondered if they have a literature of their own from the way nadab clammed up about it youd have thought jerome asked him how many blue children hed eaten lately michaels added the captain pursed her lips interesting she said judiciously but im not sure how important it is something odd is going on there carver insisted nadab knows about evolution and none of the natural philosophers among the blues does id lay money on that the other thing michaels said is that he didnt want them knowing about it either carver gave him a grateful look so you saw that too interesting captain chen said again the more enlightened the more scientifically oriented a society is the less the inclination it usually has for harassing its minorities at least openly youd think nadab would grasp that i think perhaps he does carver said slowly michaels parted company with him there thats crazy jerome nobody wants to be persecuted forever till my first trip to ephar i would have said the same thing carver scratched his head but if the greenskins dont they certainly hide it well and i dont just mean nadab none of them seems interested in changing the way things are they are a small minority the captain said and very vulnerable because of that they must know it thats true enough carver admitted ive never seen a greenskin id call a fool hardly michaels agreed a greenskin who was a fool wouldnt live long but still carver said yes but still captain chen said yes it is a puzzle if it can be arranged so as not to disturb the imperial authorities in shkenaz you might pay a visit to the greenskin village theres no profit in it michaels said money and profit are not always the same thing the captain said the locals faces did not show many emotions a human could read but the set of the blue guards ears and the way they only stood aside at the last moment for carver to pass told the trader plenty about what they thought of his having anything to do with greenskins nadab came out past the village boundary stone to meet carver it was safe enough local noon had only just passed the greenskin waved a hand welcome outlander shall we stroll whatever you wish of course the trader said falling in beside nadab after a little while he asked casually how are you coming with your ah editing of the volumes baasa acquired nadab did not miss a beat well enough carver shook his head in rueful admiration the greenskin was as polite as he was uninformative they went into the village carver had walked past it many times and seen it from the enrico dandolos view panels but he had hoped actually being in it would give him some new perspective on the way greenskins lived their lives he found himself disappointed the houses were as hed already known they were old not especially prosperous but on the clean side by local standards some elderly males stood in the village square they crowded around to get a good look at carver females and children peered from doorways most of the adult males in their prime were working in shkenaz also in the square was something carver did not remember noticing a statue of peleg maybe he thought he had not wanted to see it before he pointed at it why do you have this here to remind us of our shame it was a chorus from all the greenskins in earshot even the youngsters carver realized he must have asked a ritual question the humiliation drilled into each succeeding generation chilled him was this he wondered why the greenskins never questioned their oppression he doubted it surely some rebels would arise to challenge the way things were or would they he was thinking in human terms the strange smells on the breeze the proportions of the buildings around him even the ruddy quality of the light reminded him that those did not apply here in all his dealing with the locals he had never felt them so alien as they seemed in this quiet little square lost in his thoughts he missed something nadab had said your pardon i pray i said also to remind us of our separation baasas aide carver knew was the most prominent greenskin attached tonot inshkenaz that did not keep several of the old males from hissing at him in angeror was it alarm the trader frowned nadab had told him something important the only trouble was he was not sure what he found no easy way to ask straight out maybe changing the subject would let him come back later he said to nadab i must tell you how much i admire the wisdom you and your people display this time the murmurs from the old males were gratified you are most kind nadab said he pointed toward the enrico dandolo our ignorance is all too manifest when set beside such achievements as that we are not the proper comparison though are we carver asked i was thinking of how much more you know than say the most learned blue savants of the empire the shot was blind but it hit silence slammed down in the square from far off carver heard a flying hunter screech as it swooped down on something in the notquitegrass the old males waited for nadabs lead nadab did not seem inclined to do much leading at last the greenskin said come wander with me we will i suppose we must discuss this further one of the old males spoke in harsh protest almost too fast for carver to follow nadab said be still ithamar the need is here this has been spoken of among us as you know the time is not yet ripe ithamar insisted and i say it is who has the broader perspective you or i ithamar lowered his head and bent his forelegs in respect may you be right he said he still did not sound as though he thought nadab was the rest of the old males left the square the building nearest the statue of peleg was larger than the rest in the greenskin village and did not look like a home carver guessed it might have the same sort of importance in the village that the local governors hall did in shkenaz pointing at it he asked is that where your people keep the books you do not show the blues i have never said there are such books nadab said the trader felt his shoulders sag whatever nadab was contemplating it was not simply opening up to him too bad will you show me what is in there carver persisted presently presently was that amusement in nadabs voice greenskins seldom seemed amused they seldom carver thought had much to be amused about nadab went onnow as i said we will wander having no choice the trader wandered the village did indeed remind him of a moderately poor chunk of shkenaz set outside the city walls it seemed quieter than such a chunk but that the trader thought could just have been because shkenazs big central marketplace went a long way toward making the whole town raucous you see nadab said that we are no threat to outbid baasa for your goods you might well be could you compete fairly with his kind what is fair nadab said sounding surprisingly like a sixlimbed pilate unlike the roman procurator he undertook to answer the question at least metaphorically fair is that all advantages have corresponding disadvantages to make up for them the reverse also has to be true carver said harshlyyour disadvantages are all around me where are the offsetting advantages those i do not see well we are still just walking about nadab said he dipped his head to a male coming by good day to you kohath how does it fare in the city much as always nadab compound interest is such a painful mystery to those caught in its toils kohath turned the corner carver heard him open a door on few worlds the trader thought would a banker live so modestly he wondered if that was one of the mysterious advantages of which nadab had spoken he doubted it no one on ephar made a virtue of abstaining from worldly goods more males were coming back from shkenaz now carver glanced at the sky the sun had slid a long way down toward the west the trader was surprised when nadab led him out past the boundary stone and into the fields again by the look of things so were the blues who made up the guard squad they muttered among themselves as the greenskin and carver walked by is this safe carver asked he wished he had his stunner he hadnt thought hed need k michaels he knew would have something sharp to say about showing that kind of confidence on an alien world but nadab seemed unconcerned safe enough so long as i am back within the village by sunset being busy so much either here or within the walls of shkenaz i have too few chances simply to amble this way when one comes i make the most of it traveling as he often did for weeks at a time cooped up inside a metal shell carver understood that sentiment down to the ground he said quietly thank you for sharing the moment with me not to do so would be unjust to the one who made it possible nadab said he looked from carver to the enrico dandolo a few hundred meters away and of course would be inappropriate as your people have posed the problem now facing me on behalf of mine the trader grew alert now we come down to it he thought he said we have never intended anything but good for greenskins nadab we want to end your oppression if we can that is why then you offered baasa the volumes you did certainly why else who could say judging beings so strange a nice way to remind me carver thought that im as alien to nadab as he is to me and a point worth getting across nadab went on i thought perhaps your purpose was to destroy my entire people carver stared there are times when no matter how well one speaks a language not his own he will hear something understand it perfectly and still doubt his ears this was one of those times the trader spread his hands in a gesture of confusion we wish your folk nothing but good nadab we think it wrong for you to be forced into separation on account of the color of your skin my own racehe touched the dark brown skin of his arm has too much of that in its own past save for your being green and baasa blue we know your kind and his are no different it was nadabs turn to look sharply at the human you know that do you he astonished carver by throwing back his head and letting out the strangled snorts that served the locals for laughter whats funny the trader demanded a bit angrily only that i came close to confusing skill with wisdom a mistake i thought myself too wise for the oblique reply did little to soothe carvers temper nadab said never mind i see you bear me and mine no malice ignorance we shall cope with we have before often enough the calm confidence with which the greenskin spoke only nettled carver further somehow nadab had put the shoe on the other foot and the trader did not care for it he was unused to being forced into the role of ignorant outsider with the local as sophisticate i think we can return now nadab said he still sounded carver thought quite full of his own importance and then as he turned that note vanished from his voice or perhaps not carver looked back toward the greenskin village the blue guards had spread into a line between him nadab and the buildings what are they doing the trader asked but even as he spoke he knew his glance went to the sun not much daylight was left nadabs head swung in the same direction then back to carver yes outlander it is exactly what you think if i am not on the other side of the boundary stone by sunset but thats murder carver burst out immediately afterwards he felt like a fool hunting down any greenskin outside his village when the sun went down was murder he had seen that in gruesome telephoto from the safety of the enrico dandolo somehow though it had not occurred to him that even that violence might be perverted further by deliberately keeping a greenskin from reaching sanctuary nadab with three thousand years of tradition to guide him had no such naivet he said it happens from time to time it happens now all that remains to be seen is whether they are out for their own amusement or have something more in mind he walked slowly toward the blue guards they held their line positioning themselves so he had no chance of breaking past them back into the village carver stood where he was feeling extraordinarily helpless he wished he were carrying a kalashnikov to mow down the blues who were waving clubs and spears and yelling threats at nadab the greenskin said loudly let me by baasa will not be pleased to learn i have come to harm at your hands strangled snorts came from the blueswell take our chances on that one shouted thats what you think said another carver saw nadabs shoulders sag such was what passed for a greenskins power in shkenaz if nadabs patron tired of him he was as much at the mercy of the blues as was the lowliest greenskin tinsmith a small crowd of greenskins had gathered just on the safe side of the boundary stone they watched and waited making no move to help nadab carver was sure they would not the whole village stood hostage to the blues of shkenaz everyone knew it greenskins and blues alike the ritual of death would be played out with no interference the lower edge of the local suns red swollen disk touched the western horizon the blues sidled forward in a couple of minutes nadab was theirs in perfect legality he drew back a few paces toward carver not that running would do him any good or would it that retreat that pathetic reflex of life trying to prolong itself even to no purpose broke the traders horrified paralysis nadab he shouted the greenskin kept his eyes on the blues but his ears twisted toward carver the trader yelled run for our tradeship nadab stood motionless for another long moment he had carver thought been so sure of his imminent death that he needed time to realize he might live yet then he whirled and dashed toward the enrico dandolo carver slower on two legs than the greenskin was on four but also closer to the ship began to run too the blues shouted in outrage they were bound in the same web of custom as nadab though and hesitated before giving chase a sliver of sun still glowed above the horizon then it was gone and they came pelting after nadab and carver the trader heard their threetoed feet pounding behind him his chest felt on fire he was not very young and not very light and not at all used to sprinting crosscountry he did not want to think about what would happen if he stepped in a hole or tripped over a bush the blue guards might keep right on after nadab on the other hand they mightor some of them might which would be just as baddecide to stop and kill him he hoped that would stay just a thought experiment he had no desire to test it empirically he also hoped people on the enrico dandolo were alert the groundlevel hatch was closed if it didnt open in the next few secondshe was less than a hundred meters from the ship now only a few meters behind nadab and not nearly far enough ahead of his pursuersthings would get embarrassing theyd get a great deal worse than that for the greenskin the hatch slid upward relief sobbed through carvers throat go on he yelled or rather croaked to nadab the greenskins toes clicked on metal a moment later carvers boots clattered inside the cargo bay the hatch came down much faster than it had risen none too soonone of the blues was close enough to the enrico dandolo to hurl his bludgeon after nadab it belled off the descending door then the guards were pounding on the hatch with clubs and fists the din was tremendous carver stood with hands on knees his head lowered trying to catch his breath nadab was panting too but looked around the cargo bay with lively interest the fluorescent strips in the ceiling proved particularly intriguing not fire yet they give light he said have you then imprisoned glowfliers behind that glass no surely not he corrected himself too bright for that they work by the same power as our calculators carver told him if the trader had expected a surprised outburst he did not get one ah interesting was all nadab said carver had no chance to take things further the inner door to the compartment came open people burst in shouting questionsmostly variations on what the hell is going on carver explained the crewfolk shouted in anger the way the empire treated greenskins was abominable enough without cheating them besides patrice boileau burst out we should up ship now and have nothing more to do with these savages that would not solve the problem nadab said abrupt silence fell in the cargo bay punctuated only by the banging from the blues outside it was not so much for what nadab said as for how he said it given the limits of his lipless beak his trade english was as fluent as anyone elses in the compartment captain chen as befitted her station recovered her wits first we did not know you spoke our language she said adding a moment later we did not know anyone on ephar did i doubt any blues do nadab said again in trade english the humans looked at one another lloyd michaels said to carver seems we were on to something there back in shkenaz a few days ago so it does the black man said so you were nadab agreed captain chen drove for the heart of the issue asking why do you choose to reveal this to us now because at last i am convinced you do mean well for my people nadab sounded as if the question had surprised him jerome carver here would not have risked himself to save me were it otherwise but that strangled protest came from everyone in the compartment at the same time carver managed to articulate it ever since we came to ephar nadab we humans have been working to better the lot of you greenskins and help you take your full rightful place in the empire what makes you think those two things are one and the same nadab asked the only flaw in his speech carver thought was that he sounded pedantic he thought about that then reconsidered another flaw was that the greenskin made no sense at all patrice might have been reading his mind how could you not want to be free from persecution she demanded of nadab how many of you have died for the sake of hatred many very many nadab said answering the second question first we believe though that they let us atone for a murder by one of ours long ago a murder that was surely the stupidest thing a greenskin ever did and so they are not in vain i dont follow that patrice said carver nodded he found it tragic that such a clever being as nadab should be trapped like a fly in superstitions cobweb in any case michaels said a cargo bay is hardly the place for this kind of talk what say we go up to the control room good captain chen said briskly from there we can also tell the blues outside to go away and that nadab is under our protection that is very generous the greenskin said but what makes you believe they will listen to you theyll listen the captain said her voice grim come along she led them up the spiral stair to the control room you halfbuilt beings have an easier time of this than i nadab complained he had to twist his body awkwardly all the way up the stairs and slowed patrice and carver who were behind him captain chen stalked over to the intercom flipped a switch to channel it through the outside speakers get away from our ship she roared to the blues below the volume control was all the way to the right she must have sounded like an angry god she went on nadab is under our protection we do not allow you to harm him one of the blues ran hurrying back toward shkenaz the rest stayed where they were though for upwards of a minute they simply stood in place giving up their pounding on the cargo hatch carver thought the noise had stunned them more attuned to the subtleties of his peoples body language nadab said they do not believe their ears when the blues did regain their tongues he was quickly proved right but the greenskin has violated his parole a guard shouted and even the humans could hear his incredulity he is now ours to do with as we wish he is not captain chen declared still at the top of her electronic lungs you forced him to stay outside his village past sunset otherwise he would not have what has that to do with it the blue yelled back the act is all had the gods wished him to live they would not have let us detain him oh shut up captain chen snarled but in trade english she clicked off the intercom and the outside mike let them scream their fool heads off out there eventually theyll get tired and go away no they will not nadab said well then let them have their fit they cant hurt the ship and now the captain pointed at the switchedoff intercom they cant bother us any more either she folded her arms across her chest glowered at the greenskin now perhaps you will start making sense of yourself i am more curious about what you intend doing with me nadab said how you answer our questions will make a difference in what we decide you know carver told him the greenskin considered yes that has some truth to it very well ask what you will despite the invitation the control room stayed silent a moment patrice spoke first working as she did with computers she was used to breaking down questions into the smallest possible pieces she said why did you say bettering your peoples lot was not the same thing as taking an equal part with the blues in the life of the empire because we better ourselves precisely by not taking an equal part nadab replied at once riddles michaels said carver just suppressed an urge to kick him in the shin riddles have answers captain chen said sharply she glared at michaels who looked away even the boldest man thought twice about risking her anger she turned back to nadab go on i would think the matter obvious the greenskin said as carver showed me you people grasp the concept of lifes changing over time depending on the circumstances brought to bear upon it evolution carver supplied if that is your word i have not met it before we have been aware of it for something close to two thousand years ourselves the humans stirred longer than we have michaels muttered this time no one shushed him he went on our arts were at a much higher level when we first thought of the notion of evolution than yours are now to say nothing of what yours must have been so long ago if what you say is true how did you learn of it so quickly and what does it have to do with the greenskins plight captain chen asked nadab opened and closed his hands several times are you all blind he said in the local language this time he returned to trade english think what restrictions have applied to us greenskins since the one we never name slew peleg and fled under cover of darkness thats why they dont let you out at night carver said yes of course nadab said impatiently can you not answer a question without being diverted down a double handno excuse me you would say half a dozensidetracks carver threw the greenskin a curious look he saw he was not the only one doing so always before on ephar he had felt himself more able more sophisticated than the locals now though nadab seemed in control of things not any human taking turns carver and his companions spelled out the prohibitions greenskins had to endure no intermarriage no owning land all the rest enough nadab said at lastyes he was in controlwhat sort of lives do we lead then as a result of all this narrow ones carver told him forgive me but that is the truth as we humans see it you are restricted to a tiny handful of trades among the many in the empire and insecure in your hold on those because you are so vulnerable to the blues the rest of the people in the control room nodded carver pointedly added as the events of the day have shown all true but all i fear superficial nadab said the key is in the sort of the chime of the phone from the weapons turret interrupted the greenskin like all weapons officers anastas shumilov always stood his watch there rather than in the control room so he could aim the guns by hand if the electronics were damaged shumilov said captain forgive me for interrupting but a fairsized mob is coming this way no one had been paying attention to the view panels oh dear me michaels said or words to that effect i guess that blue guard wasnt just running away patrice added her comment though less colorful than michaelss was as inadequate blues with torches blues with clubs blues with spears were streaming out of shkenaz toward the enrico dandolo carver started to worry when he saw locals in bronze helmets if soldiers were part of the crowd it all too likely had official sanction his concern doubled when he saw blues hauling stout timbers of the sort they would think able to batter down the outer cargo bay door and doubled again when he spotted baasa near the rear of the mobofficial sanction indeed nadab said if you thwart them over me they will surely turn on my peoples village carver was sure bitter experience informed the greenskins words no they wont captain chen ground out she spoke to shumilov wait until the frontrunners are within fifty meters of the ship then hit em with the searchlight aye aye the weapons officer wasted few words a minute later the view panels lit up bright as day suddenly the blues torches seemed feeble and insignificant not the frightening harbingers of fury they had been blazing in the darkness the locals came to a ragged halt captain chen clicked on the outside speakers go back to your city her amplified voice roared the greenskin nadab is under our protection we will not let him be harmed that blunt announcement set the blues screaming again they started to surge forward the captain said do you need to be reminded of what our weapons can do the surge collapsed tradeships had used their guns a couple of times on ephar the most recent occasion had been seventyfive years before after that imperial authorities forbade attacks on offworlders they were too expensive to be worthwhile but the locals were still anything but happy give us the greenskin they shouted let us finish him searchlight or no weapons or no the blues hauling the makeshift ram began moving forward captain chens jaw tightened carver understood her dilemma opening fire on the mob not only would ruin the enrico dandolos trading mission it also would cause endless red tape when the ship got back to civilization not opening fire though would be seen as weakness and there was always the horrible off chance the locals really could break in not every ship got back to civilization to worry about red tape while the humans watched the head of the mob nadab spotted several blues slipping away from the rear as i thought he said they will avenge me upon my village what no they wont relieved at finding an action she could take captain chen snapped an order to shumilov give me a few rounds of tracers shoot to miss but show them they cant have the greenskins tracers aye machine guns hammered they made an ideal weapons system on pretechnological worlds being both raucous and spectacularly lethal lines of glowing red reached across the night the locals abruptly lost interest in going any closer to the greenskin village the blues with the ram looked to be having second thoughts too baasas retinue pushed through the mob so the local governor could confront the enrico dandolo he seemed dubious about the honor of that but spoke up as boldly as he could send nadab the greenskin out to us and we will go home having broken our strongest law he must face justice no was all captain chen said carver gestured for the mike the captain gave it to him he said the toughs outside the village deliberately kept nadab from returning in good time whats more id guess they did so at your orders now you say he has broken the law how do you have the crust to call that justice it is our ancient way by which we and the greenskins have always lived the excuse is nothing the act all if nadab was out of his village he must atone for his guilt as i predicted he would say nadab told carver rage ripped through the black man he spoke into the microphone againit is not our ancient way and we do not accept it go back into shkenaz leave usand nadabat peace you have seen we own the power to enforce our demands go back to your homes all of you there is nothing for you here carver switched off the mike captain chen eyed the view panel hardly any of the blues outside were going home but they were not advancing on the enrico dandolo and they were not heading for the greenskin village the tracers had effectively discouraged that good enough the captain said for shumilov she added use the guns to keep them where they are but dont fire into the mob itself without my order aye aye the weapons officer said and fell silent again he talked as if he were afraid his pay would be docked for every surplus word he used the blues kept milling about without doing anything much except beginning to argue among themselves stalemate captain chen said sounding pleased with herself eventually theyll get bored and leave us alone she turned to nadab where were we when that mess started they will not get bored they will not go away the greenskin said in much the same tone carver thought as he would have said the sun will come up tomorrow nadab went on as for where we were i was remarking that the key to our problem lies in the sort of occupations in which we are permitted by law to engage carver admired the way nadab instantly repaired the broken thread of conversation the trader started to tick off greenskin jobs on his fingers scribe banker jeweler shopkeeper you need not go through the entire catalog nadab said with a sting in his voice that lloyd michaels might have envied far simpler to notice what they have in common again carverand he saw his companionsdanced to the greenskins tune carver rubbed his chin as he thought before anything occurred to him patrice said we were talking about this a while ago jerome remember more than any other locals the greenskins live by their wits exactly for the first time nadab seemed satisfied with the humans he was facing he spread his hands in an expansive gesture then let them drop again when no one picked up what was plainly a cue surely you can extrapolate from what you know we know many things captain chen said shortly she was losing patience her wave encompassed the control room which anyone on ephar was centuries from matching what in particular applies to you when i learned you knew of evolution i did not think i would have to be so elementary nadab said so there carver thought the greenskin resumed if you are raising livestock and desire a larger beast what do you do breed the largest ones you have to each other michaels gave the obvious answer sounding as if he were humoring the greenskin then breed the largest of the next generation to each other and his voice trailed away carver felt a tingle of something between awe and dread as he saw where nadab was leading the humans michaels was more serious than carver had ever heard him youre saying this applies to you how could it not nadab said though nothing about him had changed he suddenly looked vastly different to carver the trader would rather have gone on seeing nadab as a representative of a tormented minority than as the result of an agelong experiment in controlled breeding things would have been much more comfortable that way you claim you greenskins have been breeding for brains for all this time captain chen sounding rattled was as unnerving as lloyd michaels being serious say rather we have been bred for them nadab said after the crime of the one we do not name the restrictions you know were forced upon us they acted as they had to act whether we knew of it at the time or not those of us who were clever enough to make their way in the face of such difficulties survived and bred those who were not starved or were killed on account of their stupidity either by offending the blues or from being caught out after sunset as i was do you doubt now that i am something different from any blue you have knownand from yourselves before any of the humans could answer the machine guns harsh chatter made them all jump tracers stabbed into the night warning the blues away from the greenskin village again i do thank you nadab said but how long will you keep that up all night a day or two as long as you are here do you think the blues will have forgotten by that time they have not forgotten us in three thousand years an ancient joke floated into carvers mind if you re so smart why arent you rich it rang eerily apt here the trader said if you were what you say you are nadab id expect your kind not the blues to be masters within the empire nadab cocked his head had he had eyebrows carver thought he would have lifted one baasa listened to my advice after i am gone he will have another greenskin by his side we reckon better we remember better we pull things together better than any other aides he is likely to find do you think him the only city governor who has discovered our usefulness do you think the emperors themselves have not hes right patrice said softly check the records every blue official traders have dealt with has always had a greenskin at his elbow from the way she stared at nadab she too was seeing him with new eyes of course the greenskin went on we also have the advantage of being disposable at need was that bitterness somehow carver doubted it nadab sounded altogether matteroffact alien the trader thought lets say you do rule behind the scenes captain chen had recovered her briskness to carvers relief she reached a hand toward nadab as if to pull the answer to her next question from him why then havent you people used your position of power to better your lot and get rid of the burdens you suffer under nadab drew back a pace his tail switched up and down a gesture of dismay because we do not wish to and we must not we have been atoning for the nameless ones crime all these years by making ourselves into a people that will not act so stupidly as he did if there were no longer pressure to force wisdom upon us we would fall back into sloth and ease and cease to improve ourselves thats the craziest lloyd michaels began but stopped before he finished the sentence carver understood from the greenskins point of view what nadab was saying was perfectly logical and intelligence was not always what set basic premises it only worked from them carver understood something else as well thats why you were going to butcher the science books baasa bought from me if the blues catch on to evolution they may realize what youve become what we are becoming nadab corrected gravely but yes you are in essence correct i doubt they would approve even in trade english the greenskin had a gift for understatement how can you presume to speak for all your people captain chen demanded what of those who do not care to be persecuted for the sake of an ancient crime dont they want us to do whatever we can to lighten their load you humans have been coming to the empire for two hundred years now your reckoning in that time how many greenskins have sought such aid from you none the captain did not sound happy about admitting it nadab let the silence grow behind that solitary word the tracers punctuated it the humans jumped again nadab repeated quietly how long will you keep that up what would you have us do captain chens voice was no louder open a door and let me out no patrice and michaels spoke at the same time while carver said theyll kill you out there captain chen said only you know what the consequences will be if we do that why do you want us to the consequences for me will be bad in any case my life is forfeit now all through the empire and i do not care to live outside it would you take me to your world with you being a curiosity there the only one of my kind has no appeal so i count myself doomed come what may i do not wish my village and perhaps greenskin villages all through the empire to be injured on my account the captain spoke to the air shumilov are you listening to this aye the weapons officers voice was machineflat comments a moments pause then shumilov said hes right captain chen made a sour face she turned back to nadab and repeated you know what will happen to you out there yes the same as would have happened had i let the blue guards have their sport with me at sunset you dont want to five carver said harshly of course i do who does not why would i have run for your ship here when you cried out if i did not want to live i thought you were giving me a new option one none of my people ever had before butthe greenskin waved at the view panel that showed the mob of blues i see that is not so i was wrong he sounded so downcast at the admission that michaels asked do you want to go out there and die just to punish yourself for making a mistake at first carver thought his fellow trader was letting his sardonic imagination run away with him then looking at nadab he wondered if michaels hadnt hit it dead center all nadab said though was my people are more important than i am i have my duty to them you outlanders have a word for the concept do you not recognize it carver winced so did captain chen she said i have another duty also not to send anyone out to certain death you do not send me you merely let me go and if you do not you condemn the greenskins in my village and others you have never seen to a fate worse than mine anastas shumilov fired off another burst the longest one yet theyre getting harder to convince he remarked you may also end up slaughtering a good many blues who have done you no harm nadab said how can you sympathize with them carver said after all theyve done to your people they are the instruments of our improvement the greenskin said mildly does the raw clay hate the kiln that burns it to make it into a vase nadab swung his unwinking eyes to captain chen now will you let me do as i must do damn you the captain turned on the control board as if it were an enemy and stabbed a button with wholly unnecessary violence the door to the stairwell that led down to the cargo bay slid open captain chen said nothing more if nadabs so smart carver thought let him figure that out for himself he was he did without hesitation he started down the stairs his voice floated up after him my people are in your debt oh shut up the captain muttered she watched nadabs progress on the ships internal monitor he went straight to the cargo bays outer door captain chen made him wait several minutes at last still shaking her head she let the door rise the outside mikes picked up the roar the blues let out when they saw nadab it sent atavistic chills racing up carvers spine though he had never seen one his glands scream lion the instant nadab was outside the ship captain chen sent the cargo bay door slamming shut like the tide rolling in the blues surged forward nadab did not die tamely he sprinted for the greenskin village like an antelope trying to break through a hundred prides of big cats he still had that one chance in ten billion of winning freedom he never got fifty meters from the enrico dandolo the blues dragged him down and took their vengeance on himand then on his corpsefor his presumption carver made himself watch it all even when the flames sprang up his only consolation by then was that nadab could not possibly be feeling what was going on any more once they were done amusing themselves with nadabor once there was nothing left to amuse themselves withsome blues started for the greenskin village quite without orders in itself unheard of before shumilov fired a burst to warn them back to his creditnot that any human was ready to give him muchbaasa had the shkenaz garrison keep the mob away at last the blues began drifting back toward the city poor bastards michaels grunted some of emll be all tired tomorrow from working so late tonight carver threw himself into a chair buried his face in his hands patrice touched his shoulder you did everything you could jerome she said gently you cannot blame yourselves that things here are different from what we thought what can you do for people who have their own reasons ones they find good for not wanting their lot to change he sat and thought about that for a long time he knew that patrice meant the answer to her question to be nothing and that she had spoken mostly to lift him from his gloom he was grateful to her for that but her words sparked something in him that perhaps had not occurred to her he got up and went to his cabin when he came back he was carrying a large fat codexwhat do you have there captain chen asked an astronomy text based on kepler and newton i intended to use it as a followup to the galileo it has the math to carry the blues forward from there intended not for the first time carver remembered that lloyd michaels was too good a trader to let much get past him what will you do with it now carver threw the book down the disposal chute call it a last favor for nadab he said he walked out of the control room again nasty brutish and sooner or later just about everybody tries his hand at writing a bar story this ones mine it may also be of interest because it introduces the foitani who play such a prominent role in earthgrip del rey new york they arent an entirely pleasant people but given their history they could hardly be expected to be only humans and not many of them know why my favorite bar is called hobbes that doesnt mean humans are the only people who go in though not by a long shot humans are spread thin out here a couple of thousand lightyears from home the night im thinking of i was the only one in the place whatll it be walt raoul levesques numbertwo bartender asked me when i came in no hobbes isnt named for the owner obviously something nasty brutish and short i told him thats why its called hobbes and knowing its worth a free drink tequila and morfruit joe suggested he knows me he reached for the tequila with one hand the morfruit its called that i suppose because its mor or less like lime with another and the saltshaker with another that left one free to wave at somebody whod come in behind me i told you i was the only human in the place while i was licking the salt off the web of my thumb i looked around to see whoor whatwas in hobbes this time there were three or four tables full of joes people not surprising since rapti the planet under this space station was joes homeworld it was early yet but a couple of them looked about ready to slide under their tables thats what they get for being fourfisted drinkers an atheter was already swinging from the chandelier she was good at it atheters live in trees when theyre at home and they have prehensile tails this one waved an empty glass at joe and screeched for a refill a couple of egnants put their credit cards in the music machine one after the other raucous noise started blaring loud enough to drown out even the atheter i walked over to the machine saw how much theyd paid and used my own plastic to outbid them for quiet they let their lips skin back from their teeth but cheered up again when i bought them drinks egnants arent hard to deal with unless you try to talk about religion i sneezed when i sat back down at the bar joes ears twitched in surprise what kind of noise is that he asked ive got the edge of a colda small sickness humans get i said disgusted at the way the worlds worked they keep saying theyll have a cure for colds real soon now ill believe it when i see it theyve been saying that since before humans got off terra greenbelly fever is dead as smallpox now because it killed people and they threw research money at it till it went away colds are just nuisances its hard to get excited enough about a nuisance to get rid of it i ordered a beer to chase the tequila took a sip looked around some more what would have been the second sip stopped halfway to my mouth off in a corner by himheritself sat a person whose species i didnt recognize and ive seen a lot of them wheres that one from i asked joe bartenders know everything its part of their job if you dont believe me just ask one who the big blue one back there over my right shoulder i didnt point at the person you never can tell what gesture will offend somebody oh him hes a foitan no kidding now i really had to work to keep from staring i thought they were extinct a lot of worlds in this part of space rapti among them had foitani artifacts they were on the edges of what had been a really big foitani empire maybe thirty fifty thousand years ago then the really big empire fought a really big civil war there are a lot of dead worlds in this part of space too and the foitani killed most of them so did we until maybe fifty years ago joe said then they started showing up every so often traders mostly but archaeologists too they only have a few planets now and theyre interested in their glory days i shivered a little wheres their homeworld do you know about as far from here toward galactic center as yours is away from it i shivered again not a little this time if the foitani empire had reached across thousands of lightyears how big had that war been how many more dead worlds lay inside that sphere more than i wanted to think about i was certain not even humans were stupid on that scale i found myself walking back toward the foitan tequila always makes me reckless excuse me i said may i buy you another of whatever you are drinking the foitan had a bug by its ear it looked like a rapti bug which meant it ought to handle spanglish it did the foitan said something in a language i didnt recognize but my own bug did i heard thank you if i may do the same for you i waved to joe pointed at my beer and the bottle in front of the foitan held up a finger joe waved back hed seen me may i join you i asked the foitan nodding toward a chair across from him by the way of answer he pushed the chair out with his foot so i could sit my legs wouldnt have been long enough for that but then what i could see of the foitan was a lot bigger than i was he looked more or less humanoid but only the biggest battleball players would have seemed like anything but children next to him his face reminded me of what people might have looked like if theyd come from bearsblue bearsinstead of apes nasty brutish and tall you might say actually thats not fair he was pretty impressive my name is naplak naplak kap he saidi have not seen your kind before is it polite to ask what you are called im walter harbron i answered walt will do walt naplak naplak kap said gravely just then joe came over with our drinks i took a pull at my beer the foitan halfemptied his new bottle walt he said again he studied me his eyes were large they didnt seem to blink may i ask about your species i do so only from curiosity and mean no offense yes go ahead may i ask about yours as well ive never met any foitani before id like to learn more about you naplak naplak kaps shrug was massive i came to this world to learn more myself i am by profession a recoverer of the past and we foitani have much past to recover what does your race call itself and why are you here were humans as for me i shrugged i travel from star to star i buy things i sell things sometimes material things sometimes information i havent starved yet ah profit the bugs flat translation didnt give me any feel for how naplak naplak kap felt about profit then he rumbled humans yes ive heard of you people youre widespread these days arent you weve done well for ourselves i shrugged again i didnt want to tell him that humans ranged as widely now as his folks had at their peak sure were just one species among many but i still didnt want him to take it the wrong way he was too big to risk riling humans he repeated this time i thought more to himself than to me suddenly he seemed to remember i was there excuse me i seem to recall something about your species in a data base from our ancient days that the raptics showed me my computer did a better job of reading it than the locals could may i check go ahead i told him what was i going to say his computer looked like a computernot like what we build but it couldnt have been anything else he talked with it in a language my bug couldnt handle i suppose it was his own he finished his bottle almost absentmindedlyyes here we are he said at last he spent long enough reading that had he been a human he would have been a rude one every so often hed grunt i didnt know whether he was surprised or angry or curious or what finally i got bored waiting i said may i ask what your records show once more it was as if he had to remind himself i was sitting with him oh yes of course i apologize he put the computer back out of sight by the way he fumbled about my guess was that he wore it in a belt pouch then his eyes found mine again according to this data base your species should not exist weve tried to do that to ourselves a few times i said laughing hasnt worked yet i drank some more beer it was good i could feel the chair pressing against my behind im real enough were all real but you should not be naplak naplak kap said he didnt have much in the way of a sense of humor whether that goes for foitani in general i couldnt tell you let me explain go ahead i nodded one more time what was i going to say you know we once ruled in this part of space yes i nodded again we explored farther yet and once we touched on what i think must be your world he dug out the computer again did some quick figuring in the coordinates the raptics use the location of the planets star was i pulled my own computer out of my pocket turned raptic numbers into my kind and felt my jaw drop those numbers worked out to just over a lightyear from sol i rubbed my nose which was starting to get numb i said i guess that has to be my star but the locations not quite right you forget naplak naplak kap said these records are of my years old i felt like an idiot not for the first time stars didnt move fast not compared to light but they did move and in umptyump thousand years sol had gone a good ways yes i did forget i said numbly tell me about my savage ancestors they were naplak naplak kap said they were vicious too and clever one tribe managed to kill a foitan despite his armor and weaponry and was in the process of roasting him when my people took vengeancefrom the air at long range we had learned and so i asked what i wanted to do was cheer for those poor doomed cavemen and so we decided that even savage humans were dangerous and that they should not be allowed to live to develop technology we decided to destroy them the bug in my ear put no expression into the words which made them doubly chilling naplak naplak kap went on my species it appears did this often enough to have developed a protocol for it we knew what we were about i assure you go on i ground out humans werent innocent of such things not while we were still on terra and sadly not always after we got off either but having someone calmly talk about strangling us in our cradle we prepared a respiratory virus genetically tailored to ensure that your species would not become immune to it then disseminated it widely throughout your planets atmosphere in a few generations you should have disappeared and your world would have been there for the taking but our own suicide wars started soon after so we never went back and we never died out i felt like crowing so you didnt guessing aliens expressions is a fools game but naplak naplak kaps seemed to say he thought it was my fault so far as i know yours is the only species of which that is true in the middle of my triumphant chuckle i sneezed three times in a row my bug does not translate that noise naplak naplak kap said its nothing i said just a cold i looked at naplak naplak kap he looked at me then i waved to joe and bought him another drink what was i supposed to do
