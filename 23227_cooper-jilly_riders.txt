jilly cooper riders to beryl hill the artur rubinstein of the typewriter with love and gratitude acknowledgments an enormous number of people helped me write riders they were all experts in their fields but this being a work of fiction i took their advice only as far as it suited my plot and the accuracy of the book in no way reflected on their expertise they included ronnie massarella caroline silver alan smith brian giles douglas bunn michael clayton alan oliver bridget le good john burbidge diana downie raymond brooksward harvey smith dr hubert and mrs bessie crouch dr timothy evans heather ross caroline akrill dick stilwell sue clarke sue gibson andrew parkerbowles john and tory oaksey marion ivey rosemary nunelly elizabeth richardson elizabeth hopkins julia longland susan blair ann martin kate osullivan marcy drummond john and michael whitaker david broome and malcolm pyrah i owed a special debt of gratitude to dear sighle gogan who spent so many hours talking to me about show jumping and arranged for me to meet so many of the people who helped me but who tragically died in january i also had cause to thank my bank manager james atkinson for being so patient and paul scherer and alan earney of corgi books for being so continually encouraging and tom hartman for being one of those rare people who actually makes authors enjoy having their books edited an award for gallantry weny to the nine ladies who all worked fantastically long hours over christmas deciphering my appalling handwriting and typing the word manuscript they included beryl hill anna gibbskennet sue moore margaret mckellican corinne monhaghan julie payne nicky greenshield patricia quatermass and my own wonderful secretary diane peter the lions share of my gratitude went to desmond elliott for masterminding the whole operation so engagingly and to all his staff at arlington who worked so hard to produce such a huge book in under five months finally there were really no words adequate to thank my husband leo and my children felix and emily except to say that without their support good cheer and continued unselfishness the book would never have been finished england because he had to get up unusually early on saturday jake lovell kept waking up throughout the night racked by terrifying dreams about being late in the first dream he couldnt find his breeches when the collecting ring steward called his number in the second he couldnt catch any of the riding school ponies to take them to the show in the third africa slipped her head collar and escaped and in the fourth the most terrifying of all he was back in the childrens home screaming and clawing at locked iron gates while rupert campbellblack rode africa off down the high street until turning with that hateful sneering smile hed shouted youll never get out of that place now gyppo its where you belong jake woke sobbing heart bursting drenched in sweat paralyzed with fear it was half a minute before he could reach out and switch on the bedside lamp he lit a cigarette with a trembling hand gradually the familiar objects in the room reasserted themselves the lionel edwards prints on the walls the tattered piles of horse and hound the books on show jumping hopelessly overcrowding the bookshelves the wash basin the faded photographs of his mother and father hanging in the wardrobe was the check riding coat mrs wilton had rather grudgingly given him for his twentyfirst birthday beneath it stood the scratched but gleaming pair of browntopped boots hed picked up secondhand last week in the stall below he could hear a horse snorting and a crash as another horse kicked over its water bucket far too slowly his panic subsided prep school and rupert campbellblack were things of the past it was and he had been out of the childrens home for four years now he mostly forgot them during the day it was only in dreams they came back to torment him he shivered the sheets were still damp with sweat fourthirty said his alarm clock there were already fingers of light under the thin yellow curtains he didnt have to get up for half an hour but he was too scared to go back to sleep he could hear the rain pattering on the roof outside and dripping from the gutter muting the chatter of the sparrows he tried to concentrate on the day ahead which didnt make him feel much more cheerful one of the worst things about working in a riding school was having to take pupils to horse shows few of them could control the bored brokendown ponies many were spoilt others terrified were only riding at all because their frightful mothers were using horses to grapple their way up the social scale giving them an excuse to put a hard hat in the back window of the jaguar and slap gymkhana stickers on the windscreen what made jake sick with nerves however was that unknown to his boss mrs wilton he intended to take africa to the show and enter her for the open jumping mrs wilton didnt allow jake to compete in shows he might get too big for his boots his job was to act as constant nursemaid to the pupils not to jump valuable horses behind her back usually mrs wilton turned up at shows in the afternoon and strutted about chatting up the mothers but today because she was driving down to brighton to chat up some rich uncle who had no children she wouldnt be putting in an appearance if jake didnt try out africa today he wouldnt have another chance for weeks africa was a livery horse looked after at the riding school but owned by an actor named bobby cotterel whod bought her in a fit of enthusiasm after starring in dick turpin a few weeks later he had bought a ferrari and apart from still paying her livery fees had forgotten about africa which had given jake the perfect opportunity to teach her to jump on the quiet she was only six but every day jake became more convinced that she had the makings of a great show jumper it was not just her larkiness and courage her fantastic turn of speed and huge jump she also had an ability to get herself out of trouble which counterbalanced her impetuosity jake adored her more than any person or animal he had known in his life if mrs wilton discovered hed taken her to a show shed probably sack him he dreaded losing a job which had brought him his first security in years but the prospect of losing africa was infinitely worse the alarm made him jump it was still raining the horror of the dream gripped him again what would happen if africa slipped when she was taking off or landing he dressed and lifting up the trapdoor at the bottom of his bed climbed down the stairs into the tackroom inhaling the smell of warm horse leather saddle soap and dung which never failed to excite him hearing him mixing the feeds horses heads came out over the halfdoors calling whickering stamping their hooves dandelion the skewbald the greediest pony in the yard his mane and back covered in straw from lying down yelled shrilly demanding to be fed first as he added extra vitamins nuts and oats to africas bowl jake thought it was hardly surprising she looked well mrs wilton would have a fit if she knew it was seventhirty before he had mucked out and fed all the horses africa feed finished blinking her big dark blue eyes in the lowangled sun hung out of her box catching his sleeve between her lips each time he went past shaking gently never nipping the skin mrs wilton had been out to dinner the night before it was unlikely shed surface before halfpast eight that gave him an hour to groom africa rolling up his sleeves chattering nonsense to her all the time jake got to work she was a beautiful horse very dark brown her coat looking almost indigo in the shadows she had two white socks a spillikin of white down her forehead a chest like a channel steamer funnel huge shoulders and quarters above lean strong legs her ears twitched and turned all the time as sensitive as radar he started when the stable cat a fat tabby with huge whiskers appeared on top of the stable door and after glancing at a couple of pigeons scratching for corn dropped down into the straw and curled up in the discarded warmth of africas rug suddenly africa jerked up her head and listened jake stepped outside nervously the curtains were still drawn in mrs wiltons house hed wanted to plait africas mane but he didnt dare it would unplait all curly and he might be caught out he went back to work surely youre not taking africa to the show said a shrill voice jake jumped out of his skin and africa tossed up her head banging him on the nose just able to look over the halfdoor was one of his pupils fenella maxwell her face as freckled as a robins egg her flaxen hair already escaping from its elastic bands what the hell are you doing here said jake furiously his eyes watering i said no one was allowed here till ten and it cant be eight yet push off home ive come to help said fenella gazing at him with huge cambridgeblue eyes fringed with thick blond lashes totally unabashed she moved a boiled sweet to the other side of her face i know youre by yourself till alison comes ill get dandelion readyplease she added i want him to look as beautiful as africa shut up hissed jake now shove off please let me stay theres nothing to do at home i couldnt sleep i will help oh doesnt smokey look sweet curled up in the rug are you really taking africa mind your own business said jake fen took the boiled sweet out of her mouth and gave it to dandelion who was slavering over the next halfdoor then kissed him on the nose her shirt was already escaping from the jeans which she wore over her jodhpurs to keep them clean does mrs wilton know she asked no said jake i wont tell her said fen swinging on africas door patty beasley might though or sally ann shes always sneaking about something jake had already sweated uncomfortably over this possibility theyre probably too thick to notice she went on shall i make you a cup of tea four spoonfuls of sugar isnt it jake relented she was a good kid cheerful and full of guts with an instinct for horses and a knowledge way beyond her nine years you can stay if you keep your trap shut he said i dont want mrs wilton waking up yet after she had spilt most of the tea in the saucer fen tied dandelion up outside africas box and settled down to washing his white patches managing to get more water over herself than the pony jake halflistened as she chattered on incessantly about her sister tory who was doing the season but not enjoying the parties at all and who often had red eyes from crying in the morning shes coming to the show later does your mother know youre here asked jake she wouldnt notice if i wasnt shes got a new boyfriend named colonel carter colonel cartah he calls himself he laughs all the time when hes talking to mummy and hes got big yellow teeth like dandelion but somehow they look better on a horse theyre coming to the show too colonel carter is bringing a lot of soldiers and guns to do a display after the open jumping he and mummy and tory are going to lunch up at the hall mummy bought a new blue dress specially its lovely but tory said it was jolly expensive so i dont expect shell be able to afford to buy me a pony yet anyway she says tory being a deb is costing a fortune shampoo and set darling she said to dandelion twenty minutes later as she stuck the ponys tail in a bucket of hot soapy water oh look africas making faces isnt she sweet the next moment dandelion had whisked his tail at a fly sending soapy water all over fen africas rug and the stable cat who retreated in high dudgeon for gods sake concentrate snapped jake mummys pictures in the tatler again this week said fen she gets in much more often than poor tory she says torys got to go on a diet next week so shell be thin for her drinks party next month oh cave mrs wiltons drawing back the kitchen curtains hastily jake replaced africas rug and came out of her box inside the kitchen beneath the ramparts of honeysuckle he could see mrs wilton her brick red face flushed from the previous nights drinking dropping alkaseltzer into a glass of water christ he hoped shed get a move on to brighton and wouldnt hang around picking up the brush and the curry comb he started on one of the ponies mrs wilton came out of the house followed by her arthritic yellow labrador who lifted his leg stiffly on the mounting block then as a formality bounded after the stable cat mrs wilton was never known to have been on a horse in her life stocky with a face squashed in like a bulldog she had short pepper and salt hair a blotchy complexion like salami and a deep bass voice all the same she had had more success with the opposite sex than her masculine appearance would suggest jake she bellowed he came out curry comb in one hand brush in the other yes mrs wilton though shed repeatedly asked him to call her joyce they gazed at each other with the dislike of the unwillingly but mutually dependent mrs wilton knew that having lost both his parents and spent much of his life in a childrens home jake clung on to the security of a livingin job as her husband was away so much on business mrs wilton had often suggested jake might be more comfortable living in the house with her but aware that he would have to share a bathroom and if mrs w had her way a bedroom jake had repeatedly refused mrs wilton was old enough to be his mother but despite finding him sullen and withdrawn to the point of insolence she had to admit that the horses had never been better looked after as a result of his encyclopedic knowledge of plants and wildflowers and his incredible gypsy remedies she hadnt had a vets bill since hed arrived and because he was frightened of losing this substitute home she could get away with paying him a pittance she found herself doing less and less she didnt want to revert to getting up at six and mucking out a dozen horses and it was good to be able to go away like today and not worry on the other hand if he was a miracle with animals he was hell with parents refusing to suck up to them positively rude to the sillier ones a lot had defected and gone to mrs haley across the valley who charged twice as much how many ponies are you taking she demanded six said jake walking towards the tackroom praying shed follow him and youll get mrs thomson to bring the head collars and the water buckets in her car do try to be polite for once although i know how hard you find it jake stared at her unsmiling he had a curiously immobile face everything in the right place but without animation the swarthy features were pale today the full lips set in an uncompromising line slanting secretive dark eyes looked out from beneath a frowning line of brow practically concealed by the thick thatch of almost black hair he was small not more than five foot seven and very thin a good jockeys weight the only note of frivolity was the gold rings in his ears there was something watchful and controled about him that didnt go with youth despite the heat of the day his shirt collar was turned up as if against some imagined storm ill be back tomorrow she said looking down the row of loose boxes suddenly her eyes lit on africa whats she doing inside i brought her in this morning he lied easily she yells her head off if shes separated from dandelion and i thought youd like a lie in well put her out again when you go im not having her eating her head off despite the fat fee paid by bobby gotterel thought jake she peered into the loose box for an appalling moment he thought she was going to peel back the rug hello mrs wilton shrieked fen come and look at dandelion doesnt he look smart distracted mrs wilton turned away from africa hello fen dear youre an early bird he does look nice youve even oiled his hooves perhaps youll bring home a rosette shouldnt think so said fen gloomily last time he ate all the potatoes in the potato race phew that was a near one said fen as mrs wiltons car with the labradors head sticking out of the window disappeared down the road come on said jake ill make you some breakfast dressing later before he set out for the show jake transferred the crushed and faded yellow tansy flower from the bottom of his left gum boot to his left riding boot tansy warded off evil jake was full of superstitions the royal gypsy blood of the lovells didnt flow through his veins for nothing by midday a blazing sun shone relentlessly out of a speedwell blue sky warming the russet stone of bilborough hall as it dreamed above its dark green moat to the right on the terrace great yews cut in the shape of peacocks seemed about to strut across the shaven lawns down into the valley where bluegreen wheat fields merged into meadows of pale silvergreen hay in the park the trees in the angelic softness of their new spring growth looked as if the rain had not only washed them but fabric conditioned them as well dark purple copper beeches and cochinealred may added a touch of color to the left the show ring was already circled two deep with cars and more cars in a long gleaming crocodile were still inching slowly through the main gate on either side of which two stone lions reared up clenching red and white bunting between their teeth the headscarf brigade were out in full force caught on the hop by the first hot day of the year their arms pale in sleeveless dresses silklined bottoms spilling over shooting sticks shouting to one another as they unpacked picnics from their cars hunt terriers yapped labradors panted food in dog bowls remaining untouched because of the heat gathered flies beyond the cars crowds milled round the stalls selling horsiana moving aside to avoid the occasional competitors riding through with numbers on their backs children mindlessly consumed crisps clamored for ices balloons and pony rides fathers hung with cameras wearing creased lightweight suits smelling of mothballs wished they could escape back to the office and for consolation eyed the inevitable hordes of nubile fourteenyearold girls with long wavy hair and very tight breeches who seem to parade permanently up and down at horse shows bilborough hall was owned by sir william blake no relation to the poet but nicknamed tiger at school mingling with the crowds he gossiped to friends raised his hat to people he didnt know and told everyone that in twenty years there had only been one wet bilborough show his wife a jp in drooping tweeds and a felt hat whose passion was gardening sighed inwardly at the ground already gray and pitted with hoof marks between each year like childbirth nature seemed to obliterate the full horror of the bilborough show she had already instructed the undergardener to his intense embarrassment to go around with a spade and gather up all the manure before it was trodden into the ground oh there you are william she said to her husband who was genially trying to guess the weight of a piglet people are already arriving for luncheon wed better go and do our stuff down by the horse lines jake lovell tying up a weedy gray pony more securely was slowly reaching screaming point the family of the unspeakably hopeless patty beasley none of whom had ever been on a horse had all turned up in jodhpurs sally ann thomsons frightful mother hung around the whole time talking at the top of her voice so all the other competitors turned around and laughed at her it doesnt matter about winning dear she was now telling sally ann competing and having fun is all that matters bloody rubbish thought jake they all sulk if theyre not placed after sally anns pony had bolted with her and patty beasleys cob had had a kicking match with the priceless winner of the under showing class causing loss of temper on all sides jake had refused to let any of the children ride their ponies until the jumping in the afternoon he had nearly had a mutiny on his hands why cant i do some practice jumps on syrup why cant i ride stardust over to get an ice cream oh snowballs trodden on my toe how dyou rate sally anns chances in the junior jumping asked mrs thomson sweating in an emerald green wool suit nonexistent snapped jake joyce wilton said sally ann was the best little horsewoman in surrey can patty enter for the potato race asked mrs beasley if she wants to waste her money the secretarys tents over there sally anns mother returned to the attack weve paid for the pony all day mrs wilton charged a gymkhana my little girl should be able to ride as much as she likes jakes head throbbed with the effort of filtering out conversation the clamor went on deafening shrill and demanding he might as well get a job as a nanny no wonder sheepdogs had nervous breakdowns no wonder mothers battered babies and babies battered mothers he wanted to turn off the din like the wireless and lie down in the long lush grass by the river and go to sleep his eye ran over the row of bored depressedlooking ponies standing on three legs tails swishing ineffectually against the flies occasionally flattening their ears at one another theyre trapped like me he thought his face became less frosty as he came to little fenella maxwell standing on a bucket replaiting the longsuffering dandelions mane for the third time she was a good kid surprisingly she wasnt spoilt by her bitch of a mother who would be guzzling champagne up at the big house with the nobs by now his eyes softened even more when they came to rest on africa not dozing like the ponies she looked around with her huge eyes taking everything in reassuring herself constantly that jake was still there the prospect of the open jumping and the risk he was running made him steadily more sick with nerves he lit another cigarette next time a huge horse box drew up a groom got out unfastened the ramp and led out a beautifully plaitedup gray sweating in a crimson rug with dark blue binding a girl wearing a white shirt a black coat skintight breeches and long black boots walked over and looked the horse over critically she had a haughty pink and white face jake thought how attractive some women looked in riding clothes the austerity and severity of the uniform contrasting with the wild wantonness beneath he imagined her long thighs threshing in ecstasy while the hat tie and haughty pink and white face remained primly in place he imagined laying her on a bed of straw as tempting as a newly made bed as if aware of jakes scrutiny she turned around jake looked away quickly determined not to give her the satisfaction of knowing she was being fancied lavinia a handsome dark boy white teeth gleaming in his suntanned face pulled up his huge chestnut horse beside her christopher hello i thought you were in marbella just got back come and have a dwink she couldnt say her rs mummys parked the car by the collecting wing love to he rode on bloody upper classes thought jake all making so much bloody noise he was fed up with wearing a cheap riding coat and thirdhand boots that were already killing him he wanted a horse box and a groom whisking out different horses like a conjurer producing colored handkerchiefs and a tackroom wall papered with red rosettes and a beautiful pink and white girl asking him respectfully how many strides there were between the gate and the rustic poles a shrill piping voice brought him back to earth ive bought you an ice cream said fenella maxwell you ought to keep up your strength oh look theyre bringing out the jumps for the junior jumping i know im going to let dandelion down mummy and toryll miss it if they dont stop stuffing themselves inside bilborough hall tory maxwell fenellas elder sister looked up at a large rubens in which a huge pink fleshy venus was being pursued by half the satyr population of ancient greece while adoring cherubs arranged her rippling pearlstrewn hair shes much fatter than me thought tory wistfully why wasnt i born in the seventeenth century she had huge gray eyes and long straight light brown hair which her mother insisted she wore drawn back off her forehead and temples and tied in a bow on the crown of her head a style which made her round pleading peony red face look bigger than ever she was tallish and bigboned with a huge bust that bounced up and down as she walked however she stood on the scales she weighed eleven stone shed just got the curse which made her feel even fatter and however many layers of erace she put on a large red spot on her chin glowed through like a lighthouse she was getting hotter and hotter but she couldnt take off the jacket of her red suit because the skirt was fastened precariously by a safety pin her ankles had swelled and having kicked off her tight shoes she wondered if shed ever be able to get back into them again she wondered if shed ever been more miserable in her life then with a stab of pain she remembered last nights dance and decided she was comparatively blessed during the weekdays she was at a finishing school in london learning to cook to type and to arrange flowers by ramming bits of rhubarb into chicken mesh by night she practiced the art of wallflower arrangement going to drinks parties and dances and trying to appear as though she belonged to one of those chattering laughing groups of debs and their admirers occasionally hostesses took pity on her and brought up wilting reluctant young men who talked politely or danced one dance then drifted away the more miserable she got the more she ate but never at dances never in front of her mother she would wait for everyone to go out or to bed then wolf three bowls of cornflakes swimming in heavy cream yesterday shed eaten a whole box of chocolates which had been given to her mother by an admirer and then had to rush out to the shops to buy another box to replace it before her mother got back why couldnt she be like fen and have something like horses to be interested in passionately and keep her nose out of the trough why did she have to stay inside on this lovely day when she wanted to be outside picnicking with fen and jake at the thought of jake darkfaced and unpredictable whom she had never spoken to her stomach felt weak her mouth dry oh jake at night she wrote him long passionate letters which she always tore up small men were supposed to like big girls look at d h lawrence and stanley spencer perhaps having no parents and being brought up in a childrens home he might be looking for a mother figure but he didnt seem to be showing any signs so far torys mother molly maxwell had enjoyed her lunch enormously she was delighted to be asked colonel carter who had accompanied her had enjoyed himself too it had been fun being able to introduce him to sir william and theyd got on well talking about the war she combed her hair surreptitiously gerald had done it beautifully this week why was tory hanging round like a wet blanket sir williams sons were there all of them old etonians nice looking and so suitable and tory hadnt addressed a word to any of them all through lunch just sitting like a pig and taking a second helping of pudding when she thought her mother wasnt looking poor molly she could imagine people saying poor molly to be saddled with such a lump no i wont have any more wine thank you sir william she didnt want to get red in the face her new silklined dress and jacket in periwinkle blue was most becoming this afternoon shed probably take the jacket off her arms were still slender and already turning brown she was really enjoying tory doing the season jennifers diary this week had described her as the chic and most attractive mother of tory maxwell at least one debs delight and several fathers had declared themselves madly in love with her and now colonel carter was getting really keen and sending roses twice a week to top everything last night she had heard two young bloods discussing tory wonder if it would be worth marrying her for her money said the first id certainly marry her for her mummy said the second molly maxwell is absolutely gorgeous molly thought that was too amusing for words molly was a bit short of cash at the moment her rather stolid husband had paid her a great deal of alimony but when he inconveniently died he had left all his money unaccountably in trust for tory that was another grudge what did tory want with an income of a year tory looked across at her mother im the fruit of her womb and i hate her hate her hate her she thought for her ankles slender as a gazelles and her flexible high insteps and thin knightsbridge legs and her painted malicious face and her shrill clipped voice not unlike fens look at sir william bending over her no really molly was saying is it by ferneley how fascinating no do tell me and that dreadful colonel carter colonel bogus more likely handsome as an aging movie star matineeidling about a cliché of chauvinism his large yellow teeth gleaming amicably beneath his graying mustache as he blamed even the weather on the socialists no my younger daughter fens riding molly was saying to sir william shes absolutely horsemad up first thing mucking out never get her to wear a dress oh i see you take the tatler too not for the articles really but its such fun to see which of ones chums are in this week no not my only child tory could hear her mother going on theres tory over there yes shes more like her fatheryes just eighteenwell how kind of you to say so i suppose i was rather young when i got married mustnt monopolize you said sir william getting up from his chair and noticing colonel carter hovering come and sit down carter cant say i blame you next moment sir william was hurrying across the room to welcome the two judges malise gordon and miss squires who on a tight schedule had only time for a quick bite malise gordon having accepted a weak whisky and soda refused to follow it with any wine he took a small helping of salmon but no potatoes not because he was worried about getting fat but because he liked to practice asceticism an excavalry officer much medaled after a good war colonel gordon not only farmed but also judged at shows all around the country during the summer and was kept busy in the winter as the local master of fox hounds he was inclined to apply army discipline to the hunting field to great effect and told people exactly what he thought of them if they talked at the covert side rode over seeds or left gates open in addition to these activities he played the flute restored pictures in his spare time and wrote poetry and books on military history just turned fifty he was tall and lean with a handsome hawklike face high cheekbones and dark hair hardly touched with gray that is easily the most attractive man in the room thought molly maxwell eyeing him speculatively as she accepted colonel carters heavy pleasantries and let her laugh tinkle again and again round the room malise gordon was now talking to sir williams wife lady dorothy what an old frump thought molly maxwell that dreadful fawn cardigan with marks on it and laceup shoes and the sort of baggy tweed skirt youd feed the chickens in as an excuse to be introduced to malise molly got up and wandering over to lady dorothy thanked her for a delicious lunch absolutely first rate agreed colonel carter whod followed her would you like to see around the garden said lady dorothy malise gordon looked at his watch we better go and supervise the junior jumping he said to miss squires oh my daughters in that said molly maxwell giving malise gordon a dazzling smile i hope youll turn a blind eye if she knocks anything down it would be such a thrill if she got a rosette malise gordon didnt smile back he had heard mollys laugh once too often and thought her very silly fortunately jumping is the one event in which one cant possibly display any favoritism colonel carter aware that his beloved had been snubbed decided malise gordon needed taking down a peg whats the order for this afternoon he asked junior jumping open jumping then gymkhana events in ring three then your show in ring two carter a keen territorial colonel carter was organizing a recruiting display which included firing twentyfive pounders were scheduled for seventeen hundred hours snapped colonel carter hope youll have wound your jumping up by then gordon my chaps like to kick off on time i hope you wont do anything silly like firing off blanks while there are horses in the ring said malise brusquely it could be extremely dangerous thanks dorothy for a splendid lunch he added kissing lady dorothy on the cheek the gardens looking marvelous colonel carter turned purple what an arrogant bastard he thought glaring after malises broad very straight back as he followed miss squires briskly out of the drawing room but then the cavalry always gave themselves airs earlier at the briefing malise had had the ill manners to point out that he thought a horse show was hardly the place to introduce a lot of people who had nothing better to do with their afternoons than play soldiers ill show him fumed colonel carter outside hackney carriages were bouncing around the ring drawn by highstepping horses rosettes streaming from their striped browbands while junior riders crashed their ponies over the practice fence by some monumental inefficiency the organizers of the show had also ended up with three celebrities whod all arrived to present the prizes and needed looking after bobby cotterel africas owner had originally been allotted the task but at the last moment hed pushed off to france and such was the panic of finding a replacement that three other celebrities had been booked and accepted the first was the lady mayoress whod opened the show and toured the exhibits and who had now been borne off to inspect the guides the second was miss bilborough whose alldaylong makeup had not stood up to the heat the third was a radio celebrity with uniformly gray hair and a black treacle voice named dudley diplock having played a doctor in a longrunning serial he talked at the top of his voice all the time in the hope that the public might recognize him he had now commandeered the microphone for the junior jumping fen felt her stomach getting hollower and hollower the jumps looked huge the first fence was as big as epping forest please god let me not have three refusals let me not let dandelion down oh here comes tory she said as jake helped her saddle up dandelion she went to a dance last night but i dont think she enjoyed it her eyes were awfully red this morning jake watched the plump anxiousfaced tory wincing over the churnedup ground in her tight shoes she didnt look like a girl who enjoyed anything very much did you have a nice lunch i bet you had strawberries shrieked fen climbing onto dandelion and gathering up the reins im just going to put dandelion over a practice fence this is my sister tory she added jake looked at tory with that measure of disapproval he always bestowed on strangers its very hot stammered tory very said jake there didnt seem much else to say fortunately tory was saved by the microphone calling the competitors into the collecting ring mr lovell i cant get stardusts girths to meet shes blown herself out wailed patty beasley jake went over and gave stardust a hefty kneeup in the belly fen came back from jumping the practice fence immediately dandelions head went down snatching at the grass you pig squealed fen jumping off and pulling bits out of his mouth i just cleaned that bit wheres mummy she added to tory going over the garden with lady dorothy said tory she must be bored said fen no there she is over on the other side of the ring looking across they could see mrs maxwell standing beside sally ann thomsons mother while colonel carter adjusted her deck chair colonel carter stayed last night said fen in disgust i couldnt sleep and i looked out of the window at about five oclock and saw him go he looked up at mummys bedroom and blew her a great soppy kiss think of kissing a man with an awful droopy mustache like that i suppose theres no accounting for tastes fen said tory blushing scarlet she looked at jake out of the corner of her eye to see if he was registering shock or amusement but his face was quite expressionless number fiftyeight called out the collecting ring steward a girl in a dark blue riding coat on a very shiny bay mare went in and jumped clear some nearby drunks in a bentley whose boot groaned with booze hooted loudly on their horn how was her ladyships garden asked colonel carter i think i was given a tour of every petal said molly maxwell you must have been the fairest flower said the colonel putting his deck chair as close to hers as possible my people used to have a lovely garden in hampshar the radio personality dudley diplock having mastered the microphone was now thoroughly enjoying himself here comes the junior champion for surrey he said miss cock miss sarah cock on topsy a girl with buckteeth rode in despite her frenziedly flailing legs the pony ground to a halt three times in front of the first fence jolly bad luck topsy said the radio personality oh i beg your pardon here comes miss sarah cock i mean cook on topsy a girl on a heavily bandaged dappled gray came in and jumped a brisk clear round next came sally ann thomson heres my little girl said mrs thomson pausing for a moment in her discussion of hats with mrs maxwell i wonder if stardust will go better in a running martingale stardust decided not and refused three times at the first fence we really ought to buy her a pony of her own said mrs thomson even the best riders cant do much on ridingschool hacks mrs maxwell winked at colonel carter round followed round everyone agreed the standard was frightful and here we have yet another competitor from brook farm riding school miss patty beasley on swindle swindle trotted dejectedly into the ring rollingeyed and thinlegged like a horse in a medieval tapestry then like a car running out of petrol she ground to a halt in front of the first fence jake raised his eyes to heaven jesus christ he muttered swindles third refusal was too much for pattys father whod bought breeches specially to attend the show rushing across the grass he brandished a shooting stick shouting geron terrified swindle rose like a stag from the hard ground and took a great leap over the brush fence whereupon patty fell off and burst into tears another competitor from brook farm riding school eliminated said dudley diplock teach them to fall off there dont they said a wag the crowd guffawed jake gritted his teeth he was aware of tory standing beside him and sensing her sympathy was grateful its your turn next said jake going up to fen and checking dandelions girths take the double slowly everyone else has come round the corner too fast and not given themselves enough time off you go he added gently pulling dandelions ears please god ill never be bad again prayed fen i wont be foul to sally ann or call patty a drip or be rude to mummy just let me get round ignoring the cries of good luck desperately trying to remember everything jake had told her fen rode into the ring with a set expression on her face miss fenella maxwell from brook farm riding school said the radio personality lets have a round of applause for our youngest competitor the crowd scenting carnage clapped lethargically dandelion his brown and white patches gleaming like a conker that had been opened too early gave a goodnatured buck isnt that your little girl said mrs thomson so it is said molly maxwell oh look her ponys going to the lav dont horses have an awful sense of timing the first fence loomed as high as bechers brook and fen used her legs so fiercely dandelion rose into the air clearing it by a foot fen was slightly unseated and unable to get straight in the saddle to ride dandelion properly at the gate he slowed down and refused when fen whacked him he rolled his eyes swished his tail and started to graze the crowd laughed fen went crimson oh poor thing murmured tory in anguish fen pulled his head up and let him examine the gate dandelion sniffed decided it was harmless and with a whisk of his fat rump flew over and went bucketing on to clear the stile at which fen lost her stirrup then cleared the parallel bars where she lost the other stirrup rounding the corner for home dandelion stepped up the pace fen checked him her hat falling over her nose as he bounded towards the roadclosed sign dandelion fighting for his head rapped the fence but it stayed put i cant bear to look thought tory shutting her eyes fen had lost her hat now and plaits flying raced towards the triple jake watched her strain every nerve to get the takeoff right dandelion cleared it by inches and galloped out of the ring to loud applause miss fenella maxwell on dandelion only three faults for a refusal jolly good round coughed the microphone i had no idea shed improved so much said tory turning a pink ecstatic face towards jake fen cantered up grinning from ear to ear wasnt dandelion wonderful she said jumping off flinging her arms round his neck covering him with kisses and stuffing him with sugar lumps she looked up at jake inquiringly well we could see half the show ground between your knees and the saddle and you took him too fast at the gate but not bad he said for the first time that day he looked cheerful and tory thought how nice he was i must go and congratulate fen said mrs maxwell delicately picking her way through the dung that manners had not yet gathered well done darling she shrieked in a loud voice which made all the nearby horses jump what a good boy she added gingerly patting dandelions nose with a gloved hand he is a boy isnt he she tilted her head sideways to look awfully good show said colonel carter my sister used to jump on horseback in hampshar mrs maxwell turned to jake enveloping him in a sickening waft of arpège fen really has come on i do hope she isnt too much of a nuisance down at the stables all day but she is utterly ponymad every sentence begins jake said this jake says that youve become quite an ogre in our home oh mummy groaned fen jake thinking how silly she was and unable to think of anything to say in reply remained silent how gauche he is thought molly maxwell the junior class having finished jumping off were riding into the ring to collect their rosettes number eightysix howled the collecting ring steward number eightysix thats you fen said tory in excitement it couldnt be i had a refusal youre fourth said jake go on i couldnt be number eightysix for the last time bellowed the ring steward it is me said fen and scrambling onto dandelion plonking her hat on her head and not wearing a riding coat she cantered into the ring where she thanked miss bilborough three times for her rosette success went to dandelions head and his feet thinking the lap of honor was a race he barged ahead of the other three winners carting fen out of the ring and galloping half round the show ground before she could pull him to a halt in front of jake he shook his head disapprovingly fen giggled wouldnt it be lovely if africa got one too the afternoon wore on getting hotter the lady mayoress sweating in her scarlet robes had a bright yellow nose from sniffing lady dorothys lilies the band was playing land of hope and glory in the main ring as the fences for the open jumping were put up the sun glinting on their brass instruments mrs thomson and mrs maxwell moved their deck chairs to the right following the sun and agreed that jake was extremely rude im going to have a word with joyce wilton about it said molly maxwell horse horse horse said mr thomson i can never get fen to wear a dress shes never been interested in dolls said molly maxwell who was still crowing over fens rosette im pleased sally ann has not lost her femininity said mrs thomson its extraordinary how many people read the tatler said mrs maxwell mrs squires to the judges tent announced the address system miss squires miss squires snapped the hairnetted lady judge stumping across the ring wasnt dandelion wonderful said fen for the hundreth time tory could feel the sweat dripping between her breasts and down her ribs shed taken off her red jacket and hung her white shirt outside over the straining safety pin competitors in the open jumping were pulling on long black boots the women tucking long hair into hairnets and hotting up their horses over the practice fence with first prize there was a lot of competition from neighboring counties two wellknown show jumpers lavinia greenslade and christopher crossley whod both jumped at wembley and for the british junior team had entered but local hopes were pinned on sir williams son michael who was riding a gray sixyearold called prescott armored cars and tanks had started driving up the hill for the dry shoot and the recruiting display soldiers sweating in battle dress were assembling twentyfive pounders in ring two christ here comes carters circus said malise gordon to miss squires hope he can keep them under control my chaps have arrived said colonel carter to mrs maxwell im just going to wander over and see that everythings all right jake gave africa a last polish tory noticing his dead white face shaking hands and chattering teeth realized how terrified he was and felt sorry for him he put a foot in the stirrup and was up if only i werent so frightened of horses i might not be frightened of life thought tory cringing against the rope to avoid these great snorting beasts with their huge iron feet and so much power in their gleaming barging quarters the band went out to much applause and to everyones dismay came back again jake rode up to tory and jumped off can you hold her for a minute he said hurling the reins at her he only just made the gents in time looking into the deep dark dell of the elsan and catching a whiff of the contents he was violently sick again he must pull himself together or africa would sense his nerves mrs wilton wouldnt find out the kids could cope in the gymkhana events for half an hour by themselves hed be all right once he got into the ring hed walked the course there was nothing africa couldnt jump if he put her right he leant against the canvas and wondered if he dared risk another cigarette tory was not happy excited by the microphone and the armored cars and the crowds africa pulled and fretted as she jogged up and down thanks very much said jake taking the horse from her tory looked at his white face and chattering teeth and felt so sorry for him i get just the same before dances she blurted out jake smiled slightly take your partners for the torture chamber he said mounting africa again he rode very short almost jockey length crouching over the mare like a cat settling down into the creaking leather africa a netted cord of veins rippling under her shining coat tugged at the reins now this way now that trying to catch jake out she danced over the grass shying at the tea tent the ladies lavatory the flags jake didnt move in the saddle christopher crossley the goodlooking boy on the chestnut with four white socks cantered past startling africa who bucked and swished her tail jake swore at him jake rides lovely doesnt he sighed fen even torys uncritical eye could see that he rode wonderfully lightly his hands hardly touched africas mouth taking her away from the crowd he popped her over a couple of practice fences colonel carter sat down beside molly maxwell announcing that his chaps were itching to get started at that moment a competitor on a huge gray paused in front of them to chat to some friends the gray promptly stuck out its penis mrs maxwell caught the colonels eye and giggled arent horses rude the colonel gave a bark of embarrassed laughter mrs maxwell found she couldnt stop giggling tears were making her mascara run the band was playing a selection from the merry widow delia oh delia sang colonel carter brushing his khaki leg against her silken thigh will you be able to get out again this evening he asked molly stopped giggling with a little hiccup oh toryll babysit thats one way shes useful oh dear i dont mean to be bitchy you never say an unkind word about anyone no thought molly perhaps i dont the colonel looked at his watch half an hour to blast off he said i hope malise gordon gets his finger out there were nine jumps in all a brush fence a stile a gate parallel bars the roadclosed sign put up to a nasty five foot another brush with a pole on top a water jump which had been drained by various dogs a wall and a triple the two stars lavinia greenslade and christopher crossley stood side by side slightly apart from the other competitors the jumps are much too low and flimsy said lavinia bound to be loads of clear wounds we wont get away for at least an hour and i did want to look in at henwiettas dwinks party not much competition anyway said christopher adding to the groom who was holding his horse cindy can you adjust that bandage the first competitor trotted out an enormously fat girl with a huge bosom give herself a couple of black eyes every time she jumps with those boobs said christopher the girl went clear i told you there were going to be loads of clear wounds said lavinia petulantly i cant see i cant see said fen in a shrill voice you come through here then said a man on a shooting stick making a gap in the crowd through which fen dragged a desperately embarrassed tory to the ropes a chestnut came in ridden by a boy with a big nose who jabbed his horse in the mouth over every fence jumps well said tory horse does said fen rider should be shot bloody hell she added as he went clear the man on the shooting stick whod let fen through looked at her with less indulgence lavinia greenslade was next the gray peering seductively through the long forelock of its mane arab ears curling upwards like eyelashes her father spends a fortune on her horses said fen that one was third at the horse of the year show last year sure enough the gray bounced serenely round the course like a pingpong ball followed by sir williams son who also went clear to the course builders relief a man came in on a horse wearing so much leather it looked like a bondage victim and proceeded to demolish the course completely fear traveled through the collecting ring and for a dozen rounds no one went clear the wall the principal bogey had to be laboriously rebuilt each time colonel carter looked at his watch five minutes to go time and the colonel waited for no malise gordon lavinias boyfriend christopher then went in and killed the jinx by jumping a very fast clear round jake envied the casual way he threw his whip to his groom slid off the horse and went back to the ringside to join lavinia and watch the rest of the rounds the next competitor was an old woman in a hairnet with raddled face scarlet lipstick and withered cheeks embedded with rouge shes only seven stone said the man whod let fen through half of thats makeup muttered fen the old lady rode as if she was steering a rollsroyce her cob went clear without any visible effort jakes after this said fen as a girl with a bun escaping from her hairnet came in on a mangy brown mare and proceeded to scatter every fence as she came to the wall the mare dug in her toes and skidded four feet into the wall then as the bricks collapsed around her she bolted on to totally demolish the triple oh poor jake said fen as they waited and waited for the course to be repaired at last they called number out came jake from the gap in the crowds his face a gray mask by contrast africa who danced and plunged merry eyes gleaming at the crowd coat rippling like a furniture polish advertisement looked the picture of joy jack lovette said dudley diplock from brook farm riding school not another one malise gordon groaned inwardly tory could see jakes lips constantly moving as he reassured africa only time he talks is to horses grumbled fen once in the ring jake found his nerves had gone he shortened his reins and stood up in the stirrups africa bounded towards the first fence too quick muttered fen but africa was over safely and jakes eyes were already trained on the post and rails ahead which she cleared easily at the gate catching sight of a balloon in the crowd she stopped concentrating and rapped her hock hard the gate swung but miraculously didnt come down thatll teach her said fen as africa dragged her leg for a couple of paces rides well said a voice in the crowd horse carrying a lot of condition isnt that jake lovell said molly maxwell africa slowed down at the wall then changed her mind and cleared it with a violent jerky cat jump which would have unseated most riders havent seen that boy before thought malise handles that horse very well shes not at all an easy ride with increasing pleasure he watched africa clear the post and rails and the parallel bars and sail over the water jump and the wall but as jake turned her towards the triple malise realized it was unnaturally high one of the arena stewards whod been crossed in love and in the beer tent all afternoon had just seen his beloved saunter past on the arm of a rival and had put the top bar up to six feet malise gordon stepped forward to protest but it was too late africa had turned and was approaching the triple at a steeplechasers pace her feet drumming on the ground fighting for her head steady darling crooned jake the top bar white against pitted graygreen turf was higher than africas ears for a second she hesitated caught on a short stride then like a helicopter rising off her hocks she made a colossal jump it seemed to the gaping crowd that she had taken off like a bird into the sky and bore no relation to the white poles below her christ said malise at the same time sir williams binoculars fastened on africa he checked his program from brook farm riding school of all unlikely places she might do very well for mikey next season the crowd gave a long sigh of rapture and sent up a great cheer colonel carter looked at his watch bloody good round said christopher crossley jake jumped off africa patting her determined not to betray the surge of exultation that was sweeping over him thats it malise gordon told the arena party restrict it to six jumps raise the pole over the first jump and the gate put another row of bricks on the wall and put the triple at five feet buck up or carter will start letting off his guns thats seven clear rounds said fen counting on her fingers colonel carter heaved himself out of his deck chair are you off said molly enemy wouldnt wait would they the men will start the display in ten minutes he said striding past malise dont be bloody silly snapped malise if you fire a single shot before the last horse has jumped youll cause chaos and accidents quarter of an hour should give you ample time ill send someone to give you the okay colonel carter ground his big yellow teeth he was tired last night with molly had been wonderful but rather exhausting he hadnt had much sleep the effects of sir williams hospitality at lunchtime had worn off and worst of all he resented malises complete refusal to take his display seriously in ring three near the chestnut trees the gymkhana events were already starting with a burst of music for musical chairs can you help me saddle up swindle mr lovell said patty beasley give me quarter of an hour said jake the horses waited in the collecting ring maddened by flies the heat and the rumble of approaching thunder if you win will you tell mrs wilton asked fen god no if she knew how good africa was shed persuade bobby to sell wish i could buy her myself but id have to win the football pools or marry an heiress marry tory said fen with a giggle shes going to be frightfully rich one day and you could keep lots of horses and i could come and live with you fen said tory going crimson she was a champion blusher thought jake fen watched sally ann thomson bumping off to take part in the musical chairs good thing mrs wiltons in brighton she said shed be jolly cross if she knew you werent keeping your eyes on her darling pupils mrs wilton eased her car through the traffic it had been a most unsatisfactory day her rich homosexual uncle irritated by the heat and the stubbornness of his male hairdresser friend had been so quarrelsome at lunchtime that she had walked out in a huff one look at brighton beach packed with day trippers avid for time in the sun and she had decided to drive back home to avoid the rushhour traffic the journey in fact had been so easy that she decided to look in at the bilborough show it never hurt to turn up unexpectedly it kept jake up to the mark she rummaged in her bag for lipstick and applied it without even looking in the mirror colonel carters blood pressure rose with the temperature bugger malise gordon he would not only lose the respect of his soldiers dying of the heat in their battle dress but also of the sizable crowd whod turned up at five to witness some bangs and were now drifting away people are getting bored with waiting sir said his adjutant take this to colonel gordon said colonel carter handing him a note the guns will be fired at seventeentwenty hours carter it was just like the charge of the light brigade thought the young soldier as he returned two minutes later with the same bit of paper on the back of which malise gordon had scrawled imperative to wait end of last round gordon colonel carter tore up the note in a fury the girl with the big boobs had seven faults sir williams son had eight the horse whose rider jabbed him in the mouth had had enough and refused the brush fence twice the stile once and was eliminated the old lady covered in makeup went next she took a brick off the wall and knocked the bar of the triple mrs wilton parked her car it looked as though the open jumping was still going colonel carter examined his watch christopher crossley was about to start his round shall we divide lavinia he said if we both go clear fire the word of command rang out on the midgy steamy air crash went the twentyfive pounders causing immediate pandemonium in the collecting rings horses rearing bucking plunging and scattering the crowd lavinia greenslades gray was barging about like a dodgem car with rabies jake jumped straight off africa and was clinging on to her bridle trying to calm her white with anger malise gordon left miss squires and the green baize table and sprinted across to ring two where he was joined by sir william asking what the hell is going on that megalomaniac carter said malise striding up to colonel carter what the bloody hell are you playing at stop those guns at once colonel carters reply was drowned in another crash a horse that had dumped its rider bolted past them reins and stirrups flying followed by the girl with the big boobs who was also being carted look at that said malise therell be a serious accident in a minute your people should be able to control their mounts said colonel carter if youre incapable of keeping to a time schedule you should accept the consequences another gun exploded think you might hang on five minutes carter said sir william only three horses left to jump hold your fire colonel said the lady mayoress who had put her hands over her ears carter decided he was outnumbered all right if you want to make a mockery of the whole display well wait another ten minutes maniac said christopher crossley whose horse was leaping around as if someone was burning the grass under its feet its nostrils as red as a poppy jake who was trying to sooth a trembling sweating africa admired the way christopher went into the ring and jumped a beautiful round only taking a brick out of the wall lavinia greenslades gray however whod been completely unhinged by the guns crashed round the course leaving it as if an earthquake had hit it once again jake had to wait until it was repaired the strain telling on both his and africas nerves bad luck said christopher crossley as lavinia rode out looking furious im going to object she said molly maxwell joined colonel carter are you having a ceasefire she said with a giggle bloody gordon insisted on finishing his jumping you should have started half an hour ago said molly i wouldnt stand for that wellington would never have taken waterloo that way oh my god gasped fen seeing mrs wilton pushing briskly through the crowd look whos over there tory shell go potty if she sees jake wed better distract her hello mrs wilton we thought you were in brighton decided to come back had a good day i was fourth in the junior jumping your first rosette well done has anyone else done anything fen shook her head wheres jake supervising the gymkhana events i think said tory desperately yes he is come and find him and on the way you can see how sweet dandelion looks in his rosette said fen seizing mrs wiltons red hand and then come and see mummy i know she wants to buy you a drink you must be hot after your journey she looked a picture of guilt as the words came tumbling out what happened in the open jumping its finished said fen the course had been set to rights in you go said the collecting ring steward jake rode quietly into the ring thats a nice horse thought malise oh theres one more competitor said mrs wilton come and see dandelion said fen desperately why its jake said mrs wilton in tones of outrage and hes riding africa africa bounded up to the first fence as tense as a catapult at full stretch the ten minutes were up fire said colonel carter for the second time the gun went off like a clap of thunder a dog bolted into the ring barking hysterically a child dropped its ice cream and let out a wail of rage africa went straight up on her hind legs eyes rolling in terror and dropping again with a bound bolted towards the first fence clearing it by inches jake sat down in the saddle and tried to hold her another gun went off africa crashed into the gate and sent the stile flying the crowd looked on helpless tory and fen watched frozen with horror as the maddened mare swung around the corner with jake hauling futilely on the bit aware only of africas hooves thundering on the dry earth and the white terrified faces flashing past as she raced for the triple ten yards off another gun went off jake tried to check her but shed missed her stride and took it completely wrong jumping sideways and catching her foreleg in the wing of the jump the crowd gave a moan of terror africa lay under three poles legs flailing like a centipede making desperate attempts to get up jake staggered groggily to his feet stars in his head praying against hope that africa hadnt broken a leg he lurched towards her still holding on to the reins another gun went off africa threw off the poles and struggled to her feet standing trembling all over holding up her off hind hoof malise ran up you all right he said jake nodded not so sure about the horse cant put her foot down malise took africas bridle stroking her gently then he led her forward a step africa hobbled then stopped malise ran his hand down the foot she winced but let him touch it nothing broken might have pulled a tendon better get the vet another gun went off africa trembled violently but was finished sorry about that said malise she jumped very well in the first round look sit down on the grass he added as jake started to sway but the next moment mrs wilton rolled up marching with a far more military stride than colonel carter so this is what you get up to when im away she shouted how dare you jump that horse how dare you jake looked at her through a haze of pain he saw her red angry face like a baron of beef receding and coming towards him leave him alone snapped malise cant you see hes in a state of shock mrs wilton turned on malise furiously jake said nothing and after another look at africas foot led her hobbling out of the ring mrs wilton followed him shouting abuse she wanted to sack him on the spot but she couldnt afford to as thered be no one except that halfwit alison who only worked part time to look after the horses grooms were so hard to get shed have to ask her copywriting brother to write a witty advertisement for horse and hound she supposed it was her fault for being too lenient with jake she should never have offered him a drink in the evenings as he came out of the ring fen rushed forward oh poor jake are you all right are you concussed can you remember what day of the week it is and what you had for lunch next minute mrs thomson came roaring up there was no one to help sally ann in the bending shes fallen off and hurt her arm oh youre back joyce she added in relief things will go more smoothly from now on tory felt so sorry for jake gray and shaking and the recipient of such a torrent of abuse from mrs wilton and mrs thomson christopher crossley passed them going into the ring to collect first prize he pulled up his chestnut horse for a minute that was bloody bad luck he said and thats a very nice mare if you ever want to sell her im in the north hampshire telephone directory under crossley those bloody soldiers should turn the guns on themselves jake nodded as they approached the horse lines fen gave a scream dandelion hes not there rushing forward she found his head collar still tied to the fence hes a valuable horse now that hes a prize winner she wailed hes probably been kidnapped after a nasty quarter of an hour in which mrs wilton trailed after jake calling him every name under the sun dandelion was discovered in the brave new world of lady dorothys vegetable garden having laid waste to the herbaceous border dug holes in the newly sprinkled lawn cut a swathe through the rose beds and deformalized the formal garden dandelion was now imitating an untamed bronco galloping about snorting showing the whites of his eyes with a large carrot sticking out of his mouth like a cigar every time jake or fen got close he whisked out of range snatching bites to eat he looks like the hamlet advertisement said fen quite hysterical with giggles by the time jake had caught him abuse from lady dorothy mrs wilton and mrs thomson was cascading over his head like niagara at last it was time to go home africa had been checked by the vet who said she was suffering a bad sprain no more and should be rested malise gordon then hurried home himself because he was going to the theater fen had come second in the potato race and was in a state of ecstasy miss bilborough had a date with one of colonel carters men dudley diplock had been asked for his autograph three times but had not been thanked for doing the commentary back at brook farm riding school a still dizzy jake was sorting out the ponies hear youre in the doghouse said alison the irish girl who helped out at weekends old ma wiltons hopping i knew shed catch you out sooner or later jake didnt answer he was putting a poultice on africa hed already rubbed one of his gypsy medicines ointment made from marshmallow flowers gently into her leg he was finally sweeping up at about ninethirty when mrs wilton turned up her faced looked unappetizingly magenta in the naked lightbulb of the tackroom and he could smell whisky on her breath i want to talk to you jake she said speaking slowly to show she was quite sober do you realize youve ruined the reputation of brook farm riding school what reputation said jake you cant descend from the basement dont be cheeky no need to answer back jake swept up the straw on the floor phrases like absolute shambles endangering best horse in the yard and duty to our young pupils flowed over his head his face had taken on an almost asiatic aloofness why cant he ever show any contrition thought mrs wilton if he apologized just once it would make a difference the diatribe continued taking advantage wonder whos employing whom use my house as an hotel after all ive done for you jake mimicked her under his breath oh god she was getting very close now he hoped she wasnt going to start anything im very disappointed in you jake she went on i really trusted you gave you some responsibility and you just kick me in the teeth yet i still feel deep down that you really like me for a second her voice was almost obscenely conciliatory no i dont jake said flatly deep down its much worse mrs wilton caught her breath next minute vindictiveness was warming her blood she played her trump card youd better get africas leg better she wont be with us much longer jake looked up eyes narrowed that jolted him she thought sir williams just rung i thought he was going to raise hell about lady dorothys garden but he only wanted to know how africa was and if wed be interested in selling he wants her for his youngest son to hunt next season she might do very well with a decent rider on her back turning she walked unsteadily out of the tackroom jake felt suddenly exhausted near to tears overwhelmed with black despair going out of the tackroom he walked down past the loose boxes until he came to africa even though she was feeding she left her manger and hobbled over to him whickering with joy nuzzling at his pockets he put his arms round her neck and she laid her head against his cheek soppy old thing shed stay like that for hours breathing softly while he scratched her behind the ears in his mind he jumped that beautiful first round again reliving that wonderful amazing last jump what a star she was he couldnt give her up and he knew more than ever that the only thing he could ever be in this world was a show jumper working for mrs wilton for over a year he was constantly aware of time running past time wasted he had left the orphanage at eighteen and spent two years in a racing stable it was there he made the discovery that difficult horses became easy when he rode them and that he could communicate with them as he never could with people even having his first girl and subsequently others wasnt nearly as exciting as that sudden breakthrough when a horse that had been written off as hopeless became responsive under his touch finally there was the joy over the past months of discovering africa and slowly realizing how good she was it was worth putting up with the horrible little girls and their frightful mothers no mother had ever protected and fussed over him like they did he thought bitterly and now hed blown it it was only a matter of time before mrs wilton sacked him he supposed he could get another job as a groom but not as a rider africa nuzzled him gently im still here she seemed to say but not for much longer sighed jake although ill fight like a bugger to keep you tory maxwell lay on her bed bitterly ashamed of herself for eating three helpings of strawberries and cream she looked around her extremely tidy bedroom and wished she had a photograph of jake the scent of lilac and lilies of the valley kept drifting in from outside as insistently he kept drifting into her thoughts not that he had noticed her his eyes had flickered over her as a man flips past the womans fashion page in his daily paper knowing it has nothing to interest him her mother had gone out with that monstrous murderer colonel carter after what hed done to jake tory couldnt bring herself even to talk to him how could her mother sleep with him she imagined him climbing on top of her like an ancient dinosaur looking in the mirror she tried on a different colored lipstick and put her hands over the sides of her round face if she were thinner she might just be pretty out of the window against a brilliant drained sapphire sky she could see the sliver of a pale new moon followed by a little star just like me following jake she thought oh please she prayed give me jake lovell and then i could buy him all the horses he wants colonel carter and mrs maxwell were on their third gin and tonic in the bar of the grand hotel guildford they had pulled malise and jake to shreds had a good bitch about sir william and lady dorothy and were in a mood of great mutual selfcongratulation about having found each other youre looking particularly lovely tonight said colonel carter he always says that thought molly but then perhaps its true she caught sight of her glossy reflection in the rosetinted bar mirror what should she wear to get married in perhaps oyster silk with a matching hat it couldnt be the same thing she wore to torys party in future the colonel could cope with all her bills in the corner the pianist who had unnaturally vermilion hair was playing someone to watch over me just a little lamb thats lost in the wood sang the colonel it was nice to take an attractive woman out again he had always been unfaithful to jennifer his wife but it had been a shock when she died shed done everything for him i was very lonely when jennifer died he said i was very lonely when alastair died said molly no reason to add that she and alastair had been divorced for six years before he was killed in that car crash it was so much more romantic to be a widow than a divorcée the waiter presented them with a huge menu which they studied with too much attention colonel carter in particular noting the prices for people in love im glad i stood up to that bastard gordon he said i wish i knew where id gone wrong with tory said molly maxwell in the bedroom down the passage from torys lay fen shed been sent to bed in disgrace for cheeking colonel carter about frightening africa with his twentyfive pounders her bed was full of biscuit crumbs and she was reading the maltese cat for the hundredth time with a flashlight she turned the flashlight on her rosettes white and blue then looking out of the window caught sight of the new moon make me the greatest show jumper in the world she wished sunday started badly for tory maxwell unable to sleep she had heard the floorboards outside her room creaking as the colonel crept out at dawn but he was back by twelvethirty spruced up in clean clothes mustache brushed and bearing a bottle of gin and he and molly maxwell sat out on the terrace drinking dry martinis while tory cooked the lunch as i have to fork out so much for this cookery and typing course said molly i might as well make use of her what a charming garden said the colonel the lawn needs mowing hinted molly maxwell but i seem to have so little time this summer the white sauce for the cauliflower went lumpy because tory was trying at the same time to read a piece in one of the color supplements on debs delights the piece included a profile of rupert campbellblack after three years in the blues he was now too busy making a name for himself as a show jumper to go to many deb parties but whenever he did he caused a rumpus you can say that again sighed tory adding more milk to the sauce she had been a victim of ruperts bitchy asides on numerous occasions he had got that blank stare of complete indifference to perfection the sight of his cold arrogant face looking out at her made her feel quite sick particularly as her mother thought he was absolutely charming and kept nagging tory to ring him up and make sure hed got the invitation and was coming to torys drinks party tory was dreading the party she didnt think anyone would come and she was sensitive enough to realize that although some of the fathers and the young men flirted with her mother the mothers thought her pushy and jumped up at onethirty although fen still wasnt back from the stables they started lunch colonel carter carved conditioned by wartime austerity he cut very thin slices tory noticed he touched her mothers hand when he passed her a plate she knew they found her presence a strain her mother found fault with everything the white sauce was too lumpy and thin the meat overdone and the roast potatoes soggy molly who wanted the colonel to think she had an appetite like a sparrow pushed hers to the side of her plate i dont mean to nag she said to tory but one day youll get married and have to cook for some chap and hell expect decent grub some hope thought tory as she cleared away in an excess of misery she ate the two roast potatoes her mother had rejected and two more left in the dish when her mother came in weighed down by the gravy boat as an excuse to powder her nose in the kitchen mirror tory had to swallow frantically halfway through the pudding when molly was grumbling that the meringue was just like toffee fen walked in with a filthy face and hands and the same shirt shed been wearing the day before so triggering off a storm of reproof which fen accepted with equanimity the colonel droned on about bridge jolly good roast potatoes said fen are there any more there were two in the dish said molly tory blushed i threw them away i bet you ate them snapped molly really tory dyou want to look like a house for your drinks party did you have a good ride fenella asked colonel carter not very said fen jake was in a foul temper nothing new said molly would you like some stilton bernard hardly surprising said fen glaring at colonel carter africa might have been ruined for life shut up snapped her mother malise gordon dropped in to see if africa was all right but jake says both he and sir william are after her its a rotten shame jakes worked so hard on her no one gets her going better than he does and hes got the most awful lot to take out this afternoon fat grownups who cant ride and in this heat theyve booked for a whole two hours im going back to help him after lunch you are not said molly maxwell firmly you spend too much time hanging round that place youre coming out to eat with the braithwaites whatever for wailed fen because they asked us tory as well no torys got to do her homework and write her thankyou letters its not fair i loathe melanie braithwaite shes a drip and shes not my age molly maxwell insisted on taking fen with them as otherwise she would have had to go back to the colonels house on the way home and spend an hour in bed with him that was the tiresome thing about men she thought they always wanted bed all the time and she so much preferred the flirting and the wining and dining tory watched fen scrubbed and mutinous in a new dress being dragged off to the braithwaites she then wrote five thankyou letters in her round careful hand and then accepted four more invitations being fat and plain and no threat to prettier girls and because many of the debs mothers had known and liked her father she was asked to quite a lot of parties each one spelled disaster im like a terrible first night but first nights are lucky enough to fold while i have to flop on forever she said to herself letters finished she started on her homework gazing at a page of shorthand until the heavy and light lines swam before her eyes we are in receipt of your favor yours faithfully yours truly she wrote oh shed be faithful and true to jake then she wrote jake in shorthand the dark backward sloping j and light horizontal k on the line with two little commas underneath to show it was a proper name then she wrote lovell it was the same sign as lovely he was lovely too she tried to visualize his face but she could only picture his body and a blur she felt impossibly restless the telephone interrupted her daydreams perhaps by a miracle it might be him but it was only her mother saying that the braithwaites wanted to play bridge and had pressed them to stay on for an early supper so theyd be home at about ten and could tory do fens packed lunch and see that she had a clean tunic and leotard for tomorrow poor trapped fen thought tory the evening stretched ahead of her jake would be back from his ride now and settling the horses the longing became too much for her shed nip down to the stables on the excuse that fen might have left her whip behind quickly she washed her hair her mother liked it drawn back from her forehead but today she was jolly well going to let it flop loose if only she had a slimming black dress but her mother said she was too young and anyway she couldnt go down to the stables dressed as though for a funeral ponchos were fashionable as if they covered all the spare tires but when they slid down on the shoulders they showed her bra straps and if she didnt wear a bra she flopped all over the place if only she had a waist she could wear a long skirt to cover her fat legs but it made her look like a barrel in the end she gave up and wore a navy blue tshirt outside her jeans her hand was shaking so much she couldnt do up the clasp of her pearls so she left them off in a fit of loathing she drenched herself in her mothers scent and as it was drizzling slightly borrowed her mothers white trench coat with the belt trendily done up at the back it didnt matter if it didnt meet over her bust as she passed the church people were coming out of evensong putting up umbrellas on the village green cricketers huddled disconsolately into the pavilion hoping the apricot glow on the horizon meant that the rain was about to stop and they could finish their game the brook farm riding school tackroom was overcrowded but very tidy saddles and bridles occupying one wall food bins another and medicines principally jakes gypsy remedies yet another room had also been found for a few faded rosettes and old calendars the order book was open sunday full of bookings had been crossed off monday was comparatively empty except for a group of children who wanted to ride after school jake sat on a rickety chair cleaning a bridle and reading the color supplement piece on rupert campbellblack the bastard was obviously going to make it in show jumping just when jakes world seemed to be falling apart throwing him straight down to the bottom of the ladder without even being within clutching distance of the first rung the twohour ride had really taken it out of him his head was pounding and every muscle in his body felt bruised by the fall yesterday after a nights rest and jakes marshmallow ointment africas lameness had nearly gone mrs wilton had gloatingly told him of malises interest that morning and sir william had just rung again no one could do anything about it as bobby cotterel was in france till the end of the week but it was only a matter of time he heard a step and looking up through the dusty cobwebbed window saw fens fat sister approaching that was all he needed now she was stopping to comb her hair then her great blushing face like a dutch cheese appeared round the door yes he said bleakly did i mean i was wondering she stammered if fen left her whip here the feebleness of the excuse made her blush even more it was er one our grandmother gave her for christmas so she was worried i havent seen it shes so scatty she probably dropped it on the way home how pinched and dark under the eyes he looked thought tory the red check shirt and the black hair only emphasizing his pallor sympathy overcame her shyness im so sorry about people wanting to buy africa fen told me jake nodded she shifted from one foot to another and jake was enveloped in a waft of mollys scent which did not evoke happy memories is her leg better shes all right why was she hanging round like a great blancmange getting up he ran the sponge under the tap and plunged it into the saddle soap adding the whip it isnt here tory gazed at her feet twisting a button on mrs maxwells mac then she noticed what he was reading oh theres rupert campbellblack horrible man jake looked up slightly more accommodating tory blushed again im sorry is he a friend of yours there was a pause i hate his guts said jake oh so do i said tory hes so vicious and contemptuous and well bloodyminded how did you come across him we were at school together tory looked amazed prep school added jake i was a day boy mum was the cook so the headmaster let me in free oh goodness he must have been an absolutely poisonous small boy taking a nail jake pushed out the saddle soap that had got stuck in the cheekstrap holes poisonous he agreed he made eichmann look like a fairy godmother hes so rich said tory that lots of mothers are after him but hes only after one thing whats that said jake to embarrass her tory swallowed well bed and things hes awfully promiscuous she pronounced it promisekewus and he never answers invitations just rolls up with his current girlfriend and leaves after half an hour if hes bored he let off thunderflashes at queen charlottes lady surrey was livid he obviously hasnt changed said jake i should have thought harrow or the army might have knocked it out of him i think it made him worse sighed tory he gets a little gang of cronies round him and manages to be even nastier nothing unites people like a good bitch jake let her rattle on as he put the bridle together again and hung it up then he went to reapply africas poultice tory followed him longingly watching the tender way his hands ran over the mare caressing her polished shoulder and her sleek veined legs africa nuzzled him breathing through her velvet nostrils with love and trust shes so beautiful said tory wistfully the swelling had practically disappeared jake redid the bandages and readjusted her summer rug he wished tory would buzz off and leave him alone to nurse his misery as he came out of the stable shutting the door behind him the rain stopped he looked at her round anxious face her clean flopping hair and enormous bosom straining against the dark blue tshirt there was kindness in her eyes he looked at his watch lets go and have a drink tory looked at him stupidly a drink he repeated mockingly the pubs are open youre eighteen arent you yes of course i am gosh thanks awfully as they walked to the pub jake noticed the hawthorns were rusting slightly but still smelt like fresh soap and the wet hot nettles gave off a heady blackcurrant scent the cricketers were running out onto the pitch anxious to get all the game they could into the last half hour it was the first time tory had been taken by a man into a pub in fact the first time a man had voluntarily asked her out at all my first date she thought excitedly an old woman was buying guinness and putting it in a black canvas bag in the corner two men with sunreddened faces their wives wearing white cardigans and lots of cheap jewelry had decided to break their journey on the way back to london and were drinking pimms what on earth was she going to drink she hated beer her mother said gin and orange was common and she knew bucks fizz involved champagne which was expensive her mind was a complete blank she looked desperately around id like a pimms she said jake sighed hed hoped shed drink something cheap like cider or better still orange juice that meant hed have to have beer instead of the double whisky he so badly needed tory sat down the furry moquette of the bench seat scratching her thighs the pub was cool and dark and restful inside the side door had been fastened back and outside was a little garden full of wallflowers and irises and pale pink clematis scrambling over some rustic poles at first the conversation was very stilted but after a couple of pimms torys tongue was loosened and suddenly like a washing machine thats been tugged open halfway through its cycle everything came gushing out what a disaster she was at dances how she hated her finishing school how ghastly colonel carter was and how she couldnt get on with her mother mummy likes fen because shes pretty and funny and because shes so young but im an embarrassment to her and living proof that shes over fortyfive she made you go to all these dances because shes looking for a husband said jake dyou think shes found one oh i hope not said tory hes so phony he was hanging a picture for mummy the other day and hit his thumb with the hammer and she went even redder he said booger instead of bugger jake hadnt even brushed his hair before he came out but it fell into place automatically tory ached to touch it she felt as if someone had bewitched her as if she was drowning and there was no coming up even for the third time in a panic she noticed hed finished his drink shed been reading about womens lib and someone called germaine greer it was all right for women to buy drinks these days she got a fiver out of her bag and handed it to jake go on she said with a giggle were all equal jake shrugged and went to the bar the cricketers had finished their game and flocked into the pub and the barmaid was serving them with huge jugs of beer to pass around so it was a few minutes before jake got served tory sat in a haze of happiness the longer he took the longer theyd have she looked at him slumped against the bar he was so thin beside the beefy cricketers she wished she could feed him up she was sure he wouldnt grumble about overdone beef and soggy potatoes on the door near the ladies a group of men were playing darts oh dear cupid had scored a double top straight into her heart jake returned with the drinks and a packet of crisps i dont know why ive been telling you all these things said tory youre the one who needs cheering up but youre such a good listener i get plenty of practice when youve got to take stupid women on long rides you develop a listeners face it doesnt necessarily mean youre listening torys face fell im sorry she said humbly starting to eat the crisps i didnt mean to bore you you havent he said irritably who taught you to ride she asked my father he put me on a pony almost before i could walk how long ago did he die said tory i dont know that hes dead tory looked startled he was a gypsy he met my mother when he was hoppicking on parttime work her father was the keeper at the big house he tried to settle down with my mother and get a steady job but it was like caging a lark one day the wanderlust became too strong so he walked out when i was about eight years old you must have missed him i did the third pint of beer had loosened his tongue and the world seemed a more hospitable place so did my mother she cried a lot behind locked doors and my grandfather went through all the photograph albums cutting my fathers picture out of the family groups so you might suddenly bump into him one day i doubt it said jake although he never passed a gypsy encampment or a fairground without having a look was he very goodlooking my mother thought so two years after he left she waved me off to school and said shed be in to cook the school dinner later then she put some cushions in front of the gas oven and that was that all i remember is that all the masters and boys were particularly put out because we were supposed to be having treacle pudding that day he suddenly glared at tory whose eyes had filled with tears what the hell was he telling the soppy cow all this for he hadnt talked about his mother for years tory couldnt bear it hed lost his mother and his father and now he was going to lose africa do you think bobby cotterel will really sell her she asked course he will doesnt give a damn about her he was grumbling the other day because mrs wilton was threatening to put up the livery fees the pub was filling up now and becoming noisy and clamorous tory looked at an obscene pink pile of sausages greasily glinting under a cover on the bar how lovely to see food and for once not feel hungry what will you do if africa goes get another job around here no up north probably i doubt if mrs wilton will give me a reference oh you mustnt said tory aghast i mean its so cold up north i must go to the loo she had difficulty negotiating the way to the ladies cannoning off tables and cricketers like a baby elephant oh hell thought jake as she narrowly missed a flying dart shes pissed tory collapsed onto the loo and realized with the shock from the cold slab under her bottom that the seat cover was still down she lifted it up if i can manage to go on peeing for over twenty seconds jake will take me out again she said to herself by wriggling she made it last for twentytwo when she found she had put her bag in the basin and washed her hands over it she realized she was very tight she couldnt bear jake to go away she pressed her hot forehead against the mirror gypsy jake she murmured to herself then it became plain that she must buy africa she had the money jake could pay her back or she could be the owner and he the jockey she had visions of herself in a big primrose yellow hat leading africa into the winners enclosure with two mounted policemen on either side she was a bit hazy about what went on in show jumping she looked in the telephone directory but there was no bobby cotterel he must be exdirectory but the mayhews had had the house before bobby cotterel she spent ages finding the ms they did come after l didnt they oh god the page was missing no it was the first number on the next page sir edward mayhew bandits court her hand was shaking so much she could hardly dial the number hello said a brusque voice she was so surprised she couldnt speak if thats burglars said the voice im here plus fifteen guard dogs and you can fuck off tory gasped no it isnt she said is that mr cotterel she must speak very slowly and try to sound businesslike jake having finished his glass of beer and ordered a large whisky gazed at his reflection framed by mahogany and surrounded by upsidedown bottles in the mirror behind the bar totally without vanity he looked in mirrors only for identity he had spent too many sundays at the childrens home with scrubbed face and hair plastered down with water in the hope of charming some visitor into fostering or adopting him to have any illusions about his attractiveness come here often said the barmaid who worked in the pub on sunday to boost her wages and in the hope of finding a new boyfriend no said jake he glanced at his watch tory had been away for nearly a quarter of an hour now he hoped the stupid cow hadnt passed out hed need a forklift truck to carry her home he went out to look for her she was standing by the telephone in the passage with her shoes off thats fine she was saying in a careful voice if bobby cotterel had not come back a week early from the south of france because it was so expensive and been promptly faced with a large incometax bill he might not have been in such a receptive mood africa troubled his conscience like his daughters guinea pig whose cage now shed gone back to boarding school needed cleaning out he was not an unkind man this girl sounded a gent and was so anxious to buy africa for four times the price hed paid for her and he wouldnt have to pay any commission to mrs wilton the livery fees paid up for another three weeks he said ill take that over said tory no ill be happy to stand it to you darling can we come round and give you the check now of course come and have a drink but for christs sake dont tell anyone im back tory had had her first date and been called darling and invited for a drink by bobby cotterel she turned towards jake with shining eyes if she lost a couple of hundredweight shed be quite pretty he thought sourly what the hell had she got to look so cheerful about you okay wonderful ive just bought africa whatever for you dont like horses for you of course you can pay me back slowly a pound a week or we can go into partnership ill own her you can ride her a dull red flush had spread across jakes face youre crazy how much did you pay i offered eight hundred and he accepted hes just had a bill for his income tax i said wed take the check around now before mrs wilton starts blabbing about sir william and malise gordon have you got that amount in the bank oh yes i got on my birthday and lots of shares your motherll bust a gut hooray said tory shell say i got you plastered no you did not i did it all off my own bat like those cricketers in the bar she cannoned off a hatstand as she went out of the door jake was finding it impossible to clamber out of the pit of despair so quickly he might at least say thank you thought tory they walked to bobby cotterels house and handed over the check armed with a receipt he walked her home both of them following the white lines in the middle of the road halfshafts of moonlight found their way through the beech trees on either side of the road shimmering on their dark graygreen trunks fortunately the house was still dark oh good said tory i can put back mummys mac before she finds out its missing im going to london tomorrow ive got two awful drinks parties then a dance on wednesday but ill be home on thursday mummy and colonel carter are going out to dinner ive got to babysit perhaps you could come around after theyve gone out and we can decide what to do i think it may be a bit more problematical than that said jake he took the key opened the door for her and turned on the hall light oh god thought tory miserably there was fens whip lying on the hall table beside a wilting bowl of pink peonies jake turned to her a slight smile touching his lips was it contempt or pity or mockery thank you very much he said and was gone fighting back her disappointment that he hadnt attempted to kiss her tory then reflected that she would probably have tasted of onionflavored crisps the drinks parties on monday and tuesday were bad enough for tory but the dance on wednesday was a nightmare at the dinner party beforehand some sadist had seated her next to rupert campbellblack on his right was a ravishing girl named melanie potter whom all the girls were absolutely furious about melanie had upstaged everyone by turning up several weeks after the season began with a suntan acquired from a month in the bahamas rupert had arrived late parking his filthy rollsroyce with the blackedout windows across the pavement he then demanded tomato ketchup in the middle of dinner and proceeded to drench his sea trout with it which everyone except his hostess and tory thought wildly funny naturally hed ignored tory all the way through dinner but there was something menacing about that broad black back and beautifully shaped blond head a totally deceptive languor concealing the rampant sexuality she wondered what he would have done if shed tapped him on the shoulder and told him she was the owner of an horse then they went on to the dance and she somehow found herself piled into ruperts rollsroyce driving through the laburnumand lilaclined streets of chelsea she had to sit on some young boys knee trying to put her feet on the ground and all her weight on them but she still heard him complaining to rupert afterwards that his legs were completely numb and about to drop off the hostess was kind but too distraught about gatecrashers to introduce tory to more than two young men who both as usual danced one dance then led her back and propped her against a pillar like an old umbrella pretending they were just off to get her a drink or had to dance with their hostess thinking about jake nonstop didnt insulate her from the misery of it all it made it almost worse obviously it was impossible that he should ever care for her if no one else wanted her why should he feeling about as desirable as a christmas tree on twelfth night she was sitting by herself at the edge of the ballroom when a handsome boy sauntered towards her reprieve at last excuse me he said oh yes please said tory if no ones using this he said could i possibly borrow it and picking up the chair beside her he carried it back across the room and sat down on the edge of the yelling group around rupert campbellblack as soon as they got to the dance rupert had abandoned his dinner party and taking melanie had gone off to get drunk with his inseparable chum billy lloydfoxe who was in another party now he was sitting cigar drooping out of his handsome curling mouth wearing melanies feather boa while she sat on his knee shrieking with laughter with the pink rose from his buttonhole behind her ear later billy lloydfoxe passed tory on the way to the lavatory and on the way back struck by conscience asked her to dance she liked billy everyone did she liked his turneddown eyes and his broken nose and his air of life being a little bit too much for him but everything was spoilt when rupert and melanie got onto the floor rupert his blue eyes glittering swinging melanies boa round like the pantomime cats tail had danced around behind torys back pulling faces and puffing out his cheeks to look fat like tory and make billy laugh tory escaped to the loo shaking she found her dinner party hostesss daughter repairing her makeup and chuntering with a couple of friends over the effrontery of melanie potter her mother did it on purpose what chance have any of us got against a suntan like that she turned up at the patelys drinks party wearing jeans lady surrey was absolutely livid at that moment melanie potter walked in and went over to the mirror where she examined a huge love bite on her shoulder and tried to cover it with powder you havent got anything stronger have you she asked tory humbly tory passed her a stick of erace oh how marvelous thats amazingly kind you were on ruperts other side at dinner werent you she added wincing as she blotted out the red oval of tooth marks isnt he a sod ive just emptied a bucket of ice over him for biting me she handed back the erace to tory and combed her platinum blond hair more seductively over one eye he and billy are taking me to tramps now why dont you come too david baileys going to be there rupe wants him to photograph me and when tory refused insisting she was going home now because she had a headache she only just persuaded melanie not to make rupert give her a lift home unfortunately tory found a taxi all too easily when she got back to the flat which molly maxwell had borrowed from a friend for the summer it was only eleventhirty she found her mother and the colonel on the sofa the colonel was wearing a lot more lipstick than her mother tory went to her room and as quietly as possible cried herself to sleep she woke as she had on the last four mornings with a terrible sense of unease that her mother would find out about africa she came home in the evening to babysit and went up to her room to change and have a bath it was still ludicrously hot dont use all the water called out her mother through the crack in the door tory could see her lying on her peach chintz counterpane rigid under a face pack tory was undressed down to her bra and panties and hoping as shed hardly eaten since her evening with jake that she might have lost a bit of weight when she heard the telephone ring and her mother answering it in a selfconsciously seductive voice hello then more matteroffact oh hello mrs wilton how are you there was a long pause then molly said no it couldnt possibly be her torys terrified of horses maxwells quite a common name you know well just wait while i shut the door tory felt as though icy water was being dripped slowly down her spine she was tempted to climb out of the window down the clematis instead she got into bed pulled the duvet over her head and started to shake five minutes later her mother barged in ripping the bedclothes off the bed she was still wearing her face pack like some malignant mime of catastrophe at first she was so angry she couldnt get the words out did you or did you not ring up bobby cotterel on sunday and buy africa she sputtered i dont know what you mean mumbled tory dont lie to me who put you up to it no one its my money why shouldnt i buy a horse if i want to and i cant afford to buy little fen a little pony molly spat out the little get up you fat lump she reached forward and tugged tory to her feet by her hair it was that little swine jake lovell wasnt it no it wasnt course it was molly maxwell was shaking tory by the shoulders until she thought her head would snap off hes obsessed with that horse spends all his time on it but he wont much longer she added her eyes suddenly lighting up with venom mrs wiltons just given him the sack oh no said tory aghast it was nothing to do with him i rang bobby cotterel i did everything myself why hissed molly powder from her drying cracking face pack drifting down to the floor youve got a crush on that boy i saw you mooning over him on saturday at the show thats why youve been such a colossal flop at all those dances not trying with all those suitable young men because youve got hot pants for some common stable boy well you wont get him by buying him expensive presents tory couldnt bear to look at her mother anymore the hideous contrast with the twitching disintegrating white face and the angry red turkey neck she gazed down at her mothers feet noticing the newly painted scarlet nails cotton wool keeping each toe apart hes a friend she sobbed nothing more well hes not having africa hes going back hes a she and shes not sir william and colonel gordon are both prepared to top your offer im going around to see bobby cotterel to make him tear up that check molly pictured herself in a new dress rather low cut driving up to bobby cotterels house and pleading with him my daughters not responsible for her actions and bobby cotterel who she suspected was between marriages would pour her a stiff drink and comfortingly say tell me all about it preferably over dinner she was brought back from her reverie by tory sobbing its my money and i can do what i like with it and how are you going to look after a horse hissed molly it cant live in the potting shed and now jake lovells lost his job hell be moving on tory was in such despair she hardly heard her mothers tirade about all the expense and trouble shed gone to to give tory a season until catching sight of her face which resembled a driedup riverbed in the mirror molly realized she had better get her pack off tugging open the door she found fen whod been listening avidly at the keyhole and nearly fell into the room on top of her fen gave a giggle and waving in time with a halfeaten frozen lolly started singing my mother said that i never should play with the gypsies in the wood shut up screeched molly its your fault too for always hanging round the stables youre not going down there tonight go to your room do your homework and dont talk to tory i must ring bernard i cant possibly go out and play bridge after all this want to bet said fen as her mother went into the bedroom slamming the door behind her immediately they heard the ping of the telephone followed at intervals by other pings molly couldnt get through to bobby cotterel but if she couldnt get him to tear up the check there was always the possibility of reselling africa to sir william or malise that had possibilities too she reflected shed like to meet sir william again and for malise gordon she still had the hankering of the summarily rejected she saw herself with less makeup and a higher neckline than for bobby cotterel and malises hawklike face softening as he took her hand saying when i first met you at bilborough i thought you were just a lovely face after all colonel carter hadnt popped the question it would be good to make him jealous as tory predicted the colonel talked her mother into going out for dinner bernards friends have gone to a lot of trouble cooking and theyd be so disappointed if we cried off at the last moment she told tory coldly as if she was making a supreme effort to go out not that shed enjoy a second of it with all this worry as well as bernards friends cooking on her plate tory was still sitting on her bed in her bra and panties as if turned to stone do you hear me tory im putting you on your honor not to talk to fen and not to telephone anyone or put a foot outside the house while im away she said it three times but she wasnt sure it had registered jake sat in the tackroom chainsmoking and watching the moon peering in through the window round and pink with turneddown eyes in an anxious chubby face it reminded him of tory poor kid he hoped that cow of a mother wasnt giving her too bad a time hed like to have got in touch with her to find out the score but he didnt dare ring the house africa was much better hed turned her out for a few hours and just laid down thick clean straw in her loose box next to the tackroom he was just going to fetch her when he heard a step outside and tory came timidly through the door christ she looked all blotchy like a swede thats been beaten up by the frost the next minute she was sobbing in his arms im so sorry i got you sacked doesnt matter i was going to leave anyway plenty more fishwives in the sea but you havent anywhere to go mrs wilton cant chuck me out till shes found someone else shes too idle and its too late to put an ad in horse and hound this week so ive got a bit of time did your mother give you a hard time tory nodded shes determined to give africa back or sell her she was shaking so violently jake sat her down on the rickety chair and made her a strong cup of coffee with four tablespoons of sugar she didnt normally take sugar but she found the sweetness comforting jake lounged against the food bin watching her look he said dropping his halfsmoked cigarette down the sink why did you buy me that horse tory lowered her eyes because i like you she whispered jake took her hands which felt damp and chilled how much he said gently tory glanced up he was so beautiful with his thin watchful face and his glinting earrings oh so very much she said and suddenly like a horse thats been locked up in a stable for a long time and sees the door opening onto a huge field of clover the idea that hed been battling against all week overwhelmed him a rich wife thats what he needed not very rich but enough to buy him a few horses and give him a start so he could get to the top and wipe that selfsatisfied smile off rupert campbellblacks face and rather in the way a swimmer holds his nose and plunges into the water and finds it pleasantly warm his arms were suddenly full of tory she was kissing him sucking at him like a great vacuum cleaner christ shed pull his teeth out soon and her arms had him in a vise and the huge friendly breasts were pressing against him oh jake oh jake without fumbling he undid the buttons of her dress and switched off the light and they were on the bed of deep clean straw with the light of the moon now filtering in through the skylight he unfastened her bra and the splendid breasts overflowed soft and sweetswelling like a river bursting its dam for a small slight man jake was sexually well endowed but he spent enough time fingering a spot which tory afterwards discovered was her clitoris and she was so slippery with longing that she hardly felt any pain after that first sharp thrust inside her shed always heard it was awful the first time but despite the scratching of the straw on her bare back she felt only ecstasy now i know why its called a loose box said jake extracting himself and wiping her with a handful of hay from the rack any minute africall wander in and say whos been sleeping in my bed said tory with a giggle not much sleeping said jake he rested his head on her breasts actually she was much less fat without her clothes on rather splendid in fact i didnt hurt you too much no no it was lovely and you do like me he said tory nodded in the dark then kissed him passionately adoringly uncritical like a dog greeting a returning master enough to marry me tory gasped and stopped kissing him i know i can make big money out of horses once i get started jake said i just need a break ill help you said tory in excitement ive got a year admittedly a lot of that had gone on africa and been given to her mother for new clothes and the cocktail party but if she married jake she wouldnt have to go to her own cocktail party or to any more dances five thousand a year thought jake that must mean at least in the bank if only he could get his hands on that they could buy a place and a dozen horses weve got to find somewhere to live he said theres no point in getting anywhere too small we need stables and at least fourteen acres the house neednt be big i could paint it said tory and i could build the jumps said jake she could feel him hot with excitement beside her the only trouble is that ive only got about in the bank at the moment that wont buy us a house and everything else is tied up in trust till im twentyone back came the black gloom the pit the despair the stable door was locked and bolted on him again it wasnt going to be any good after all jake slumped back on the straw then he realized that tory was full of plans to break the trust the capitals mine after all daddy left it to me its just sitting there and theres a whole lot more to come when granny dies it was as though she was talking about having a good crop of runner beans in the garden and another crop coming up in a few months i cant just take your money he said of course you can she said im only crying because im so happy well go and talk to granny maxwell shell help us they tried to keep their visit to granny maxwell secret tory arranged to go and see her the following saturday alison the stable girl would lend them her car to drive up to warwickshire molly however distrusting torys almost too passive acquiescence guessed something was up and intercepted a letter from tory to jake which fell out of fens pocket on the way to the stables the letter spoke of them marrying as well as the visit to granny maxwell and the scenes that followed were terrible mollys hysteria knew no bounds how could tory be ungrateful and stupid enough to throw herself away on this penniless illegitimate nobody in fact molly suddenly realized that she would no longer have her daughter as an unpaid babysitter cook cleaner shopper and errand runner she would have no one on whom to vent her rage to grumble to and about no one so easy to cadge money off she was in danger of losing her whipping boy and she didnt like it one bit she dispatched a reluctant colonel carter to have a blimptoman talk with jake but as jake saw the colonel as that monster whod nearly destroyed africa the meeting wasnt a success dumb insolence were the colonels words for it fellow just gazed out of the window and read the paper upside down anyway how can you expect a chap who wears earrings and hair over his collar to see reason molly felt the colonel had failed her malise gordon would have had much more success in the face of torys intransigence molly buried her pride and rang granny maxwell her exmother inlaw whom shed always hated and suspected of plotting against her yes i can see he doesnt sound very suitable said granny maxwell but i prefer to judge for myself tory is bringing him down to meet me on saturday and molly for once curbing the fountain of invective surging up inside her felt silenced and snubbed fen although horrified at dropping the letter was thoroughly overexcited by the whole thing i wish i was old enough to marry him you are lucky tory have you mated with him yet i cant think why mummy minds so much about his being intermediate the heatwave continued making the long drive up to warwickshire sweaty and unpleasant the sun blazed down on the top of the car until tory longed to escape down some woodland glade or picnic in a field by a winding river the white chestnut candles lit up the valley the bluebells making an exquisite contrast to the saffron of the young oaks cow parsley rampaged along every verge but jake was not interested in scenery he seemed to find alisons car difficult to drive and kept grinding the gears and stopping in fits and starts probably hasnt had much practice thought tory watching his bittennail hands clenching the wheel he answered all her questions in monosyllables so she fell silent she was dreading the meeting with her grandmother who could be very rude and difficult she couldnt see jake getting on with her if he was in this mood and if she wont help us thought tory in panic perhaps he wont want to marry me after all then again what did she know about this strange taciturn young man with whom she was hoping to spend the rest of her life at least shed shed nine pounds since she met him and now could get easily into a size sixteen skirt dozing then waking up she realized theyd just gone through cirencester she looked at the map arent we a little off course no said jake curtly putting his foot on the accelerator climbing to the top of a very steep hill he pulled into the side of the road saying get out for a minute they had a magical view across the valley to where a goldengray manor house lay dreaming against its pillow of beech woods in front was lush streamlaced parkland dotted with big bellshaped trees under which horses sought the shade swishing their tails against the flies to the left a good deal of building and excavations were going on but here one large flat field had been left unplowed on it every kind of colored jump was set up jake studied the place at length through binoculars where are we asked tory the last signpost had been buried in cow parsley penscombe jake suddenly looked drawn a muscle was flickering in his cheek rupert campbellblacks place going back to the car he scooped all the rubbish off the floor and from the ashtrays which brimmed with cigarette butts and tipped it over the wall into ruperts land one of the workmen looking across shook his fist at their departing car serves him right said tory with a giggle but when she looked at jake she saw he was not smiling torys grandmother lived sixtyfive miles on in an equally beautiful but more sheltered position gabled and russet the house peered out from its unkempt mane of virginia creeper like a yorkshire terrier a troupe of pekes and pugs came yapping round the side to welcome them despite the beauty of the day they found granny maxwell sitting in the drawing room watching racing on the television she was also trying to read horse and hound somerville and ross and a gardening book at the same time with three pairs of spectacles hanging round her neck like trapezes she had a strong face broadbrowed hooknosed the peatybrown eyes glittering imperiously beneath their black brows the wrinkles deeply etched round the wide mouth on her head she wore a graygreen curly wig slightly askew and held on with sticky tape youre wearing your nightgown child she said looking at torys floating white dress i like your blue pants then she held out a wrinkled blacknailed hand to jake i assume this is mr wrong she added with a cackle of laughter granny said tory blushing jake grinned sit down sit down no not in that chair she said as jake was almost bitten by an ancient rheumyeyed jack russell already sprawled on it all the other pekes and pugs lay at her feet snuffling and panting she wore an ancient cardigan a lace shirt obviously for the second or third day and a tweed skirt with a droopy descending hem she and lady dorothy must go to the same tailor thought jake but aquamarines and diamonds flashed on the grimy hands as she talked and the pearls round her neck were each as big as a mistletoe berry i suppose you want a drink young people drink at the most extraordinary hours these days there are some tins of iced beer in the fridge mr lovell unless youd like something stronger then go and get them tory the room had the glorious overcrowded look resulting from an exodus from a larger country house jakes hands rested on the rough carved mane of a lion the carpet was the blurred pink and green of an impressionist painting as tory went out granny maxwell studied jake who was surreptitiously looking at the horses circling at the start at least he didnt fidget epsom she said handing him the paper ive had a bet in this race any tips for the threethirty jake glanced at the runners id have a fiver on mal le maison im surprised you havent chosen marriage of convenience or how about fortune hunter she added maliciously hes a hundred to one jake looked at her steadily ill stick with mal le maison he said flatly and if i wanted to pick an outsider id choose whirlwind courtship you havent known tory long have you not very long but i like outsiders at least hes not frightened of me thought granny maxwell that in itself is a novelty old and bored and waiting for death she was aware that her family only came to see her when they were in financial trouble she sometimes felt she was only kept alive by feuds and tyranny tory came back with the cans of beer and a glass and was immediately sent up to talk to mrs maggs who was sorting out the hot cupboard shes made you lardy cake and gingerbread men for tea she thinks youre still eight you look very tired child she added in a gentler voice and youve lost a lot of weight she turned to jake bring your glass of beer and lets walk round the garden she said struggling to her feet she walked very stiffly and had to be helped over the step one hip was obviously very painful rheumatism she explained its difficult to be a very nice old woman when everything hurts having picked several heads off a coral pink geranium she set off along the herbaceous border it was the most glorious overpacked garden peonies jostled with huge oriental poppies lupins and irises catmint not yet out stroked their legs as they passed the pack of dogs some on three legs panted after them grumbling and yapping this is what i call a beautiful garden said jake as opposed to what to torys mothers all the flowers seem to stand in their own patch of earth there in serried ranks thou shalt not touch like a park said granny maxwell a bird flashed by yellow as laburnum yellowhammer said granny maxwell golden oriole i think said jake very rare in these parts it must be the heat suddenly a jaunty mongrel with a tight brindle coat came bounding across the lawn and was greeted by much yapping and every sign of delight by the pack particularly a little blond peke who wagged her tail and kissed him granny maxwell turned to jake we used to call them butchers dogs in my day because they followed the butchers van owners get very fussed when mongrels try to mate with their pedigree dogs i imagine thats why my daughterinlaw is making such a fuss about you i made a fuss when my son threw himself away on molly her father was a hairdresser remember that if you ever think about her i try not to said jake she never got over being the toast of hong kong now shes the sliced bread of bilborough mrs maxwell gave a cackle of laughter tell me about yourself you had polio as a child he nodded when i was six i was in the hospital for eighteen months learning to walk again it left me with a wasted leg and a raging desire to prove yourself presumably said granny maxwell dryly and your father was a gypsy juke nodded my mothers family tried to resettle him but he missed the wandering life and the horses he was a genius with horses so he pushed off soon after i came out of the hospital and your mother committed suicide you blamed yourself for that i suppose i think she was let down by some chap who she took up with after my father left but i didnt know that at the time what happened after she died the school where i went free as a day boy made me board i hated it so i ran away and joined a group of gypsies they taught me all i know to poach and to look after horses and train dogs there was an old grandmother there she taught me about all the medicines shed learnt from her greatgrandmother he took granny maxwells arm and guided her down some stone steps to a pond filled with irises and marsh marigolds she caught her breath at the pain an infusion of the leaves of travelers joy works wonders for rheumatism he said ill make you some up to try or if you prefer you can carry the skin of a dead frog against your skin granny maxwell watched the dogs lapping out of the pond the mongrel got into the water drinking paddling and making a lot of splashing i always feel very badly about the gypsies she sighed its one of the great unnecessary tragedies of progress they should never have been forced into compounds to settle and sell scrap metal but its always the same story today of harassment from the police and from farmers before the war they always used to park in our fields for the seasonal piecework my father often kept them employed from march until christmas i miss the sight of their fires at twilight with that marvelous smell of rabbit stew and the gaudy washing on the line and the shaggy horses and silent lean dogs they knew a thing or two those dogs jake didnt say anything but felt an emotion almost love stronger than he had ever felt for another human being how long were you with the gypsies three years then i was picked up by the police and put in an orphanage cant have been much fun it was better than prep school the kids were less vicious they even accused me of having a posh accent they walked back across the burnt lawn we need rain badly and what about this horse tory appears to have bought when he spoke about africa his face took on a tinge of color shes just the best horse ive ever ridden shes got so much potential and such a lovely nature are you sure you dont love her more than tory jake thought for a minute frowning then he said im not sure but if i take care of tory as well as i look after africa she wont do too badly anyway she couldnt be worse off than she is at the moment with that bitch of a mother shell have a nervous breakdown if she has to go to many more of those smart parties its like putting a carthorse in a hack class then beating it if it doesnt win and i gather molly has a new boyfriend some colonel hes a jerk they dont want tory why are they so reluctant to let her go then molly likes something to sharpen her claws on torys her catscratching board she bent down to pull a bit of groundsel then asked jake to uproot a thread of bindweed that was toppling a lupin its hell getting old i can only prune sitting down now and whats in it for you she asked i couldnt marry her if she werent rich ive got to get started somehow and i think tory and i could make each other happy neither of us has ever really had a home before that was the nearest he was going to get to placating her arent you banking too much on that horse being a winner she might break a leg tomorrow ill get more horses this is only the beginning to make it work as a show jumper youve got to have at least half a dozen top horses and novices coming on all the time the gypsies taught me how to recognize a good horse and i can ride them and ive got patience lets go and watch the threethirty said granny maxwell mal le maison was second whirlwind courtship nowhere thats torn it thought jake at that moment tory came in with a tray are you ready for tea yet granny put the tray down on this table in front of me thank you and sit down i have something to say to you both for a minute she looked at them both with speculative eyes im not going to give you any money young people should get along by themselves tory has a considerable income and youll soon save enough to buy and sell a few horses jakes face was expressionless that was that his hopes crashed ive no intention of breaking the trust granny maxwell went on picking up the blond peke and rolling it onto its back until i see if youre capable of making tory happy in three years time shell get the money anyway however jake stiffened fighting back hope as with maddening deliberation granny maxwell poured tea into three cups and went into a long would anyone like milk sugar or lemon routine and then handed out plates and asked whether anyone would like a sandwich however she repeated mr binlock is retiring to a cottage in the middle of june which means the mill house at withrington thats about twenty miles north of here will be empty you can have that tory turned pale but granny its got stables and fields she stammered exactly but its tumbledown and very damp i hope you havent got a weak chest she added to jake but its yours if you want it oh granny darling said tory crossing the room and flinging her arms round her grandmother dont smother me child and theres no need to cry and as you dont appear to have any transport ill buy you a decent horse box for a wedding present jake shook his head i cant believe it he said theres one condition granny maxwell went on with a cackle of laughter that the first time you appear at wembley you buy me a seat in the front row im a bored old woman in time if you do well i might buy a couple of horses and let you ride them for me if you really are going to buy us a horse box said jake id better learn to drive properly and take a test six long months after she arrived in london in helen macaulay met rupert campbellblack born in florida the eldest daughter of a successful dentist helen was considered the brilliant child of the family her mother a passionate anglophile and the daughter of a presbyterian minister was constantly reminding people of her english ancestry in fact a distant connection had come over if not on the mayflower perhaps by the next boat mrs macaulay glossed over this fact and from an early age encouraged the young helen to read english novels and poetry and admire all things english later helen majored in english literature at the university of tampa where she was confidently expected to get a brilliant degree deeply romantic on the one hand helen was also repressed by the rigid respectability of her family the only proof that her parents had ever copulated at all were the four macaulay daughters helen had never heard her mother and father row or seen either of them naked her mother who always insisted on women doctors never mentioned sex except to imply that it was degrading and wicked neither of her parents ever told her she was beautiful work to keep sin at bay feel guilty if you slack was the macaulay motto until she was nineteen helen never gave her parents a moments trouble she worked at school helped her mother in the house never had acne or gained weight and never answered back at tampa at the beginning of the seventies however she came under the influence of the womens movement anathema to her mother who believed a womans place was in the home her mother did however support the feminists view that a woman should never allow herself to be treated as a sex object nor be admired for her body rather than her mind to her parents horror helen started getting caught up in student protest movements demonstrating against the vietnam war and joining civil rights marches even worse she came home on vacation and said disparaging things about richard nixon but far worse was to come during her third year helen flunked out with a nervous breakdown pregnant by her english professor harold mountjoy heavily married but accustomed to the easy conquest of female students harold mountjoy was quite unprepared for the torrent of emotion he unleashed in helen macaulay it was jane eyre and mr rochester charlotte brontë and her professor all over again except that helen was a beauty only a tremendous earnestness and dedication to study had kept her on the straight and narrow so long at tampa on campus she was known as the fair miss frigidaire harold mountjoy set about defrosting her seeing her huge hazel eyes fixed on him like amber traffic lights during lectures he should have read caution instead one day after class he kept her back to answer a complicated question on brownings paracelsus discussing ambition in life harold had lightly quoted i am he that aspired to know and thou to which helen had instantly almost despairingly quoted back i would love infinitely and be loved harold mountjoy realized he was on to a good thing and asked her for a drink secret meetings followed selfconscious letters weighed down by literary allusions were exchanged and finally helens virginity was lost in a motel twentyfive miles from the campus followed by fearful guilt followed by more motels and more guilt under harolds radical guidance helen embraced radical causes and on vacation shocked her parents even more finally towards the end of the summer term helen fainted in class her roommate who despite helens attempts at secrecy had regularly been reading her diary went to the head of the faculty he in turn was highly delighted because for years he had been looking for an excuse to dump harold mountjoy whom he regarded as not only immoral but far worse intellectually suspect helens parents were summoned appalled they removed her from college her father being a dentist had the medical contacts to organize a discreet abortion helen and harold were forbidden to see one another again harold clinging to his job terrified his wife would find out complied with the request this was the last straw for helen losing her virginity had meant total commitment she had expected harold to tell her to keep the baby and to divorce his wife desperately worried about her her parents who were kindly if rigid people packed her off to england in the hope that this other great imagined love of her life would distract her she was to stay for at least a year helen rang harold mountjoy in despair he urged her to go they would both write in time they would meet again there was a possibility hed get over to england in august at last helen agreed the head of the faculty wrote to his london publishers giving helen an excellent reference and praising her diligence and they agreed to give her a job reading manuscripts writing blurbs and copyediting he also fixed her up with digs with a female author in hampstead so helen pieced her broken heart together and came to england in october unable to suppress a feeling of excitement that she would soon be able to visit st pauls where john donne had preached and wimpole street where robert browning had courted elizabeth barrett she might even get up to the lakes to see wordsworths cottage or haworth home of the brontës sadly england proved a disappointment accustomed to yearround florida sunshine helen arrived at the beginning of the worst winter for years she couldnt believe how cold it was by day she froze in her publishing house by night she froze at her digs which were awful the female author was an ancient lesbian who watched her every move upstairs was a lecherous lodger who made eyes at her at mealtimes and kept coming into her room on trumpedup excuses the place was filthy and reeked of a tomcat which her landlady refused to castrate the landlady also used the same dishcloth to wash up the cats plates and the humans plates the food was awful they seemed to eat carbohydrates with carbohydrates in england she found herself eating cookies and candy to keep out the cold put on ten pounds and panicked at the weekends she froze on sightseeing tours shivering at stratford at the tower and on the train down to hampton court and in numerous art galleries the english men were a bitter disappointment too none of them looked like darcy or rochester or heathcliff or burgo fitzgerald or sebastian flyte none of them washed their hair often enough she never dared look in their ears in the subway they also seemed desexed by the cold weather they never gazed or whistled at her in the street anyway helen was not the sort of girl who would have picked up men as the days passed she grew more and more lonely harold mountjoy was another disappointment after one letter darling girl forgive a scribbled note but you are too precious to have brief letters it would take a month to tell you all i feel about you and i dont have the time he didnt write at christmas or remember her birthday or even valentines day finally at the beginning of march helen decided she could bear her digs no longer on the same day that her landlady used a catfoodencrusted spoon to stir the beef stew with and the tomcat invaded her room for the hundredth time and sprayed on her typewriter cover she moved into regina house an allfemale hostel in hammersmith which catered exclusively for visiting academics and was at least clean and warm nor was her job in publishing very exciting the initial bliss of being paid to read all day soon palled because of the almost universal awfulness of the manuscripts submitted to begin with helen wrote the authors polite letters of rejection whereupon they all wrote back sending her other unpublished works and pestering her to publish them so finally she resorted like everyone else to rejection slips her two bosses took very extended lunch hours and spent long weekends at their houses in the country one of the directors sons having ignored her in the office asked her out to dinner one evening and lunged so ferociously in the car going home that helen was forced to slap his face from then on he went back to ignoring her the only other unmarried man in the office was a science graduate in his late twenties named nigel a vegetarian with brushedforward fawn hair a straggly beard a thin neck like a goose and spectacles for six months helen and he had been stepping round each other she out of loneliness and he out of desire they had long political arguments and grumbled about their capitalist bosses nigel introduced her to orwell and bombarded her with leftist literature he was also heavily involved with the antifox hunting movement and seemed to spend an exciting resistance life on weekends rescuing foxes and hares from ravening packs of hounds harassing hunt balls with tear gas and descending by helicopter into the middle of coursing meetings he was constantly on the telephone to various cronies named paul and dave arranging deadofnight rendezvous to unblock earths often he came in on monday with a black eye or bandaged wrist after scuffles with hunt supporters one friday towards the end of march he asked helen out to lunch he was wearing a yellow corduroy coat a black shirt had clean hair and looked less unattractive than usual inevitably the conversation got around to blood sports they think were all lefties or students on the dole living in towns he said whipping off his spectacles but we come from all walks of life you see the fox he went on in his flat northern accent beautiful dirty hardpressed with so many people after him hounds footfollowers riders horses terriers he needs us on his side to tip the balance a little helens huge eyes filled with tears for a moment in his blaze of conviction nigel reminded her of harold mountjoy he speared a piece of stuffed eggplant with his fork why dont you come out with us tomorrow were driving down to gloucestershire to rot up the chalford and bisley its the last meet of the season daves got hold of a lot of fireworks it should be a good day helen unable to face another weekend on her own trailing round galleries or visiting the house of some longdead writer said shed love to and afterwards we might have dinner in oxford said nigel theyve opened a good vegetarian restaurant in the high and now she was rattling down the m to gloucestershire and wondering why the hell shed agreed to come the dilapidated car was driven by a bearded young zoology graduate named paul who had cotton wool in his ears and was already losing his hair beside him sat nigel both men were wearing gum boots and khaki combat kit and khaki she decided simply wasnt nigels color even worse she had to sit in the back with pauls girlfriend maureen who was large dismissive and aggressively unglamorous with dirty dark brown hair black fingernails and no makeup on her shiny white face between her heavy laceup boots and the bottom of the khaki trousers were two inches of hairy unshaven leg she was also wearing a voluminous white sheepskin coat which stank as it dried off it was rather like sharing the back with a large unfriendly dog even worse she insisted on referring to helen as ellen taking one look at helens rust corduroy trousers tucked into brown shiny boots dark green cashmere turtleneck jersey and brown herringbone jacket she said i dont expect youve ever demonstrated against anything in your life ellen helen replied somewhat frostily that shed been on several antivietnam war marches which launched maureen nigel and paul into an unprovoked attack on america and nixon and watergate and how corrupt the americans were which irritated helen to death it was all right for her to go on about corruption in america but not at all okay for the brits to take it for granted sulkily she buried herself in a piece in the paper speculating as to whether princess anne was going to marry captain mark phillips shed been following conflicting reports of the romance with shamefaced interest mark phillips was so goodlooking with his neat smooth head and gleaming dark hair so much more attractive than nigel and pauls straggly locks in america hair like theirs had long gone out of fashion other than for aging hippies they were off the motorway now driving past hedgerows starry with primroses buds were beginning to soften and blur the trees against a clear blue sky flocks of pigeons rose like smoke from the newly plowed fields helen felt tears stinging her eyes once more spring returns but not my friend she murmured thinking sadly of harold mountjoy i suppose foxes do have to be kept down somehow she said out loud feeling she ought to contribute something to the discussion they do kill chickens rubbish snapped maureen these days chickens are safely trapped in battery houses and ellen said paul earnestly only five percent of foxes ever touch chicken helen had a sudden vision of the five percent sitting down to coq au vin with knives and forks now maureen paul and nigel were slagging someone they referred to as rcb whos rcb asked helen and was told it was rupert campbellblack the one the antis hated most male chauvinist pig of the worst kind said maureen upperclass shit who makes hitler look like nestlés milk said paul always rides his horses straight at us said nigel broke pauls wrist with his whip last autumn remember that hunt ball when he smashed a champagne bottle on the table and threatened you with it nige said maureen what does he do asked helen show jumps internationally said paul and allegedly beats up his horses but hes so loaded he doesnt need to do anything very much helen noticed the curling copies of the new statesman and tribune on the backseat and a tattered copy of bertolt brecht in the pocket of maureens coat these are people who care about things she reproved herself i must try to like them better what do we do when we get there she asked the basic idea ellen said maureen is to copy everything the huntsmen do we bring our own horns paul here actually plays the horn in an orchestra and use them to split the pack weve perfected our view halloos and we also spray the meet with a special mixture called antimate which confuses the hounds nigel looked at his watch which he wore ten minutes fast on the inside of his wrist nearly there he said helen got out her mirror added some blusher to her pale freckled cheeks ran a comb through her gleaming dark red page boy and rearranged the tortoiseshell headband that kept it off her forehead youre not going to a party reproved maureen defiantly helen sprayed on some scent nice pong said paul wrinkling his long nose dyou know the one about the irish saboteurs ellen they spent all day trying to sabotage a drag hunt dont tell ethnic jokes paul said nigel smiling as widely as his small mouth would allow they were beginning to overtake riders and horses hacking to the meet a pretty blonde on an overexcited chestnut waved them past youve no idea how were going to cook your goose later my beauty nigel gloated soon the road was lined with boxes and trailers and paul drove faster through the deep brown puddles in order to splash all those riders in clean white breeches standing on the grass verge now he was fuming at being stuck at ten mph behind a huge horse box which kept crashing against the overhanging ash trees the meet was held in one of those sleepy cotswold villages with a village green flanked by goldengray cottages a lichened church kneedeep in daffodils and a pub called the goat in boots a large crowd had gathered to watch the riders in their black and scarlet coats saddling up supervising the unboxing of their horses and grumbling about their hangovers what a darling place said helen as the sun came out the antis however had no time for esthetic appreciation paul parked his car on the edge of the green and getting out they all surged forward to exchange firm handshakes and straight glances with other saboteurs both sexes were wearing khaki anoraks or combat kit as camouflage but with their gray faces and long straggly hair and beards they couldnt have stood out more beside the freshfaced cleancut locals heres your own supply of antimate said nigel dropping two aerosol cans into the pockets of helens coat spray it on hounds or riders whenever you get the chance helen thought irritably that the cans would ruin the line of her coat and when nigel insisted on pinning two badges saying hounds off our wild life and only rotters hunt otters on the lapels of her coat she wondered if it was necessary for him to take so long and press his skinny hands quite so hard against her breast perhaps shed have to use the antimate on him two sinisterlooking men walked by with a quartet of small brighteyed yapping dogs those are the terriers they use to dig out the fox whispered maureen helen also noticed several crimsonfaced colonels and braying ladies on shooting sticks giving her dirty looks a group of men in deerstalkers and dungcolored suits stood grimly beside a land rover theyre paid by the hunt to sabotage us explained maureen indignantly given a chance theyll block the road and ram us with that land rover helen was beginning to feel distinctly uneasy she edged slightly away from the group of saboteurs then said to herself firmly i am a creative writer here is a golden opportunity to study the british in one of their most primitive rituals listening to the anxious whinnying from the boxes she breathed in the heady smell of sweating horse dung and damp earth the landlord of the pub was dispensing free drinks on a silver tray his wife followed with a tray of sandwiches and sausage rolls helen who had had no breakfast was dying to tuck in but felt being part of the enemy that she shouldnt nigel and maureen had no such scruples good crowd said nigel greedily helping himself to three sandwiches oh dear theyre ham he added disapprovingly and removing the fillings he dropped them disdainfully on the ground where they were devoured by a passing labrador suddenly as the gold hand of the church clock edged towards eleven oclock there was a murmur of excitement as a dark blue porsche drew up there he is hissed maureen as two men got out helen caught a glimpse of gleaming blond hair and haughty suntanned features as the taller of the two men vanished in a screaming tidal wave of teenagers brandishing autograph books others stood on the bonnets of their parents cars or clambered onto each others shoulders trying to take photographs or get a better look worse than that dick jagger snorted an old lady whod been nearly knocked off her shooting stick by the rush a girl stumbled out of the melée her face as bright pink as the page of the autograph book she was kissing half a minute later she was followed by her friend he used this pen she sighed ecstatically im never going to use it again gradually the crowd dispersed and through a gap helen was able to get a better look the man had thick blond hair brushed straight back and in two wings above the ears emphasizing the clear smooth forehead and the beautiful shape of his head his face with its greek nose high cheekbones and long denim blue eyes was saved from effeminacy by a square jaw and a very determined mouth totally oblivious of the mayhem he had caused he was lounging against the porsche talking continuously but hardly moving his lips to a stocky young man with light brown curly hair a broken nose sleepy eyes and a noticeably green complexion the blond man was signing autograph books so automatically and handing them onto his companion that when the queue dried up he held his hand out for another pen and a book what a beautiful beautiful guy gasped helen yes and knows it snapped maureen thats rcb and his shadow billy lloydfoxe the landlord pressed forward with the tray morning rupe morning billy want a hair of the dog christ yes reaching out the stocky lightbrownhaired boy grabbed two glasses one of which he handed to rupert then getting out a tenner and two flasks from his pocket he handed them to the landlord adding could you bear to fill them up with brandy les ill never fight my way through rupes admirers bit under the weather are you billy said the landlord terrible if i open my eyes ill bleed to death a groom was lowering the ramp of a nearby box and unloading a magnificent bay mare sweating in a dark blue rug edged with emerald green with the initials rcb in the corner and looking back into the box whinnying imperiously for her stable companions rupert turned around how is she frenchie bit over the top sir said the groom she could use the exercise he swept the rug off the sweating shuddering mare and slapped on a saddle suddenly she started to hump her back with excitement dancing on the spot as the hunt arrived in a flood of scarlet coats burnished horses and jolly grinning hounds tails wagging frenziedly circling merrily looking curiously naked without any collars helen felt her heart lift how beautiful and glamorous they all looked little people get on big horses and think theyre gods said nigel thickly in her ear those hounds havent been fed for three days but helen was gazing at rupert campbellblack who was taking off his navy blue jersey and shrugging himself into a red coat goodness he was well constructed usually men with such long legs had short bodies but rupert from the broad flat shoulders to the lean muscular hips and powerful thighs seemed perfectly in proportion just as he and billy mounted their horses the local photographer arrived pushing his way through the ring of admirers hello rupert can i have a photograph of you and billy okay said rupert gazing unsmiling into the camera im not looking my best grumbled billy i havent washed my hair good chance for publicity said maureen sententiously and barging her way through she handed rupert an antihunting leaflet thank you very much he said politely can i have one for billy maureen turned round to face the camera between them can i borrow your lighter billy said rupert next minute he had set fire to the two leaflets and dropped them flaming at maureens feet youre not even man enough to read them she said furiously rupert looked her up and down its rather hard to tell what sex you are he drawled but youre certainly not goodlooking enough to hold such extreme views go away youre frightening my horse the crowd screamed with laughter maureen flounced back to helen the bastard did you hear what he said over maureens head for a second ruperts eyes met helens then he looked away without interest theyre right hes poisonous she thought at that moment a beautiful but overmadeup woman her black coat straining over a splendid bosom trotted up to rupert with a proprietorial air darling how are you feeling i actually made it simultaneously the landlord arrived with the two filled flasks as he handed one of them to rupert she grabbed it taking a large swig dont drink it all snapped rupert darling she said fondly screwing back the top and handing it to him you can come home later and drink as much of ours as you like rupert put a long booted leg forward and pulled up the mares girths i dont know if ill need monty as well he said to the groom with these bloody hunt saboteurs about we may not get much action if you lose us wait at the spotted cow the next moment the hunt clattered off helen was amazed to see nigel suddenly leap out of a hawthorn bush and squirt the hounds with antimate next minute a little girl had rushed up and kicked him so hard on the ankles that he dropped the aerosol can with a yell stop it you horrid man she screamed rupert campbellblack who was passing grinned down at her well done angel ill marry you when you grow up the saboteurs leapt into their five cars keep your eyes peeled for foxes hissed paul nigel was still grumbling about his ankle hurtling down a country lane sending the catkins shivering they found hounds being put into the palest green larch covert the saboteurs parked above it and the next moment a posse including nigel and paul vaulted over the fence and armed with antimate disappeared after them judging by the expletives and the shaking of fists they were causing havoc in the woods the master decided to move on out of my way he said bossily to a group of girl riders youre not with the pony club now i expect youve only come out to gaze at rupert campbellblack the saboteurs moved off in search of fresh sport stopping in a layby to spray pepper they got stuck in the mud two footfollowers not realizing who they were pushed them out the next two hours were like being at a race meeting permanently under starters orders every time the hunt picked up a scent the antis managed to foil them later maureen and helen hung over a gate watching a sluggish stream choking its way through overhanging osiers and pussy willows fat celandines were pushing their way through the dead leaves helen gloried in the spring sunshine beating through her dark green jersey are the saboteurs antifishing as well she asked oh yes said maureen earnestly our more extreme members feel its cruel to the worm helens stomach gave an ominous rumble im starving said maureen thank god i had a cooked breakfast were all rendezvousing at the spotted cow at one oclock helen who had had no breakfast and only scrambled eggs the previous night had visions of gins and tonics and pub steak and kidney pudding the plowed brown fields in their evenness reminded her of mince perhaps thered be shepherds pie for lunch but in the end they only stopped at the village shop to buy oranges and some perrier cant squander the saboteurs funds on food and drink said nigel offering her his bottle of perrier helen suddenly thought how much shed prefer to share a flask of brandy with rupert campbellblack if shed been out with him she figured hed have made sure she was properly looked after the saboteurs were parked outside the spotted cow as the hunt came past looking understandably bootfaced after such an abortive morning pull the choke out whispered paul itll muddle the hounds on the other side of another wood the hats of the riders could be seen moving ceaselessly back and forth another posse of saboteurs moved in from the right viewhallooing to distract the hounds and throwing in a couple of firecrackers which set the already excited horses plunging pa pa pa pa came the tender melancholy note of the horn oh good i mean oh dear said helen theyve found a fox thats paul said maureen smugly he can blow a horn as well as any huntsman two women supporters in green quilted coats and tweed skirts parked nearby and got out of their car bloody antis said one incongruously smoothing a wildlife sanctuary sticker on her windscreen have you heard how the paigntonlaceys dance went said her friend fionas not up yet this morning but i saw primrose who said it was frightfully good more chaps than girls for a change rupert campbellblack disgraced himself as usual got off with gabriella evidently they disappeared for hours and hours charlie got quite frantic theyve only been married a year better than marcias dance said the first one evidently he got simply plastered and docked the tails of all the yew peacocks i mean theyve taken literally hundreds of years to grow id have sued the little beast he gets away with it said the first one because he is so frightfully attractive suddenly she gave an enraged bellow as nigel and paul spattered with mud their hands cut and bleeding from the undergrowth tore up the hill with the heavies hot on their trail and leapt into the car taking off paul shook off the heavies finally stopping at the edge of a beech wood looking down a valley in the back nigel was noisily sucking an orange getting out of the car helen caught her breath for there slowly riding up the hill came rupert campbellblack his gleaming bay mare and his red coat the only splashes of color against the greens and browns gaining the top of the hill he paused trying to work out which way the hounds might run the sun which had been hovering in the wings like an actor waiting to make an entrance broke away from the clouds warming the brown fields nigel got out of the car wiping his hands on his trousers to one who has been long in city pent he said pompously as he edged towards helen tis very sweet to look into the fair and open face of heaven helen who privately thought it would be much sweeter to look into the fair and very close face of rupert campbellblack edged away again i think theyre going to draw this covert said nigel vanishing into the beech copse followed by paul a hound spoke then the triumphant chorus rang out and there was the wild cry of the true horn suddenly with the master cheering them on the line hounds streamed down the valley in a dappled cloud then came the field galloping jumping barging through gates with a clash of stirrups there was rupert looking in a completely different class to the others riding so easily and fluidly almost nibbling his horses ears as he seemed to lift her over a huge hedge wire on the other side he yelled back to billy who gathered his black cob together and cleared it just as easily there was a clattering of hooves as they jumped into the road and out again and set off towards the beech copse which had been liberally sprayed with pepper and antimate as they entered the copse nigel and paul stood on a nearby fence and started to blow a horn concerto utterly muddling the hounds who distracted by the pepper and the antimate charged around frenziedly zigzagging back and forth whimpering with frustration as they tried to pick up the scent helen suddenly felt furious with nigel and paul what right had they to spoil everyones day she and maureen were standing in the field skirting the copse when suddenly nigel came hurtling out of the wood followed by paul the next minute rupert campbellblack galloped around the corner riding straight at them his eyes blazing he wont touch the girls screamed nigel promptly plunging his horn down helens new dark green cashmere jersey stretching the neckband and disappearing over the hedge chivalry will prevent him he called over his shoulder chivalry prevented rupert doing no such thing he rode straight up to helen reined in the plunging mare and before helen could stop him leaned over put a warm hand down the front of her jersey and retrieved the horn a goodlooking anti he said in mockwonder i never expected to see one whats a pretty girl like you doing getting mixed up with a desiccated creep like nigel how dare you gasped helen hand to her breast as though shed been violated how dare you said rupert this is private property youre trespassing id go back to london and not get involved with a lot of rentacrowd lefties all right helen asked nigel emerging from the undergrowth shes not getting much help from you you little rat said rupert shes got a very good body though blushing crimson hopelessly aware how unbecoming it was with her red hair helen gazed fixedly at ruperts highly polished boot dont you insult my girlfriend said nigel striding up slipping in a cowpat and putting his arm round helens shoulders equally furiously she shrugged him off on the contrary said rupert pocketing the horn i was being excessively polite telling her shes the only decentlooking girl id ever seen out with the antis he nodded in maureens direction what dyou use that one for breaking down lift doors for a second he made the mare plunge towards nigel who retreated into the hedge then wheeling round he was off ill get even with you screeched nigel as they set off again helen sat in the back stunned rupert was simply the most wrong but entirely romantic person shed ever met she was appalled how violently she felt attracted to him she could still feel the warmth of his leisurely hand and remember the way the brilliant blue eyes had moved over her assessing absorbing data like a computer my only love sprang from my only hate she whispered as rupert cantered back to join the despondent remains of the hunt gabriella whod earlier helped herself to his hip flask caught up with him cooee darling where have you been one of the added irritations caused by the saboteurs thought rupert was that it had been impossible to shake gabriella off last night belonging to someone else with her magnificent white bosom rising out of plunging black lace she had been a far more desirable proposition he had taken her in a cordonedoff bedroom hung around with tapestries in the middle a long line of footfollowers had actually congaed unknowing through the room whooping and yelling and reducing them both to helpless laughter today redveined from an excess of wine with her makeup running her hair coming down in a lacquered mass and her bulky thighs in tootight breeches she had lost all her charm though none of her ardor rupert had a sudden yearning for the whippetslim anti with her hair the color of the bracken still strewing the rides what a bloody useless day he said it could be improved dramatically said gabriella riding her horse alongside him why dont we slip home charlies gone shooting probably like to count me as part of the bag said rupert looking at his watch its only a quarter to three worth giving it another hour he was relieved to see billy emerging from the wood his head buried in his horses neck to avoid the branches i feel better said billy ive just been sick behind a holly bush have you got any brandy left rupe not much said rupert handing him the flask better finish it ruperts fiendish behavior was soon relayed with relish to the rest of the antis helen unable to work up any indignation at all picked a bunch of primroses and wrapped them in a paper handkerchief dipped in a puddle briefly paul and nigel had lost the hounds but had found them again in full cry within the walls of some huge estate unable to get at them physically the saboteurs launched their toughest offensive all hell broke loose as smoke bombs and thunderflashes exploded foghorns wailed and horns and whistles were blown jesus christ some buggers are shooting in the covert pull hounds out yelled a huntsman helen hid behind an ash tree saying her prayers as the saboteurs charged about yelling screaming slipping on wet leaves tripping over bramble cables and the long silver roots of beech trees hounds had gone to pieces all helen could hear was whimpering nigel shimmied up the wall to look masters lost control he said happily to the left the land rovers with the heavies were moving in threateningly paul seized helen bustling her into the front of the car lets beat it he said where are maureen and nigel mos in one of the other cars paul put his foot down on the accelerator and nigels got some ingenious plot of his own but my lips are sealed hes taken fionas car said hed join us later it had started to spit with rain old ladies hurried home putting on headscarves women rushed out into the cottage gardens taking in washing youre not wearing your safety belt ellen said paul wouldnt want an attractive young lady to come to any harm turning on radio three he accompanied a beethoven sonata in a reedy tenor helen had a feeling he was glad theyd shed the others i know youre niges girl he said throatily i am not said helen tartly there is nothing between us that makes a difference didnt want to tread on anyones corns i happen to be playing at a concert at the festival hall next saturday wonder if youd care to come we could have an indian afterwards helen who hated curry said shed look in her diary which he seemed to regard as a satisfactory answer as he rabbited on about the orchestra and the paper he was writing on shrews helen found it was unnecessary to make any other comment than the occasional um breathing in the apricot dusk she wondered what rupert campbellblack was doing now rupert and billy hacked back to their horse box through the pouring rain discussing which horses they should take to the crittleden easter meeting which started on friday billy whod put his collar up and turned his hat back to front to stop the rain running down his neck was trying to light a cigarette did you see the girl with the antis asked rupert in that deceptively casual way that meant he was interested bit thin said billy marvelous face though doesnt sound english how the hell did nigel get hold of her perhaps she likes his mind hardly likely to be anything else rounding the corner fifty yards away they saw nigel busily letting down the tires of ruperts horse box riding on the verge he hadnt heard them coming leave this to me said rupert softly sliding off the mare throwing the reins to billy he sprinted down the road and taking a flying leap landed on nigel with a crash knocking the breath out of his body next minute he had dragged him up a grassy side lane and was systematically beating him to a pulp it was billy who dragged rupert off for gods sake thats enough you dont want to be done for murder at that moment frenchie the groom woke up from sleeping off his lunch and appeared out of the front of the horse box rubbing his eyes where the hell have you been snarled rupert getting pissed as usual i suppose here take the horses and get me some rope pulling off his hunting tie he stuffed it into nigels mouth then systematically stripped off nigels clothes looking down with distaste at the white skinny body as rupert tied his hands and feet with spare headcollar ropes nigel gave a groan and started to wriggle think hell be all right said billy sadly yes the little shit said rupert giving him a kick in the ribs itll take him half an hour to wriggle down the road itll still be light someonell pick him up pity its such a warm night he picked up nigels combat jacket and removed his address book from the inside pocket as he flipped through it they hitched a lift in the horse box back to the blue porsche how riveting said rupert hes got fionas telephone number and mine the little bastard and yours too what did he call that girl helen i think heres one helen macaulay regina house w fourteen where the hells that shepherds bush or hammersmith frightfully unsmart said rupert i wonder if thats her helen got in around midnight the walnut and cottage cheese paté and the vegetable curry had been disgusting shed hardly eaten anything but still dazed by rupert campbellblack had drunk more cheap elderberry wine than was good for her maureen had glared at her all evening nigel had never turned up and paul had somehow engineered that he drop her off at regina house after dropping maureen at her digs i wont come up for a coffee mo i expect youre tired he said helen suspected that maureen standing in her furry coat like a disgruntled pyrenean mountain dog was no such thing outside regina house paul said may i kiss you ellen and lunged goatily his beard tickled he had bo and his breath smelled of curry helen lost her temper youre too sanctimonious for words right you had a glorious day playing cops and robbers and feeling smug to boot and whats more id like to report you to the rspca for being horrible to hounds leaping out she slammed the car door in his face now she sat in her room feeling ashamed of herself and gazing at harold mountjoys photograph which seemed to have lost all its appeal she noticed the spoilt slightly weak expression the hair carefully combed forward to cover the lined forehead and crowsfeet round the eyes my only love sprang from my only hate she whispered shed never see rupert again he obviously had millions of girls after him and anyway he was thoroughly spoilt she looked at the primroses in the tooth mug with the ochre centers and pastel petals shed have to put him in her novel then she could dream about him slowly she undressed gazing at her body in the mirror shed never really studied it before and yet hed said it was beautiful she found shed put her nightdress on inside out that was supposed to be lucky she could do with some luck she jumped at a sudden pounding on the door it was the principal of the hostel in a camel hair dressing gown hair in a net telephone she snapped person says its an emergency cant see how it can be helen sighed it must be nigel perhaps hed been arrested and needed bailing out or was grumbling because paul had driven off without him at least he couldnt accuse her of getting off with paul in the telephone booth someone had left a copy of lorca helen picked up the receiver hello may i speak to helen macaulay said a voice shed recognize that clipped light drawl anywhere her palms went damp her knees turned to jelly this is she well this is the enemy speaking rupert campbellblack how did you get my number its a long story is nigel all right as right as he ever could be what are you doing tomorrow going to church in the morning in the background she could hear the sounds of music and revelry shut up you maniacs yelled rupert look ill take you to church then ill give you lunch ill pick you up at halfpast ten she liked the way he pronounced it hppstn oblivious to the continued grumbling of the head of the hostel who was still hovering in the hall helen fled upstairs to her room and rushed to the mirror just to reassure herself that she was still there and that such a thing could have happened he called she whispered he really called with all those girls chasing after him hed bothered to get her phone number from nigel then she buried her face in the primroses breathing in their faint sweet smell before collapsing onto the bed she must pull herself together rupert was a terrible rake who attracted females far too effortlessly no doubt leaving a trail of destruction in his wake like macheath and what about the dreadful sexist things hed said to maureen and what about married gabriella with whom hed vanished for two hours at the ball perhaps she shouldnt go her heart hadnt mended after harold mountjoy a second break would be far more difficult to repair but the thought of not seeing him made her faint with horror she felt quite out of control swept along like a branch chucked into a raging torrent besides there was no way she could get in touch with him to say she had changed her mind and would she ever be any good as a writer if she didnt experience life it had been a very long day if she didnt want black circles under bug eyes the next morning she ought to get some sleep but instead she sat down at her typewriter and covered six pages of foolscap describing the day these she slotted into a folder marked england then she cleaned her teeth for two minutes using dental floss between each tooth and sank to her knees to say her prayers a convinced conservationist who believed in husbanding natures resources she was horrified when she got to her feet to see that shed left the tap running she woke in wild excitement but elation soon gave way to panic as clothes littered the normally tidy room on and off and on and off went the gray angora dress which went best with her hair but might be too hot if they went to a crowded restaurant on and off went the crocus yellow silk shirt which brought out the color of her eyes but worn with a gray suit made her look too much like an efficient secretary the rust suit was too autumnal the steel blue wool dress was lovely but she was perspiring so much with nerves she might have great embarrassing dark circles under the arms finally she settled for the kilt and matching beret and green velvet coat she had bought from the scotch house worn with a frilly white shirt then what about makeup she knew you shouldnt wear much for church but too much for god would be too little for rupert really it was very hard dressing for both like having god and the devil to dinner perfume was wrong for church too delilahish so she settled for pouring half a bottle of cologne over herself instead much against her principles shed taken one of the tranquilizers shed been given when she split up with harold mountjoy it was having no effect at all when she found herself rubbing deodorant into her cheeks and moisturizer under her arms she realized she was really over the top she was ready by tenfifteen waiting in the dark polished hall various dowdy lady academics were milling around getting ready for outings to museums or galleries if only one of them would tell her she looked nice but lady academics dont notice such trivialities she took a surreptitious glance in the fulllength mirror and suddenly decided that she looked ludicrous in the matching tartan beret and kilt just like an air hostess racing upstairs she changed back into the gray angora dress oh god there was lipstick on it she covered the mark with a pearl brooch which looked ridiculous just above her left nipple her newly washed hair was all over the place from so much dressing and undressing she rammed it down with a gray velvet hairband she couldnt stop shaking it was now twentyfive to eleven at first the minutes crawled by then they started to gallop he couldnt be coming it was tenfifty perhaps shed heard him wrong but she was sure hed said halfpast ten she tried to read a long analysis of the watergate crisis in the sunday times but the words kept blurring so she gave up and gazed at some horrible shocking pink hyacinths that were twitching outside in the cold wind perhaps in her state of cardiac arrest shed given him the wrong directions to regina house saying left when she meant right it was two minutes to eleven she musnt cry it would make her mascara run but what did it matter when he obviously wasnt coming anyway it was just some diabolical plot to raise her hopes and then dump on her from a great height because she was part of the saboteurs the club secretary had just pinned the lunchtime menu on the board and several of the inmates surged forward trying not to look too eager watering at the mouth at the prospect of roast beef and treacle pudding to liven up their uneventful lives in utter despair fighting back the tears helen turned to stumble upstairs but just as the hall grandfather clock struck eleven the front door pushed open and rubert walked in coming towards her with that lovely loping athletes stride unlike most people he didnt automatically lower his voice when he entered an institution darling darling im desperately sorry i had to look at a horse in newbury on the way up the traffic was frightful he lied are you all right did you think i wasnt coming he walked up to her and taking her hand kissed her on the cheek helen gazed up at him unable to get a word out overnight shed changed him in his red coat into some kind of devil and here he was turning up looking just the sort of preppy young man of whom her parents would approve the severity of the impeccably cut dark suit striped shirt and blue tie only served to set off the dazzling good looks a shaft of pale sunlight coming through the window gilded the smooth blond hair it was as though a light had been turned on in the dark hall even the dingy academics gathered around the notice board changed the object of the salivating gazing at him unashamedly you want to go to church dont you helen nodded still speechless well its not too late well probably miss the bfilm and the ads but get in for the big picture he said putting his arm through hers ive never been to hammersmith before he said opening the car door for her its a fascinating ethnic cross section said helen earnestly in the back of the porsche sitting muddily on a huge pile of unopened letters newspapers and old copies of horse and hound sat a grinning black labrador this is badger said rupert hes the only being in the world who thinks i can do no wrong badger thumped his thick black tail joyfully scattering the letters and leaning forward gave helen a great slobbery kiss dont preempt me badger said rupert driving off so fast that the dog nearly fell off the backseat badger insisted on coming today rupert went on to see if you were as pretty as i said you were embarrassed helen said dont you ever open your mail not if i can help it its always people wanting my money or my life he drove her at great speed to the guards chapel immediately theyd crept into a back pew helen sank to her knees rupert sitting sideways to accommodate his long legs noticed she really prayed eyes shut lips moving confessing in advance the sins shes going to commit later this afternoon he thought dryly while she was kneeling he examined the freckled hands with their slender wrists and colorless nail polish the small beaky nose the very clean ears the lipstick drawn not quite to the edges to disguise a large mouth the frightful alice band holding back the gorgeous dark red hair it was the color of drenched fox rather than bracken wondering if she had a ginger bush he felt the stirrings of lust hed tank her up at lunchtime and take her back to his mothers house as she sat up he noticed the perfect ankles slightly freckled beneath the pale tights nice scent he whispered for a second she looked at him her huge wideapart yellow eyes flecked like a conference pear then smiled shyly christ shes adorable he said to himself he had deliberately not picked up a hymn book on the way in so he could share hers as their hands touched she jumped as if burnt then realizing she was overreacting tried to relax forty days and forty nights tempted and yet undefiled sang rupert loudly and quite out of tune during the sermon helen found her thoughts straying as she glanced at the crimson and gold banners topped with little gold lions with crowns on their heads and breathed in the scent of a nearby arrangement of white lilac and narcissi among the congregation were several grayhound men in dark suits with lean carved features and very straight backs accompanied by conservatively dressed women with good enough cheekbones to get away with turbans or hats with no hair showing the altar was draped with purple for lent helen was horrified to find herself wondering whether a dress in that color would suit her she must concentrate rupert had no such intentions after staring at the priest for a few minutes with halfclosed eyes he extracted a paint chart out of his pocket and studied the colors finally marking a prussian blue square with a cross then he produced yesterdays evening paper and folding it up into a small square started to read the racing results hooray he whispered ive won itll pay for a lunch helen tried to ignore him and stared stonily in front of her but as the sermon droned on a loud snore suddenly rent the air rupert had fallen asleep and the next moment his head had flopped onto her shoulder several of the grayhound men and a woman in a red turban like piped fish paste glanced around in disapproval helen nudged rupert sharply in the ribs he woke up with a start glanced round in bewilderment and then grinned at her totally without contrition the smile suddenly softening the arrogant deadpan features and creasing up the long blue eyes reduced her to complete panic harold mountjoy had never affected her like this she was relieved when the organ galloped through the last hymn and they surged out into the sunshine rupert nodded to several of the congregation but didnt stop to talk until one of the grayhound men called out to him rupert stopped said hello tommy and introduced helen after the inevitable brisk swapping of mutual acquaintances tommy said youve been doing very well meant to come and buy you a drink at olympia look he added lowering his voice theres a horse that might interest you at the barracks bought him in ireland just before christmas make a topclass puissance horse can i come and look at him after lunch about four helen wondered if she were included in the invitation and was shocked by her relief when rupert said well be there before lunch he insisted on taking badger for a walk in the park it was a perfect spring day thickening crimson buds fretted a loveinthemist blue sky the banks were draped with crocuses of the same lenten purple as the altar cloth a host of golden daffodils retarded by the bitter winter had just reached their prime and nodded their pale heads in approval helen longed to dawdle but there was no chance of wandering lonely as a cloud rupert with his brisk military walk set off at a cracking pace helen her high heels pegged by the soft grass was soon panting to keep up did you buy the horse you looked at this morning she asked it was a retired racehorse said rupert after flattening four fences it suddenly decided to stage a comeback and carted me halfway to london couldnt stop the bugger and im pretty strong what happened fortunately the londonnewbury express thundered straight across our bows the horse decided he wasnt ready to be strawberry jam and skidded to a halt must say i was shitscared brought up that no gentleman swears in front of a lady helen wished he would not use such bad language im starving he said lets go and have some lunch will it be very smart asked helen not until we get there said rupert the restaurant despite being sandbagged up to the gutters against ira bomb attacks was extremely smart inside with cane chairs and tables a black and white check floor and a forest of glossy tropical plants emphasizing the jungle atmosphere from the kitchen came a heady waft of garlic and herbs and from the dining room the same swooping my dearpunctuated roar of a successful drinks party the head waiter rushed forward meester campbellblack he said reproachfully you deednt book i never book said rupert but i ave no tables im sure you can find us one nice and private we dont want people bothering us and you cannot bring dogs in ere the health inspectors they will shoot me badgers different said rupert hes a guide dog for the blind drunk now buck up luigi dont keep us waiting sure enough within half a minute luigi beckoned it was quite an experience walking through a restaurant with rupert and badger every head turned necks cricked nudges were exchanged as people looked first at him then at helen trying to work out who she was if anyone the restaurant seemed to be packed with beautiful people the girls all wearing fashionable flared trousers down to the ground with never a boot showing their red nails tapping on their slim thighs smoothing back their streaked hair and calling hi rupe as he passed luigi installed them at a table divided from the rest of the restaurant by a dark green wall of tropical plants immediately helen fled to the ladies she felt so drab in her gray dress with her pale church face gazing back from the mirror savagely she ringed her eyes with pencil added a coral splodge of blusher to each cheekbone painted her mouth to match and emptied so much miss dior over herself that it made her sneeze back at the table rupert had ordered a bottle of dom perignon and removed his tie badger lying at his feet thumped his tail breathing in the newly applied miss dior rupert noticed the additional makeup all good signs i havent been in london on a sunday for ages he said its nice and its the first time ive had a chance to look at you properly thats even nicer youre really an astonishingly beautiful girl what the hell were you doing with nige we work together in publishing i read manuscripts and write blurbs actually she blushed im also working on a novel can i read it its only in draft form well you must put me in it then ill be prince charming nigel can be the toad youre not really his girlfriend no i am not said helen with some asperity he just asked me out with the antis yesterday how did you get my phone number well billy and i found nigel letting down the tires of our lorry so i shook him till his lentils rattled then left him trussed up like a christmas turkey and appropriated his address book what did you think of your day out very cruel all those people tearing after a poor defenseless fox ripping it apart for fun have you ever seen a chicken coop after a fox has been all with their heads bitten off and left foxes kill for the hell of it too the fox doesnt get a chance protested helen with you blocking up their earths and digging them out with terriers after theyve gone to ground rupert shrugged his shoulders farmers wouldnt let us hunt across their land if we didnt he filled her glass although shed drunk only half of it looking at her meditatively huntings like adultery he said endless hanging about interspersed with frenzied moments of excitement very expensive and morally indefensible why dyou do it then asked helen primly hunt or commit adultery because i enjoy them both i fancy other peoples wives from time to time i enjoy riding hell for leather across country its one of the best ways of teaching young horses to jump anything or stop an older horse getting stale horses love it so do hounds so do the people doing it you just dont like to see people enjoying themselves its still wrong for people to get all dressed up for the pleasure of killing something said helen hotly darling love the saboteurs had far more fun than we did yesterday billy my mate always says if ever they abolish hunting hes going to join the antis helen remembering how shed attacked paul last night had to concede he was right but nigel does have principles she protested hes a strict vegan farts all day in the office i suppose said rupert yawning helen blushed but refused to be deflected nigel she went on earnestly has not eaten anything that moves for ten years not even jelly asked rupert helen tried to look disapproving and giggled youre impossible impassible am i said rupert mocking her pronunciation well you certainly wont get past me in a hurry luigi arrived with the menu helen noticed there were no prices what are you going to eat im sure luigi can flambé you some nut cutlets but why not be really decadent and have a large rare steak luigi particularly recommended the scampi served with a cream pernod sauce or the filets of wild duck with juniper berry sauce no i dont want any of your muckedabout rubbish luigi my guest would like he turned to helen oh pâté and a small steak and a green salad and ill have smoked salmon and grilled lamb chops very rare with some fried potatoes and can you bring an extra steak for badger he likes it well done and well have a bottle of number six and another bottle of this while were waiting while he was ordering she admired the beautifully lean curve of his jaw unlike most englishmen and particularly ones who spent so much time out of doors there was no red tinge to his complexion which even without the suntan would have been pale olive glancing around he caught her gazing at him well he said youre very tanned skiing last month i hear youre an expert at horseback riding rupert grinned you could call it that the show jumping seasons about to start in earnest its crittleden next weekend why dont you come down on saturday he was touched to see how thrilled she was id just love to id so enjoy seeing one of your performances with any luck you might be seeing one of those before that he said smiling at her with those wicked dangerously direct eyes helen chose to ignore the innuendo was it badger or rupert under the table pressing against her leg how did you get into that terrible coven helen looked disapproving regina house is a very distinguished institution it was founded to accommodate women of substance oh thats whats the matter with them said rupert i thought they all looked like that frightful harridan that was out with you yesterday the one with more spare tires than the firestone factory under the influence of the wine helen found herself more and more at ease minding less and less about his flip remarks as their first course arrived she found herself telling him about her first digs and the unfixed tom and the lecherous lodger i gained ten pounds well it seems to have gone in the right places said rupert gazing at her breasts he ate very fast finishing his smoked salmon before she was a quarter way through her pâté this is excellent paté she pronounced it partay he wondered idly if her accent would get on his nerves im afraid i cant finish it im awfully sorry off her grub thought rupert another good sign now is the time for all good dogs to come to the aid of the partay he said spearing it with his knife and handing it under the table to badger who gobbled it up with more thumping as their second course arrived she tried to steer the conversation on to more academic lines did he enjoy reading not a lot the best book ive read in years is the moons a balloon do you go to the theater a lot well i went once said rupert helen determinedly didnt look shocked writers had to accept all kinds of people rupert was picking his chop bones now tearing the meat off with very strong white teeth particularly good teeth she noticed for an englishman have you any siblings what brothers and sisters she explained only one a brother adrian very bright my mothers favorite he runs an art gallery oh which one asked helen eagerly the bellingham specializes in modern stuff helen said shed been there often awful tripe dont you think said rupert adrian gets frightfully miffed when i tell him badger could do better with his tail dipped in a paint pot all these remarks were drawled out with a completely deadpan face she couldnt tell if he was sending her up at least you must go to the cinema no said rupert quite honestly if youve got nearly thirty horses as billy and i have many of them novices that need bringing on or topclass horses that need keeping up to the mark you dont get much time for anything else weve got a man and three girl grooms but we still get up at sixthirty and seldom leave the yard before nine or ten at night horses still need looking after on weekends and youve got to keep looking at other horses all the time in case you miss something nearly all the year round were traveling nonstop from show to show all over the world you dont get to the top by going to french films or hanging around art galleries im sorry said helen feeling corrected do you do the same sort of thing as mark phillips he events i show jump ours is the serious stuff eventings for gifted amateurs do you know mr phillips helen felt ashamed for asking yes hes a very nice bloke will he marry princess anne so he tells me said rupert filling up her glass helen tried not to betray how impressed she felt she couldnt eat any more of her second course than her first rupert gave her steak to badger its so expensive its awful said helen in distress it isnt offal its steak said rupert again imitating her accent did you go to eton college she asked no harrow lord byron went there said helen excitedly he was an extraordinarily fine poet pulled some amazing girls too his letters are fascinating supposed to have had his halfsister luigi brought brandy for rupert and coffee and chocolate peppermint creams for helen no thank you she said ive given up candy for lent ive given up women said rupert taking her hand except you almost on cue an exquisitely beautiful girl with long blueblack hair barged into their jungle glade rupert bear she screamed what are you doing skulking away like a babe in the wood arent you frightened of all the wild animals she added to helen but before helen could answer the girl had rattled on nicky cripps is absolutely livid with you rupe he booked this table weeks ago and you just pinch it from under his nose arent you going to offer me a drink rupert bear just for old times sake beat it said rupert icily oh well ill have to help myself and picking up ruperts glass of brandy with a shaking hand she drained it suddenly there was a tremendous thump from under the table and badger emerged grinning pressing his black face into the girls crotch hello badger she said in a choked voice youve always been keener on me than rupert bear is glancing at ruperts face helen tried to lighten the atmosphere why do you call him rupert bear she asked the girl looked at her pityingly dont you know rupert bare because he spends so much time with his clothes off reaching over she picked up the cross that hung round helens neck and dont think thatll keep you safe you wont be able to ward him off any more than anyone else and afterwards hell spit you out like a grape pip rupert got to his feet get out he said in a voice that made helen shiver youre drunk and youre boring us the girl gave a sob and fled helen escaped to the loo she felt quite sick her face was flushed her eyes inflamed as she slapped on some makeup two girls came in heading for the loos shouting to each other over the partition biancas just had a showdown with rupert bear said the first and all in front of his new girlfriend she wont be new by next week said the second shell be an ex like the rest of us as she emerged from the loo rupert having paid the bill was waiting for her whats the matter youre shaking i want to go home dont be silly taking her hand he led her back to the car now what happened two girls were talking in the john what did they say helen told him rupert took her hands again holding them tightly look im sure it upset you and what bianca said too but if you and i are going to have anything going together and i feel we can you must shut your eyes and ears to gossip if youre any kind of celebrity which i suppose billy and i are people will always bitch about you if they dont know you they make it up if they catch you snapping at a traffic warden because your mothers just died theyll assume youre always bloodyminded i had a brief walkout with bianca i broke it off ive even had girls accusing billy and me of being queer because i havent made a pass at them you listen to me not anyone else is that clear helen nodded speechless youre terribly sweet leaning forward he kissed her very gently at first she resisted then as her lips parted he drew away come on weve got to see that horse jesus tommy he said a quarter of an hour later as a huge black horse with a white face clattered out of the stable tugging a helpless terrified trooper on the end of a rope are you trying to sell me an elephant hes a good horse said tommy jump the harrods building with all four feet tied together going up to the plunging animal ignoring its rolling eyes and snapping teeth tommy caught the other side of the head collar together he and the trooper managed to steady him come and have a look he said from a safe distance helen watched ruperts practiced hands moving over the horse running down a leg here picking up a hoof there examining his teeth looking at him from front and back lovely courageous head said tommy dodging hastily sideways to avoid a diving nip whats his background dam was an irish draft mare father was clean bred won a few races in ireland we got him from jock ohara doesnt usually miss a good horse said rupert walking around him again his wife was having a baby at the time he was a bit more distracted than usual and hes being discharged whats wrong with him well quite honestly hes a bit of a bugger run away with nearly every trooper in the regiment fidgets on parade breaks ranks naps on duty and wont obey orders rupert laughed and youre suggesting i buy him you could always sort out difficult horses and i promise you he can jump he carted a trooper in the kings road last week a milk float was crossing the road old satan stood back on his hocks and cleared it by inches several witnesses saw him that has to be some horse okay said rupert taking off his coat tack him up a trooper stood nervously in the center of the indoor school waiting for ruperts orders tommy and helen to her relief watched from the gallery at first satan walked around as though butter wouldnt melt in his mouth only his eyes rolled and his tail twitched his white face and the one white sock that came above knee and hock gave him a comic appearance rupert pushed him into a canter with his huge stride he circled the school in seconds then suddenly the horse seemed to gather itself together and as they rounded the top end he humped his back in a series of devastating bucks which would have unseated any rodeo rider helen gave a gasp putting her hands over her eyes its all right said tommy hes still there okay said rupert to the trooper put all the fences up to four foot six tommy got out a silver cigarette case and handed it to helen who shook her head watch this he said as satan bucketed towards the upright rupert put him at exactly the right spot and he cleared it by a foot it was the same with the parallels put them up to five foot six said rupert known rupert long asked tommy no said helen and it wont be much longer at this rate she added nervously as satan thundered towards the upright then put in a terrific stop the next moment rupert was beating the hell out of the horse poor satan murmured helen rupert turned him again satan cleared the upright then careless stargazing at some pigeons in the roof he rapped the parallel so hard that only ruperts immaculate riding held him together and saved them both from crashing to the ground put it up to six foot said rupert to the whitefaced trooper crazy agreed tommy but he always liked riding something over the top this time rupert cantered down quietly and satan cleared the upright with several inches to spare rupert pulled him up coming out of the school the horse appeared positively docile sliding off rupert reached for his coat pocket which was hanging on the door and taking out a packet of polos gave a couple to satan who looked at him suspiciously then ate them curling his upper lip in the air i think well get along he said ill buy him tommy youll discharge him as uncontrollable will you and ill have a word with colonel cory up at melton mowbray helen was ashamed how much the sight of rupert mastering that huge halfwild horse had excited her he might not have heard of françois truffaut or kandinsky but when it came to horses he was obviously a genius suddenly she felt a spark of pure envy however much she slaved at her novel she could never display such joyful spontaneous talent as rupert the sun was going down now firing the barracks windows dog walkers were hurrying home from the park as rupert sorted out the details of the sale with tommy helen did her face yet again she turned on the car radio and found the middle movement of schumanns piano concerto listening to the rippling romantic music she looked uneasily at the pile of mail on the backseat many of the envelopes were mauve or peppermint green or shocking pink someone had addressed a letter to rupert campbellblack the handsomest man in england and so he was thought helen as he walked back to the car badger at his heels he looked very happy that is one hell of a good horse i reckon i could take him to the olympics if he doesnt kill me first lets go and have a drink at my mothers house thatd be nice said helen privately she didnt feel quite up to meeting ruperts mother shed have to talk out of the corner of her mouth to hide the drink fumes rupert listened to the piano concerto for a minute i suppose this is the sort of music you like yes said helen are your parents happily married yes said rupert how lovely said helen but not to each other my mothers on her third marriage my father on his fourth were you very traumatized when your parents split up she asked rupert looked surprised not at all i stayed with mummy and nanny but you must have had endless replacement parents what stepmothers and fathers oh legions werent they very unkind to you i was very unkind to them i was a little sod when i was young they got their own back by never taking me out when i was at school so you never went out said helen her eyes filling with tears nanny came down by train occasionally and brought me fruit cakes i spent most leaveouts and a lot of the holidays with billys family what about adrian oh he was my mothers darling far too delicate and sensitive to go to boarding school rupert spoke without bitterness or selfpity he was not given to introspection and never considered anything his parents had done might have affected his behavior in life helen whod studied psychology felt differently still hazy and emotional from an excess of champagne she was flooded with compassion for poor poor rupert parents whod never loved him stepparents who neglected him a mother who preferred his younger brother no wonder he felt the need to beat other riders all the time and to seduce women to bolster his selfconfidence then unused to a loving relationship break it off the moment things became heavy i could change him she thought expansively i could arrest the rakes progress and show him what real love is like ruperts mother lived in one of those large white georgian houses looking onto an emerald green railedin square the garden was filled with grape hyacinths scillas and white daffodils an almond tree was already scattering pink petals on the sleekly shaven lawn every window was barred rupert opened the door with several keys and sprinted in to switch off the alarm well your mother certainly wont get burglarized said helen no but youre just about to my treasure said rupert under his breath they went into the drawing room as rupert switched on the lights helen gave a cry of pleasure what an exquisite room there were pale primrose walls and carpets old gold watered silk curtains and sofas and armchairs covered in faded pale blue and rose chintzes two tables with long pale rose tablecloths were covered in snuffboxes the walls were covered in portraits of handsome arrogant men and beautiful women their faces lit up by fat strings of pearls orchids in pots added to the exotic atmosphere on the draped grand piano were photographs one of ruperts mother as a deb and others of several men in uniform who were presumably replacement fathers there was also a picture of rupert on a horse being handed a cup by princess margaret what caught the eye was a photograph of an extraordinarily beautiful youth very like rupert but more fragile of feature thats my kid brother said rupert what dyou want to drink helen shook her head as rupert poured himself a large glass of brandy helen caught sight of a study next door the walls lined with books all behind grilles may i look of course most of those on the left are first editions helen gave a cry of excitement why heres keats endymion and shelleys prometheus unbound and mansfield park oh wow your mother must be a very cultured woman this seemed to amuse rupert shes never read any of them but thats awful is there a key somewhere i expect she got to her feet reluctantly on the study desk was a huge pile of letters doesnt your mother open her mail either its a family failing will she be home soon shes not here said rupert draining his glass of brandy shes in the bahamas escaping from the tax man helen looked at him appalled i must go if id known she wasnt going to be here id never have come you havent come yet sweetheart said rupert softly taking her in his arms but you soon will i promise she was almost overwhelmed by the warmth and sheer power of him so different from harold mountjoy whod been a bit of a weed no she yelped yes said rupert into her hair you need some material for your narvel you shouldnt have pretended your mother was here she struggled to get away from him i didnt anyway alls fair in love and war and i dont imagine its going to be war between us and he bent his head and kissed her for a few seconds she kept her lips rigid then powerless she found herself kissing him back her hands moving up to the sleek surprisingly silky hair rupert pulled her down on the faded rose pink sofa i havent stopped thinking about you for a moment since i first saw you he said he was running his hands over her back now assessing the amount of underwear planning where the next assault should come from there were no clips on the gray dress which would have to come over her head which might frighten her if removed too soon over her shoulder he met the jovial eyes of one of his forebears atta boy he seemed to say no said helen trying to prise off the hand barnacled over her left breast youre repeating yourself angel you must realize im unfixed like your landladys tomcat through her dress he expertly undid her bra with his left hand the thumb of his right hand began to strafe her nipple no im not like that like what whispered rupert dyou want to spend the rest of your life behind bars unopened like those first editions helen burst into tears at first she was crying so hard rupert couldnt understand what she was saying then the first storm of weeping gave way to shuddering sobs and gradually the whole story came pouring out how respectable her family were what a terrible shock it had been when she became pregnant by a married man and flunked her finals how her parents had been real supportive sending her to europe to get over it all this afternoon you appeared to be getting over it very well said rupert perhaps i should send your father a bill what did you say this married man was called harold mountjoy should have been called mount helen helen sniffed hes a very distinguished writer she said reprovingly im surprised you havent heard of his work you must know i havent heard of anyone said rupert i loved him said helen i thought he loved me but he only wrote once he forgot christmas my birthday valentines day mothering sunday asked rupert grinning the pregnancy was terminated said helen with dignity i promise i wont let you get pregnant said rupert gravely thats not the point i dont want to be treated like a sex object because you object to sex oh dont be so flip wailed helen rupert got out a blue silk handkerchief and wiped away the mascara that was running down her cheeks he had enough experience of women to realize that if you backed off and were kind and considerate on a first occasion they dropped into the palm of your hand on the next more important he suddenly felt terribly tired phenomenally strong he could go for long periods without sleep but he realized that apart from a twohour marathon in the fourposter with gabriella on friday night he hadnt been to bed for three days he had to drive home to gloucestershire that night a dealer was coming to see him first thing in the morning and he wanted to buy satan quickly before the army started producing all kinds of red tape he also had a string of novices to take to an indoor show the following evening all right he said getting to his feet go home to your narvel let me put on a jersey and ill drive you back to your coven helen felt absolutely miserable convinced that shed lost him the sun had set and the trees and the houses losing their distinctive features were darkening against a glowing turquoise sky rupert didnt speak on the way to regina house nor did he say anything about taking her to crittleden let her work up a good lather of anxiety he thought helen got lower and lower perhaps he was hurt by her saying she couldnt sleep with him because she didnt love him but she felt it was just too soon all the lights were on in regina house as they drew up a blackbird was singing in a nearby plane tree helen sat for a second overwhelmed with anticlimax and despair tears about to spill over again the womens movement was always urging one to be assertive and make the running but in practice it wasnt easy im sorry she said in a choked voice i didnt mean to give you a hard time rupert yawned on the contrary sweetheart it was me intending to give you a hard time he got out of the car but before he could open the door for her she had scrambled out standing up so they faced each other a foot apart good night he said brusquely intending to get back into the car and drive straight off but suddenly the bells of a nearby church carried by the west wind drifted through the muzzy gray twilight rupert shivered suddenly reminded of the desolation of sunday nights at school summoned by bells to evensong followed by cold ham and bread and marge for supper and everyone else coming back feeling homesick from days out with their parents rupert had never really had a proper home to feel sick about i wwill see you again wont i she stammered her face with its vast brimming mascarasmudged eyes had lost all its color in the dusk he took it in his hands of course you will my little red fox ive let you escape this time but ill get you in the end try and go to ground youll find the earth blocked disappear down another earth ill get the terrier men to dig you out his white teeth gleamed as he bent and kissed her helen trembled with fear and longing dont listen to nige he said getting back into the car hes not my greatest fan ill ring you later in the week about crittleden and he was gone helen stood in the twilight listening to the bells thinking about weddings and the attraction of opposites rupert drove down the m thinking about satan he toyed with the idea of stopping off at the newbury turn to see a married girlfriend whose husband was away but he was too tired at exit sleep overcame him and the moment he was off the motorway he pulled into a layby climbed into the back and hugging badger for warmth fell asleep the frogsmore valley is considered by many to be the most beautiful in the cotswolds on either side fields checkered by pale stone walls and dotted by lush woodland and the occasional farm fall steeply down to jade green water meadows divided by the briskly bustling frogsmore stream at the top of the valley curling round like a horseshoe lies the ancient village of penscombe here for the past hundred and twenty years the campbellblacks had made their home alternately scandalizing and captivating the local community by their outrageous behavior on ruperts twentyfirst birthday a month before he came out of the army his father edward campbellblack had made over to him the house penscombe court and its surrounding two hundred acres the motive for this altruistic gesture was that edward had just further scandalized the community by leaving his wife and running off with the beautiful italian wife of one of his gloucestershire shooting cronies on reflection too eddie decided he was bored with running the estate at a thumping loss and his beautiful italian prospective bride decided that neither of them could stand the bitter west winds which sweep straight off the bristol channel up the frogsmore valley to howl round penscombe court throughout the winter so they decamped permanently to the south of france young rupert further scandalized the community by moving back into the house with his friend billy lloydfoxe and a floating population of dogs and shapely girl grooms even worse hellbent on making the place profitable rupert promptly dug up the famous rose garden and the orchard built stables for thirty horses turned the cricket pitch where the village used to play regularly into a showjumping ring and put up an indoor school beyond the stables to buttress them from the bitter winds gradually over the next four years the chuntering subsided as rupert and billy started winning and were frequently seen on television clearing vast fences and being awarded silver cups by members of the royal family journalists and television crews came down and raved about the charms of the village and the valley suddenly penscombe had two local heroes and found itself on the map penscombe court was fortunately situated on the north side of the valley half a mile from the end of the village so any latenight revelry was deadened by surrounding woodland and didnt keep the village or the neighboring farmers awake too often rupert was generally considered capricious and arrogant but billy who loved gossip and spent a lot of time in the village shop and the pub chattering to the locals was universally adored any inseparable friend of billy it was felt couldnt be all bad besides the locals had known rupert since he was a child and had seen stepparents come and go with alarming regularity and being a tolerant and generous community felt allowances should be made they also realized that rupert like the rest of his family was indifferent to public opinion so that their disapproval would not make a haporth of difference just before midnight rupert woke up from his nap in the layby and set off for home he never saw the signposts to penscombes without a leap of joy and recognition as he drove along the top of the south side of the valley badger woke up and started snuffling excitedly at the crack of an open window ahead in the moonlight gleamed penscombes church spire although it was after midnight rupert looked across to the north side and cursed in irritation to see half the lights in the house blazing billy must have gone to bed plastered without switching them off as he stormed up the drive through the chestnut avenue planted by his greatgrandfather he could see the pale green leaves opening like parachutes behind white railings three dozing horses in new zealand rugs blinked as he passed the car crunched on the gravel in front of the house there was a great baying and yapping as rupert opened the front door two jack russells a springer spaniel a yellow labrador and a blond mongrel with a tightly curled tail threw themselves on him in delight growling and fighting each other finally they all started rubbishing badger jealous because hed been the one to go on a jaunt rupert kicked them gently out of the way his suitcase was still lying in the hall where hed left it that morning in the drawing room the fire was going out sunday papers halfread and a pile of entrance forms lay scattered over the sofa one of the dogs had shredded his hunting tie on the rug in front of the fire jesus said rupert slamming the door shut in the kitchen he found billy trying to read horse and hound clean the brown tops of a pair of black boots drink whisky and fork oysters out of a tin all at the same time hi he said looking up how did it go have you joined the antis billy was not a handsome young man for his nose was broken and his sleepy dark brown eyes were seldom visible because they were always creased up with laughter but he had a smile that could melt the arctic circle rupert however was not in a mood to be melted this place is a tip he snapped pointing to the sink which was piled high with plates glasses and dog bowls cant you even put things in the dishwasher its full said billy calmly or in the dustbin went on rupert pointing to the empty tins of dog food and milk cartons littering the shelf thats full too said billy and one of your dogs has crapped in the hall it was one of your dogs said billy without rancor anyway ive been bloody busy drinking my whisky and reading the sunday papers the hell i have by the way theres a nice piece about you in the observer what did it say oh some sycophantic rubbish about you being the best rider in england dont try to placate me and whys the telephone off the hook to stop bianca and gabriella and goodness knows who else ringing up rupert replaced the receiver five seconds later the telephone rang see what i mean rupert picked it up both of them could hear squawking putting the receiver in a nearby cupboard rupert shut the door billy grinned anyway i repeat ive been bloody busy doing what taking care of the entire yard singlehanded ive even sold a couple of horses for you how much dyou get ten grand for padua and eight for the gray with the ewe neck not enough said rupert looking slightly mollified never is for you and i worked everything were going to need tomorrow admittedly i was so hungover first thing i saw four ears every time i looked down a horses neck he speared up another oyster and i think ive sorted out why the bull keeps stopping hes terrified of water so am i said rupert unless its got whisky in it he picked up the bottle and not finding any clean glasses in the cupboard poured it into a teacup where the hell was diane today said shes got the curse soldiered on for a couple of hours then collapsed into bed rubbish said rupert she had it a fortnight ago shed have stayed working if id been here and tracey its her day off and marion gave in her notice and flatly refused to work she was pissed off because you forgot to take her to some party on saturday night shes been ringing sits vac in horse and hound all day and left them deliberately lying on the table for us to find he handed the magazine to rupert cheerful capable groom read out rupert incredulously cheerful christ shes about as cheerful as blackpool lights during a power cut experienced girl groom required for hunters and stud work opportunity to further breeding knowledge she doesnt have anything to learn about breeding either oh hell let her go im fed up with her tantrums you cause most of them said billy reasonably you know perfectly well that mayfair and belgravia not to mention the bull and kitchener will all go into a decline if she leaves and we cant afford that at the beginning of the season he held out his glass for rupert to fill up and just remember how tremendous she is with customs men theyre so transfixed by her boobs they never bother to even glance at our papers are you after her or something said rupert no my heart belongs entirely to mavis said billy looking down at the blond mongrel who was now curled up on his knee slanting eyes closed head resting on his collarbone oh all right said rupert ill go and see her in a minute shell be asleep by now not her shell be tossing and turning with desire and frustration from the pantry next door the washing machine was thundering to a halt wiping the boot polish off his hands onto maviss blond coat billy set her gently down on the floor opening the machine he removed a tangle of white ties shirts breeches socks and underpants and threw them into the dryer rupert looked disapprovingly round the kitchen which was lowbeamed with a flagstone floor and a window looking over the valley a bridle hung from a meat hook every shelf seemed to be covered with spilling ashtrays and unopened bills we must get a housekeeper im fed up with chaos its pointless said billy youd only employ pretty ones then you couldnt resist screwing them and theyd get bolshy mrs burroughs is coming in the morning shell tidy the place up i want it straight on weekends perhaps we ought to get nanny back shed have a heart attack at the goingson perhaps you ought to get married wives are supposed to do this sort of thing how was your redheaded anti interesting very uptight not the easy lay you expected youve put your finger on the spot said rupert draining his whisky which is certainly more than i did shes rather sweet but frightfully intense kept wanting to talk about books and the theater must have taxed your brain are you going to see her again i might i dont like unfinished business by the way i bought a bloody good horse today from the barracks no one was about so tommy let me try him on the qt never seen a big horse so good in front despite his size he jumps like a pony need some sorting out though dont make me tired ive done enough sorting out for one day said billy picking up the yellow mongrel mavis and i are off to bed see you in the morning ill go and placate marion said rupert he went upstairs brushed his teeth and his hair then took the dogs out at the end of the lawn two black yew trees crouched like great gelded tomcats behind the house rose the wood stretching for half a mile four vast lawson cypresses rose in front of the bare beech trees like spires of a cathedral moonlight flooded the valley silvering the lake and blanching the first daffodils on the opposite side a car driving along the top towards penscombe lit up the trees lining the road like a firefly rupert felt his heart expand with pride and love this was his home and his land to do what he wanted with he must keep on winning to keep it going to make it better and better the dogs weaved about lifting their legs on rosebushes and young trees from the stables he could hear the occasional snort and stamp and resisted the temptation to go and wake the horses up as he expected the light was still on in marions flat over the tackroom he shut the dogs in the house marion took a long time to answer the door she was pale and puffyeyed but nothing could disguise the voluptuousness of her body nor the length of leg revealed by the clinging nightshirt with the baleful figure of snoopy on the front what dyou want she asked in a choked voice you said rupert bastard snoopy rose and fell as her breast heaved thats no way to address ones boss youre not my boss anymore ive given in my notice didnt billy tell you yes said rupert moving towards her and putting a hand between her legs and i havent accepted it dont touch me she sobbed but as he splayed out his fingers and increased the pressure she collapsed into his arms helen found the next week extraordinarily trying she could think of nothing but rupert which made sleep work and very existence impossible in the evenings at regina house she read endless love poetry and played schumanns piano concerto being the only music she and rupert had in common over and over again very quietly with her door an inch open in case she missed the telephone ringing downstairs by day she had to put up with nigel he limped in after lunch on monday with a black eye and two cracked ribs she was appalled by his detailed account of the brutality of the beating up but when he started describing how hed been tied up and left naked behind a hedge she suddenly remembered ruperts remark about trussing a christmas turkey and had to gaze out of the window so nigel wouldnt see her laughing fortunately the selfobsessed nigel mistook her shaking shoulders for sobbing she now realized how difficult it must have been for juliet loving a montagu while living in the capulet camp she found herself jumping and blushing scarlet as nigel who was suffering from acute telephonitis exchanged lengthy indignation meetings on ruperts dreadful behavior with dave and paul and maureen and evidently every other saboteur in and around the country there was brave talk of taking rupert to court but as the other antis pointed out rupert being as rich as croesus would employ the best lawyer in town and as nigel had been letting down ruperts tires witnessed by rupert and billy and later the groom he was on weak ground even worse helen nigel added his piggy unblacked eye gleaming behind his thick spectacles rcb appropriated my address book oh dear said helen starting guiltily will he find any important numbers crucial said nigel sententiously that book contains the numbers of every resistance fighter in the uk people who are believed to belong to the hunting fraternity but who are really one of us and supply us with vital information fiona westbury the daughter of saturdays master is a classic example and the secretary of the chairman of the british field sports whos been one of us for years with that book in his hands rcb can smash our entire network im sure he beat me up because he was so anxious to get his hands on it rather like watergate said helen again fighting a terrible desire to giggle as the week crawled by she was filled with an increasing restlessness and sat at her typewriter playing he loves me he loves me not with the raindrops cascading down the window from the incessant april showers quite incapable even of typing dear sir because the only sir who was dear to her still hadnt rung shed learnt from the paper that the crittleden meeting started on good friday and lasted over the easter weekend on thursday at lunchtime in anticipation of seeing rupert she went out and spent nearly three weeks salary on the softest beige suede midi dress coming through the door of the office she found nigel holding out the telephone receiver and looking bootfaced some man with a foreign accent asking for you says its personal helen felt her knees give way her cheeks flame she could hardly cross the room then found herself positively winded by the thud of disappointment because it was paul on the other end i put on a french accent to deceive nigel he said laughing heartily how about that concert on saturday night almost in tears helen had told him she was going away for the whole weekend thats a shame said nigel as she came off the telephone i was going to a cnd rally in hyde park on sunday i hoped youd accompany me and i was hoping to see rcb at crittleden helen wanted to scream at him but i dont think thats going to happen either she spent a miserable good friday going to the threehour service praying for resignation and trying not to ask god to remind rupert to ring on saturday afternoon she went downstairs and sitting on a hardbacked chair in the television room tried to watch crittleden but had to wait until some charlie chaplin film had finished on the other channel before she could switch over by this time the bbc had left crittleden and gone over to some extremely noisy motor race seeing the pained expressions on the lady academics faces helen explained that a friend of hers was jumping at crittleden which should be on any minute at last they went over to the show ground it was pouring with rain and it was not until the last five riders none of them rupert had demolished the course that the announcer told them that the winner was a german rider who had produced the only clear an irishman was second with four faults and rupert campbellblack for great britain was third with eight faults billy lloydfoxe and three other riders had tied for fourth place with twelve faults apiece after the incessant rain said the announcer the crittleden arena was like a quagmire and any rider who got round was to be congratulated through the downpour the german rider came into the ring followed by the irish rider in his holly green coat helens heart started thumping her mouth went dry as rupert followed them on a huge chestnut the black collar of his red coat was turned up his white breeches splattered with mud as they lined up a man in a tweed suit and a bowler hat came out holding an umbrella over an attractive middleaged blonde in a dark gray suit who delicately picked her way through the mud another bowlerhatted man in a tweed suit followed them carrying a huge silver cup and shielding a tray of rosettes from the rain under his coat here comes lady pringle a fine horsewoman in her own right to present the prizes said the announcer helen could see rupert chatting and laughing with billy and as lady pringle reached him he took off his hat and bending down kissed her on both cheeks lady pringle and rupert campbellblack are obviously old friends said the announcer as she handed him a lemon yellow rosette and shes obviously delighted to have a british rider in the first three isnt that the young man who picked you up last sunday said one of the female anthropologists changing her spectacles to have a better look but helen had fled upstairs to sob her heart out on her bed how could rupert look so cheerful and carefree when shed been going through such hell waiting for him to call lady pringle indeed she sobbed and taking the photograph of rupert which shed surreptitiously cut out from one of nigels horse and hounds out of her diary she tore it into tiny pieces he was nothing but a stud she was crying so hard at first she didnt hear the knock on the door telephone said a voice when she got downstairs it was rupert angel im sorry i havent rung before i left your number at home and ive only just remembered the name of your coven weve been up at the south lancashire show and the lorry blew out on the way down so we only arrived in time for the big class how did you get on asked helen she was damned if she was going to let him know shed been watching not bad i was third billy fourth we had to unload the horses straight out of the lorry and the going was terrible nogs in front of every fence are you coming down i ddont know said helen thinking of her swollen eyes and lack of sleep i cant tonight come down tomorrow id come and collect you but ive got classes in the morning get a taxi but its miles said helen appalled thinking of all the money shed squandered on the midi dress its only an hour from london ill pay said rupert come to the main entrance ill leave the cash and a ticket with the man on the gate ruperts estimate of the time it would take to drive down to crittleden was very different from the taxi drivers no doubt he shifted that porsche at a hundred and twenty miles an hour the moment he got on the motorway thought helen as she nervously watched the fare jerk up and up she was sure the driver wouldnt take an american check and she couldnt ring up her bank as it was sunday scrabbling round in her purse she found only perhaps hed accept her gold watch until she could find rupert even worse two miles from crittleden they ran into a huge traffic jam a glorious mild day had followed yesterdays downpour every young green leaf and blade of new grass sparkled with raindrops and all the people whod given the show a miss yesterday seemed to have decided to go today for the thousandth time helen checked her face in the mirror her hair had gone right the suede dress brought out the amber of her eyes but she still looked tired got him bad ave you said the taxi driver as the third application of miss dior in ten minutes fought with the diesel fumes shed looked rich enough when shed got into the car that dress must have cost a packet and americans were rarely short of a few bob been to crittleden before helen shook her head one of the show jumpers has invited me you may have heard of him rupert campbellblack rupert campbellblack said the driver i know rupert ad him in the cab and his mate billy lloydfoxe es a lad is rupert did you see him at the orse of the year show in one of the novelty classes on the last day dressed up as miss world wiv coconuts in his dress they fell out as he rode over the jumps brought the ouse down es a lad is rupert i got is autograph for my missis shes mad about rupert she is and lady pringle and gabriella and bianca too thought helen bleakly at last they reached the main gates help thought helen in panic there seemed to be half a dozen men in yellow coats on the gate the taxi driver had no such reserve winding down the window he shouted ive got a lidy here for rupert immediately one of the yellowcoated men leapt forward and peered into the cab might ave guessed it he said with a gaptoothed grin rupert certainly goes for lookers and getting a sheaf of tenners out of his pocket he handed them to helen i think hes given me most of his winnings yesterday if you hang on quarter of an hour mate ill get you a fare back to london after helen had paid the taximan sixty pounds which seemed an appalling amount of money the man in the yellow coat took her off to find rupert it was so muddy she was thankful shed worn boots im a bit late she said not surprised in that traffic got a good crowd here today although it looks like rain later he pointed to indigo clouds which were beginning to mass on the horizon above the pale acid green elm wood they found rupert in the practice ring cantering very slowly round on a magnificent bay gelding totally oblivious of the crowd mostly nubile teenagers who were gazing at him the man in the yellow coat was about to call out when helen stopped him i want to watch for a second she said thank you so much rupert was wearing green cords tucked into gum boots a dark blue quilted waistcoat over a dark blue jersey and no hat i told you he was lovely said a teenage girl eating an ice cream i never thought hed be that lovely said her friend thats his groom marion said the first girl pointing to a sulkylooking blonde who was standing by the practice fence she was interviewed in honey about what its like working for rupert she said he doesnt get enough sleep at a word from rupert the sulky blonde who was wearing a red tshirt with i only sleep with the best people printed across her bosom put up the pole to five foot rupert cleared it effortlessly wish i was the horse said the girl with rippling hair helen had had enough rupert she called as he came past it was some comfort that he seemed so pleased to see her instantly sliding off the bay gelding and handing him to the sulky blonde he ducked under the railings to join her immediately the autograph hunters surged forward bugger off snapped rupert cant you see im busy and putting his arm round helens shoulders he pushed impatiently through the crowd how are you he said wonderful said helen suddenly realizing she was you certainly look it he said running his hand down her suede arm i adore that dress its the same texture as belgravia when hes just been clipped but i dont like that bloody alice band and removing it from her hair he tossed it into a nearby dustbin helen gave a cry of protest and ran towards the bin to find the hairband nestling among the remains of hamburger buns and kentucky fried chicken that was my favorite hairband she said outraged and your last one said rupert and he turned her round to face him running his hands through her red mane so it fell tousled and shining over her forehead and round her face for a second she gazed at him mutinously then she laughed christ said rupert id forgotten how beautiful you were and drawing her towards him he kissed her full on the mouth in front of the crowds we cant here she said pulling away blushing furiously we can absolutely anywhere said rupert come on lets go back to the caravan and have a drink he looked at his watch ive got a class in an hour and a half on their way they passed the stables horses lolled their heads over the halfdoors gnawing at the wood flattening their ears at each other and at passersby a crowd of people were hanging round one box stable thats belgravia said rupert as he went towards the halfdoor the crowd dispersed to a respectful distance but the horse rolled its eyes and took a threatening nip at ruperts sleeve ungrateful sod said rupert punching him gently on the neck he doesnt like me i mean hard work to him youd better be on form this afternoon leaving the horses they walked through the mud up the hill to the caravan village in which the riders lived during the show ruperts was easily the biggest caravan and the only one painted dark blue piped with emerald in the window hung a string of rosettes we had a good morning said rupert inside the caravan badger thumped his tail joyfully and wriggling up to helen goosed her briskly on the table sat billy lloydfoxe mavis the yellow mongrel sat perched on his knee being fed pieces of easter egg on the bench seats sat a mousyhaired man with big ears and his mouth open a fat man with short legs and a pretty brunette with a notepad they were all watching yesterdays competition on the video machine billys horse was coming up to a big oxer and scattering poles freeze it said the fat man you went in too close billy not enough impulsion said rupert got to jump an extra foot in mud like that i wish youd all stop cluttering up my caravan this is helen macaulay they all stared at her this continued rupert is my unstable companion billy lloydfoxe billy grinned hi i saw you across a crowded meet but sadly rupe got in first this is joanna battle from the chronicle whos interviewing billy said rupert introducing the dark girl and humpty hamilton the fat man nodded and this is ivor braine singularly misnamed because hes so thick the man with big ears opened his mouth even wider rupert got down two glasses and another bottle i wish youd stop feeding that bloody dog my easter egg shell get spots and turn into a dalmatian said billy mavis was now lying on her back with her legs apart and her head on his shoulder wish i had this effect on women he went on smiling at helen once helen had been given a drink they all ignored her and went back to watching the video tearing everyones round to shreds which gave her a chance to look at the caravan it was extremely luxurious with an oven a fridge a washing machine bench seats a double bed that folded up completely and a great deal of cupboard space at the end of the tape rupert switched over to racing picking up the paper in order to look at his horoscope good day for shopping he read perhaps id better buy that gray gelding evening starred for romance he grinned at helen i should bloody well hope so at that moment marion walked in still looking sulky she was chewing gum which gave her a particularly insolent air have you rung ladbrokes asked rupert i havent had time snapped marion better buck up youll miss the first race put a fiver each way on red chaffinch said billy come on william said joanna battie picking up her notebook this is going to be a bum interview isnt there anyone or anything you dislike in show jumping you should have interviewed rupert said billy undoing the purple paper from one of the chocolates inside the egg and giving it to mavis ill tell you whats wrong with show jumping said rupert filling up helens glass why dont the big shows provide the stabling free for the top riders cattle and sheep never have to pay a penny for accommodation they ought to waive our entrance fees too and pay us appearance money our names go on every press release the crowds have come here to watch billy humpty ivor and mostly me youre so modest said joanna and another thing said rupert warming to his subject french german and irish riders get a grand every time they win abroad we dont get a bean well never smash the kraut ascendancy until they start paying us decent money do you agree with this billy asked joanna well i dont feel as strongly as rupert probably because im not a member of the british team and because you never worry about money snapped rupert people who claim not to be interested in money are always bloody good at spending other peoples if you want to be a top show jumper said billy winking at helen you dont need to ride well just be olympic level at bellyaching marion came off the telephone to ladbrokes you havent met helen macaulay marion said rupert a slight note of malice creeping into his voice ive met her namesake said marion sourly arrived friday morning bitten me three times already my namesake asked helen bewildered the black horse i bought at the barracks hes been showing marion whos boss i decided to call him macaulay helen blushed crimson oh how darling of you are you going to make us something to eat said rupert havent got time said marion class starts in threequarters of an hour ive got to help tracey tack up belgravia and the bull theres smoked salmon in the fridge and brown bread in the bin and she flounced out of the caravan slamming the door behind her what a lovely nature that girls got humpty said getting up wed better go ivor thanks for the drink ill come with you said joanna youll want to get changed i presume youre all going to grania pringles party tonight okay then ill have half an hour there with you billy good luck both of you do you want me to go out while you change asked helen as long as you dont mind underpants said rupert ill make you some sandwiches she went to the fridge which was packed with an upmarket medley of pâté smoked salmon smoked turkey and several bottles of champagne she also noticed a great many empties already in the trash can breads in the bin on the right said rupert lifting her hair he planted a kiss on the back of her neck then when she swung round he kissed her on the mouth his hands feeling for her breasts helen tried to leap away but she was rammed against the oven rupert laughed and let her go mustnt raise my blood pressure too much before a class as helen spread unsalted butter on slices of bread and placed smoked salmon red pepper and a squirt of lemon on top she allowed herself the brief fantasy of living with rupert in the little caravan like a couple of gypsies cooking him ingenious dinners on the stove each night shutting out the rest of the horsey world except billy billy she decided was really nice hows nige asked rupert very overadrenalized said helen cutting the crusts off the sandwiches and overly concerned that youve appropriated his address book and now have access to all the names and addresses of the saboteur underground the only name and address i was after said rupert mimicking her accent again was yours after that i threw the book into the thames so no doubt a lot of fishes are about to reveal the antis darkest secrets in the angling times helen turned round with the plate of sandwiches to find billy already dressed in breeches and shirt tying his white tie and rupert wearing nothing at all she nearly dropped the sandwiches on the floor shoving the plate down on the table she turned back to tidy up and found herself putting the crusts in the fridge very good sandwiches said rupert dyou want some billy no thanks said billy lighting a cigarette it never fails to amaze me how you can eat before a big class im about to throw up last nights dinner nigel had two broken ribs a black eye and multiple bruises said helen reprovingly you ought to have brought me a color photograph said rupert who was pulling on his boots there was a bang on the door it was humpty hamilton we can walk the course in five minutes he said it looks a sod im definitely going to ask lavinia greenslade out tonight said billy shrugging into his red coat youll have to take her parents along as well said rupert seizing a couple more sandwiches as they went out of the caravan helen as a result of three glasses of wine and no sandwiches was feeling very unsteady she was glad rupert took a firm hold of her arm can you remember where im jumping he asked billy fifteen said billy ive got to wait until thirty im last christ look at that upright they left helen in the riders stand while they walked the course she saw joanna the deadpan girl from the chronicle pointing her out to some of the other journalists who laughed and shrugged their shoulders she wished shed brought a coat the suede dress wasnt very warm she watched the riders splaying out over the emerald green arena there were a few girls in black or very dark navy blue coats several irish riders in army uniform or holly green but the majority wore coats as red as an armistice day poppy some of them were pacing out the number of strides between jumps like seconds in a duel others put their hands up to rattle a pole to check how firm it was in the cup others stood eyeing a turn or an angle seeing how safe it was to cut a corner or come in sharply several riders climbed up the famous crittleden bank like a turnedout avocado mousse to examine the fence halfway across on the top the jumps were absolutely colossal humpty hamilton looking stouter than ever in a quilted waistcoat couldnt even see over half of them and there was billy pulling on yet another cigarette gloomily examining the water jump while mavis thirsty from all that easter egg drank frantically trying to lower the water level the indigo clouds had rolled away leaving the softest pale blue sky above the acid green wood which had only a few sad gray streaks where the odd tree had died of dutch elm disease on the hill she could see the gleaming armadillo of parked cars and the caravan village mostly her eyes were drawn to rupert who seemed to be spending more time ribbing his fellow competitors than studying the course unlike the others he didnt look bandylegged or stout or diminished by not being on a horse all round the ring crowds were gathering with binoculars helen reluctantly imagined every eye was on rupert two men in check suits and bowler hats flushed from lunch were going up into the judges box as the riders came out joking and laughing on the nervous high before a big class the cameramen went in most of them in jeans gathering round the water jump a large lady with a huge bust strode round the course with a tape measure checking the height of each jump tracey and marion rode down to the collecting ring one on the dark bay allenby nicknamed the bull the other on the chestnut belgravia god i hate rupe before big classes said marion hes so picky checking and rechecking everything stop it you monster she snapped as belgravia oated up to the eyeballs fidgeted and spooked at everything he passed scattering the crowd with his huge feet and quarters seems on top of the world said tracey wish i was said marion gloomily you havent seen rupes new girlfriend whats she like not really his type redheaded breedylooking quivering with nerves rather like belgravia i suppose he is mad about chestnuts and shes mad about him but trying desperately to hide it sounds like all the rest said tracey even worse shes called macaulay blimey said tracey leaning forward and giving the last bit of her wimpy bun to the bull hes never done that before dont worry i expect shell go the way of all the others he cant be that smitten if he was fooling about with grania pringle last night helen was joined by rupert billy and mavis in the riders stand i wish youd leave that dog behind billy said a steward fussily she brings me luck cant see why she cant bring you luck in your caravan the first riders were crashing their horses over jumps in the practice ring under the oak trees members of the public leaned forward to pat their equine heroes as they passed in their colored rugs what was the course like asked helen bloody you can park a doubledecker bus between the parallel bars said rupert there are only two and a half strides between the double and the wall isnt as solid as it looks if you catch it on the way up youre in dead trouble zee vater must be at least six meters said a german rider gloomily billy looked green and lit another cigarette a man in a felt hat with long sideburns and a raffish face stopped on the way to the commentary box hello boys he said in a carefully modulated puton voice are you going to show them how to do it again today rupert i might if you dont describe me as our most brilliant young rider as i come into the ring in which case ill knock up a cricket score the raffish man laughed id better get upstairs were on the air in two minutes how did the course walk not very good i dont like banks in the high street or in a jumping ring but it may ride better than it walks said rupert surely ride and walk arent transitive verbs thought helen whos that she asked as he moved on dudley diplock does all the commentaries hes a pratt knows buggerall about show jumping everything went quiet as the first rider came in yesterdays winner ludwig von schellenberg on brahms a splendid horse impeccably schooled hes the one to watch billy told helen hes the best rider in the world and was virtually unbeaten last season kraut horses learn obedience the moment they come out of the womb said rupert british spirits were not raised however when the mighty ludwig had a most uncharacteristic twelve faults shows how bloody difficult the course must be said rupert well all be up in the fifties said billy and here comes the despair of the pony club said rupert as ludwig was followed by humpty hamilton on porky boy humpty certainly rode in a very unorthodox fashion pouter pigeon chest stuck out hands held high feet pointing down like a dancing master showing a great patch of blue sky as he rose nearly a foot and a half out of the saddle over every fence nevertheless he acquitted himself well over the punishing course and only had two fences down and a foot in the water for the same number of faults as ludwig after that everyone went to pieces disastrous round followed disastrous round slowing the proceedings up because the course had to be rebuilt every time rupert got to his feet id better go and show them how to do it he said he kissed helen on the cheek i wont be long darling without his redhot presence beside her helen suddenly felt cold a brisk wind was unfurling the flags and spreading out the horses tails on television it had looked like a game for children with toy horses and toy fences the camera had caught nothing of the colossal height of the jumps the pounding hooves the heroic splendor and sheer size of the horses thundering about like some battle of borodino suddenly helen felt scared for rupert arent you terrified terrified said billy clutching mavis for comfort and lighting another cigarette particularly as malise gordon has just arrived and parked himself below us whos he one of the selectors and the new chef dequipe he manages the british team and goes abroad with them to keep them in order whats he like said helen admiring the taut aquiline features the high complexion and the dark hair graying at the temples he looks kind of attractive bit of a tartar stickler for discipline always has spats with rupe well you can never exactly tell what rupes going to do next going to bed sober early and alone has never been his strong point although im sure billy added hastily worried that he might have hurt helen now hes met you hell mend his ways mind you its getting to the stage when rupes so good malise cant afford to leave him out helen watched rupert saunter across the concrete below them then vault over the fence into the collecting ring goodness he must be fit he walked up to marion and belgravia bending down to adjust the bandages on the horses front legs is he that good helen longed to talk about him christ yes doesnt have any nerves cool as an icicle before every class and hes so fast and he meets every fence just right knows what risks he can take too and hes got the killer instinct even in novice classes hes always out to win ivor braine was in the middle of a good round the television man ran nimbly after him with the boom recording the grunts and snorts of his horse sounds like a live sex show said billy we always say its ivors dumbo ears that carry him round ivor was followed by a handsome frenchman in a blue coat with a crimson collar who proceeded to demolish the course as he came thundering down to the water the horse jammed on its brakes and the frenchman took a leisurely somersault through the air landing with a huge splash il est tombé dans leau said billy i know thats going to happen to me and the bull now theyll have to rebuild the course and belgravia wont like the wait in the collecting ring the horse was plunging round eyes rolling nostrils flaring flecks of foam going everywhere a colossal cheer went up as rupert erupted into the ring through the red brick arch in the private boxes people came out onto the balconies to watch clutching their gin and tonics helen was sure she could detect some beatlescreaming belgravia stood still just long enough for rupert to take his hat off fidgeting and stamping to be allowed into action humpty hamilton sat down beside helen belgravia looks completely over the top is it true billy his half brother was second in the grand national belgravia gave three colossal bucks rupert laughed and didnt move in the saddle as the klaxon went off with its eldritch screech the horse bounded forward complete tearaway muttered humpty steerable but not stoppable that horse would benefit from some dressage thought malise gordon disapprovingly if it werent for ruperts colossal strength hed be quite out of control over the brush sailed belgravia over the post and rails over the rustic poles driven on by ruperts erotic pelvic thrusts when he came to the massive upright he flew over it as though it was a tiny log at the gate with crittleden written across it in large red letters he came in too fast slipped just righted himself and rapped the fence hard as he went over for a second it swung back and forth making ruperts fans gasp rupert didnt even bother to glance round with his long stride belgravia managed the double in three strides now he was rounding the corner next moment helen saw belgravias pricked ginger ears appearing over the top of the bank then his lovely head with the white star and then rupert they were on top popping over the little fence then tobogganing down the other side belgravia on his haunches only ruperts superhuman strength again stopped the horse running into the fence at the bottom he was over the crowd gave a cheer over the wall and the combination which caused him no trouble then he kicked belgravia into a gallop and sailed over the water yanking him back to get him in line for the final triple too fast said billy in anguish hes going to hit it helen shut her eyes listening to the thundering hooves waiting for the sickening thud of falling poles and the groans of the crowd instead there was a mighty roar of applause helen opened her eyes ouch said billy looking down helen realized shed been gripping his arm im really sorry be my guest brilliant round wasnt it wonderful helen watched a delighted rupert letting his rein go slack and walking belgravia out of the ring slapping his lathered neck pulling the ginger ears with joy belgravias coat dark bronzed and shiny with sweat looked like uncooked liver that puts me in joint second which means but there are still fifteen to go said humpty helen noticed the arrogant way rupert ignored the cheers sliding to the ground he patted the horse once more and turned towards the riders stand stopped by admirers on the way in an exultant mood he was prepared to sign autographs once you get a clear people realize it can be jumped and youll probably get a lot more said billy if i watch any more rounds ill start getting the heebyjeebies he lit another cigarette mavis closed her slanting eyes to avoid the smoke how long has your mount suffered from hydrophobia asked helen what billy looked alarmed been frightened of water oh ever since i had him i think he might have nearly drowned in some tiny river when he was a foal because it really scares him last week i managed to get him over a sixfoot stream at home but he trembled for ages afterwards i just dont know how hell go today hes such a good horse he went on his face lighting up so kind and such a trier hell get himself into all sorts of trouble rather than duck out and hes so bright over and over i put him wrong and he just brakes at the last moment and sails over and hes so cheerful never moody and so gentle a child could lead him up to london on a piece of string like a little dog helen smiled i think mavis is getting jealous she said oh mavis knows shes my favorite dog and there goes my favorite girl said billy as a blonde with a pink and white complexion on a gray horse waited to go into the ring look at her bloody father telling her to give it a whack at the water and her mother telling her not to poor girls in such a muddle i could sort her out he said longingly good luck darling he called down lavinia looked up waved her whip and smiled her parents looked simply furious how nice he is thought helen and hes ruperts best friend there couldnt be much wrong with rupert if he inspired friendship like this in anguish billy watched poor lavinia after a nervous tentative round meet the same fate as the frenchman flying through the air into the water at least she wont have to wash her hair before she goes out with you this evening said an amused voice it was rupert he was eating an ice cream congratulations said helen bloody well done said billy that should wrap the whole thing up said rupert shooting a sideways glance at billy dont imagine therell be any more clears thanks a lot said billy ive still got to jump oh look at poor darling lavinia coming out in tears she looks like a seal said rupert she may just be dwipping water not cwying lavinia he added to helen cant say her rs it was a good round until she came to the water protested billy that girl couldnt ride in a taxi with the door shut said rupert they ought to pay her disappearance money billy got up can you hold mavis for me he asked helen good luck said rupert as he went downstairs the dog whined and strained after him shut up snapped rupert mavis gave him a cold stare then climbed onto helens knees and settled down with a sigh of deep martyrdom helen though not wild about dogs was grateful for the warmth seeing she was shivering rupert put his red coat round her shoulders the heat still left from his body was like a caress riders kept returning to the stand many of them on twelve faults everyone congratulated rupert he was in tearing spirits until malise gordon came over and sat down on his other side rupert was about to introduce helen when malise said not a bad round but a bit hit and miss ruperts lips tightened his face suddenly expressionless belgravia could do with a lot more work on the flat went on malise and a lot less corn he never felt in any danger to me said rupert coldly you were very lucky at the gate and at the rail after the bank and you came in much too fast at the triple thats a good horse but you wont get him out of trouble every time rupert stared stonily ahead we ought to be thinking of him in terms of the olympics or the world championships said malise in a slightly more conciliatory tone belgraviad be the ideal horse said rupert relenting slightly too in the world championship he explained to helen the four finalists have to jump each others horses belgravias such a sod no one would have a hope on him hardly cricket said malise course it isnt said rupert insolently i thought we were talking about show jumping by the way asked malise have you come across a rider called jake lovell hes been jumping on the northern circuit i think hes very good rupert paused for a second no is he good enough to make the british team he will be in a year or two youd do much better with billy said rupert quickly billy has yet to convince me he has the killer instinct said malise standing up ill probably see you at granias helen could see exactly why he and rupert struck sparks off each other down in the collecting ring billy went up to lavinia greenslade and commiserated with her same things bound to happen to me he said he was just about to ask her out when her mother came up wish you wouldnt call out to lavinia just as shes going into the ring she snapped completely put her off her stroke sorry muttered billy winking at lavinia he walked over to the bull who whickered with joy and stuck his nose inside billys coat built like an oak tree with a vast girth short wideapart wellshaped legs and surprisingly small feet it was the wide forehead and rather small eyes that made him look like a bull the wide blaze down his forehead gave him an added appearance of placid contentment how is he he asked tracey gorgeous said tracey always is didnt rupert jump champion billy rode off trying to control his nerves rupert had been so cockahoop he felt needled into producing something better other riders having finished jumping were all too ready to offer him advice but it was no good listening to other people at this stage hed only get muddled over the years hed schooled himself to tackle the problem by himself in the ring you were on your own the german number two rider hans schmidt came out an irish rider was next then billy how did you get on he asked hans von stop at zee vater said the german despondently and zee gate and zee wall down puts me in second place viz ludvig and humpty bloody good said billy zee bull looks vell put on a lot of condition thanks said billy the collecting ring steward called his number good lucks came from all round billy was very popular as he waited for the irishman to come out a little girl bent over and stroked the bulls nose good luck bull she said shyly billy smiled and thanked her wishing the butterflies in his stomach would go away he couldnt even remember which fence to jump first the bull however showed no such fears striding out briskly ears pricked tail up merry eyes sparkling taking everything in take your hat off billy whispered a ring steward the crowd roared with laughter as billy started and hastily whipped off his hat damp curls sticking to his forehead malise stopped talking to grania pringle in the presidents box i want to watch this round he said must say the bull looks marvelous more than can be said for billy said grania hes pea green take it slowly billy told himself over and over again if you can go clear even with time faults youll be second youre the best youre the best he whispered to the bull as he leaned forward and started cantering as the klaxon went the bull bucketed over the first three fences giving huge scary leaps with inches to spare then he settled down trundling merrily along little legs going like pistons meeting everything just right god that horse has improved said malise as he flew over the double billys really been working on him helen held her breath as the bull scrambled up the bank which after much use was extremely slippery on the top billy steadied him just for a second the bull looked dubious the crowd crossed their fingers in case he stepped back which would have constituted a stop costing billy three faults but he popped over tobogganed down the other side and took a huge jump out over the tiny rail snorting with disapproval ears flat tail swishing didnt enjoy that laughed humpty look at his old tail going who did you say his dam was rupert probably a cow said rupert helen giggled the combination three good solid fences held no fears for the bull hes faster than you said humpty with some satisfaction i know said rupert coldly now it was only the water and the final triple turning the bull billy thundered down his red coat like a spot of blood against the dappled crowd come on billy howled rupert ahead billy saw the water glinting as wide and as blue as the serpentine on each side huddled the photographers waiting for the third ducking go on go on billy whispered youre a star you can do it we can do it he felt the bull tense hes probably thinking its twenty feet deep thought billy just for a second the horse hesitated then suddenly he seemed to relax and put his trust in billy if you think its okay he seemed to say lets give it a whirl people who were close swear to this day that the bull closed his eyes standing back he took a mighty leap off his hocks soaring about six feet in the air and landed three feet beyond the tape on the other side people claim it was the longest jump they had ever seen as he landed the ring erupted in a bellow of cheers go on billy you can do it go on he had only the triple to jump and that had caused no problems to anyone but to the crowds amazement billy suddenly pulled the bull up hugging him patting him running his hand up and down his mane and telling him what a king he was youve got one more fence to jump yelled the photographers youve missed the last fence go back youve still got time shouted the ring steward whod reminded him to take his hat off i know said billy and raising his whip to the judges to show he was retiring he cantered slowly out of the ring in front of the stunned crowd rupert met him in the collecting ring absolutely white with rage bloody maniac what the fuck are you playing at youve just chucked away or it was only you and me in the jumpoff i know said billy but he was so frightened and he jumped the water so bravely i thought id call it a day so he could remember how good hed been rupert looked at him incredulously you must be crazy billy slid off the bull burying his face in the brown shiny shoulder hugging him patting his chest good boy clever boy rupert suddenly realized billys eyes were filled with tears tracey rushed up and removing the rug which shed been wearing round her shoulders for warmth put it over the bull what happened she said in concern did he hurt himself billy shook his head no he said in a choked voice undoing a packet of polos all of which he gave to the bull i was so pleased with him winning didnt seem to matter anymore rupert sighed im afraid malise gordon will feel differently he said i hope you realize youve blown your chances of going to rome he put an arm round billys shoulders all the same it was a bloody good round you were up on the clock on me marion came up with belgravia they want you in the ring rupert as rupert rode off to collect his first prize billy turned to tracey im sorry he said humbly perhaps i shouldnt have done it course you should hes got years ahead look how pleased he is the next minute they went slap into malise who took billy and the bull aside that was a bloody silly thing to do he said billy hung his head im sorry but its the first time hes ever jumped water and it was such a tremendous jump well dont do it again malise patted the bull i must say he looks terrific so dont get carried away and overjump him in the next three weeks ill certainly be needing him for rome if not for madrid billy looked up incredulously what did you say dont go blathering it around to everyone but id like you to bring him to rome he gave the bull another pat and stalked off whatever did he say to you said tracey then seeing there were tears in billys eyes again did he bawl you out no yes no i dont know said billy in a dazed voice i think ill ride the bull back to the stable myself after winning a major competition rupert was usually in a manic mood but today he felt that billy had somehow stolen his thunder malise gordons remarks had niggled him he resented the implication that belgravias win had been a matter of luck if billy hadnt pulled the bull up in that stupid fashion rupert would have been able to prove malise wrong by trouncing billy in the jumpoff against the clock anyway hed like to see malise or anyone else controlling belgravia and all that fuss about dressage it was no more than bloody come dancing he was further irritated that billy despite having chucked away prize money without a thought was behaving as though malise had kissed him under the mistletoe rupert loved billy but he was constantly irked by billys hazy assumption that the lord or rupert campbellblack would provide like many generous people rupert liked to have the monopoly of the expansive gesture billys could have gone a long way towards repainting the yard it never occurred to rupert that billy might have beaten him after the competition the heavens opened and journalists and other riders crowded into ruperts caravan to get out of the rain but after drinking ruperts health in ruperts champagne out of the huge silver cup he had just won they were far more interested in talking about the bulls amazing jump and billys retirement rupert loved billy but he did not like playing second fiddle he might have been indifferent to public adulation but he liked it to be there so he could be indifferent to it leaving them all gassing together he took half a bottle of champagne into the shower as the drumming of raindrops on the caravan roof drowned the noise of the hot water he was gripped by the lust that always overwhelmed him after a big class normally he would have screwed marion in the back of the horse box but he doubted if she would oblige with a quickie with helen around anyway he didnt want marion he was amazed by his violent craving for helen he must get her into bed soon only that could restore his amour propre and remove the ache from his loins hed already told billy to find somewhere else to shack up for the night as he needed the caravan for helen and himself but although he knew she was hooked on him he was by no means sure she was going to be a pushover hed have to make her jealous he knew grania pringle would oblige helen in fact was feeling absolutely miserable she knew rupert was busy that this was his world but he had this ability to be all over her one moment and virtually oblivious of her the next since hed won the cup hed been completely withdrawn and now all these people were guzzling his drink talking shop and ignoring her only the german hans schmidt who had rather mad arctic blue eyes had made any attempt to chat her up but he hadnt seen any of the german movies she so admired and when she got him on to writers it was even worse i just adore brecht she said with enthusiasm i too am a great admirer of breasts said hans brightening perceptibly and gazing at her bosom no brecht the writer ya ya said hans small breasts big breasts its quite all right viz me for zee ladies to like other ladies breasts helen went pink and hastily started talking about gunther grass she thought she was making progress the german seemed most interested until he suddenly said vot is zis grass is it some kind of hay which rupert feed his horses so she gave up and he turned back to humpty hamilton who was having an argument with the man from the daily telegraph about dust allergy billy still being interviewed by joanna battie from the chronicle who was showing all the intensity of someone who realizes theyve stumbled on a really good story could do little more than smile apologetically and shove the bottle in helens direction from time to time unaware of the taciturnity and habitual suspicion towards outsiders of all showjumping people helen felt she must have lost her sex appeal nor did she realize they were too wary of rupert to chat up one of his girlfriends she longed to be able to shower and change before lady pringles party shed never met a member of the british aristocracy before and wondered if she ought to curtsey and how she should address her her mother always emphasized the importance of using peoples names when you talked to them was it milady or your grace or what shed liked to have asked joanna or marion who had just returned exhausted from settling the horses but they both looked at her with such hostility to hell with them all she thought helping herself to another drink i am a writer i must observe life and listen to british dialogue one of the journalists was ringing his newspaper on ruperts telephone im sure he was half brother to arctic prince said humpty he was own brother said ivor sullenly half brother own brother i ought to know i rode the horse i must use the telephone next to ring my news desk said the man from the telegraph at this moment rupert came out of the shower a dark blue towel round his hips blond hair dark and otter sleek helen felt her stomach give way i want to change so would you all fuck off he said coldly dont mind us said humpty you never have before wasnt polar pete half brother to arctic prince i dont care get outall of you and get off my telephone malcolm he ripped the telephone wire out of its socket i was on to the news desk singing your praises said malcolm indignantly i dont care beat it grumbling they all dispersed into the sheeting rain running with their coats over their heads until only billy and helen were left rupert replugged the telephone it rang immediately at a nod from rupert billy picked it up rupert came over and kissed helen he tasted of toothpaste and smelt faintly of eau de cologne in the safety of billys chaperonage she allowed herself to melt against him kissing him back until she could hardly stand rupert put a hand on her breast i can feel your heart he said softly and it sure is racing ahem said billy sorry to interrupt but its dick brandon he wants to drop in for a drink hell oh all right tell him to come over go and have a shower darling the waters baking will it be very fancy tonight not particularly shall i wear pants ruperts eyes gleamed that was getting somewhere certainly not he said helen was relieved to find that the shower unlike the showers at regina house gushed out constant hot water but there was no lock on the door and helen imagined rupert barging in so she showered with frantic haste she put on a black silk jersey dress with a discreetly low back and pale gray tights which stuck to her legs because they were still wet outside she found that the double bed had been let down from the wall joining the two bench seats it formed a huge area on top of the dark blue duvet lounged rupert wearing a striped shirt and gray trousers perching on the edge of the bed were billy and a man in a light check suit with an expansive redveined face bags under his eyes and blond hair going gray they were threequarters of the way down another bottle of champagne ruperts eyes were beginning to glitter slightly well if the horse is so bloody good i cant see why youre selling her said brandon shes not quite up to my weight and shes too sensitive for me you know what i feel about mares suddenly they all noticed helen standing there white skin flushed from the shower brilliant red hair falling over her forehead the perfect contrast to the black dress the man in the check suit whistled oh boy he said come here sweetheart as she came towards him he ran his hand down her pearly gray stockinged leg as if she were a horse now this im really prepared to offer for rupert laughed and reaching out for helen pulled her down beside him offering her his glass to drink out of then he ruffled her hair gazing into the huge shy bruised eyes im afraid this ones definitely not for sale dick he said christ rupe is a lucky sod thought billy she gets more stunning by the minute another bottle of champagne was consumed and the rain had stopped before they set out for grania pringles party the setting sun was firing the puddles and bathing the dripping trees with a soft pink light rupert and billy both already slightly tight and in raging spirits walked on either side of helen putting their inside arms through hers and lifting her over the muddier ground where my caravan has rested flowers i leave you on the grass caroled billy in a quavering baritone as they walked past the caravan village mavis ran on ahead picking up her blond feet like a hackney pony delicately tiptoeing along the runnels of the puddles on the way they stopped to check the horses who were dozing in nine inches of wood shavings the bull was looking out of his box and mavis scampered up and licked him on the nose helen couldnt help noticing how both the bull and kitchener whickered with pleasure to see billy nudging at his pockets for polos but both belgravia and mayfair and the younger novice horses flattened their ears and backed off as rupert approached got to show them whos boss said rupert lightly but adding that it was getting chilly he put an extra rug on belgravia dont forget the antifreeze said billy and promptly burst into song again then he said im going to make the most enormous play for lavinia greenslade tonight wavish her in the whododendwons said rupert like hell you will ill give you a tenner if you get to first base the pringles lived in a large georgian house behind the crittleden elm wood looking over a lake and a cherry orchard whose white blossom was now tinged almond pink by the last rays of the sun helen gave a gasp of pleasure loveliest of trees the cherry now she gushed expansively is hung with bloom along the bough hung with bloomers said rupert deliberately mishearing her sounds just like nanny what were those bloody great things she insisted on wearing winter and summer directoire knickers said billy thats right when she hung them on the line on washday we always thought theyd carry the house away like an air balloon they both collapsed with laughter in order not to be a spoilsport helen tried to join in from the noise issuing from the front door the party was obviously well under way as helen changed out of mudspattered boots into black highheeled shoes a handsome blonde scent rising like incense from the cleavage of her splendid bosom came out to welcome them rupert darling how lovely to see you she gathered him into a braceleted embrace over his shoulder her sootily mascaraed eyes appraised the rest of them affording helen and mavis about the same amount of enthusiasm thats grania pringle thought helen close up she didnt look very ladylike must you bring that creature in here she said to billy love me love my dog said billy unrepentantly sorry grania but she howls the caravan down if i leave her behind well i dont have any difficulty loving you but i do draw the line at mavis you havent met helen macaulay said rupert extracting himself from her clutches she comes from florida where tomatoes she informs me are their tertiary industry tomatoes said lady pringle how extraordinary your mother gave me a marvelous recipe for tomato provençale last time i saw her rupe we all stank of garlic for weeks afterwards but it was simply delicious she turned back to helen are you a horsey gel no thank god said rupert she works in publishing and shes absolutely fed up with humpty hamilton and ivor braine and billy gassing about bloodlines all afternoon have you invited any intellectuals for her to talk to only malise gordon said grania he writes books frightfully clever chap you must meet him but hes rather hemmed in by lavinia greenslades parents who are twying to persuade him to take lavinia to wome must be mad said rupert she couldnt even stay on the wocking horse at hawwods shut up said billy grinning billys rather a fan of lavinias explained rupert hes longing to wape her and lavinias daddy will be so cwoss hell come and wun me over in his wollswoyce said billy grania screamed with laughter she was already beginning to get seriously on helens nerves you boys are awful come and have a drink if greenslade mère and père are bending malises ear that means lavinia must be unchaperoned for a second and im off said billy and vanished into the crowd in the next room im afraid ive hidden the whisky rupert said grania you know what pigs this lot are but youll find some in the decanter in the library and theres another bottle in the kitchen cupboard whisky however was only for rupert helen had to make do with a glass of very indifferent sparkling wine the next moment grania had swept her away from rupert and thrust her into a loudly arguing group consisting of several show jumpers and joanna battie now then joanna said grania briskly you cant monopolize all these delicious chaps this is helen macaulay boys shes frightfully clever and works for a publisher in london now i know all you show jumpers are writing your autobiographies so why dont you get her to publish yours come along rupert my sisters dying to meet you and off she swept leaving helen scarlet with embarrassment hi again she mumbled to joanna are you all writing books she asked the ring of men too busy keeping them said a man with brushedforward hair and a pale pinched disapproving face who was drinking tomato juice joannas the writer round here arent you joe except she gets it all wrong never met a journalist who got anything right grumbled humpty hamilton last week the telegraph said porky boy was out of sally in our alley i mean everyone knows windsor lass was his dam oh shut up humpty snapped the man with brushedforward hair you told us that yesterday you should come off the wagon driffield said humpty its making you very badtempered ive lost twelve pounds which is more than i can say for you humpty you look five months gone in that sweater how much dyou reckon rupert weighs said ivor braine who was gazing at helen with his mouth open helen should know said joanna acidly about twelve stone i should think said humpty and eleven stone of that is pieces of paper with girls phone numbers on said joanna helen flushed she hated joanna and her flat little voice and hair drawn back from her forehead she was more deadpan even than the show jumpers how long have you been reducing for she asked driffield about a month you must have terrific control no he cut right across her thats wrong humpty he went clear no he didnt he had four faults and he was at least a quarter of a second slower than rupert against the clock helen gritted her teeth across the room as the horsey chat ebbed and flowed endlessly round her she could see rupert talking to dick brandon hemmed in by women all braying like grania every few minutes she noticed grania fed in another one and saw to it that ruperts glass of whisky was constantly topped up every so often he looked across and mouthed all right to helen and pride made her nod back she was certain grania had deliberately thrust her into a group of small men she topped all of them in her high heels separated from rupert she wanted him to be able to see her as the center of attention being madly chatted up but among this lot she felt about as attractive as a spayed great dane among a lot of jack russells she bent her legs slightly now they were discussing whod bought what horses during the winter and which looked as though they were going to be the most promising novices hans schmidt wearing slightly too fitted and too bright blue a blazer came up clicked his heels and kissed helens hand ha mees helen of troy he said helen turned to him gratefully but next minute he was caught up with the others discussing some potentially unbeatable hanoverian mare over in the corner billy was hanging over the back of an armchair shared by mavis and lavinia greenslade after her dunking in the water shed rewashed and curled her hair a belted peacock blue dress showed off her tiny waist her small hand rested on maviss head billy and shell have very curlyhaired children thought helen she wished rupert would look after her like that she must pull herself together and try and be more extrovert the group had moved on to discussing the best routes to take to the next show which was in the west country the as much quicker said humpty hamilton suddenly they were joined by an amazing woman of about sixty squat with a discernible black mustache on her upper lip she was wearing a hairnet a red flannel nightgown bedroom slippers and looked thought helen not unlike president nixon in drag hello boys she said in her deep voice if we dont get something to eat soon youll have to carry me home she was just about to move on when she caught sight of helen gave her the most enthusiastic eyemeet shed received all evening and joined the group whos that whispered helen holding out her glass to a passing waitress monica carlton whispered humpty law unto herself breeds welsh cobs always comes to parties in her nightgown then can get absolutely plastered and doesnt have the hassle of undressing when she gets back to her caravan while that waitress is here she might as well fill me up too said miss carlton thrusting her glass at humpty you look familiar she added to joanna battie we met at olympia last christmas said joanna i write for the chronicle dreadful rag boomed miss carlton retrieving her full glass still it comes in useful for wiping up puppies widdle helen giggled scenting enthusiasm miss carlton turned towards her youre a lovely little thing she went on we certainly havent met id have remembered you she looked helen up and down approvingly dont belong to any of these boring little farts do you might have guessed it too good for any of them i resent that said humpty the amount of times ive given you a firemans lift home after parties monica well perhaps youre better than some now where are you from my beauty she said turning her full attention on helen are you going to be here tomorrow i dont know stammered helen well if you are ill take you for a spin round the countryside in my trap youd enjoy that my two chaps travel at a spanking pace and she was off describing the merits of her two cobs who it seemed had won prizes at every show in england as she talked her eyes wandered over helens body and the hand not clutching a glass squeezed helens waist on every possible opportunity around them helen was vaguely aware of all the show jumpers creasing themselves with laughter none of them was prepared to rescue her everyone all right it was grania flitting past just admiring your antiques called out helen desperately im a real chippendale freak oh you americans are always mad about old things you must meet my husband i see youve already met naughty monica she patted miss carltons bristly cheek grubs up downstairs by the way thank god for that said humpty im starving come on everyone rupert caught up with her just as she was entering the dining room all right darling sorry to neglect you im in the process of selling a horse im fine said helen hardly able to trust herself to speak just fine you must be starving ill get you a plate but the next moment hed been lassooed by a large woman in red asking him what had happened to some horse shed sold him last year next minute the crowds had closed around him turning around helen saw miss carlton bearing down on her with two huge plates of chicken and rice cooee she shouted desperately helen fled in the other direction where she could see billy and mavis and lavinia sharing another armchair shed just have to play gooseberry please she rushed up to them can i talk with you ruperts with some woman and miss carltons on the warpath of course billy got to this feet you havent met lavinia have you are you having an awful party i havent seen much of rupert she said trying to keep the bitterness out of her voice i know im sorry hes still haggling with dick brandon and its the first real show of the season no ones seen each other all together for ages if you know what i mean theyve got a lot to catch up on oh billy darling said lavinia ive forgotten to put any fwench dwessing on my lettuce can you get me some and do see if theres any more of that delicious garlic bwead for a second helens eyes met billys but both of them managed not to giggle well if monica comes up you must protect helen hes weally nice isnt he said lavinia dreamily mummy doesnt approve because hes such a fwiend of wuperts not but what wupert isnt very attwactive she added hastily but mummy thinks wupert leads billy astway is this your first date with him no said helen finding herself chewing and chewing on the same piece of chicken my second goodness said lavinia her china blue eyes widening that must be a wecord billy came back and they were joined by humpty and ivor braine with a bottle of red i say helen said humpty going rather pink you certainly made a hit with monica oh dear said helen blushing thinks youre the prettiest filly shes seen in years said ivor and roared with laughter going to take you in her trap tomorrow she says well dont get twapped in her twap said lavinia she chased me round the tackwoom once better watch out she breeds her own welsh cobs they say she doesnt even need a stallion said billy well at least shes better than driffield grumbled ivor since hes given up booze hes got so badtempered the big fairy said humpty lets chuck him in the lake after dinner next moment hans joined them carrying a plate of trifle mind my dog said billy as the german prepared to sit heavily on the sleeping mavis hans rolled his eyes in the air always zee same zee english zee dog sleep in zee chair or zee bed zee husband sleep on the floor you are american fraulein helen are zey not crazy people why not come back to germany wiz me i say hans off said humpty youll have to fight a duel with monica you might also have rupert to contend with said billy giving mavis the rest of his chicken no rupert is no problem i can beat him any day of zee week how do you say it against zee cock but monica she is different proposition she is superman if monica stake a claim i can only love you from afar helen felt suddenly happy she hadnt been a flop after all in their clumsy way they were paying her attention accepting her ragging her as they ragged each other oh blast said lavinia here come mummy and daddy theyve been talking to malise an awfully long time talk to me like mad helen and billy you turn away and talk like mad to humpty and hans and geoff then perhaps they wont suspect anything where did you get that lovely dwess helen bus stop said helen my mother doesnt really approve of me wearing black nor mine said lavinia if youre here tomowwow you must come and have a cup of tea in our cawavan its not gwand like wuperts once again helen felt overwhelmed with pleasure particularly when driffield suddenly brought her a plate of fruit salad this moment must go down in history said humpty it is the first time driffield has ever done anything for anyone else in his life wheres joanna she must put it in the chronicle are you feeling all right driffield said billy hes dwunk too much tomato juice said lavinia driffield went scarlet and looked irritated and pleased at the same time they were all laughing then helen looked across the room and her happiness evaporated there was rupert standing by the sofa signing autographs for some girl and still talking to dick brandon who was sitting down beside brandon sat grania talking to another woman helen watched frozen as she saw grania slide her hand up and down the inside of ruperts thigh those beautiful brown muscular thighs shed seen earlier rupert did not move grania carried on leaping to her feet and spilling the fruit salad mostly over the carpet and mavis helen fled from the room darling yelled rupert as she passed he caught up with her in the hall where are you off to then seeing her stricken face whats the matter and taking her hand he pulled her into a nearby room which turned out to be an office with desks and ledgers and a calendar of spikylegged racehorses on the wall rupert leant against the door now whats the matter i thought you were having a good time helen backed away until she found herself sitting in a wire basket im fed up with all these people treating you like public property she said rupert shrugged come back to the caravan now and i promise you my undivided attention until morning like hell in five minutes someonell be banging on the door trying to sell you a horse or asking for your autograph for their great aunt rupert laughed temper temper im sorry about all these people it was positively obscene all those women hanging round you like wasps round a molasses tin rupert felt a surge of triumph it had worked she really was jealous im fed up with them all gabriella and bianca and that obnoxious joanna she emphasized all the as and marion looking daggers at me all afternoon and worst of all grania if shes a lady im the queen of sheba dont be silly no one ever suggested she was her father made his fortune flogging laxatives do you honestly think i fancy her shes like some geriatric canary you didnt think so two minutes ago when she was running her hand up and down your thigh like an adrenalized tarantula i was hemmed in autograph hunter to the right prospective buyer to the left i couldnt just prise her off it might have distracted dick brandon do you realize ive just made twenty grand bully for you youve also just lost a girlfriend he put his head on one side and grinned at her a girlfriend have i just he said mockingly then his voice softened dont be such a crosspatch and he came towards her pinning her against the table so she couldnt escape now youre hemmed in and dont you like it he said drawing her towards him until he was holding her tight against his body which was so smooth and hard it seemed to curve into hers like expensive soap for a second she melted her longing for him was so strong her relief to be in his arms gently he pulled down the shoulder of her dress and began to kiss her along her collarbone the other hand glided over her bottom chicken you are wearing pants i am not im wearing a dress whats this then he pinged the elastic panties said helen quickly rupert sighed there is a language barrier he said helen suddenly twigged you thought id go to a party without panties she said in a shocked voice i hoped you might seeing as how youre going to take off all your clothes for me later this evening no said helen struggling away im not going to be another of your fancy bits just to be spat out like chewing gum when the flavors gone rupert started to laugh fancy bit what an extraordinary phrase sounds like a gag snaffle and i dont like chewing gum very much nanny always said it was common why do you trivialize everything wailed helen i just dont want to be rushed oh really drawled rupert would you rather we made a date for the year would january fifth be okay or would the sixth suit you better im afraid i cant make the seventh perhaps you could check in your diary oh stop it i just dont believe in jumping into bed with people who dont give a damn for me you havent given me much chance you can hardly expect me to swear eternal devotion on the second date i dont sobbed helen i truly dont i just dont want to get hurt again harold mountjoy oh dear now were going to be subjected to another sermon on the mountjoy is that it you only go to bed with married men if i get married to someone else then can i fuck you please dont use that kind of language whats wrong with the word fuck thats what were discussing arent we stop being so bloody middle class i am middle class personally i think prickteaser is a much worse word than fuck why the hell did you come down here then i wanted to see you you can all of me come back to the caravan no screamed helen im going back to london how asked rupert wheres the nearest railroad station about ten miles away and frankly im not going to drive you nor am i going to lend you one of my horses although i suppose you could borrow a bike from one of granias children or perhaps monica could whizz you home in her trap helen burst into tears running to the door she went slap into grania pringle oh there you are darling ive been looking for you everywhere rupert can i borrow you for a sec helen gave a sob and fled down the passage she locked herself in the john twice someone came and rattled the door then went away again the party was still roaring away downstairs and from the shouts and catcalls seemed to be spilling out into the garden feeling suicidal she washed her face and combed her hair creeping out into the passage she saw the huge red nightgowned back of monica carlton she was talking to mrs greenslade terrified helen shot into reverse taking the nearest door on her left helen pushed open the door and found herself in a library where the only gaps in the walls not covered with books were filled with vast family portraits in one corner on a revolving stand stood a globe of the world with the map of america turned towards her the states all blurred together and sepia with age a fire leaping in the grate gave off a sweet tart smell of apple logs reminding her of her grandmothers house in the mountains and filling her with such homesickness that she had to choke back her sobs and blow her nose several times on an overworked paper handkerchief drawn instinctively towards the bookshelves she was halfway across the room before she realized a man was sitting in an armchair in front of the fire reading i am sorry she said with a gulp i didnt mean to disturb you youre not im hiding from mrs greenslade et alia we werent introduced this afternoon malise gordon he put out his hand helen macaulay she mumbled sit down ill get you a glass of algies brandy please dont bother he didnt answer and went over to the drinks trolley he was wearing a pinstripe suit threadbare but well cut across the shoulders with turnups and a fob watch she noticed the upright military bearing the thin mouth the eyes courtesy of british steel corporation he was the kind of englishman one used to see in old war movies trevor howard or michael redgrave who hid any emotion behind a clipped voice a stiff upper lip and sangfroid what were you reading she asked rupert brooke oh said helen in surprise how lovely theres one rupert brooke poem i really love how does it go these laid the world away she began in her soft voice poured out the red sweet wine of youth gave up the years to be of work and joy and that unhoped serene that men call age and those who would have been their sons they gave their immortality her voice broke as she was suddenly stabbed with grief at the thought of harold mountjoys child that she had lost its so beautiful and so sad she went on for a second the color seemed to drain out of malise gordons face then he handed helen the glass of brandy how extraordinary he said i was just reading that poem my father was at school with rupert brooke what was he like oh awfully nice according to my mother your father must have some marvelous stories about him probably did unfortunately he was killed in in the last advance of the war thats just terrible you never knew your father did you go to rugby too he nodded i so enjoy the rugby poets said helen walter savage landor clough arnold they have a deep melancholy about them which i find very appealing i did the victorian poets for my major i think matthew arnold is by far the most interesting seeing her curled up on the sofa having kicked off her shoes the firelight flickering on her pale face malise thought she was the most beautiful girl he had ever seen her ankles were so slender he wondered how they could bear the weight of her body or her long slender neck the weight of that glorious titian hair quivering with misery she was like a beech leaf suddenly blown by the gale against a wall he had the feeling that at any moment the gale might whisk her away again he would like to have painted her just like that against the faded gold sofa where is rupert he asked being enjoyed by his adoring public actually hes just been borrowed by lady pringle shes never been very scrupulous about giving people back shes kinda glamorous but very old said helen then realizing that grania must be younger than malise gordon added hastily for a woman i mean or rather a lady hardly said malise echoing rupert oh i know about the laxatives said helen but all these ancestors she waved a hand round the walls all fakes said malise cutting the end off a cigar i restore pictures as a sideline granias greatgrandmother over there he pointed to a bosomy victorian lady was actually painted in helen giggled feeling more cheerful you and rupert just had a row helen nodded what about he wants to go to the max malise raised his eyebrows in england i think you call it the whole hog ah yes hes so arrogant he ignores me all evening selling some horse then expects me to go meekly back and spend the night in his caravan i said i was going back to london so he told me to find my own way i just dont know what to do ill take you im going back to london tonight but i live in shepherds bush its way out rupert claims hes never heard of it rupert on occasions can be very affected its about a mile from my flat it couldnt be easier to drop you off cutting through her stammerings of gratitude he started to ask her about herself about america her family her university her ambitions to be a writer and her job he even knew her boss nice chap never read a book in his life but no one seems interested in books over here sighed helen picking up the rupert brooke this is a first edition and they havent even bothered to cut the pages i dont understand the british i mean they have all this marvelous culture on their doorsteps and theyre quite indifferent to it half the office hasnt even been inside st pauls and john donne actually preached there ruperts mother has shelves full of first editions no one ever reads them she keeps them behind bars as though they were dangerous animals full of subversive ideas they never even know whos painted their ancestors unless its a gainsborough theyre going to flog at christies for half a million said malise then theyre fairly sharp that lot out there cant talk about anything but horses said helen bitterly you mustnt blame them said malise for most of the season which goes on sadly for most of the year now theyre spending twentyfour hours a day with those horses studying them schooling worrying about their health chauffeuring them from one show to another that lot you met next door have battled their way to the top against the fiercest competition and it hasnt been easy were in the middle of a recession petrol prices are rocketing overheads are colossal show jumpings a very tough competitive sport and only a few make it and unless they keep on winning they dont survive he got up and walked over to the globe and spun it round pointing to the tiny faded pink shrimp that was england most of them would never have left the villages they were born in if they hadnt been brilliant horsemen now as a result of this brilliance they are kings to the public household names ambassadors to their country all over the world rome today madrid tomorrow new york the day after constantly on television yet most of them havent an o level between them often youll hear the winner of a competition gabbling to his horses all the way round coaxing him over those huge jumps yet ask him to describe that round in a television interview afterwards and hell be completely tonguetied theyre physical people and they think in physical terms and theyre far more at home with horses than they are with humans and they distrust anyone with any kind of learning because it makes them feel inadequate but dont underestimate them because they lack the gift of tongues it doesnt mean they dont feel things deeply he paused frowning at her then smiled im sorry i didnt mean to lecture you i know what youve been going through today ever since i was appointed chef dequipe last year ive been trying to break down these barriers of suspicion you simply cant apply army discipline and expect them to jump into line they are all deeply individualistic chippy very highly strung despite their deadpan exteriors they get terribly het up before a big class but once they accept you youre in for keeps unless you do something very silly he thought it was time to change the subject is your firm publishing any decent books this summer and they went back to talking about literature which malise enjoyed because she was so adorably pompous and earnest and because he could see how she was relaxing and gaining confidence and just watching that exquisite face gave him pleasure he was tempted to ask her to sit for him i wish i could meet someone like rupert brooke she was saying i guess he can be regarded as the most charismatic personality of his generation malise gordon winced and put another log on the fire i wish your generation wouldnt so willfully misuse words helen laughed i guess then that rupert was the most glamorous character of his generation taking my name in vain said a voice rupert was standing in the doorway his face quite expressionless no said malise gordon we were discussing another rupert a poet quite unlike me said rupert lightly helen knows im an intellectual dolt dont you darling he turned to helen still smiling but she knew beneath that bland exterior he was angry i wondered where youd got to talking to me since grania er borrowed you how nice said rupert so no doubt youve discussed every exhibition and play and foreign film on in london perhaps youve even graduated to henry james we hadnt got round to him yet said malise thatll have to wait till next time said rupert come and dance he added to helen it was definitely an order but before she could move a sound of screams whoops and catcalls rent the air drowning the deafening pounding of music the noise was coming from outside malise drew back the heavy dark green velvet curtains a group of men were running through the moonlit cherry orchard carrying something that was wriggling frantically like a sheep about to be dipped theyre throwing driffield in the lake said rupert isnt that lake polluted asked helen in worried tones rupert laughed it soon will be if they throw driffield in he took helens wrist come on darling malise took his watch out of his waistcoat pocket we ought to head for home he said we asked rupert his fingers tightening on helens wrist then she said all in a rush colonel gordons going back to london tonight hes very kindly offered me a lift thats ridiculous there isnt anywhere for me to sleep graniall give you a bed partys hardly got going yet events would bely that said malise as bellows guffaws and sounds of splashing issued from the lake i hope driffield doesnt catch cold its hardly the weather for midnight bathing as for grania putting helen up im sure every bed and sofa in the house is already heaving with occupants shall we go he turned to helen she nodded unable to speak part of her longed to stay with rupert shed never seen anyone so angry his blue eyes narrowed to slits his face pale as marble he picked a white narcissus out of the flower vase examining the crinkly orange center ill drive you back to vagina house he said dont be silly said malise crushingly youve got classes early tomorrow and youve had far too much to drink police always patrol the worthinglondon road at this hour of night not worth risking your license you cant afford to be off the road for a year i am quite capable of driving said rupert through gritted teeth and then youd have to turn round and drive all the way back be reasonable rupert turned to helen you really want to go i guess so looking down rupert found he had shredded the narcissus one petal was left she loves me not he said ill get my coat said helen fleeing from the room she nearly fell over monica carlton fast asleep in her red nightgown propped against the gong on her lap lay a plate of chocolate mousse which mavis was busy finishing up in the room where shed left her coat and boots a couple were heaving on the bed billy we must be careful said a voice mummy will be fuwious if she catches us billy was going to win his tenner thought helen as she grabbed her belongings and let herself out of the room mavis shot through her feet to join in the fun outside she found hans schmidt swaying in front of her fraulein helen he said triumphantly come and dance wiz me he was just about to drag her off in the direction of the music when malise and rupert came out of the library both looking wintry to make matters worse hans insisted on coming out to the car with them and roaring with laughter when he discovered what was going on you are losing zee touch rupert he kept saying fuck off snarled rupert then as helen got into the car your things are still in the caravan only my suede dress said helen ill get marion to post it on to you said rupert and without even saying goodbye turned on his heel and stalked back into the house theres absolutely no need to cry said malise as the headlights lit up the grass verge and the pale green undersides of the spring trees thats definitely thirtylove to you dyou think hell ever call me again said helen with a sniff course he will its a completely new experience to rupert not getting his own way very good for him malise slipped a beethoven quintet into the stereo helen lay back reveling in the music and thinking how much rupert would hate it ahead along the winding road she watched the cats eyes light up as their car approached all right said malise sure i was thinking the cats eyes were like girls all lighting up as rupert approached and rupert never dims his headlights said malise is it worth it me going on with him that is if he does ring me depends if youve reached the stage when you cant not in which case any advice i give you will be meaningless explain him to me pleaded helen all i hear is gossip from people who hardly know him ive known his family for years ruperts mother was exquisitely beautiful but deeply silly she couldnt cope with rupert at all and abandoned him to a series of nannies who all spoilt him because they were frightened of him or felt sorry for him he learnt far too early in life that by making himself unpleasant he could get his own way the only decent relationship he had was with old nanny heald and she was his fathers old nanny so she didnt look after rupert very long ruperts mother of course was besotted with adrian ruperts younger brother who was sweet curlyhaired plump easygoing and who of course has turned into a roaring pansy as a result i dont think rupert really likes women he certainly doesnt trust them subconsciously i think he enjoys kicking them in the teeth just to pay them back as a sex for letting him down when he was a child hes bright though and enormously talented funnily enough the one thing that might save him could be a good marriage but shed have to be a very remarkable girl to take the flak as they reached the motorway he put his foot on the accelerator wouldnt it be easier he said to find a respectably rising barrister or some bright young publisher helen shrugged i guess so but he is kind of addictive you take a lot of trouble with all these guys have you got kids of your own weve got a daughter she events oh said helen thats what mark phillips does as opposed to rupert thats right any sons no there was a pause then he said in a measured deliberately matteroffact voice we had a boy he was killed in northern ireland last year oh said helen aghast im desperately sorry he drove into a booby trap killed outright which i suppose was a mercy but not for you said helen you werent able to say goodbye oh hell she said to herself thats why he was reading that rupert brooke poem and i came barging in with all my problems were you very close she asked yes i think so the awful thing was that im not sure he really wanted to go into the army at all just felt he ought to because my father had a dazzling war and and you got an mc billy told me but timmy was really rather a rebel we had an awful row hed got some waitress pregnant felt he ought to marry her he didnt love her he just had principles we tried to dissuade him his last leave was all rows my wife in hysterics what happened to the baby it was a false alarm which made the whole thing more ironic now i wish it hadnt been at least wed have something of him left they had reached london now when they got to regina house he got out as well a few stars had managed to pierce the russet haze hanging over london lit from behind by the streetlight there were no lines on his face helen swallowed took a deep breath to conquer her shyness and stammered i always dreamed english men would be just like you and its taken me six months in this country to find one and putting her hand on his shoulder she kissed him quickly on the cheek thank you so much for my lift i do hope we meet again absolutely no doubt about that said malise young rupertll be on the warpath in no time but listen to an old campaigner play it cool dont let him have it all his own way malise let himself into his lowndes street flat and switched off the burglar alarm it was a cheerless place his wife had conventional tastes tending to eau de nil wallpaper overhead lights and sloane square chintz she was away in the country eventing with their daughter the marriage had not been a success they had stayed together because of the children but now there was only henrietta left in the drawing room on an easel standing on a dust sheet was an oil painting of a hunting scene malise was restoring he could finish it in two hours he didnt feel tired instead he poured himself a glass of brandy and set to work thinking about that exquisite redhead she was wasted on rupert he was not entirely sure of his motives in whisking her back to london was it a desire to put rupert down or because he couldnt bear the thought of rupert sleeping with her tonight forcing his drunken hamfisted attentions on her for a minute he imagined painting her in his studio not bothering to turn on the lights as dusk fell then taking her across to the narrow bed in the corner and making love to her so slowly and gently she wouldnt realize it had been miraculous until it was all over he cursed himself for being a fool he was fiftytwo thirty years her senior probably a disgusting old man in her eyes yet she had stirred him more than any woman he had met for years shed have done for timmy he picked up the photograph on the piano the features that smiled back at him were very like his own but less grim and austere more cleareyed and trusting were rupert and billy and humpty merely timmy substitutes was that why hed taken the job of chef dequipe after six months he was surprised almost indignant at the pain putting the photograph down he slumped on the sofa his face in his hands as helen let herself into regina house the telephone was ringing shush shush she pleaded and rushing forward reached the receiver just before the principal of the hostel furious and bristling in her hairnet its one oclock in the morning she hissed i wont have people ringing so late but helen ignored her hunching herself over the telephone to ward off the outside world praying as shed never prayed before she put it to her ear hello said a slightly slurred voice can i speak to helen macaulay oh yes you can this is she bloody bitch said rupert waltzing off with the one man in the room i cant afford to punch on the nose helen leant joyously against the wall oblivious of the gesticulating crone in the hairnet are you okay rupert went on fine where are you back in my horrible little caravan alone ive got your dress here like a shed snakeskin it reeks of your scent i wish you were here to fill it oh so do i said helen again at a distance she felt free to come on more strongly look im on the road this week and most of next i havent really got myself together but ill ring you towards the end of the week and ill try and get up to london on monday or tuesday rupert she pleaded i didnt want to go off with malise it was just that you seemed so otherwise engaged all evening trying to make you jealous didnt work did it wont try that again in a hurry for the next few weeks rupert laid siege to helen throwing her into total confusion on the one hand he epitomized everything she disapproved of he was flip except about winning spoilt philistine hedonistic immoral and very rightwing eating south african oranges just to irritate her and in the street which her mother had drummed into her one must never do the few dates they were able to snatch in between ruperts punishing showjumping schedule and helens job always ended in rows because she wouldnt sleep with him on the other hand she had very much taken to heart malises remarks about ruperts disturbed childhood and the possibility that he might be redeemed by a good marriage could she be the one to transform this wild boy into the greatest show jumper of his age there was a strong element of reforming zeal in helens character she had a great urge to do good princess anne had also just announced her engagement to mark phillips and every girl in england was in love with the handsome captain who looked so macho in his uniform and who despite being pretty unforthcoming when interviewed on television was obviously a genius with horses princess anne looked blissfully happy and when one considered rupert was just as beautiful as captain phillips and extremely articulate when interviewed about anything did it matter pondered helen as she tossed and turned in her narrow bed in regina house reading a e housman and matthew arnold that she and rupert couldnt talk about sartre and henry james he was young he could learn malise said he was bright anyway all this fretting was academic because rupert hadnt mentioned marriage or said that he loved her but he rang her from all over europe and managed to snatch an evening however embattled with her about once a fortnight and he had invited her to fly out to lucerne for a big show at the beginning of june so she had plenty of hope to sustain her meanwhile the ira were very active in london exploding bombs everyone was very jumpy and her mother wrote her endless letters saying that she need no longer stay in england a year that things sounded very hazardous and why didnt she come home helen who would have leapt at the chance all through the winter wrote back saying she was fine and that she had a new beau rupert sat with his feet up on the balcony of his hotel bedroom overlooking the bois de boulogne after a class at the paris show that ended at midnight the previous night he was eating a late breakfast wearing nothing but a bath towel his bare shoulders already turning dark brown he was eating a croissant with apricot jam and trying to read war and peace i cant understand this bloody book he yelled back into the room all the characters have three names so do you said billy coming out onto the balcony dripping from the bath and also wrapped in a towel he looked at the spine of the book it might help if you started with volume one not volume two fucking hell said rupert throwing the book into the bosky depths of the bois and endangering the lives of two squirrels thats what comes of asking marion to get out books from the library why are you reading that junk anyway rupert poured himself another cup of coffee helen says im a philistine she thinks youre jewish said billy you dont look it i thought it meant something to do with sodom and gomorrah until i looked it up said rupert but it just means youre pig ignorant deficient in culture and dont read enough you read horse and hound said billy indignantly and your horoscope and the racing results and dick francis or go to the theater as she calls it i should think not after that rubbish she dragged us to the other night anyway you went to a strip club in hamburg last week ive heard people call you a lot of things but not stupid he bent down to pick up his hairbrush which had dropped on the floor and winced i dont know what they put in those drinks last night but i feel like hell i feel like helen said rupert i spent all last night trying to ring her up i got hold of the london directory but i couldnt find vagina house anywhere probably looked it up under cunt said billy rupert laughed then a look of determination came over his face ill show her ill write her a really intellectual letter he got helens last letter all ten pages of it out of his wallet i can hardly understand hers its so full of long words he smoothed out the first page she hopes we take in the comédie française and the louvre and then says that just looking at me elevates her temperature christ what have i landed myself with dont forget to put ms on the envelope said billy marion even got me a book of quotations said rupert extracting a couple of sheets of hotel writing paper from the leather folder in the chest of drawers now ought i to address her as dear or dearest you darling her all the time when youre with her dont want to compromise myself on paper rupert picked up the quote book ill bloody outquote her lets look up helen he ran his fingers down the index helen here we are i wish i knew where helen lies not with me unfortunately sweet helen make me immortal with a kiss thats not going nearly far enough are you going to buy con oharas chestnut asked billy who was trying to cut the nails on his right hand not for the price hes asking its got a terrible stop helen thy beauty is to me that sounds more promising he flipped over the pages to find the reference helen thy beauty is to mehyacinth hair hyacinths are pink and blue not haircolored christ these poets get away with murder why dont you just say youre missing her asked billy reasonably thats what she wants to hear if i could only bed her i could forget about her sensible girl said billy knows if she gives in shell lose you hardly blame her you havent exactly got a reputation for fidelity i have said rupert outraged i was faithful to bianca for at least two months while having marion on the side grooms dont count they simply exist for the recreation of the rider helens not even my type if you analyze her feature by feature her clothes are terrible like all american women she always wears trousers or pants as she so delightfully calls them two sizes too big methinks the laddy does protest too much why dont you pack her in im buggered if ill give up so easily ive never not got anyone i really wanted what about that nun in rome said billy who was lighting a cigarette nuns dont count like grooms i suppose sweet helen make me immortal with a kiss read rupert her lips suck forth my soul come helen come give me my soul again thats a bit strong said billy who wrote that chap called marlowe anyway its not my soul i want her to suck billy started to laugh and choked on his cigarette rupert looked at him beadily honestly william i dont know why you dont empty the entire packet of cigarettes onto a plate and eat them with a knife and fork you ought to cut down he returned to the quote book this bits better thou art fairer than the evening air clad in the beauty of a thousand stars thats very pretty reminds me of penscombe on a clear night he wrote it down in his flamboyant royal blue scrawl practically taking up half the page thatll wow her anyway i should be able to pull her in lucerne shes coming out for a whole week dyou know what i think said billy not until you tell me unlike most of the girls youve run around with helens serious shes absolutely crazy about you genuinely in love and she wont sleep with you not because she wants to trap you but because she believes its wrong shes a middleclass american girl and theyre very very respectable you reckon shes crazy about me i reckon christ rupe youre actually blushing rupert soon recovered what are we going to do this evening he asked go to bed early and no booze according to malise weve got a nations cup tomorrow sod that said rupert putting his letter into an envelope theres a stunning girl whos come out from the tatler to cover the er social side of show jumping i would not mind covering her i thought we could show her paris sure sighed billy and shes brought a dog of a female photographer with her and guess wholl end up with her i wish to christ malise would pick lavinia for lucerne not while hes imposing all this kraut discipline and trying to keep his squad pure he wont said rupert he looked at his watch weve got three hours im going to give the bull a workout tracey can do that lets go and spend an hour at the louvre after a couple of good classes in which they were both placed rupert and billy felt like celebrating pretending to go to bed dutifully at eleven oclock they waited half an hour then crept out down the back stairs aided by a chambermaid it was unfortunate that malise getting up very early to explore paris caught rupert coming out of the tatler girls bedroom in the nations cup later in the day rupert jumped appallingly and had over twenty faults in each round in the evening malise called him to his room and gave him the worst dressingdown of his life rupert was irresponsible insubordinate undisciplined a disruptive influence on the team and a disgrace to his country and whats more thundered malise im not having you back in the team until youve learnt to behave yourself helen sat in the london library checking the quotations in a manuscript on disraeli before sending it to press goodness authors are inaccurate this one got everything wrong changing words leaving out huge chunks paraphrasing long paragraphs to suit his argument all the same she was glad to be out of the office nigel having recently discovered she was going out with rupert made her life a misery saying awful things about him all the time in the middle of a heatwave the london library was one of the coolest places in the west end helen was always inspired too by the air of cloistered quiet and erudition those rows and rows of wonderful books and the photographs of famous writers on the stairs t s eliot harold nicolson rudyard kipling one day if she persevered with her novel she might join them being a great writer however didnt seem nearly as important at the moment as seeing rupert again she hadnt heard from him for a fortnight not a telephone call nor a letter next monday she was supposed to be flying out to lucerne to spend a week with him and it was already wednesday shed asked for the week off and she knew how nigel would sneer if she suddenly announced she wouldnt be going after all and if he did ring and she did go wasnt she compromising herself would she be able to hold him off in all that heady swiss air god life was difficult a bluebottle was bashing abortively against the windowpane at a nearby desk a horrible old man sweating in a check wool suit with eyebrows as big as mustaches was leering at her suddenly she hated academics beastly goaty things with inflated ideas of their own sex appeal like nigel and paul and even harold mountjoy she wanted to get out and live her life she was trapped like that bluebottle have you any books on copulation said a voice im afraid i dont work here said helen then she started violently for there tanned and gloriously unacademic stood rupert her next thought was how unfair it was that he should have caught her with twodayold hair a shiny face and no makeup the next moment she was in his arms angel he said kissing her did you get my letter no i left before the post this morning sssh said the man with mustache eyebrows disapprovingly people are trying to work are you coming out for a drink said rupert only slightly lowering his voice id just love it ive got one more quote to check ill be with you in ten minutes ill wander round said rupert helen found the quotation and was surreptitiously combing her hair and powdering her nose behind a pillar when she heard a loud and unmistakable voice saying hello is that ladbrokes my account numbers ky i want a tenner each way on brass monkey in the two oclock at kempton and twenty each way on bob martin in the twothirty hes been scratched has he change it to sam the spy then but only a tenner each way crimson with embarrassment helen longed to disappear into one of the card index drawers how dare rupert disturb such a hallowed seat of learning funny places you work in he said as they went out into the sunshine i bet nige feels at home in there come on lets go to the ritz they sat in the downstairs bar helen drinking bucks fizz rupert drinking whisky dont go and get tarted up he said as she was about to rush off to the powder room i like you without makeup sometimes reminds me of what you might look like in the mornings he ran the back of his fingers down her cheek ive missed you and ive missed you how was paris not brilliant i read the papers belgravia was off form something like that i bought you a present theyre all the rage in paris it was an ivory silk shirt that tied under the bust leaving a bare midriff oh its just gorgeous said helen ill just never take it off hm well see about that such beautiful workmanship said helen examining it in ecstasy itll be marvelous for lucerne ive bought so many clothes i do hope the weathers nice ruperts fingers drummed on the bar he beckoned for the barman to fill up his glass there isnt going to be any lucerne why ever not helen was quite unable to hide her disappointment ive been dropped said rupert bleakly for a couple of bad rounds in a nations cup thats insane it wasnt your fault well it was actually malise told us to go to bed early i never sleep before a nations cup so i took billy out on the tiles we got more smashed than we meant to next day every double was a quadruple oh rupert wailed helen how could you when you were jumping for great britain surely you could have gone to bed early one night and to involve billy malise must have been so disappointed rupert had expected sympathy not reproach bordering on disapproval poor malise whos he going to put in your place i dont know and i dont want to talk about it helen could see he was mad but could not stop herself saying im just so disappointed i so wanted to go to lucerne well go some other time look im off to the royal plymouth tomorrow morning its an agricultural and flower show with only a couple of big showjumping classes a day so i shant be overoccupied why dont you take the rest of the week off and come too helen was sorely tempted when were you thinking of leaving now i want to avoid the rush hour and ive got a lot to catch up on tonight after three weeks away i cant why not ive got an editorial meeting at three oclock and ive got to get this manuscript off to the press by friday i was planning to have everything clear before lucerne and ive screwed up your little jaunt well im sorry he certainly didnt sound it helen warmed to her subject and i do have some sort of responsibility towards my colleagues unlike you to go and get drunk before a nations cup is just infantile and malise said you could be the finest rider in britain if you took it a bit more seriously did he indeed said rupert dangerously quiet draining his glass and getting a tenner out of his notecase he handed it to the barman well its no bloody business of yours or his to discuss me he got to his feet helen realized shed gone too far malise and i only want whats best for you she stammered sweet of you both said rupert have a nice meeting its high time you took up with nige again you two really suit each other and he was gone rupert returned to penscombe at eight oclock the following morning just as marion and tracey were loading up the lorry for the fourhour drive down to plymouth he looked terrible and proceeded to complain bitterly about everything in the yard then went inside to have a bath and emerged twenty minutes later looking very pale but quite under control whats up with him said tracey had a tiff with the flamehaired virgin i should think said marion her suspicions were confirmed when rupert started to quibble about the order in which the horses were being loaded who are you putting next to the bull macaulay i thought it would settle him dont call him that im not having him named after that bitch anymore he can go back to being satan suits him much better with billy driving rupert slept most of the way down to plymouth the showground was half a mile outside the town it was a glorious day dazzling white little clouds scampered as gaily across a butcher blue sky as boats with colored sails danced on the sparkling aquamarine ocean the horses clattering down the ramp sniffed the salty air appreciatively once in the caravan which marion had driven down rupert poured himself a large measure of whisky tears before sunset said marion to tracey on their way to the secretarys tent to declare billy was telling rupert about ivor braines latest ineptitude he was popping out to the shops and i asked him to get me a packet of rothmans i said if you cant get rothmans get me anything and he comes back with a bloody pork pie billy suddenly realized he had lost his audience glancing round he noticed that very still watchful predatory expression on ruperts face like a leopard whos just sighted a plump impala following ruperts gaze he saw a suntanned blonde in a pale pink sleeveless dress probably in her midthirties she was laying out green baize on a table gorgeous murmured rupert married said billy good said rupert im fed up with bornagain virgins the blonde looked up she was really very pretty billy decided rupert smiled at her she smiled back halfpuzzled assuming because his face was so familiar that theyd met before on the way back from declaring they found her lugging a huge challenge cup out from the car other cups were already lined up on the table let me said rupert sprinting forward and seizing the cup oh she jumped how very kind oh its you suddenly as she realized who rupert was she blushed crimson i expect youll win it later hope so said rupert setting it on the green baize then he looked at the inscription this ones actually for lightweight hunters im certainly a hunter he shot her an appraising glance when the preys attractive enough but not that lightweight she seemed to think this was very funny it was nice to have someone who laughed at his jokes shouldnt your husband be helping you unload this stuff he handed her another cup hes away in madrid some trouble over an order he had to fly out this morning better and better thought rupert running his eye over the outline of her round tight buttocks as she peered into the back of the car blast she said i picked a big bunch of sweetpeas for the table i must have left them in the porch they might have slipped under the front seat said rupert affording himself another good view no she emerged flushed and ruffled oh dear and i was going to tie them up with ribbon as a bouquet for the mayoress ill drive back and pick them up for you you cant its awfully sweet of you but its twenty miles rupert patted her arm leave it with me ill find you a bouquet he went back to the caravan and had another couple of stiff whiskies and then went on the prowl he peered into the horticultural tent it was dark and cool and smelled like a greenhouse the huge flower arrangements making a rainbow blaze of color up at the far end he could see a group of judges poring over some marrows handling them like vast indian clubs it didnt take him long to find what he was looking for a deeply scented bunch of huge dark crimson roses with a red firstprize card and a championship card beside them without anyone noticing he seized the roses and slid out of the tent no one was about except a large woman in a porkpie hat giving her two rotweillers a run back at the caravan he put the roses in a pint mug where did you get those demanded billy who was pulling on his breeches never you mind inconstant spry said billy as rupert arranged them then poured himself another whisky you better lay off that stuff warned billy and dont get carried away weve got a class in threequarters of an hour here you are rupert said to the pretty blonde oh theyre lovely she said ena harkness i think and they smell out of this world you didnt go and buy them rupert smirked noncommittally you did and youve even beaten the stems so they wont wilt ive got some ribbon in the glove compartment ill hide them in the shade for the moment i must repay you come and have a drink after youve finished your class my names laura bridges by the way rumor raced round the collecting ring as the riders warmed up their horses i hear ruperts been dropped driffield said to billy with some satisfaction is it twue malise caught him in bed with a weporter from the tatler giggled lavinia he is awful for christs sake dont say anything to rupe said billy hes not in the sunniest of moods what about that gorgeous redhead said humpty i wouldnt mind having a crack at her myself nor would i said driffield but i gather she doesnt put out shut up said billy here he comes as rupert cantered up on macaulay scattering onlookers humpty said that horse is new where dyou get him sneered driffield at a pig fair everyone laughed but the smiles were wiped off their faces halfway through the class when rupert came in and jumped clear he had reached that pitch of drunkenness when he rode brilliantly total lack of inhibition giving an edge to his timing he also made the discovery that macaulay loved crowds used to the adulation of being a troop horse through the streets of london he really caught fire and become a different animal once he got into the ring and heard applause if youre going to be that good perhaps its unfair to call you satan again rupert said as he rode out patting the horse delightedly over the crowd he could see that the mayoress had arrived and surrounded by officials was progressing towards laura bridgess green baize table no doubt to receive her bouquet vaulting off macaulay he handed him to marion and ran off to have a look mr harold maynard horticultural king of plymouth had won the rose championship at the royal show for the past five years going into the tent confident he had swept the board for the sixth year he was thunderstruck to find his prize exhibit missing he was about to report the loss to the show secretary and get it paged over the loudspeaker when he suddenly saw his lovingly tended ena harkness roses now done up with a scarlet bow being handed over to the mayoress by a curtseying brownie what very choice blooms said the mayoress who prided herself on being good with kiddies ive never seen roses so lovely with a bellow of rage mr maynard pushed through the crowd and seized the roses how dare you steal my ena harkness he shouted the mayoress swelled theyve just been presented to me by this young lady and where did you get them from mr maynard turned furiously to the quailing brownie mrs bridges gave them to me she whispered and who may she be roared mr maynard brandishing the roses like a policemans truncheon im me said laura bridges and dont shout at that poor child rupert arrived to find laura bridges harold maynard a number of harolds horticultural chums from the allotments several show officials and the lady mayoress in the middle of a fulldress row the brownie was bawling her head off whats up he said this ladys stolen my ena harkness bellowed mr maynard glaring furiously at laura bridges next minute rupert had grabbed him by his coat collar dont you speak to her like that you revolting little shit she did not steal them and you bloody well apologize those are my roses and dont use foul language im calling the police yelled mr maynard you are bloody not said rupert and picking mr maynard up he hurled him backwards into the nearby horticultural and produce tent a second later four of mr maynards chums from the allotments had landed on rupert shaking them off he dove into the tent after mr maynard picking up a lemon meringue pie and smashing it in his red roaring face turning rupert started pelting mr maynards cronies who were trying to storm the tent in pursuit with iced cakes next minute a bakewell tart flew over their heads and hit the mayoress slap in the face just as the allotment contingent were advancing on rupert menacingly brandishing huge marrows reinforcements arrived in the form of billy humpty ivor braine and driffield who picking up everything they could find hurled them at mr maynards chums carrots turnips cabbages rhubarb pies and fairy cakes flew through the air what the hells going on humpty asked billy weve got to jump off in a few minutes the next minute a vast black forest gateau hurled by mr maynard and meant for rupert hit humpty in the middle of his forehead roaring like a little bull rubbing cream out of his eyes humpty jumped on mr maynard hammering him with his fists driffield behind the safety of a long white table was lobbing sponge cakes into the mêlée stopping to take a bite from time to time three of the allotment chums had billy on the ground now and were belaboring him with parsnips stop it you wotten cowards screamed lavinia greenslade thwee against one isnt fair and having kicked them all in the bum she picked up a chair and bashed it over their heads suddenly there was the wail of police cars we better beat it said humpty reluctantly come on said driffield stuffing pieces of shortcake into his pockets and running towards the tent opening but they were too late for the next minute the tent had filled with policemen slowly show jumpers and horticulturalists picked themselves off the floor now who started this fight said the sergeant getting out a notebook morning mr lloydfoxe morning mr hamilton for a minute no one said anything then from the corner pulling himself up by the trestle table rupert staggered to his feet i did officer he said weaving towards them but he provoked me and picking up the last prizewinning fruit cake he flung it at mr maynard unfortunately it missed knocking off a policemans helmet book him said the sergeant you cant said humpty in tones of outrage wiping chocolate icing out of his hair hes got to jumpoff a noisy argument ensued only ended by the police threatening to book all the show jumpers you cant do that said the show secretary in horror the public have come specially to see them theyve got two more big classes after the jumpoff well im booking him said the sergeant slapping handcuffs on rupert never heard such abusive language in my life on the way out laura bridges stopped him im so sorry it was all my fault rupert grinned dont give it a thought sweetheart ill get you out of there promised billy not now said humpty bail him out after the classes in the early evening billy and laura bridges whod pulled every string in the book arrived at the police station the police agreed to let rupert go as long as he appeared in court first thing tomorrow they found him sobering up in the cells and playing poker with a couple of constables who happened to be showjumping fans the story had made the late editions of the evening papers and the showground and the front of the station were swarming with press rupert was smuggled out of the back door despite the heat he was shivering like a rainsoaked puppy he looked terrible better come home with me said laura keep the press out of your hair and at least give you a decent nights sleep billy who wanted to see lavinia went back to the showground in the car rupert lay back and shut his eyes how dyou feel bit of a headache dont know if its hangover or flying marrows presumably you did take those roses from the tent yes she patted his knee it was very sweet of you can i go and have a bath he said when he got to her house just to wash the rainbow cake out of my hair downstairs changed into a sweater and jeans brought by billy he found her in the kitchen she had changed too into a long pale blue cotton dress with a halter neck which showed off her beautiful brown shoulders when did you last have something to eat she asked i dont remember she gave him a glass of ice cold milk do you good and got a large piece of steak out of the larder you can put this on your eye if you like or i can grill it for you rupert decided he was very hungry two newspapers rang for you while you were in the bath she said as she switched on the grill i said youd gone to stay with friends in exeter rupert went up to her dropping a kiss on the bare shoulder what a very very nice lady you are they ate outside in the dusk hardly talking but allowing the silence to be companionable afterwards rupert wandered into the drawing room and examined the photograph of the man on the desk your husband she nodded my charlie goodlooking bloke you happy with him very she also had three children the last had just gone to prep school i love them but youve no idea the bliss after thirteen years of marriage of having the house to ourselves she was swinging gently on the hammock seat every time she came forward her blond hair gleamed in the light from the window rupert longed to sit down beside her but thought the swaying back and forth might make him sick ever get bored with each other sexually she shook her head reaching down he took her hands pulling her to her feet she felt so honey soft and nicely fleshed his hand crept round to the back of her neck where the halter was knotted im not sure you should she said after that fight you cant be feeling very well i know the one thing thatd make me better slowly he unknotted the halter allowing her dress to slither to the ground underneath she was quite naked on her warm golden breasts there were delicate blue lines she had full thighs and round curving hips in a few years her body would collapse like a peony now it was superb and knowing it she gazed back at him without embarrassment rupert pulled her towards him i want to give you the best time in the world he murmured tell me what turns you on at three oclock in the morning the telephone rang laura stretched out an arm charlie darling where are you she asked with simulated sleepiness oh thats lovely you can get a flight to plymouth ill come and meet you what an hour you must be exhausted yes ive been fine the show was a great success love you darling all news when i see you bye where is he asked rupert madrid hell be back in three hours hes got his own plane rupert laughed good thing he didnt parachute in unexpectedly ill drive you back to the showground on the way rupert snuggled up against her splendid breasts come on we dont want to waste any time it was another beautiful day an innocent cerulean sky hung over the deep green fountain of the oak trees as they left the house dawn was just breaking rupert breathed in a smell of dust roses and approaching rain laura he said as they reached the outskirts of plymouth i was at a pretty low ebb when i met you yesterday youve been very good to me feel i ought to write charlie a thankyou letter have you got a steady girlfriend she asked apart from the multitudes i mean weve just packed it in why shes too seriousminded and she wont sleep with me laura braked at the lights must be crazy youre the eighth wonder of the world i am when im with you he put his hand between her legs pressing gently that must have been one of the most glorious fucks ive ever had if i wasnt absolutely knackered id drag you back to the caravan for another go dyou ever get away to london or gloucestershire he asked as she drew up at the showground sometimes usually with charlie therell be next years show charliell probably be here next time he took her face in his hands and kissed her well get together again sometime i wont forget you in a hurry laura watched him walking across the dewladen grass with that lovely athletes lope red coat slung over his shoulder as he turned and waved she thought it was a very good thing charlie was coming back the boy was quite irresistible underneath the macho exterior he was very vulnerable i could straighten him out she thought wistfully rupert headed for the stables he couldnt ever remember having been so tired in his life due in court at nine he must get a couple of hours sleep beforehand he hoped the press werent going to make too much of a meal of it he might even get suspended for a year malise would be charmed no one was about yet belgravia and mayfair were lying down macaulay however who missed life at the barracks welcomed any interruption and stuck his head out nudging rupert for polos from what i can remember rupert told him you jumped bloody well yesterday over the next few months you and i are going to raise two hooves to malise gordon until he cant afford not to have us back in the team wed better think up a new name for you perhaps we ought to call you bridges but as he walked wearily towards the caravan remembering the day he had bought macaulay he felt kneed in the groin with longing for helen it must be tiredness that made it hurt so much his resistance was weakened bloody hell there was a light on in the caravan billy must have gone to bed drunk he found the key behind the left front wheel where it was always left he let himself in cautiously billy might be shacked up with lavinia for a minute he thought he was hallucinating for there lying in the double bed apparently naked dark blue duvet over her breasts lay helen there were huge circles under her eyes and shed obviously been crying she looked waiflike and terrified not a muscle flickered in ruperts face for a few seconds he gazed at her how did you get in here he said coldly then as the tears began to roll down her cheeks he crossed the caravan taking her in his arms after lauras opulent curves she felt as frail as a child sweetheart its all right im so desperately sorry she sobbed i know you ggot drunk and into that dreadful fight because i was real mean to you the day before yesterday you werent i was too you were down because youd been dropped and all i did was come on sanctimonious and blame you i should have been supportive and kind youre right i am a prude i dont love harold at all i love you and and its stupid to pretend i dont she was crying really hard now rupert got out his handkerchief then not able to remember whether hed used it to clean up laura bridges shoved it hastily away and grabbed a handful of kleenex from the box on the side you can make love with me whenever you want to she said only if you want to he said gently i do her lip trembled more than anything else in the world im just so scared of losing you rupert tightened his grip on her youre not going to i want you so much now she pleaded christ rupert said to himself i come home smelling like an old dog fox and im so pooped i cant do a thing he took her hands i respect you far too much to force you he said gravely you dont have to be kind i really want it it wouldnt be right then he had a brainwave why dont we get married married she whispered incredulously why not its different are you sure youre not still drunk not at all i havent had a drop since yesterday lunchtime he pulled off his boots then collapsed into bed beside her then removing his signet ring he slid it onto her wedding ring finger thatll have to do til i get you an engagement ring she gazed at it speechless turning it over and over you really mean it really he lay back and laughed i was so mad at you yesterday morning i even changed macaulays name now youll be changing yours perhaps id better call him campbellblack christ youre beautiful i can fall asleep for the rest of my life counting freckles next minute he was fast asleep he was woken by helen an hour before the court case my god he said startled then seeing his signet ring on her finger he gradually brought the last few days events into focus rupert she said frantically twisting the ring around and around when you came in this morning you asked me to marry you but honestly ill understand if youve decided against it darling as he pulled her into his arms he could smell toothpaste and cleanscented flesh she must have been up for hours of course i meant it theres only one obstacle whats that she said going pale i dont remember you accepting helen flung her arms round his neck kissing him fiercely oh yes please i promise ill be supportive ill learn about horses and be a real help in your career rupert looked alarmed you dont have to go that far i must go and have a pee when he came back her arms closed round him like a vise he pushed her away wait i want to look at you first she was so so shy hanging her head as he admired the slender arms the tapering waist the jutting hip bones very gently he stroked the little snow white breasts theyre beautiful he murmured too small she muttered i wish i had a wonderful fortyinch bust the kind like pillows you could fall asleep on nanny always claimed it was much better for ones back to sleep without pillows said rupert then realizing it was not the time for jokes he kissed each chestnut nipple waiting for them to stiffen under his tongue with a colossal feeling of triumph he pushed her back onto the bed and began to move downwards kissing her ribs then her belly no she gasped grabbing his head firmly he removed her hands shut up youre mine now to do exactly what i like with feeling her quivering frantically with desire he progressed down to the ginger bush then suddenly he encountered a sticky lacquered mass like a hedgehog what the bloody hell he yelled are you trying to poison me its only vaginal deodorant stammered helen it is bloody not sweetheart youve used hair lacquer by mistake picking her up screaming he carried her into the shower and held her under until he washed it off then threw her dripping onto the bed now lets get one thing straight i like the taste of you and i dont want it diluted by any damned deodorants im going to wipe out that new england puritanism if it kills me in court he got off with a hefty fine his lawyer used to ruperts scrapes had traveled down overnight mr campbellblack he said had had a row with his girlfriend the day before which had upset him so much hed proceeded to get drunk now the row was made up and he and his girlfriend were planning to get married his client was very sorry it wouldnt happen again the press were so captivated by the news that they concentrated on the engagement rather than on the fight later between classes rupert bumped into laura who introduced her husband charlie conversation was very amicable as charlie moved on to talk to some friends laura said in a low voice im so glad youre getting married to her rupert grinned will you sleep with me again as a wedding present laura looked reproving your new wife wouldnt like that very much ah said rupert lightly shell have to take me as she finds me if she can find me nearly two years later helen stood in the middle of her bedroom at penscombe tearing her hair and trying to decide what she should pack for rome and then madrid she and rupert would be away for nearly three weeks so she would need at least three cases to carry all the different clothes for sightseeing swimming sunbathing watching rupert in the ring and for the string of parties and dinners which always coincided with international shows abroad she had started a hundred lists then scrumpled them up but even clothes littering every available surface couldnt detract from the beauty of the room with its high ceilings huge jacobean fourposter old rose walls pale yellow and pink silk striped curtains and fluffy amber carpet on the dressing table and beside the bed were great bunches of yellow irises the general effect of a sunrise provided the perfect foil for helens coloring or so the woman from house and garden had said last week when she came down to photograph the house and the dramatic changes helen had made to it on the primrose yellow silk chaise longue lay a copy of this months vogue with a photographic feature on the new beauties most beautiful of them all was undoubtedly mrs rupert campbellblack showing helen hugeeyed swannecked her titian hair spread by a wind machine ruperts diamonds gleaming at her ears and throat also on the chaise longue were guidebooks for rome and madrid and italian and spanish phrase books helen took her trips abroad very seriously sightseeing and trying to learn as much of the language as possible beside the books lay helens journal it was the same dark green notebook shed had in regina house she was ashamed that since shed married rupert shed filled in less than a half of it only sketchily recording events in what had certainly been the most exciting years of her life but shed been so busy living she didnt seem to have had much time to write about it she remembered the day rupert had asked her to marry him in the afternoon shed been sitting in the stands with doreen humpty hamiltons even fatter bouncier wife mother of two children watching rupert and humpty jump in a class helen delirious with happiness couldnt resist telling doreen she was engaged doreen hamilton was delighted at the news and promptly bore helen off to the bar for a celebration drink then offered her a word of advice if you marry a show jumper she said involve yourself in his career as much as possible and travel with him as much as you can even if it means sleeping in lorries or caravans or frightful pokey foreign hotels and if he suddenly rings up when youre at home and says come out to rome or drive down to windsor or to crittleden always go at once even if youve just washed your hair and put it in curlers or youve just got the baby to sleep because if you dont therell always be others queuing up to take your place helen cocooned in the miracle of her new and reciprocated love for rupert was unable to imagine him loving anyone else or any girl queuing up for fat little humpty but she had heeded the advice and gone with rupert to as many shows as possible not that this involved much hardship his caravan was extremely luxurious and when they went abroad rupert insisted on staying in decent hotels or with rich jetset friends who seemed to surface crying welcome in every country they visited but it meant she always had to look her best going to the window with its rampaging frame of scented palest pink clematis she gazed out across the valley emerald green from weeks of heavy rain remembering the first time shed seen the house rupert and billy having both won big classes on the final day of the royal plymouth decided to stay on for the closing party that night after intensive revelry rupert suddenly turned to helen and said i think its time you had a look at my bachelor pad and they loaded up the horse box and set out for gloucestershire rupert driving helen sitting warm between the two men an exquisite sliver of smoked salmon between two very old stale pieces of bread said billy helen went to sleep and woke up as they drove up the valley towards penscombe the sun had just risen firing a denim blue sky with ripples of crimson and reddening the ramparts of cow parsley on either side of the road suddenly the horses started pawing the floorboards in the back and mavis and badger who were sprawled across billys and helens knees in the front woke up and started sniffing excitedly ouch said billy as badger stepped heavily across him get off my crotch why the hell dont you get his claws cut rupe helen looked across the valley at the honey gold house leaning back against its pale green pillow of beech trees what a beautiful mansion she gasped i wonder who lives there you do said rupert thats your new home and he and billy laughed to see how speechless she was i cant believe it she whispered its so old and so beautiful its a stately home you may not find it quite so splendid when you get close to said rupert slowing down as they entered the village he took the lorry straight round to the stables where marion and tracey whod driven home the night before with the caravan were waiting to unload the horses leaving billy to check everything was all right rupert whipped into the house collected a bottle of champagne and two glasses and took helen out on the terrace below them lay the valley drenched white with dew softened by the palest gray mist rising from the stream that ran along the bottom on the opposite hillside the sun was filtering thick biblical rays through the trees which in turn cast long powder blue shadows down the fields and sauntering leisurely down one of these rays like horses of the dawn came three of ruperts sleek and beautiful thoroughbreds two grays and a chestnut tossing their heads they broke into a gallop and careered joyously down the white valley vanishing into the mist like a dream leaning on the stone balustrade on the edge of the terrace helen gazed and gazed behind her the wood was filled with bluebells thrushes were singing out of a clump of white lilacs to the left badger after the long journey wandered around lifting his leg on bright yellow irises before happily plunging into the lake its the most beautiful place ive ever seen she breathed youre not a closet earl or anything are you i feel like king cophetua and the beggar maid king who asked rupert hitching a hip onto the lichened balustrade and edging open the champagne with his thumbs the cork flew through the air landing in a rosebush is it all yours as far as that village on the right he filled a glass and handed it to her anyway its yours too now darling every inch of it looking up she saw he was smiling even an eighth of an inch of blond stubble and a slight puffiness round the wickedly sparkling eyes couldnt diminish his beauty just as every single inch of you belongs to me from now on he added softly then she realized it was not king cophetua he reminded her of but the devil tempting christ in the wilderness saying all this will i give you just for a second she had a premonition of unease then rupert chinked his glass against hers and draining it said lets go to bed we cant stammered helen what will everyone think that weve gone to bed said rupert upstairs he pulled the telephone out but didnt bother to lock the door well at least im going to draw the curtains said helen i wouldnt said rupert but the next minute shed given the dark red velvet a vigorous tug and the whole thing descended curtain rail and all on her head in a huge cloud of dust in fits of laughter rupert extracted her i told you not to pull it then seeing her hair covered in dust my god youve gone white overnight must be the effect of saying youll marry me he pulled her into the shade of the great ancient fourposter and began unbuttoning her shirt next minute she leapt out of her skin as the door opened but it was only badger dripping from the lake trying to join them in bed basket snapped rupert and you might bloody well shut the door he added kicking it shut after rupert had come with that splendid driving flourish of staccato thrusts which reminded helen of the end of a beethoven symphony he fell into a deep sleep helen lying in his arms had been far too tense and nervous of interruption to gain any satisfaction looking around the room she took in the mothy fox masks leering down from the walls the munnings and the lionel edwards and surely that was a stubbs in the corner very much in need of a clean all the furniture in the room was old and handsome but it too was desperately in need of a polish and all the chairs and the sofa needed reupholstering there were angora rabbits of dust on top of every picture and sailors could have climbed up the rigging of cobwebs in the corners judging by the color of the bed linen it hadnt seen a washing machine for weeks helen began to itch and edged out of ruperts embrace she was touched to see a copy of war and peace by the bedside table at least he was trying to educate himself writing i love you in the dust she wandered off to find a bathroom she found the john first and was less touched to find a framed photograph on the wall of rupert on a horse being presented with a cup by grania pringle along the bottom grania had written so happy to mount you love grania thats one for the jumble sale thought helen taking it off the wall the bathroom made her faint a great white bath standing six inches off the ground on legs shaped like lions paws was ringed with grime like a rugger sweater above it a geyser on the wall spat out dust and then boiling water the ceiling was black with dirt the paint peeling like the surface of the moon on another beautiful chest of drawers which was warping from the damp stood empty bottles mugs and two ashtrays brimming over with cigarette stubs having found a moderately clean towel and spent nearly an hour cleaning the bath she had one herself then set out to explore the house finding bedroom after bedroom filled with wonderful furniture carpets and china with many of the beds recently slept in but not made at the end of the passage she discovered a room which was obviously billys on the chest of drawers was a large photograph in a frame of lavinia greenslade and an even larger one of mavis there were glasses by the bed and drink rings on everything a bridle hung from the fourposter there were sporting prints on the wall and more framed photographs of horses jumping galloping standing still and being presented with rosettes on the chest of drawers was a pile of unopened brown envelopes and more overflowing ashtrays descending the splendid staircase with a fat crimson cord attached to the wall to cling on to she admired a huge painting of badger in the hall underneath it two jack russells were having a fight she found a pair of springer spaniels shut in the drawing room every beautiful faded chair and sofa seemed to be upholstered in dog hair on the wall was a large lighter patch where a painting had been sold the rest of the walls were covered among other things by a romney a gainsborough a lely and a thomas lawrence next door behind the inevitable wire cages was the library no wonder rupert was indifferent to culture it was all around him to be taken for granted for a minute looking at more cobwebs and dust she thought shed strayed into miss havershams house then she trod on something that squelched oh my god she screamed whats the matter asked billy coming through the door holding a pile of entry forms and a checkbook one of those damned dogs has gone to the bathroom in the living room she couldnt understand why billy laughed so much its not funny she said ive never seen such a dump doesnt anyone ever clean it its an arachnophobes nightmare marion and tracey must be the most awful slobs to let it get into such a state suppose it is a bit of a mess said billy apologetically but were not in the house much during the day and one never notices dust at night we had a char she wasnt very good but rupert kept her on because she made him laugh he said she had charisma then he came back and found her in one of the spare room beds drinking gin with the electric blanket on after that even he had to sack her so we havent had anyone for about six weeks doesnt look as though youve had anyone for six years said helen scraping her shoe on the gravel outside come and look at the stables that should cheer you up is rupert asleep helen nodded i know its a mess he said putting his arm through helens and leading her across the lawn passing overgrown shrub roses that hadnt seen a pruner in years and pink scented peonies collapsing on the grass but were so frightfully busy we havent really got time to organize the house thats why rupert desperately needs a wife he went on squeezing her hand not only are you the most adorably beautiful girl weve ever seen but we really need you to look after us thanks said helen so in fact im really marrying two riders four grooms thirty horses a million dogs and a stable cat i feel like milly in seven brides for seven brothers but its such a beautiful house and it could be made so gorgeous and im quite confident youll be able to do it said billy happily the stables were built of the same honeycolored stone as the house the doors painted the same dark blue rupert had chosen on the color chart in church on their first date horses looked out inquisitively eager for any diversion brick red geraniums bloomed in blue and white striped tubs there was not a blade of straw or a speck of dust anywhere in the center was a circle of grass beautifully mown round an ancient mulberry tree it was like a toy stable billy introduced her to the junior grooms susie and janis two more pretty shapely blondes tracey and marion having the afternoon off had collapsed into bed marion helen suspected to cry her eyes out she hadnt addressed a word to rupert since she heard he was getting married billy led her into the tackroom which was beautifully kept the tack was dark and gleaming the bits shining every inch of wall lined with rosettes helen breathed in the smell of leather linseed oil saddle soap but i dont understand she said its as neat as a new pin here why is the house such a mess billy shrugged this is where the action is if i were you id move into macaulays box at least youd get clean straw and regular meals after a good nights sleep helen felt more able to cope next day she went back to regina house and the office despite ruperts outraged protests she felt she ought to get things straight and tidy up nigel when he heard she was going to marry rupert was even more outraged youd think rupert was general franco or oswald mosley she grumbled jolly nearly hissed nigel im ashamed of you helen the next day the ira blew up a shop and then a hamburger bar in london not far from helens office rupert was at a show in the west country but he was on to helen immediately are you all right darling christ ive been worried look im not leaving you in london anymore you must move in at once i cant bear another night away from you but what am i going to do with myself all day you can organize my life can i redecorate your house if it makes you happy as long as you let me burn your entire wardrobe and promise never to buy any more clothes without my coming too i havent got a show next monday he went on i thought we might get married and so they were married at gloucester registry office helen wore a gray silk suit chosen by rupert billy and humpty were witnesses they set off to yorkshire on their honeymoon staying in an old pub in the middle of the moors on the tuesday rupert went to look at a horse which he decided not to buy on thursday he said he was fed up with the pub and knew a better one over the pennines as they were driving there helen suddenly noticed aa signs and advertising posters the great lancashire show starts today she said idly to rupert is billy going yes said rupert leaning across and kissing her and so are we when they reached the show there were billy and tracey looking sheepish and marion looking bootfaced and surprise surprise mayfair and macaulay and ruperts riding clothes helen looked down at the huge unusual ring of sapphires and emeralds which rupert had given her as an engagement ring and remembered what doreen hamilton had said about being a show jumpers wife and laughed instead of cried darling mother she wrote home that evening i got married on monday my husband is called rupert campbellblack he is real handsome and very famous in england because he is a stadium jumping star in england it is called show jumping and a big sport rather like baseball he has the most beautiful stately home near shakespeares birthplace you will just go crazy about it it is so old and the village he lives in looks as though none of the houses have been touched since elizabeth ists day i enclose photographs of the house and of rupert i know you wanted me to get married in florida and in white mother but i promise you i am truly truly happy i never believed being in love could be like this rupert had a very traumatic childhood im surprised he hasnt been in analysis for years but he is very normal his mother lives in the bahamas and is on her third husband and his father is on his fourth wife i havent met them yet but soon im going to meet ruperts old nanny who is really the person who brought him up and gave him security he thinks the world of her im going to make him happy i love him so much i long to have you meet him but the summer is ruperts busy time at the moment he is at shows all the week and at weekends but i promise the first weekend we get free well fly out and see you all love helen ruperts meeting with helens parents didnt take place until august and was not a success the plan was that helen should fly direct to florida and rupert having looked at some horses in kentucky should join her a couple of days later as it was in the middle of the showjumping season helen explained he would be able to stay only for the weekend before flying back to europe for the dublin horse show where having been forgiven at last by malise he had been picked to jump for great britain but at least it would give her parents the chance to meet him arriving home helen was appalled to find her mother had arranged a fullscale wedding party with three hundred guests to meet helens handsome english husband with even a minister coming to the house to perform a service beforehand in which the happy couple would be blessed i just dont feel youre married after a registry office ceremony said her mother rupertll absolutely freak out protested helen he hasnt brought a cutaway or even a dinner jacket he can always hire one or borrow one from father said her mother with a growing feeling of apprehension helen watched the preparations in fact her mother was so well organized that on friday afternoon she and her four daughters were able to slip down to the beach below their house for a couple of hours sun helens three sisters all lithe and beautiful awaited ruperts arrival that evening with intense excitement they were amazed at the change in helen she looked so beautiful and happy and so much more selfassured look at that dreamy yacht said esme the younger sister as a big boat with bright blue sails crowded with bronzed halfnaked people tacked close to the shore the next moment one of them had jumped ship wading through the shallows carrying a case he turned as he reached the sand and brandishing it shouted thanks for the lift are you ready for that said milly the second sister in wonder its rupert gasped helen he was as blond and as brown as a beach boy and he was wearing nothing except a rather small united states flag draped round his loins jesus said claudia the third sister dont swear claudia said mrs macaulay helen hurtled down the beach flung her arms round ruperts neck and only just stopped the american flag tumbling to halfmast darling we were expecting you tonight i got a lift with some chums i missed you on palm beach home of the beautiful he was still the most beautiful of all mother this is rupert said helen mrs macaulay was vain enough not to be very pleased at having to meet her new soninlaw when she was scarlet and sweating from the heat she would have preferred to have parted the wisteria on the terrace welcoming him in a pretty dress hair newly set makeup light but perfect but she knew one must behave like a lady at all times so she radiated graciousness hi rupert she said holding out a hand slippery with suntan oil and trying not to look at the american flag im so pleased to welcome you as our son i hope youll call me mother rupert in fact never managed to call her anything he didnt even kiss her both felt it would have been too sweaty an embrace he looked at her handsome rigid determined face with the graying red hair he took in the wellcontrolled figure in its skirted bathing dress he noticed the gold cross hanging between the crepey breasts and he shuddered and vowed he would never let helen get like that mrs macaulay averted her eyes and noted rupert was not wearing a wedding ring father must find him one before tomorrow im not going to hire a morning coat snapped rupert when at last he and helen were alone in their bedroom nor am i going to be blessed by some yankee poofter we were married in england thats enough for me hush darling theyll hear you and its worth it for all the wedding gifts not if you look at them closely six magazine racks two sets of monogrammed highball glasses twelve egg coddlers a dozen staghorn steak knives jesus two sets of glasses with polo players on polo i ask you oh that was darling greataunt grace doesnt know the difference between show jumping and polo she was doing her best theres a lovely dinner service and some beautiful cachepots and glass the problem is how to get them all home well have to hire a plane and hope it crashes on takeoff helen giggled but she felt defensive about her parents and their friends if only he would behave for the wedding she knew everyone would love him rupert went moodily to the window god i miss badger why dont your parents have a dog i am not going through with this party if i do ill wear a suit all right said helen soothingly but please darling be nice just this once mothers been arranging it for weeks and millys going to sing what is life to me without you mothers been coaching her for weeks and dads even been out and bought himself an ascot and some striped pants all youve got to do is show up and be polite rupert behaved rather well during the service later everyone crowded onto the lawn and after champagne had been drunk for an hour or so the most distinguished male relation rose to praise helen and to welcome rupert to the family afterwards there was a pause speech speech shouted all the relations and friends and the large sprinkling of mr macaulays patients flashing their beautifully capped teeth rupert wearing a dark suit and not wearing the wedding ring his fatherinlaw had pressed on him that morning rose to his feet my heart is in my mouth at this wonderful party he said charmingly but as my nanny always told me not to talk with my mouth full im not going to say anything except to thank mr and mrs macaulay i could tell jokes about gay irish dentists but i dont think my fatherinlaw would like that thank you all for your wonderful presents and with that he quietly slid under the table but you werent even drunk said helen still furious as their plane took off for england i know but i was bored im sorry darling but the only relations i like are sexual relations and youve left aunt marthas paintings behind i know said rupert i was terrified they might frighten the dogs ruperts parents both wrote helen delightfully vague letters ruperts mother sent her a diamond brooch with a broken clasp ruperts father a jar of caviar both promised theyd be over sometime probably when they want to borrow money said rupert and wished them every happiness helens meeting with ruperts old nanny was hardly more successful what shall i wear she asked billy beforehand a skirt with horizontal stripes all nanny cares about is good childbearing hips nannys cottage in wiltshire had been bought and furnished by the campbellblack family they had filled it with pieces from their various houses which were far too large it was an obstacle race to get across the sitting room nanny almost the largest thing in the cottage stood six feet tall with big ears a whiskery seamed face a boxers jaw and shrewd tough little brown eyes like henry vii she was wearing a shiny highnecked navy blue dress with a white collar which gave the impression of a uniform although it was a very hot day she was watching fireworks on a black and white television with the central heating at full blast and none of the windows open perhaps years of campbellblack austerity and indifference to the cold had unhinged her thought helen every surface in the room was covered in photographs of babies in long white dresses the only others were of rupert at every stage of his career as a solemn blueeyed baby at st augustines harrow in the blues and mostly of him show jumping otherwise there was no evidence that she was remotely pleased to see him she hardly thanked him for the halfdozen bottles of her favorite disgustingly sweet sherry that he brought her pouring out three glasses she gave much the smallest to helen isnt helen beautiful said rupert nanny looked helen up and down and sniffed very beautiful face she said shes got a beautiful figure too protested rupert laughing i know youd have only been happy if id married some flanders mare producing sons every eight months nanny snorted and proceeded to tear rupert off a strip for hellraising in paris and getting arrested at plymouth and getting married without a proper wedding rupert accepted it with amazing mildness im sorry we didnt ask you to the wedding we didnt ask anyone i couldnt face all my stepparents muscling in on the act and my mother would have been bored to have been reminded of all her weddings whos your father married to at the moment said nanny some italian whore said rupert i suppose you had to get married asked nanny no we did not whatever happened to bianca and melanie potter she was a bonny girl shes married with two daughters i told you last time nanny knew everything about him and every round hed jumped in the last two years your mother remembered my birthday she said accusingly more than you did and so did your brother adrian i hear hes got a girlfriend are you sure said rupert in amazement i dont think so never knew he was bispectacled said nanny helen didnt dare look at rupert helens american said rupert so i read said nanny never thought youd end up with a foreigner ive read about watergate she added as though helen were personally responsible helen was so hot she took off her jersey revealing her slender brown arms and waist not much of her is there said nanny anorexic i suppose finally when helen thought shed faint from the heat she said i think we ought to go rupert nanny was not at all upset she didnt even come to the door desperate to get out into the fresh air helen made her goodbyes and fled but not before she heard nanny say got money i suppose only reason for marrying a foreigner really isnt she a gem said rupert on the way home shes a machiavellian old monster said helen doesnt mean it shes nearly eighty all the same i cant wait for you to have a baby so we can get her out of mothballs to look after it it was plain in fact as the months went by that rupert and helen were very different rupert was spoilt easily irritated and didnt flinch from showing it his ambition in life was to get his own way and beat the hell out of the opposition he had many moments of frustration and boredom in life but very few of selfdoubt helen on the other hand was riddled with selfdoubt she believed that one should not only constantly strive to improve oneself and others but that work would indeed keep the devil at bay to begin with therefore she made heroic efforts to interest herself in horses and learn to ride but she was too tense and nervous and the horses sensed this and the way she always caught her breath got on ruperts nerves then marion helen never knew if it were deliberate put her up on one of the novices who carted her through a wood with lowhanging branches and finally deposited her on the tarmac of the village street helen bruised herself very badly and after that gave up trying to ride she still took an interest in show jumping however reading every book on the subject scanning the papers for horsey news she even started reading dressage books and discussing her theories with rupert trying to show him where he was going wrong rupert was not amused he did not want gratuitous advice that macaulay might go better in a running martingale or belgravia might profit from learning to execute halfpasses when alls said and done he told her sharply im riding the fucking horse not you so belt up helen during the long long hours that rupert and billy were occupied with the horses turned her attention to the house and soon had the place swarming with builders plumbers electricians and painters youd think they were building the pyramids grumbled rupert but gradually the damp and the dry rot were eradicated and a new heating and wiring system installed pastel colors replaced the crimson and dark green wallpapers and old brocades tattered silks and motheaten tapestries were succeeded by new pale silks glazed chintz and laura ashley flower prints helen also employed a decent cleaner mrs bodkin paid her well and managed to keep her mrs bodkin admired helen she found her formal and distant and not given to gossip but she was kind straight listened to mrs bodkins problems and was prepared to muck in with the cleaning she certainly needed to rupert and billy were appallingly untidy both dropped their clothes where they took them off never brought a cup or glass downstairs and if they couldnt find a boot jack at the front or back door trailed mud all over the hall and the new carpet followed by a convoy of dogs with dirty paws the dogs drove helen increasingly crackers shedding hair barking fighting claiming ruperts attention also the colder the winter got and the last one was a killer you could skate on the water in the john the more the dogs tried to climb into bed with them rupert who fell asleep the moment his head touched the pillow didnt notice or mind badger lying across his feet or a springer spaniel curled up in the warmth of his back helen a nervous insomniac was kept awake night after night shoving the dogs out of bed and listening to them licking themselves or scratching interminably in creaking baskets as the winter got colder and the winds blew off the bristol channel and the central heating was not yet installed poor floridareared helen developed a hacking cough rupert who like most very healthy people lacked sympathy with illness suggested she should get a job coughing between movements on radio three and that was another problem culturally they were so different every time she wanted to listen to classical music rupert turned on radio one every week she determinedly read the times literary supplement encounter and new society she started to read the new statesman but rupert canceled it he was not having subversive trotskyite rubbish corrupting the dogs he said then there was the matter of the augustus john drawing helen having spent a long time deciding what would really please rupert for a wedding present spent her entire savings on a drawing of a horse by augustus john rupert was enchanted i think that was the old roué who had a walkout with my grandmother he was studying the drawing in great detail when the doorbell rang it was a man about the washing machine when helen returned quarter of an hour later rupert had propped the drawing on the sofa and was looking at it with satisfaction thats better what said helen then noticing a pencil and rubber in ruperts hand gave a gasp of horror what have you done redrawn the near side hock chap simply hadnt got it right but you cant tamper with the work of great artists said helen appalled i can when they cant draw said rupert although he insisted on buying her a completely new wardrobe making her look hed told billy like the aristocrat she plainly isnt on the whole he approved of the changes she made to the house but he drew the line at mats under glasses to stop the drink rings and he tore down the net curtains in the firstfloor bedrooms and the downstairs loo and he threw all the artificial flowers she bought to brighten up the dark hall into the boiler their worst row was triggered off however when helen introduced discs into the lavatory cisterns to disinfect the water and dye it blue rupert came roaring into the kitchen one of the blue discs in his hand dripping dye all over the floor what the fuck is this he howled have you gone mad are you trying to poison my dogs they shouldnt drink out of the john screamed helen then they go and lick everyone its disgusting theyve got water bowls in the kitchen and a water trough and a lake in the garden why do they bother with the john because they always have im not having you introducing any more of your dinky little american ideas itll be chiming doorbells and musical lavatory paper next i want the water clear by the time i get home and if any of the dogs get ill ill report you to the rspca and he stormed out slamming the door helen and mrs bodkin removed the blue discs poor helen tried and failed to impose gracious living on billy and rupert she yearned for candlelit dinners with the silver out damask napkins intelligent conversation and lingering over coffee and liqueurs but looking after horses there was no guarantee what time rupert and billy would get in after three attempts at boeuf en croute that turned out tougher than a tramps boots helen found out that all they really wanted was sausages and mash or irish stew on their knees slumped in front of the television usually they argued across the program about the days events or some horse they were thinking of buying rupert bolted his food hardly noticing what he ate she was often tempted to offer him chappie and winalot often they were so tired they fell asleep in the middle of a meal but however much rupert fell asleep over the television he always woke up and wanted sex when they went to bed and again in the morning and often popping in if he wasnt at a show in the middle of the day im happy as long as im mounted he used to say and youre so compulsively ridable my darling if they ever had a row rupert had to make it up because he wanted to sleep with her if she found his demands excessive and she frequently didnt achieve orgasm herself she never said so but after nearly a year she still grabbed a towel when he walked into the bedroom and found her naked she always locked the lavatory door and she only really liked sex if shed just had a bath she was embarrassed by his unashamed delight in her body she still couldnt convince herself that he really enjoyed doing those things he insisted he liked doing long enough to make her come so she often wriggled away pretending she had then felt desperately ashamed of faking but she found him irresistible and she needed his constant assaults as evidence that he still doted on her for there was oodles of competition wherever they were girls ran after rupert clamoring for his autograph mobbing him at parties even pulling hairs out of his horses tails as souvenirs until they were almost bald and although she got kudos wherever she went as ruperts beautiful wife and there was a great feeling of mutual congratulation in being such a handsome couple it was rupert people really wanted to see marion troubled her too she longed for rupert to sack her as he was always threatening to do but was too tactful to say anything but she remembered marions reddened eyes particularly after their wedding she tried to be particularly nice to the girl giving her a beautiful black cashmere jersey for her birthday which marion never wore and was constantly urging rupert to ask her to dinner and suggesting handsome young men to meet her but marion politely refused and kept her distance gazing at helen with the hostile somber eyes of a prisoner of war billy explained to helen that marion was so good with the horses that it was worthwhile putting up with her moods billy was such a comfort hed offered to move out when helen and rupert got married but neither of them could bear to lose him after all he and rupert had been inseparable since they were eight and they were business partners and rupert needed someone to talk horses with as the weeks passed helen decided billy was simply the nicest person shed ever met he was so kind funny easygoing and she flattered herself just a tiny bit in love with her if she had a row with rupert billy stuck up for her if rupert was irritable because the horses were going badly she could dump on billy knowing she wasnt being disloyal because billy understood rupert and loved him at the same time as knowing all his faults it was a very happy arrangement billy obviously wasnt serious about lavinia greenslade and wouldnt get married for years rupert sometimes complained of being gentrified but he and billy soon found it a boon that the house was run like clockwork that their suits and red coats were always back from the cleaners that there were always enough clean white shirts ties and breeches that their boots were mended that the house was ordered and tidy that entry forms were filled in that fan mail was answered and endless requests to speak or open fêtes and supermarkets were politely refused by return of post this left rupert and billy to concentrate on the horses which they certainly needed to do the threeday week brought extra costs petrol prices in particular shot up there were forecasts of economic doom for years to come and with the socialists coming to power there was more chilling talk of a wealth tax which would cripple ruperts income it became increasingly vital to win and win and they did there was no doubt that since rupert married helen he and billy had calmed down and were now both regular fixtures in the british team so now helen on the eve of leaving for rome and madrid gazed out on the green valley she was really looking forward to the trip for the first time she felt she could leave the house without the workmen doing something frightful she loved going abroad picking up antiques and pieces for the house visiting galleries and museums learning new languages also it meant a holiday from all the dogs in the bed and as rupert was far less famous abroad they werent constantly besieged by groupies or rupies as billy called them and malise gordon was there she always enjoyed spending time with him they often went to galleries and museums together when they were away making rupert slightly edgy he was jealous of something that malise and helen shared that he couldnt give her so he continually mocked it helen turned back to all the beautiful clothes rupert had bought her she realized above all that it was important to him that other men admired and fancied her but like meissen china in a glass case the admiration had to be kept at a distance last year in rotterdam when a rather inebriated dutchman asked her to dance in a nightclub it had only been billys half nelson that had stopped rupert knocking him across the room a slightly more persistent admirer at one of the dublin horse show balls had been less lucky and ended up with a fractured jaw jake lovell rode across his fields at a leisurely pace when he came to a hedge or a wall he popped the gray gelding over it but he was in no hurry hed already worked all the novice horses that morning and the grade a horses were having a rest after a threeday show besides it was a beautiful day and the cuckoo was yelling its head off in the hazel wood nearby wolf jakes shaggy adoring lurcher was chasing rabbits but never letting his master out of his sight for very long and jake wanted to think it was nearly five years since he had married tory and granny maxwell had given them the mill house at withrington and although there had been years of hard work and struggle jake knew they had been the happiest in his life the mill had been in a dilapidated state when they moved in but gradually he and tory had painted the rooms and gradually they had scraped together enough money to pull down the old stables and build new ones so they now kept a dozen horses there had been terrible setbacks two mays ago hed been selected to ride for great britain for the first time but the day he was due to leave africa stepped on a rusty nail which put her out of action for several months one of the young novices a really promising gray thoroughbred had jumped out of its field escaped onto the motorway been hit by a lorry and had to be destroyed then as tory had inherited the bulk of her capital by then and africa was out of action jake had spent rather too much money on a topclass horse to fill the gap which had broken its leg and had to be put down at the first show he took it to things had not gone according to plan in other directions either at the start of their marriage tory had worked as a secretary to a local solicitor her salary being the main contribution that had saved her jake and the horses from starvation for months they seemed to live on pork pies and baked beans bought with her luncheon vouchers but within a year and a quarter she was pregnant and in july of the following year she produced a son they called him isa short for isaac after jakes lost gypsy father and jake whod been very apprehensive not particularly liking children and feeling most unready to be a father found himself utterly besotted with the child perhaps it was because little isa was his only blood relation or because the boy was so beautiful with his huge black eyes and white blond hair or because he was so sturdy and merry and placid and seemed positively to thrive in a cold damp house and being permanently carted from show to show in a carrycot jake was also pleasantly surprised to find how easy it was to be married to tory who was the ideal showjumpers wife she never made him feel guilty if he were late back from shows or up all night tending a sick horse when he came in she always provided him with good food a sympathetic ear and sex if he wanted but was never offended if he didnt she understood his terrible nerves before big classes and why often if he were sorting out his relationship with a particular horse he could be withdrawn and taciturn she coped with all the paperwork paying bills and sending off entry forms when they married shed been terrified of horses but jake had helped her to overcome this and although shed never be much good as a rider she soon picked up the rudiments of feeding and looking after a string fussing over each animal as if she was its mother so all the horses were happy and the yard ran like clockwork even when he was away she was also passionately proud of everything he did and nailed up every new rosette with joy so a whole wall of the tackroom was now covered most important of all she understood that his character was like a stray dogs rescued from battersea dogs home constantly moving from one show to another satisfied some nomadic gypsy wanderlust in his blood but he only felt safe doing this knowing he had a safe loving home to come back to like many wanderers only by going away would he test that home would still be there when he returned two years before he had had a special stroke of luck he had gone to a horse sale in warwick not one of his favorite pastimes he tried not to be anthropomorphic about horses but sales always reminded him of the childrens home all those horses bewildered frightened displaced often coming from cosseted homes or after years of hard work to be sold to the knackers yard or to people who didnt know how to look after them or who would abuse their willing natures the mare hed been tipped off about went for more than he could afford but suddenly he heard a horse squealing his head off get me out of this horrible place he seemed to be saying wandering down the horse lines jake found a halfstarved dirty fleabitten gray gelding standing about with a walleye big feet a coarse head huge ears flapping like a mules and ribs sticking out like a plate rack he had to be the ugliest horse jake had ever seen he was obviously starving but jake looked at his teeth and was surprised to see the horse was only six or seven he looked a hundred but his legs were clean and strong and when he was petted and scratched behind the ear he stopped screaming and accepted jakes attention with obvious pleasure whats his history jake asked the dealer who trotted him up and down some old nutter bought him as a pet for his wife who had one foot in the grave anyway they called him sailor one day the horse stopped suddenly in the yard and she fell off catching her head on the mounting block and croaked two days later the old nutter was heartbroken but too mean to have the horse put down so he left him in a tiny yard virtually starving him to death finally the old nutter died when they discovered his body they found the horse the only thing he had to drink out of was a rusty bucket with two inches of rainwater filled with dead wasps as you can see its a case for the rspca but you cant prosecute a dead man for a second jake felt choked with rage poor old sod he said stroking the ugly gray head had a bad time have you he had to pay in order to outbid the horsemeat dealers which he could ill afford at the time once home he stuffed sailor full of food and during the day turned him out with africa after three months he took him hunting and had one of the best days of his life sailor still looked like nothing on earth it was always impossible to get any condition on him but he could jump anything you put him at and keep going all day and jake experienced a surge of excitement he had not felt since he first jumped africa jake had had many arguments with granny maxwell because he refused to overface his horses and did not bring them on fast enough but there was no need to bring sailor on slowly by the end of the next season he had been placed in every class he entered and had lifted himself to grade a the northern show jumping fraternity who were a hardboiled bunch not easily impressed laughed at sailor when they first saw such an extraordinarily unprepossessing horse but stayed to pray once they had seen him jump he was also the cleverest horse in the yard and when he was bored would unbolt his stable door and wander over to the house putting his fleabitten head in through the kitchen window hoping for an apple or a piece of chocolate always milk he wouldnt touch plain but just as happy with a petting he never strayed beyond the yard it was as though he couldnt believe his luck in having found a good home he was also the gentlest horse devoted to africa and wolf the lurcher and torys jack russell horace who could lead him in from the fields tugging at the headcollar rope with his teeth he was also a marvelous babysitter tory found she could leave baby isa in sailors box playing round the manger clinging onto sailors legs and often pulling himself up by the horses rather skimpy tail if he fell over and cried sailor would nudge him gently breathing on him until he laughed and got up again today on this ravishing day jake was hacking sailor round the fields just to check that all the fences were safe he had a feeling things were at last coming good for him africa was fit again and jumping like a kangaroo she had won two big classes in birmingham last week even beating the mighty humpty hamilton against the clock and sailor had been placed three times it had helped this year that he could at last afford to take on a fulltime groom a girl called tanya who was as good at riding as at stable management the idea was that jake could now concentrate on schooling and competing but he still found it hard to delegate believing that no one understood or could look after his horses as he could over the past four years he had traveled the northern and midland circuits never venturing south because it was expensive in petrol because he hated staying away from home for the night and because some niggling fear told him that he and his horses werent yet quite ready to beat the hell out of rupert campbellblack rupert had never been far from his thoughts however he had watched him obsessively whenever shows were televised and read every word about him in the papers as one outrageous scrape followed another in fact jake suspected he had only been picked for the team the may before last when hed had to drop out because africa was unfit because rupert and billy had both been dropped for hellraising in paris and then later getting into some frightful fight at the royal plymouth soon afterwards as though realizing hed gone too far rupert had suddenly married a gorgeous american redhead who seemed to have had a dramatic effect on his behavior gone were the days of womanizing and wild drinking rupert appeared less and less often in the gossip pages and more and more on the sports pages cleaning up at shows all over europe appearing as a regular fixture in the british team and even being tipped as a probable for the olympic games the following year jake gnashed his teeth he had a feeling that rupert was pulling further and further away from him that he would never catch up now still it was too nice a day to worry about rupert ahead flanked by pale green willows he could see the mill house its ancient red brick weathered to strawberry roan tossing its shaggy mane of white roses which no one had time to prune it was a long low house he tory little isa and tanya the groom lived on the lefthand side the right contained the old mill with its storerooms and huge stone wheel which fifty years before had been turned by a fastrushing stream which still hurtled under the house through the garden and eventually into the river trent behind the house hidden from view were the stables and beyond that a ring of oak trees with huge acid green lichened trunks which protected them all from the vicious north winds jakes ambition this year was to build an indoor school there were too many days in winter with the dark mornings and long nights or when it was frosty wet or slippery underfoot when it was impossible to work the horses outside hed eaten into torys capital so much hed have to get a loan from the bank but ever since the threeday week and the socialists coming to power and the economic gloom the banks had clamped down and were lending money only at colossal interest he didnt want to sell more shares at the moment as theyd have nothing to fall back on and nothing to secure any further borrowing they might need he was so deep in thought that it was a few seconds before he realized that sailor had pricked up his lop ears wolf was bounding forward and tory was shouting from the house popping sailor across the stream he cantered up the lawn which was more of a hayfield these days as no one had time to mow it telephone she yelled hurry she was standing by the willow tree which permanently dangled its leaves in the stream eight months pregnant with their second child she was about as fat now as she had been when he first met her her face was pink with excitement who is it he said sliding off sailor malise gordon ringing from london ill take sailor jake handed her the horse and ran into the house as fast as his limp would allow he mustnt sound too eager probably malise only wished to say he was coming north on a recce to watch jake at some show the telephone was in the hall which tory had painted duckegg blue last february damp patches were already showing through one day they might be able to afford a carpet hello he said curtly hello how are you said malise in his brisk military tones not stopping for an answer you had a good show at birmingham i hear glad africa got her form back humpty was very irritated to be beaten but very impressed how she was going thanks said jake feeling wolf curl up around his feet as he leafed through the neatly typed envelopes on the hall table tory had been busy sending off entry forms to the various show secretaries you cant hide your light under a bushel forever said malise in a slightly hearty voice you ought to try some shows further south i thought of having a crack at crittleden in july and perhaps wembley in october malise laughed i was thinking of much further south how about coming to madrid it was a moment jake had dreamed about for so long his throat went dry and he had to clutch onto the rickety table for support madrid he croaked yep sorry its such short notice ivor braines horses have all got the cough and driffield broke his arm over the weekend so i thought you might like to go in his place jake didnt answer his mind careering from terror to elation hello are you still there just said jake id like to then as an afterthought thanks very much the rest of the teamll be coming on from rome said malise except for humpty whos flying from heathrow and sending his groom down by train with the horses its a bugger of a journey takes three or four days so i suggest you put your groom and your horses in humptys box his groom bridie can collect yours on the way and they can travel as far as dunkirk together then take the train the rest of the way you can fly out to madrid with humpty he went on and meet the horses there no point both you and the horses arriving exhausted no said jake sharply i want to travel with the horses i really wouldnt recommend it anyway i cant spare my groom torys about to have a baby and she cant look after the yard on her own are you sure you really wont enjoy that flog i dont mind jake had never been abroad and the thought of letting his precious horses out of sight for a second on foreign soil filled him with horror and youll bring valerian and africa asked malise valerians been a bit pulled down by some virus ive got a much better horse he was placed in three classes at birmingham okay said malise you know your own horses if we need you for the nations cup you can jump africa in the kitchen jake found tory talking to wolf who was sitting on the kitchen table she was also opening a bottle of champagne where did that come from he said shocked at such extravagance granny maxwell gave it to me just before she died she said i wasnt to open it until you were selected she had faith in you too oh jake she put down the bottle and flung her arms around his neck and he could feel the tears on her cheeks im so so proud of you in the week that followed jake was almost too busy to be nervous although tory repeatedly nagged him hed never bothered to get a passport thinking it was tempting providence until he was actually picked now all sorts of strings had to be pulled by the bsja and trips taken to the passport office africa and sailor had to have passports too which included a drawing of the horse however many times jake redrew sailor he still looked like an old billy goat they also had to have blood tests and their health papers had to be stamped then shows had to be canceled and jake and the horses had to be packed for with a fourday journey there and possibly back he would be away for nearly three weeks he would liked to have rung humpty and asked his advice about foreign customs and what to wear but he was too proud meanwhile the village dressmaker sat up late every night making him a red coat he tried the coat on the night before he left wishing he was taller and broader in the shoulders at least he didnt have a turkey red face that clashed with it like humpty tory was putting isa to bed wolf the lurcher sat on his curved tail shivering on jakes suitcase the picture of desolation normally he went with jake to every show but some sixth sense told him he was going to be left behind tomorrow next minute isa wandered in in blue pajamas with a womble on the front and a policemans helmet on his head which he wore all day and in bed at night his left wrist was handcuffed to a large teddy bear he was at the age when he kept acquiring new words and copied everything jake and tory said daddy going hunting he announced seeing the red coat not exactly said jake im going away for a few days to spain and you must take care of mummy will you be back before mummy gets her baby out will you bring me a present jake turned so he could look at the coat from the back he wished he knew how hot it would be in spain what dyou want nuvver lorry youve got about ten said jake for christs sake dont touch that briefcase whats this spanish money where is pain said isa ignoring jake and spreading out the notes over the seas i said leave that case alone normally he hated snapping at isa but lastminute nerves were getting to him daddy have a whicksey said isa who regarded a stiff drink as the cure to all grownup ills and get pissed up i said go and find mummy jake retrieved the notes and the health papers mummys crying said isa jake felt a burst of irritation he felt guilty about leaving her but what else could he do she wanted him to get on what the hell was she crying for he found her in the bathroom bending her bulk down slowly to retrieve plastic ducks boats and sodden towels her swollen ankles were spilling over her slipon shoes she had had those shoes since he married her whats the matter he snapped nothing she concentrated on squeezing out a flannel what the hells the matter i cant help going his guilt at leaving her made him speak more harshly than hed meant to its not going to be much fun for me fifteen hundred miles on the train in the blazing heat with two horses it was part of the bargain of their marriage that she never clung to him or betrayed her desperate dependency im sorry she mumbled im over the moon that youre going i dont know whats the matter with me her lip trembled jake put his arm round her feeling the solid shape of the baby inside her pressing against him for a second she clung to him lowering her guard its just that im going to miss you so much itll go very quickly he said ill ring you the moment i get to madrid next minute they heard a terrific banging and wolf barking looking out they saw tanya obviously having to stand on a bucket peering out of the tiny high tackroom window will someone come and rescue me your wretched sons just locked me in and yet next morning getting up at first light with the rising sun touching the willows and the pale gray fields the mill house looked so beautiful that jake wondered how he could bear to leave it tanya had already been up for two hours getting the horses ready she had even borrowed two milk churns from a nearby dairy to carry water in case jake ran out on the train journey im sorry youre not coming he said you can take me next time if there is a next time said jake lighting a cigarette nervous jake nodded africa heard humptys lorry before jake did she had changed over the years growing stronger more muscular and filling out behind the saddle she was more demanding and less sociable and could be moody and impatient especially if she was in season now aware that something was up she darted to her halfdoor to look out eyes bold ears flattened pawing at her straw stamping with her forelegs the other horses put their heads out of the boxes ready to be jealous because they were not included in the trip only sailor stayed in his box calmly finishing off his feed sailor calmed africa down but jake was her big love both tory and tanya felt a stab of relief that bridie humptys groom wasnt at all pretty plump with mouse brown curls she had a greasy skin and a large bottom just my luck to be stuck for four days with that thought jake inside the lorry they could see humptys three horses with the resplendent porky boy on the outside coat gleaming like a conker by comparison sailor shuffling up the ramp looked as though he was going on his last journey at least africa in her dark beauty whinnying and prancing up the ramp slightly redeemed the yard well i dont think you need have any worries about jake getting off with that said tanya as the lorry heaved its way over the bridge rattling against the willow branches the forecasts awful bridie told jake cheerfully im afraid its going to be a terrible crossing in fact the entire journey was a nightmare the horse box moved like a snail a storm blew up in midchannel and the boat nearly turned back jake spent the entire journey trying to calm the horses the crossing took so long they missed the train at dunkirk and had to wait twelve hours before they caught another one which took them to the spanish border quite smoothly there they got into trouble with both french and spanish customs who took exception to jakes emergency passport jake speaking no languages at all and bridie who had only a few words of spanish found themselves shunted off to a siding for a day and a half fast running out of food bridie who was quite used to such delays whiled the time away reading mills and boon novels and being chatted up by handsome customs officials who didnt seem remotely put off by her size jake nearly went crazy pacing up and down smoking packet after packet of cigarettes trying to telephone england if youre abroad there are always holdups said bridie philosophically youll just have to get used to them hes as uptight as a tick that one she thought any minute hell snap at last jake got on to tory who managed to trace malise in rome who pulled more strings and eventually arranged for them to take the next madridbound train in the ensuing wait jake started reading mills and boon novels too not realizing that only now was the real nightmare about to begin their transport turned out to be cattle trucks with humptys three horses and bridie in one and jake africa and sailor in another there were no windows in the trucks just air vents and a sliding door porky boy wont like this said bridie hes used to a light in his box after lots of shunting and banging back and forth until every bone in jakes body was jarred they were then hitched to a spanish passenger express once the train started there was no communication with the outside world no one to talk to just total blackness and occasional flashes as stations flew past the whiplash effect was appalling jake knew exactly what it was like to be a dry martini shuddering in a cocktail shaker as they slowed down outside a big station jake heard crashing and banging from bridies truck next door porky boys gone off his head she yelled i cant hold him still enough to dope him risking his life and eternal abandonment in the middle of spain jake leapt out of his truck and ran along to bridies only making it just in time and narrowly avoiding being crushed to death by a maddened porky boy somehow with the flashlight between his teeth he managed to fill the syringe jab it into the terrified plunging animal and cling on soothing and talking to him until he calmed down bridie was tearful in her gratitude frantic about africa and sailor jake then had to wait until the milky white light of morning revealed rolling hills dotted with olive trees flattening out to the dusty leathery plains around madrid before the train slowed down enough for him to get back to them he was so proud africa had a cut knee where she had fallen down and both were obviously saddened by his absence but delighted to welcome him back they swayed from side to side keeping their footing if they could he thought they would have got out and pulled the cattle trucks themselves when they finally reached madrid the trucks were pulled into the passenger station jake and bridie found the platform packed with chic spanish commuters soberly dressed for the office and looking with astonishment on two such travelworn wrecks and their shabby horses after such a hellish journey jake was prepared for hen coops in which to stable the horses but the madrid showground turned out to be the last word in luxury with a sumptuous clubhouse swimming pools and squash courts and a huge jumping arena next to an even bigger practice ring containing more than fifty different jumps humpty says its worth coming to madrid just to practice over these fences said bridie as she unloaded a stiff weary chastened porky boy even better each foreign team had been given its own private yard with splendid loose boxes next door the victorious german team had just arrived from rome and were unloading their huge horses and making a lot of noise jake recognized ludwig von schellenberg and hans schmidt two riders hed worshiped for years tomorrow he thought with a thud of fear hed be competing against them he was distracted from his fears by another crisis the loose boxes were all bedded with thick straw which was no good for greedy sailor who always guzzled straw and blew himself out jake had run out of wood shavings on the journey down how could he possibly explain to these charming smiling but uncomprehending spaniards what he wanted bridies dictionary had wood but not shavings he felt a great weariness can i help said a voice it was malise gordon who had just flown in from rome his high complexion tanned by the italian sun wearing a lightweight suit and looking handsome and authoritative jake was never so pleased to see anyone immediately malise broke into fluent spanish and sorted everything out you look absolutely shattered he said to jake sorry it was a bloody journey but i warned you still it was as well you were there to look after porky boy last night are your horses okay while the spanish grooms put down the wood shavings for sailor jake showed malise africas knee which mercifully hadnt swollen up wheres your other horse here theyve got his box ready sailor a messy eater had tipped all his feed into the wood shavings and was busily picking it out he gave malise a baleful look out of his walleye after the fourday journey he looked perfectly dreadful christ thought malise well be a laughingstock entering something like that but he supposed in the remote chance of jake having to compete in the nations cup he could always ride africa anyway the boy looked all in no point in saying anything now ill take you back to the hotel youd better get some sleep malise looked at his watch its only ten oclock now the rest of the team wont arrive till this afternoon i suggest we meet in the bar around nine pm then we can have dinner together and you can meet them all to jake who had never slept in a hotel the bedroom seemed the height of luxury there was a bathroom with a shower and a bath and a loo and free soap and bubble bath and a bathcap and three white towels in the bedroom there was a television a wireless a telephone and a huge double bed he was dying for some coffee but he didnt dare pick up the telephone in case they couldnt understand him french windows led out onto a bosomy balcony which looked over a park to the left if he leaned out he could see a street full of shops and cafés with tables outside already smells of olive oil pimentos and saffron were drifting up from the kitchen drawing the thick purple curtains and only bothering to take off his shoes jake fell onto the surprisingly hard bed the picture on the wall of a matador in obscenely tight pink trousers shoving what looked like knitting needles into the neck of a bull swam before his eyes and he was asleep despite his exhaustion however he slept only fitfully his dreams of disastrous rounds kept being interrupted by bursts of flamenco music or the screams of children playing in the park by six the city had woken up and stretched itself after its siesta and jake decided to abandon any hope of sleep outside the streets were packed with cars rattling over the cobbles hardly restrained at all by lights or frantically whistling policemen tables along the pavement were beginning to fill up crowds to parade up and down looking across at the park he saw a small child racing after a red ball then tripping over a gamboling dog falling flat on his face and bursting into noisy sobs next moment a pretty darkhaired mother had rushed forward sworn at the dog and gathered up the child covering him with kisses jake was suddenly flattened with longing for isa and tory he was desperate to ring home but he didnt know how to nor did he dare pick up the telephone and ask for some tea instead raging with thirst he drank a couple of mugs of water out of the tap then unpacked showered and wrapped only in one of the white towels wandered out onto the balcony instantly he stepped back for there on the next balcony was a beautiful girl painting her toenails coral pink and soaking up the slanting rays of the early evening sun she was impossibly slender with long legs and arms which despite being covered in freckles were already tanning becomingly to the color of weak tea she wore a saffron yellow bikini and her hair was hidden by a big yellow towel beside her lay the catalogue of some art gallery a spanish dictionary what looked like a book of poetry and a halffinished glass of orange juice obviously she could make reception understand her the whole impression was of a marvelously pampered and overbred racehorse as she stretched luxuriously enjoying the sensation of being warm and alive jake felt a stab of lust why didnt one ever see girls like that in warwickshire he wished she would pick her nose or scratch her crotch anything to make her more normal and less desirable suddenly there was a commotion in the corridor the girl jumped up a mans voice could be heard shouting in the passage okay well see you in the bar about nine the girl in the saffron bikini could be heard calling out in an american accent darling its so good to see you there was a long pause then he heard the mans voice more clearly it was a flat distinctive drawl which he would recognize anywhere and which made his knees disappear and the hairs prickle on the back of his neck bloody awful journey said the voice lorry kept overheating weve been on the road for nearly thirtysix hours sweetheart said the girl im so sorry you must be exhausted another pause followed then the voice said sharply i dont care how fucking exhausted i am get that bikini off the girl started protesting but not for long next moment there were sounds of lovemaking with the bed banging against the wall so hard that jake felt he was back in the cattle truck mercifully it lasted only five minutes any more evidence of ruperts superstud servicing would have finished jake off altogether almost worse was the splashing and laughter as later they had a bath together it was still desperately hot jake made his bed neatly and soaked with sweat had another shower and changed his shirt for something to do hed have liked to have washed some underpants and shirts and hung them out on the balcony but he could imagine ruperts derisive comments later he heard them having a drink on the balcony better get a few quick ones under my belt so malise doesnt think im alcoholic by nine oclock jake was so crucified by nerves and waiting that he couldnt bring himself to go downstairs until malise rang up from reception saying they were all in the bar and had he overslept malise met him as he came out of the lift noticing the set face the black rings under the eyes the obvious tension he said dont worry theyre all very unalarming there they were all his heroes humpty hamilton puce from the heat drinking lager lavinia greenslade whom he remembered from the first bilborough show she was even prettier now that shed lightened her hair and wore it shorter and curlier on either side like two guard dogs sat her mother who wore too much cheap jewelry and her father who had ginger sideburns and a stomach spilling over his trousers they didnt smile lavinia was too recent a cap herself for them to regard any new member of the team with enthusiasm billy lloydfoxe had filled out and broken his nose since prep school days but looked more or less the same he was laughing with a most beautiful redheaded girl who was wearing black flared trousers and a white silk shirt tied under her breasts and showing off her smooth bare midriff by her freckled arms and her coral pink toenails jake identified the girl on the balcony rupert had his back turned as he paid for a round of drinks and signed an autograph for the barman but jake immediately recognized the back of that smooth blond head and the broad blue striped shoulders he felt a wave of horror and loathing this is jake lovell said malise im sure he knows who all of you are rupert swung round smiling in his brown face his eyes were as brilliantly blue as a jays wing hi he said welcome to alcoholics not at all anonymous i hear you had a worse journey than us which seems impossible what are you going to drink jake whod rehearsed this moment so often and who was prepared to be icily aloof found himself totally disarmed by such friendliness and muttered hed like some scotch billy got to his feet and shook jakes hand youve been cleaning up on the northern circuit dont venture up there often myself too easy to get beaten that was a good horse you were jumping at birmingham said humpty patting the empty seat beside him whats she called australia africa said jake looks almost clean bred who was her sire dont know and her dam dont know that either oh shut up humpty said rupert handing jake a very large glass of whisky which made malise frown slightly rupert lifted his glass to jake welcome to the british squad he said hope its the first of many thanks said jake he took a slug of his whisky which was so strong it made his eyes water he put his glass down at once so they shouldnt see how much his hand was shaking lavinias been capped for great britain six times said her mother defensively oh please mummy you should be proud of the fact went on her mother the only girl in the team what about driffield said rupert ive always thought his sex was slightly in question no it isnt said humpty ive shared a room with him thats enough said malise did you get to the prado this afternoon helen asked him malise shook his head i spent a couple of hours there she said the velasquez are out of this world such power i only managed to do two rooms but i also looked at the cathedral the nave is just wonderful rupert stifled a yawn i prefer navels he said running his hand over his wifes midriff then pushing down her black trousers he fingered her belly button particularly yours it was definitely a gesture of possession and he smiled across at jake with that bullying mocking appraising look that jake remembered so well humpty turned back to jake by the way thanks for looking after porky on the way down bridie said he might have damaged himself and her very badly if you hadnt stepped in the train driver ought to be shot said jake spaniards dont like animals said humpty porkys highly strung of course but so was his dam and humpty was off on a long involved dissertation on porky boys breeding jake appeared to listen and studied the others mr and mrs greenslade were discussing what horses lavinia ought to jump across lavinia who was gazing surreptitiously at billy billy was arguing fairly amicably with rupert about whether a particular mare was worth selling and how much theyd get for her helen and malise having exhausted velasquez had moved on to spanish poetry she was an astonishingly beautiful girl thought jake but too fragile for rupert jake couldnt imagine him handling anyone with care for very long i just adore lorca helen was saying hes so passionate and basic that poem that starts green green i want you green sounds like billy said rupert only in his case its gweenslade gweenslade i want you gweenslade shut up hissed billy shooting a nervous glance in the direction of lavinias mother not unless you buy me a drink said rupert handing billy his empty glass okay said billy getting up who needs a refill jake does said rupert unable and not particularly wanting to get a word in edgeways while humpty talked jake had had plenty of time to finish his whisky having not had anything to eat for at least thirtysix hours he was beginning to feel very tight but before he could protest rupert had whipped his glass away and handed it to billy not as strong as the last one then said malise firmly that was a quadruple hes not eighteen you know said rupert softly how old are you asked humpty twentysix said jake same as me and rupe said billy hailing the waiter its funny we havent heard of you before said lavinia awfully womantic to be suddenly picked out of the blue like that i started late said jake but im sure ive seen you before said billy puzzled as he handed double whiskies to jake and rupert pwobably in horse and hound or widing magazine said lavinia no it wasnt thought billy to himself there was something about jake that made him feel uneasy layers of memory being slowly peeled back like an onion not very happy memories the kind you tucked into a corner of your mind and tried to forget they dined in a taverna a couple of streets away the walls were covered in fans and castanets and pictures of ladies in mantillas in a corner a fat tenor in a rather dirty white frilly shirt and with greasy patent leather hair was dispiritedly strumming a guitar the owner rushed out shaking hands with malise humpty rupert and billy and showing them their signed photographs on the wall then going into a frenzy of ecstasy over lavinias blond beauty redheads were less rare in madrid than blondes and helen was a little too thin for spanish tastes jake was beginning to feel distinctly odd he must get some food inside him he found himself with lavinia on his left and mr greenslade on his right bottles were put on the table and rupert immediately filled everyones glasses completely incomprehensible menus came round whats gazpacho he asked lavinia tomato soup said rupert that sounded gentle and stomachsettling and polpi some sort of pasta said rupert ill have that said jake suddenly he noticed billys hand caressing lavinias thigh under the table where her mother and father couldnt see the waiter arrived for their order firmly jake said hed like gazpacho and polpi id like a large steak and chips said humpty so would i said billy but not chips just a salad my trousers are getting disgustingly tight and mediterranean prawns to start you shouldnt drink so much said rupert filling up his glass helen turned to the waiter and started to address him in spanish oh for christs sake said rupert irritably they all speak english spanish is the native language of approximately two hundred million people throughout the world said helen flushing slightly that cant be all bad at least she can translate your horoscope in the spanish papers said billy and jolly useful at customs said mrs greenslade who admired helen weve got marion for that said rupert shes got big boobs which is more a language the customs officers understand apart from his hand stroking her thigh billy was studiously avoiding lavinia for the benefit of her parents so she turned to jake how did you get on in rome he said i havent seen any papers i got a second and a third wupert did best he won two classes and got a clear wound in the nations cup but we were still thwashed by the germans and the fwench i dont think well ever beat them ludwig and hans schmidt are like computers they just pwogwam their horses and wound they go jake was eating bread desperate to mop up some alcohol the fat flamenco singer after a lot of stamping launched into some mournful ditty sounds like grand hotel said rupert now hed had a lot to drink jake found his eyes continually drawn to rupert like a rabbit to a snake he still felt the same sick churning inside ruperts whiplash tongue was still there soon he knew hed be the recipient he realized again what an evil man rupert was behind his offhand jokey exterior it was very hot in the restaurant jake was drenched with sweat okay asked malise grub should be up in a minute thats one of the maddening things about spain no one dines before ten oclock at least we get a nice late start im going to spend tomowwow morning sunbathing said lavinia you are not said her father youll sort out that stop of snowstorms were not risking him ducking out again at last food began to arrive a plate of soup was put in front of jake a great waft of garlic made him feel distinctly queasy god knows what was in it little bits of fried bread green peppers and cucumbers floated on top this is a most interesting paella helen was saying as she speared a large mussel feeling slightly sick jake took a mouthful of soup and only just avoided spitting it out it was stone cold and heavily garlicked he put his spoon down and took a huge gulp of wine then a piece of bread to take the taste away what was he to do was it some diabolical plan of ruperts telling the waiter to bring him cold soup so he could laugh like a drain when jake ate it whats the matter said malise nothing said jake he mustnt betray weakness he took another mouthful and very nearly threw up glancing up he saw rupert eyeing him speculatively gazpacho good he asked its stone cold if you want to know said jake theyve forgotten to heat it up rupert grinned its meant to be he said gently i should have warned you its a spanish national dish no doubt enjoyed throughout the world by approximately two hundred million people jake gripped the sides of the plate for a second he felt such a wave of hatred he nearly hurled it in ruperts face ill have the gazpacho said billy leaning over whipping away jakes plate and handing him the mediterranean prawns in return then youll sleep alone said rupert it seems i have no other choice said billy smiling blandly at mrs greenslade and squeezing lavinias thigh a bit harder rupert started discussing bullfights with humpty hamilton well go to one later in the week im not going said lavinia i thinks its vewy cwuel have you ever seen one asked rupert no youre just like helen she was out with the antis when i first met her she looks like a fox thought jake beautiful nervous wistful with those haunted yellow eyes a tamed fox that might bolt at any minute the el grecos are wonderful she was saying to malise you look like an el greco yourself kind of lean and distinguished malise jake noticed blushed slightly and looked not unpleased im going back tomorrow morning why dont you come too she went on tomorrow my angel said rupert with a distinct edge to his voice you are going to spend the morning in bed with me the second courses were arriving jake felt the mayonnaise and prawns mixing unhappily with the whisky and wine in his stomach pasta was just the thing to settle it next moment a plate was put down in front of him he nearly heaved at the sight it was full of octopus i didnt order this sí señor polpi jake turned dark red you said it was pasta he hissed at rupert how silly of me drawled rupert of course polpi octopus id forgotten what a pity you didnt ask helen or malise youre a shit rupert said billy look he added to the waiter take this back and get some risotto or would you rather have a steak jake shook his head he was feeling awful i think ive had enough have some of my wice and chicken said lavinia tipping it onto his side plate its weally good but ill never get thwough it all did you know there were two men in the spanish team called angel and maria dinner dragged on jake was dropping now he picked at the rice lavinia had given him but didnt manage to finish it once again he was overwhelmed with such homesickness he almost wept if he was home now hed probably have just come in from a show tory would be waiting and together theyd go up and gloat over the sleeping isa anyone want pudding asked malise id love some berries said helen have they any fresh berries in english you specify them said rupert through gritted teeth strawberries raspberries gooseberries im sure there are some strawberries said malise smiling at helen what about you jake jake shook his head and got to his feet thank you for dinner im off to bed he said can i settle up with you in the morning this is on the bsja said malise well thanks said jake sleep well said malise order breakfast from reception they all speak english and for christs sake dont drink the water in the taps you going to bed said rupert in surprise sorry about the polpi and the gazpacho new boys tease you know i know said jake bleakly only too well looking at the set white face in a flash billy remembered lovell j of course he knew hed seen him before he was the gypsy boy at st augustines gyppo jake whom he and rupert had bullied unmercifully until he ran away it was the one thing in his life hed always been ashamed of he wanted to say something to jake to apologize for the teasing at dinner but it was too late hed gone outside jake took a taxi down to the showground fortunately hed remembered his pass and the guards let him in he realized he was very drunk the great bear overhead kept disintegrating and reforming like a swarm of illuminated gnats crossing the exercise ring he threw up behind a large spanish chestnut as he covered it with sand he hoped one of ruperts bloody horses would slip on it tomorrow bastard bastard bastard he hadnt changed at all new boys tease indeed nausea overwhelmed him again he leant against an oak feeling dizzy finally he made the stables it was a comfort that africa and sailor were so pleased to see him blinking sleepily they smelt of hay and contentment one arm round each of their necks he clung onto them desperate for reassurance they were his horses from his yard tomorrow he said well go out and lynch him jake never knew if it was a result of meeting rupert again or because he drank too much tap water but in the early hours of the morning he was laid low with a vicious attack of gyppy tummy for the first few days of the show it was all he could do to struggle up and crawl down to the stables to look after africa and sailor later in the day he was either eliminated or knocked up a cricket score of faults in every class he entered the jumps were huge and solid with the poles fitting deeply into the cups and the competition was fierce both africa and sailor were out of sorts after the long journey jake was so strungup he transmitted his nerves to the horses who jumped worse and worse as the week went on to make matters worse none of the classes started before three oclock in the afternoon with an evening performance beginning at pm by the time the final national anthem had been played it was am and usually four oclock before jake fell into bed to wake like a stone at six in the morning his usual time for getting up after which he couldnt get back to sleep again a doctor was summoned and gave him pills and advised fortyeight hours rest but for a workaholic like jake this was impossible he couldnt bear to be parted from his horses his one link with home he had no desire to sightsee with malise or helen or lounge round the pool sunbathing with the others and be confronted with the contemptuous bronzed beauty of rupert campbellblack so while the others relaxed and enjoyed themselves jake didnt miss a round jumped by another rider or a workout in the warmup area he was learning all the time but not to his advantage there were too many of his heroes around to influence him and he got increasingly muddled as first he tried to ride like the italians then like the dashing spaniards then like the mighty germans the rest of the team except rupert tried to be friendly and helpful they were all relieved he was not the whitehot savior predicted by malise but as one catastrophic round followed another and he became more monosyllabic and withdrawn they gave up rupert on the other hand was openly hostile on the morning after they arrived in madrid he was riding round the practice ring when billy said you know that new chap the great gourmet and conversationalist said rupert scornfully dont you recognize him hes the same gyppo lovell who was at st augustines with us cant be bloody is dont you remember his mother was the cook mrs lovell she did herself in hardly surprising after producing an undersized little runt like that didnt he become a boarder yes said billy bleakly he was in our dormitory we gave him such hell he ran away perhaps we should repeat the experiment with any luck he might do it again you didnt help much last night snapped billy making him order octopus poor sod hes never been abroad before certainly doesnt know how to behave in a hotel said rupert i caught him making his bed this morning for a few minutes they rode on in silence then billy said i feel i ought to make it up to him somehow for being such a shit at st augustines rupert started to play on an imaginary violin dont be so bloody wet little creeps like that deserve to be hammered how the hell did he get started anyway well thats the interesting part dyou remember a hugely fat deb named tory maxwell rupert shuddered only too vividly maxwell big as a house unable to turn round without the use of tugs he glanced sideways at billy relieved to see he had made him laugh and quite rich thats the one well jake lovell married her and evidently used all her cash to get started no wonder hes undersized squashed flat in the sack must be like going to bed with a steamroller who told you all this malise last night he thinks lovells brilliant well hes wrong lovells just about as insipid as the mince his mother used to cook and whats more he kept helen and me awake all night throwing up to rub salt into jakes wounds all the other members of the team were jumping well and in the money particularly rupert who won a vespa on the third day and insisted on roaring round the showground on it to everyones amusement and irritation jakes was the only part of the british tackroom without its share of rosettes rupert never lost an opportunity to put the boot in on the third day just before the competition he persuaded marion to hide all jakes breeches and his red coat and fill up his trunk with frilly underwear marion was only too happy to oblige wandering round heavily curvaceous in pink hot pants and a sleeveless pink tshirt she was the toast of the showground always followed by a swarm of admiring tongueclicking spaniards and the recipient of endless bonhomie from the other male international riders jake resentful that rupert not only had an exquisite wife but a spectacular groom ignored marion a reaction to which she was unused he went bananas when he found his clothes missing she told rupert gleefully hes not as cool as he makes out although marion soon returned his clothes what upset jake more was that the yellow tansy flower he always wore in the heel of his left boot to bring him luck had somehow vanished without his talisman his luck was bound to plummet and as a result he lost even more confidence most of all he was upset by ruperts constant cracks about sailor that he must be a mule or a camel and no wonder hed frightened them at customs they must have thought they were letting a dinosaur into the country jake felt very protective towards sailor whom he loved very deeply and his heart blackened against rupert on the fifth day malise announced the british team rupert billy humpty hamilton and lavinia with jake as reserve in the evening he took jake out for a drink and explained there was nothing else he could do on jakes current form dont worry he said spearing an olive out of his very dry martini this often happens to new caps not as badly as this said jake gazing gloomily into a glass of soda water he still felt too sick even to smoke his eyes seemed three inches deep in his face his face was gray and seamed with exhaustion he must have lost half a stone its a vicious circle said malise gently everyone talks about the killer instinct and being hungry enough to go out and win but youre so snarled up inside youre frightening the hell out of your horses i know the fences seem huge and youre worried about overfacing them but you must be more aggressive the only way to tackle those fences is to attack be accurate but ride on all the time those big heavy poles are so firm you can afford to clout them africa should be able to sail over them anyway jakes face registered no emotion a fly was buzzing round their heads malise flicked it away with a copy of the times spanish fly said jake suddenly with the ghost of a smile spposed to be good for sex isnt it malise laughed never tried it myself more ruperts province expect youre feeling homesick too missing tory and the baby and youre pulled down looking after the horses by yourself its amazing how your first win will buck you up if i ever do win my dear boy ive seen you on form i know youre good youve just got to calm down jake suddenly felt an emotion close to adulation he could imagine following malise into battle without a qualm if only hed had a father like that or even a father like mr greenslade who bossed you around all the time because he minded about you there he was buying himself a drink at the bar and about to come and join them im going to be very unorthodox said malise he handed jake a bottle with some red pills in thosell make you sleep put you out like a light dont tell the rest of the team ive given them to you theyll play havoc with your reflexes but youre not jumping tomorrow or in the nations cup and a couple of good nights sleepll put you right for the grand prix on saturday and dont tell me you dont approve of sleeping pills nor do i except in an emergency tomorrow youre not going anywhere near the stables marion and tracey will look after africa and sailor you can go on the sightseeing jaunt with the rest of the team after fourteen hours sleep jake woke feeling much better he didnt know whether malise had had a word with them but all the team were particularly nice to him as they set off out of madrid in an old bus across dusty plains like the hide of a great slaughtered bull then through rolling hills dotted with olive trees and orange groves the road was full of potholes sending sledgehammer blows up jakes spine as the back wheels went over them rupert sat next to helen with his arm along the back of the seat but not touching her because it was too hot billy sat in front talking constantly to them refereeing any squabbles sticking up for helen lavinia greenslade sat with her father humpty sat with jake and talked nonstop about porky boy only rupert didnt let up in his needling every donkey or mule or depressedlooking horse they passed reminded him of sailor or jakes joke as he now called him they lunched at a very good restaurant sitting outside under the plane trees eating cochinella or roast suckling pig it was the first square meal jake had been able to keep down since he arrived while they were having coffee a particularly revolting old gypsy woman came up and tried to read their fortunes do tell your ghastly relation to go away jake said rupert helen beautiful radiant and clinging was surprised rupert was being so poisonous to this taciturn newcomer she tried to talk to jake and ask him about his horses but aware that he was being patronized he answered abruptly and left her in midsentence afterwards they went to a bull farm and tried playing with the young bulls and heifers with padded horns and a cape rupert and billy whod both had a fair amount to drink at lunchtime were only too anxious to have a go humpty whod eaten too much suckling pig you might pop if a horn grazed you said rupert refused to try and so did jake side by side but both feeling very different emotions jake and helen watched rupert tall and lean a natural at any sport swinging away as the little bull hurtled towards him determined to excel he was already getting competitive billy fooling around couldnt stop laughing and was finally sent flying and only pulled out of danger just in time by rupert in the end rupert only allowed himself to be dragged away because they had to be in madrid to watch a bullfight at six before the fight they were shown the chapel where the matadors pray before the fight do with a session in there before tomorrow afternoon said billy dear god make us beat the germans the bullfight nauseated jake particularly when the picadors came on riding their pathetic brokendown insufficiently padded horses if they were gored according to humpty they were patched up and sent down into the ring to face the ordeal again they were so thin they were in no condition to run away the way too that the picadors were tossing their goads into the bulls neck to break his muscles reminded jake of ruperts method of bullying the cochinella was already churning inside him i say jake ruperts voice carried down the row doesnt that picadors horse remind you of sailor if you popped down to the plaza de toros later this evening im sure theyd give you a few pesetas for him jake gritted his teeth and said nothing thats wight whispered lavinia who was sitting next to him dont wise its the only way to tweat wupert jake felt more cheerful particularly when the next moment lavinia plucked at his sleeve saying can i wush past you quickly im going to be sick ill come with you said jake neither of them was sick but on the way home enjoyed a good bitch about rupert the rest of the team went out to a party at the embassy jake followed malises advice and went to bed early again on the morning of the nations cup jake woke feeling better in body but not in mind the sight of fan mail and invitations so overcrowding ruperts pigeonhole that they spilled over into humptys and lavinias on either side gave him a frightful stab of jealousy then in his own pigeonhole he found a letter from tory which filled him equally with remorse and homesickness darling jake she wrote in her round childish hand isa and wolf and all the horses and tanya and most of all me or should it be i are missing you dreadfully but i keep telling myself that its all in a good cause and that by the time you get this letter youll have really made all the other riders sit up particularly rupert is he still as horrible or has marriage mellowed him i know youre going to do really well jake couldnt bear to read any more he scrumpled up the letter and put it in his hip pocket skipping breakfast he went straight down to the stables he wanted to work the horses before it got too punishingly hot walking into the british tackroom he steeled himself for whatever grisly practical joke was on the menu today but he found everything in place because it was nations cup day everyone was far too preoccupied the grooms were tense and distracted the horses edgy they knew something was up jake worked both the horses and was pleased to find sailor had recovered from the bout of colic hed had earlier in the week and africas leg was better back in the yard he cooled down sailors legs with a hose amused by the besotted expression on the horses long speckled face nearby tracey was washing the bulls tail beyond her ruperts groom marion was standing on a hay bale to plait the mighty macaulays mane showing off her long brown legs in the shortest pale blue hot pants and grumbling about the amount of work she had to get through macaulay was so over the top that rather than risk hotting him up rupert had decided to ride belgravia in the parade beforehand and bring out macaulay only for the actual class this meant marion had two horses to get ready jake whod been carefully studying ruperts horses thought they were getting too many oats no one could deny ruperts genius as a rider but his horses were not happy he had surreptitiously watched rupert take mayfair belgravia and macaulay off to a secluded corner of the huge practice ring and seen how he made tracey and marion each hold the end of the top pole of a fence lifting it as the horses went over to give them a sharp rap on the shins however high they jumped this was meant to make them pick up their feet even higher the next time the practice known as rapping was strictly illegal in england jake however was most interested in macaulay he was a brilliant horse but still young and inexperienced jake felt he was being brought on too fast in the yard the wireless was belching out spanish pop music i do miss radio one said tracey the italian team came past their beautifully streaked hair as well cut as their jeans and stopped to exchange backchat with marion and tracey as jake started to dry sailors legs the horse nudged at his pocket for polos how long have we got tracey asked marion about an hour and a half before the parade christ said tracey plaiting faster im never going to be ready in time give over bull keep still the bull looked up with kind shining eyes you want a hand asked jake ive nearly finished sailor you havent said a voice behind him it was malise gordon looking elegant even in this heat in a pale gray suit but extremely grim youre going to have to jump after all he said that stupid idiot billy sloped off this morning with rupert to have another crack at bullfighting and got himself knocked out cold tracey gave a wail and dropped her comb the bull jerked up his head its all right hell live said malise irritably the doctor doesnt think its serious but billy certainly doesnt know what day of the week it is and theres no chance of him riding tracey burst into tears marion stopped plaiting and put her arms round tracey glaring at jake as though it was his fault hes got a head like a bullet dont worry marion said soothingly come on said malise not unkindly pull yourself together put the bull back in his box and get moving on whoever jakes going to ride africa i presume jake shook his head her legs not right im not risking it ill ride sailor for a second malise hesitated you dont want to jump the bull catching traceys and marions looks of horror jake shook his head if by the remotest chance he didnt let the side down he was bloody well not having it attributed to the fact that he wasnt riding his own horse all right youd better get changed youre meant to be walking the course in an hour but with the general coming and spanish dilatoriness its impossible to be sure luckily jake didnt have time to panic tracey sewed the union jack onto his red coat normally he would have been fretting around trying to find the socks the breeches the shirt and the white tie which he wore when he last won a class but as it was so long since he had won anything hed forgotten which was the last set of clothes that worked his face looked gray and contrasted with the whiteness of his shirt like a beforeandafter laundry detergent ad his hands were trembling so much he could hardly tie his tie and his red coat which fitted him before he left england was now too loose then suddenly when he dropped a peseta and was searching for it under the forage bin he found his tansy flower slightly battered but intact overjoyed he slipped it into his left boot aware of it a tiny bump under his heel he felt perhaps his luck might be turning at last rupert arrived at the showground in a foul temper hed just had a dressingdown from malise for going bullfighting on the morning of a nations cup he was worried about billy and he realized with billy gone that their chances of even being placed were negligible normally he didnt need to distance himself before a big class but helens chatter about el grecos and goyas and her trip to toledo with the old houses silhouetted against the skyline got on his nerves and hed snapped at her unnecessarily shed hoped to win him over in a new dress a laura ashley white smock dotted with yellow buttercups worn with a huge yellow straw hat but he had merely snapped what on earth are you wearing that for its the latest milkmaid look said helen i dont like milkmaids only whisky maids and youre going to obscure about fifteen peoples view in that hat no there isnt time to change were late as it is god its hot said lavinia greenslade as they sweated in the unrelenting sun waiting for the goahead to walk the course her eyes were swollen and pink from crying over billys concussion it had taken all malise gordons steely persuasion coupled with her parents ranting to make her agree to ride the rotund humpty was sweating so profusely that great damp patches had seeped through his red coat under the arms and down the spine wish we could jump in our shirtsleeves he grumbled not in fwont of the genewal said lavinia hes weally hot on pwotocol jake clenched his teeth together so the others couldnt hear them chattering like castanets walking the course didnt improve his nerves the fourteen jumps were enormous most of them bigger than he was with a huge combination in the middle and a double at the end with an awkward distance you could either take three small strides between the two jumps or two long ones he tried to concentrate on what malise was saying as they paced out the distances in a nations cup four riders on four horses jump for each country jumping two rounds each over the same course there is a draw for the order in which the nations jump today it was france italy spain germany then great britain last which meant that a french rider would jump first followed by an italian then a spaniard a german and finally a british rider then the second french rider would jump followed by the second italian and so on until all the riders had jumped each nation would then total the scores of its three best riders discarding the worst score the nation with the lowest number of faults would then be in the lead at half time the whole process is then repeated each rider jumping in the same order once again the three lowest scores are totted up and the nation with the lowest total over the two rounds wins the cup if two countries tie there is a jumpoff nations cup matches are held all over europe throughout the summer and autumn and the side that notches up the most points during the year is awarded the presidents cup for the last two years this had been won by germany malise gave the order for the british team to jump humpty lavinia rupert jake if you get a double clear humpty told jake as they came out of the ring you get a free red coat cant see myself having much chance of wearing out this one said jake he thought so even more a few seconds later as lavinia gave a shriek of relieved joy bounded towards billy as he stood swaying slightly at the entrance to the arena and flung her arms round him lavinia thundered her mother and father simultaneously lavinia ignored them are you all wight you shouldnt have come out in this heat does your poor head hurt billy was deathly pale but he steadied himself against lavinia and grinned sheepishly at malise im terribly sorry triffic said rupert you can ride after all no he cant said malise firmly go and sit in the shade billy and take my hat he removed his panama and handed it to billy for christs sake snarled rupert hardly bothering to lower his voice even concussed billys more valuable than lavinia or jake they simply havent the nerve when the chips are down thank you wupert said lavinia disengaging herself from billy if it werent against the intwests of my countwy id hope you fall off are you implying my lavinia isnt up to it said mrs greenslade turning even redder in the face yes said rupert unrepentantly and jake even less so shut up rupert said malise losing his temper youre behaving like a yobbo well if you want us to come bottom yet again its up to you said rupert im honestly not up to it said billy placatingly i can see at least six of all of you fortunately an ugly scene was averted by a loose horse pounding through the collecting ring his lead rein trailing and flysheet slipping whickering with delight he shoved the rest of the british team summarily out of the way and rushed straight up to jake burying his nose inside his coat and nudging him with delight it was sailor his feet were oiled his coat polished his thin mane coaxed into plaits his sparse tail fell jagged from a tube of royal blue tail bandage the next minute tracey joined them panting and laughing the moment he saw you he broke away from me amazing that someone finds you attractive said rupert thats enough rupert said malise icily youd better warm up before the parade humpty the general in true spanish tradition was late so the parade started without him the germans came first the famous four hans manfred wolfgang and ludwig olympic gold medalists who had not lost a nations cup competition for two years they had reason to be proud they rode with a swagger on their equally famous horses four beautiful hanoverian geldings with satin coats elegant booted legs arched necks and chins apparently soldered to their breastbones as they passed their grooms gripped the fence and cheered they were followed by the french beautifully turned out with the lighter and less obedient horses and then the italians in their impeccably cut coats with the blue collars riding with slapdash elegance two of them smoking then there was a great earsplitting cheer sending a great communal waft of garlic up from the crowd as the spanish team came in beautiful riders on beautiful powerful horses their manes flowing free but somehow not coordinated like the germans the crowd however thought they were the greatest and screams and shouts of magnifico and olé followed them all round the ring the british team came last rupert rode on the magnificent belgravia chestnut coat gleaming in the sunshine not having been ridden in at all marion hadnt even had the time to walk him around he was boisterous and uncontrollable and the crowd particularly the women marveled how this handsome englishman hardly moved in the saddle as the horse bucked and violently shied beneath him on his left was humpty on porky boy then lavinia on the gray snowstorm whose coat was already turning blue with sweat and then sailor shuffling along looking on his last legs as though he could hardly stagger as far as the grandstand the crowd laughed jeered and pointed jake gritted his teeth hed show them the wait that followed was interminable the teams lined up in front of the grandstand and all except lavinia removed their hats as each countrys national anthem was played the band knew their own national anthem and confident the germans would win had been practicing deutschland deutschland all week but when they got to great britain they launched into the starspangled banner which everyone thought very funny except the mustachioed bandmaster who turned an even deeper shade of purple the horses meanwhile were going mad in the heat except sailor who stood half asleep one back leg bent hanging his head twitching his fleabitten coat against the flies and occasionally flattening his ears at belgravia who was still barging around like a beestung bronco jake tried not to look at the jumps all the women in the audience fanned themselves with their programs medallions nestling in a thousand black hairy chests glittered in the sunlight in the riders stand next to the collecting ring helen comforted a disconsolate billy youd be mad to jump she said must say ive got the most awful headache jakes horse looks like i feel said billy as the teams came out of the ring sailor bringing up the rear shuffling along head hanging helen looked at jakes set face she hadnt seen him smile once since hed arrived the knight of the sorrowful countenance she thought hes like don quixote she said to billy and that poor beatendown old horse looks like rosinante billy wasnt interested in literary allusions what a bloody stupid thing to do he said malise is livid doesnt look it said helen watching malise in dark glasses with a gardenia in the buttonhole of his pale gray suit completely calm as he went from one member of the team to another steadying their nerves encouraging them lavinias not wearing anything underneath that black coat sighed billy as the british team filed into the riders stand malise gave helen the jumping order on a clipboard so she could keep the score the general still hadnt arrived but it was decided to start the arena went very quiet as the white doors opened and the first french rider came in and took off his hat to the judges as he went past the start the clock started ticking it was soon obvious as he demolished jump after jump sending poles and bricks flying that this was a far from easy course the italian who came on second was also all over the place and notched up twentyeight faults viva españa screamed the crowd as the first spanish rider came in although they had applauded the earlier riders politely they cheered their own hero unrestrainedly doesnt look very magnifico to me said rupert as the horse went head over heels at the rustic poles crashed through the wall and the final double losing his rider again and having to be led out impossibly lame ive seen enough said humpty running down the steps and out to the collecting ring to scramble onto porky boy as the first german rider rode leisurely into the ring hans schmidt was the second best rider in the german team but his dark brown horse didnt like the course any more than the others and came out most unusually with twelve faults as he walked out ruefully shaking his blond head and muttering dummkopf he was practically knocked sideways by humpty bouncing into the ring the merry porky boy ears pricked and fighting for his head his black tail swishing back and forth across his plump cobby quarters bucketed towards the first fence the crowd was amused by him and his rider who rose so high out of the saddle over the bigger jumps that it seemed he would never come down again but he got around with a very creditable twelve faults now it was time for the second frenchman to jump no one went clear as round followed round and disaster followed disaster several horses overturned and were eliminated a spanish horse burst a blood vessel and had to be destroyed later in the day despite ruperts gloomy prognostications lavinia jumped well for only twelve faults which meant the germans and the english were level pegging on twentyfour faults at the end of the second round with the other nations trailing well behind the next german manfred got eight faults the best round so far he was followed by rupert who did not jump well macaulay like belgravia overoated and insufficiently ridden in had been frightened in the collecting ring by three loudspeakers crackling fortissimo above his head an enormously powerful horse it took all ruperts strength to stop him running away in the ring by some miracle they went clear until they got to the upright where macaulay put wrong hit it sharply for a second the pole bounced agonizingly in the cup then fell unbalanced and taking off too early macaulay also had a foot in the water rupert came out of the ring looking bootfaced hes dying to beat the hell out of that horse said jake to himself he watched helen beautiful in her yellow hat biting her lip with disappointment as she entered eight faults by ruperts name jake didnt want to be around when rupert came back hed seen enough rounds anyway riding around the collecting ring he felt sicker and sicker trying to remember the turns and the distances between the jumps but his mind had suddenly gone completely blank as if someone had pulled a lavatory chain draining all the information out of his head leaving an empty cistern he wished he could slip into the matadors church to pray he listened to the deafening cheer as the last spanish rider went in and groan follow groan as he demolished the course now it was time for the mighty ludwig von schellenberg the greatest rider in the world to go into the ring and show everyone how to do it which he did jumping clear but so carried away was he by the poetry and stylishness of his round that he notched up one and a half time faults he came out grinning and cursing now as luck would have it as jake was due to jump the last rider in round one the general chose to arrive and everything ground to a halt while two lines of soldiers with machine guns formed a guard of honor and the band played the spanish national anthem several times and dignitaries were introduced with a lot of bowing and shaking of hands and the general was settled in his seat this is a bugger said malise after jake had been kept waiting twenty minutes im very sorry theyll call you any minute just aim for a steady clear take it easy and ride at the center of the fence up in the riders stand helen was doing sums if the germans count ludwigs manfreds and hanss rounds and drop wolfgangs that puts them on twentyone and a half she said weve got rupert on eight humpty on twelve and lavinia on twelve that makes thirtytwo we wont get lower than that this half said rupert jakes bound to be eliminated ludwig von schellenberg came into the riders stand you look beautiful mees helen in that hat he said clicking his heels as he kissed her hand shes a mrs not a miss you smarmy kraut and keep your hands off her said rupert but quite amiably ludwig was one of the few riders he liked and admired number twentyeight called the collecting ring steward jake rode quietly into the ring during the long wait he had counted sailors plaits found there were fifteen his unlucky number and had quickly undone them so sailors sparse mane crinkled unbecomingly like harpo marxs hair as the horse shuffled in fleabitten head hanging ludwig laughed and turned to rupert do you get your horses from zee knackers yard now may i be franco with you said rupert that is the ugliest horse anyones ever seen helen looked at jake and repeated her remark about the knight of the sorrowful countenance to malise but malise wasnt listening either he was praying the audience was losing interest there hadnt been enough clear rounds the germans were so far ahead it didnt look as though anyone and definitely not the spaniards would catch them up the general was talking to his energy minister about oil prices no one was paying much attention as sailor cantered towards the first fence tilting at windmills thought helen filled with compassion never get over it said rupert but suddenly this extraordinarily ugly animal shook himself like an old music hall actor who realizes hes got a capacity crowd gave a snort of pleasure and took hold of the bit christ look at that said humpty hamilton as sailor cleared the first fence and that said billy as he cleared the second and that said malise resisting a temptation to crow as he cleared the third and that said helen jesus he can really jump said billy look at the way he tucks up his feet the crowd bored by spains poor performance suddenly diverted by this extraordinary horse laughed at first then started to clap and cheer hes going to get time faults if hes not careful said mrs greenslade as jake checked sailor before the combination but pop pop pop over he went christ said humpty that horse must have some good blood in him who is zees horse malise said ludwig it is not permitted i think to jump mules i shall lodge an objection sailor was over the water now there was just the double left as he turned sharply to make up time the sun shone straight into jakes eyes dazzling and blinding him he had to leave it all to sailor the british team held its breath as the horse came trundling down carefully positioned himself and cleared both parts beautifully as he shambled out of the ring to deafening cheers some people in the riders stand could have sworn he winked his walleye jake his face blank leaned forward pulling sailors ears running his hand repeatedly up and down the horses curly mane beginners luck said rupert that horse isnt a beginner said billy he looks like an oldage pensioner hes got half a time fault said helen putting c for clear by jakes name that puts us in the lead in the collecting ring sailor philosophically accepted the ecstatic embraces of bridie and tracey but was more interested in getting his three polos reward from jake who in his turn was trying to hide his elation having automatically checked sailors legs for any swelling or tenderness he loosened his girths and put on his fly sheet well done said malise its hard to believe that horse hadnt walked the course himself and as humpty billy lavinia and both her parents surged round jake to offer their congratulations malise added delighted hes come good completely justified your faith in him get tracey to walk him round in the shade and keep him quiet and come and have a coke or something but jake couldnt bear to leave sailor using a bucket of water brought by tracey he sponged the horses head throat and neck and between his back legs to cool him down putting a hand over sailors eyes he sprayed his head and ears with fly spray and as it wasnt wise for the horse to take in quantities of water he washed his mouth with a sponge to refresh him belgraviad have your hand off if you did that said marion who was walking a sweating macaulay round the paddock he jumped well she added nodding at sailor was this the first round in peace talks thought jake marion one of the iron curtain satellites temporarily making diplomatic overtures towards the west thanks he said the second half of the competition was much tougher the delays had got to the horses and frayed the riders nerves the heat was stifling the flies even worse sipping an ice cold pepsi in the competitors stand jake tried to keep calm its the first time for ages the germans havent been in the lead after the first half said mrs greenslade but theyre tremendously good at coming from behind sounds fun said rupert glancing at helen who went pink the germans in fact came back fighting humpty jumped well but could only manage eight faults lavinia had four to her parents ecstasy bloody boo sucks to you wupert she said as she came out of the ring but the first two germans had only four faults each then manfred came in and got only eight faults ruperts got to go clear said billy looking at helens marks and counting on his fingers god i wish id taken o level math down in the collecting ring malise told rupert the same thing macaulays a big brave horse he can do it if you keep calm and put him right but rupert was still raging with jake and malise and with lavinia for being so smug about getting four faults macaulay was a big brave horse but hed suffered when rupert was angry before and he sensed rupert was angry now and it unsettled him putting him over an unnecessarily high practice fence rupert had banged his fetlocks badly macaulay was a brave horse but he didnt like being pushed around rupert jumped clear until he came to the seventh fence a huge oxer then he turned macaulay too sharply put him at the fence wrong pulling him up a stride too early despite a huge and heroic jump macaulay couldnt make it and had the pole down this unsettled him for the combination fighting for his head he almost ran away with rupert and had all three elements down then put a foot in the water finishing up with twenty faults the british team groaned this was the round theyd have to drop it would be too much to expect jake to repeat his brilliant first round they had been so near beating the germans now victory was slipping away like a sock in a gum boot rupert rode straight out of the ring ignoring the cries of bad luck spoken in five different languages straight past marion out of the collecting ring and back to the stables ludwig came in stepped on it and as expected went clear without a time fault it was all up to jake if he went clear they would win by half a time fault the volatile crowd were disappointed not to have a spanish win but they admired the courage of this gypsy boy and his hideous horse and adopted him as their own magnifico they cried half in irony as he came into the ring were bloody well going to do it whispered jake into sailors ear as he leaned forward and shortened his reins sailor gave three bucks to show he hadnt fallen asleep and the crowd roared their appreciation off sailor went towards the first fence and billy despite a blinding headache felt that rare surge of pleasure which transcends any kind of jealousy when a new star is born youre right he said to malise hes brilliant malise unable to speak because he felt so nervous and choked with emotion merely nodded suddenly billy felt someone tugging his sleeve it was marion one look at her horrorstricken face and he followed her down the steps whats the matter its rupert hes killing macaulay where is he back at the stables in the box hes bolted the door as billy sprinted the three hundred yards back to the stables he was aware of a huge cheer that seemed to raise the sky jake must have gone clear marion ran beside him sobbing the bastard the bastard it was his fault go and saddle up belgravia quickly rupertll have to ride him in the parade the white hot stone of the stables seemed to burn billys eyes for a second he felt dizzy and thought he was going to faint then he heard the terrified screaming of a horse and the sickening thud of a whip on flesh he streaked across the yard both the halfdoors of macaulays box were shut rupert let me in fuck off bloody well let me in shouted billy pushing his huge shoulders against the door mind your own fucking business billy stepped back and ran at the bottom halfdoor it began to give then he hurled his shoulders at it nearly taking his head off as it caved in for a second after the dazzling sunlight he couldnt see a thing then he gave a flying leap and landed on rupert winding him and rolling him on the ground fucking horse gasped rupert give me that whip or ill use it on you you bloody wont billy scrambled to his feet macaulay was a pitiful sight cowering in the corner the lather turned red with blood he had weals all down his shoulder and one across his face just above the nostrils which were extended and as red as a poppy his eyes were rolling in terror his veins swollen his sides heaving you poor bastard said billy going up to him the horse cringed away in terror its all right he said catching his bridle its all over rupert got to his feet his face murderous give me that whip i havent finished you put him at it wrong said billy quietly you were a stride off no horse could have jumped that fence its all right boy he stroked macaulays trembling neck its all right you stupid bugger he added over his shoulder you could be prosecuted for this ill deal with my horses as i choose snarled rupert he was about to make a dive for the whip when they heard a clattering of hooves outside it was marion with belgravia go on said billy dont you realize weve won jake went clear so what youve got to go and collect the cup you won it too you know you only got eight faults in the first round go on belgravias waiting im not going stop behaving like a teenager said billy echoing malise do you want everyone saying youre a stinking loser for a second he thought rupert was going to take a slug at him instead he ducked out of the halfdoor and vaulted onto belgravias back heres your hat called billy after him marion took it and handed it up to rupert youre a bastard she hissed im giving in my notice mr and mrs greenslade malise and all the grooms were cheering like schoolboys as the british team rode into the ring even helen now over the disappointment of ruperts twenty faults was jumping up and down and waving her yellow hat in the air sailor the hero of the afternoon walked on the outside walleye looking suspiciously at the crowd but accepting the deluge of cushions flowers and handkerchiefs that descended around him with equanimity jake managed to catch two pink carnations and threaded them into sailors browband as they lined up in front of the generals box a cushion flew through the air and rupert had to duck to avoid it jake turned to him rather reminds me of pillow fights in the dormitory of st augustines he said softly rupert gave him a look of pure loathing which would have withered most people but jake was beyond withering they were also very keen at st augustines on people being good losers he said and laughed in ruperts face the british team stood in front with the other teams fanned out behind them jake choked back the tears as the union jack rose in a series of jerks up the flagpole and the national anthem was played for the second time that afternoon very badly and this time in a minor key god jolly well ought to save our queen fwom foweign bands said lavinia afterwards they had to walk rather apprehensively between an avenue of machine guns and meet the very distinguished general who despite his great age and the punishing heat rose to his feet and congratulated them in perfect english rupert he appeared to know already and inquired after his beautiful mother but before rupert could reply a second commotion that afternoon was created by sailor who dragging the unfortunate official who was trying to hold him refused to be separated from jake and undeterred by the armed guard followed his master halfway up the stairs fortunately the general had a sense of humor and allowed two of his minions to help him down the stairs to pat sailor on the nose jake smiled the general smiled sailor nudged the general in the pocket as though checking if he were armed too and the photographers went wild sailor among soldiers said the headlines next morning and the press went wild because it was the first time anyone had beaten the germans for two years the germans who were all very sporting came up and shook jake by the hand i think we will have to pull the stocking up no said hans are you thinking of selling that horse said ludwig as they finally galloped round the ring rosettes streaming sashes across their left shoulders jake clutched a solid silver bear the symbol of madrid his prize as leading rider i dont care what you say said humpty swelling his chest at each cheer that horse must have some good blood somewhere i must telephone tory said jake as they rode out of the ring god i hate those telephones mummyll do it for you said lavinia she speaks spanish billy was waiting for them well done he said to jake good thing i got a concussion id never have pulled off a double clear that night at dinner they went over every fence in every round and the nations cup was filled and drunk out of again and again and everyone even billy whod deadened his headache with four aspirin was relieved that rupert and helen excused themselves from the celebration on the very genuine excuse that the general had asked them to dinner much later not entirely sober jake went down to the stables to check on his horses earlier hed added salt and electrolytes to sailors feed to make him drink because hed been very dehydrated after sweating so much in the afternoon now he found his water bucket was empty and kicked over jake filled it up again rather laboriously he repoulticed sailors legs to take away the aches brought on by such strenuous jumping then he went and looked at his darling africa walking her up and down her leg was better shed be okay for the grand prix tomorrow he couldnt resist going into the tackroom and shining his flashlight on the red rosette hed won earlier rubbing its shiny ribbon along his face kissing the hard cardboard center maudlin idiot he told himself but he was still walking on air as he came out he saw a light in ruperts box creeping towards it he looked over the halfdoor and found marion redressing macaulays weals jake winced in distaste his shoulder looked as though someone had been playing noughts and crosses with a knife macaulay saw him first and cowered into the corner marion swung round instinctively pulling the rug over the damage what the hell are you doing here looking at my horses i suppose thats ruperts work for a second marion hesitated between discretion and outrage outrage won of course it was the bastard she peeled back the rug and went on applying cream to the wounds ive got some better stuff for that said jake returning to his trunk in the tackroom he got out a jar of ointment which had turned liquid in the heat whats that said marion suspiciously an ancient romany recipe said jake opening the jar steady boy im going to make you better gently he began to rub the ointment into the weals macaulay trembled and flinched but did not move away he seemed to understand that jake was trying to help him hed never let rupert do that said marion who stopped him billy did malise know no and with ruperts luck he wont find out macaulayll be in his box tomorrow ruperts riding belgravia in the grand prix and mayfair in the class before the day after were flying back to england first thing hes a lovely horse but ruperts ruined him hell sell him on now cant bear to be faced with anything that makes him feel guilty helenll go mad macaulays the only horse shes interested in because he named him after her having treated the last cut jake patted the horse then perhaps because he was more than a little drunk he said leave him to rest come and have a drink marion looked at jakes expressionless face he was like one of those birthday cards left blank so you could write your own message all right she said im sorry i nicked your breeches thats okay i knew rupert put you up to it hes really got it in for you makes two of us ive really got it in for him they never got to the bar rupert would really fire me if he could see me now said marion well hell certainly hear you if you dont keep your voice down theyre in the nextdoor bedroom marion laughed i gave in my notice today anyway you going to leave asked jake unbuttoning her white shirt ive given it in so often he probably didnt believe me accustomed exclusively over the last five years to torys bulk jake could hardly believe the slenderness of marions thighs or the springy breasts which didnt collapse under her armpits when she lay down for a few minutes he stroked her body as wonderingly as if she were a thoroughbred and when he kissed her he was enchanted by the skill and enthusiasm of her response they broke away she smiled at him touching a gold earring are you really a gypsy half said jake she ran her tongue along the lifeline of his hand im crossing your palm with saliva it was a feeble joke but they both had to bury their faces in the pillow to muffle their laughter both got an extra buzz from knowing how angry rupert would be if he could see them jake was small thin and not very handsome but his hands had a magical effect on marion soothing away all the tensions and frustrations shed been bottling up since rupert married helen ruperts lovemaking was aggressive like a power drill her campbellblack and decker she used to call him she enjoyed it only because rupert was so wildly attractive and she melted at his slightest touch jake was gentle considerate yet seemed by comparison extraordinarily detached in fact jake was extremely attracted to marion and very glad he was able to prevent himself coming too soon by working out a plan of action afterwards when they lay sated in each others arms marion said that was wonderful who would have thought it youre not looking for a groom are you i couldnt pay you as much as rupert and youd distract me too much you totally ignored me all week that was deliberate i hated you for being part of ruperts entourage and youre so goodlooking you irritated the hell out of me prettier than helen much he knew that was the judgment that would win her over i wish rupert thought so the bastard is he faithful to her at the moment i think hes rather captivated by the idea of his own fidelity its such a novelty but theyve hardly had a night apart since theyve been married and she sticks like a leech wait till she gets pregnant and cant go everywhere with him thats when the troubles going to start he cant do without it nor can i by all events muttered jake look he said pushing her hair back from her forehead youre fond of macaulay arent you yes i love him all you have to do is to let me know when ruperts selling him hed never sell him on to you perhaps not but someone else could buy him for me hes too strong for you rupert can only just hold him and hes a sod in the stable i dont control horses by brute strength said jake and my guess is that he wont jump for rupert anymore have you got a nice wife asked marion hoping hed make love to her again very said jake rupe said you married her for money doesnt stop her being nice dont you feel guilty no said jake this is my reward for a double clear amonth later jake lovell drove through the warm june evening doing sums late the previous night marion had rung him from a call box to tip him off about a horse called revenge hes a sod but a brilliant one and youd better hurry ruperts after him too wasting no time jake had driven all the way down to surrey to look at the horse and he liked what he saw jake was seldom cheated when buying a horse his stint with the gypsies had stood him in good stead they taught him that dealers often disguise lameness deliberately laming the opposite leg by shoeing it wrong that they put black marks on a horses teeth with hot wires so itll pass for a sixyearold or even shove mustard up its rectum so the animal prances along with its tail up in a travesty of high spirits they had also taught him never to be carried away by a horses looks he had to confess however that revenge was the handsomest horse hed ever seen a showy red chestnut with a zigzag blaze a mane and tail that looked as if theyd been dipped in peroxide and an air of intense selfimportance he had been bought by a doting millionaire for his daughter when she suddenly decided she wanted to take up show jumping revenge had turned out far too strong for her allowed to get away with murder he had learnt to buck and spin at the same time and tried to drag jake off under some lowhanging oaks at the top of the field on the other hand he had jumped a line of large fences without effort landing like a cat and showing not only an ability to get himself out of trouble but incredible powers of acceleration jake ached all over where the horse had had him off three times but he still wanted him unfortunately george masters the dealer wanted which jake hadnt got hed just sold two of his best novices in order to put down the deposit on the indoor school the balance on this would be due by the end of the summer darklis the new baby girl was adorable but she meant more work for tory isa jealous and playing up needed extra attention which meant tory had less and less time for the horses tanya the one groom was hopelessly overworked jake desperately needed another groom but to pay her he needed to go to more shows and win more money to do that he needed another grade a horse to fall back on when either sailor or africa were unfit theres a hole in your bank balance dear jake he told himself so deep was he in thought on the way home that he suddenly realized hed taken the wrong turn and was driving through bilborough there was bilborough hall russet and mellow in the evening sun scene of his first show on africa if he competed there now as a member of the british showjumping team would he be invited to lunch up at the house with the nobs there was brook farm riding school he felt a sick churning relief that he no longer worked for mrs wilton there was the village green and the church and molly maxwells house molly carter she was now the colonels lady diplomatic relations had been resumed between molly and tory after isa was born but they were still uneasy jake had never forgiven the colonel for firing his guns molly had never forgiven jake for running off with her daughter and even worse making her happy mollys marriage to colonel carter had not been happy he was hardly back from his honeymoon at that hotel in brittany that served english food before he realized what a bitch she was too old and too proud to split up they were locked together in mutual enmity the colonels retirement from the city had thrown them even more into one anothers company molly took refuge in endless bridge the colonel tried to control mollys spending and dickered with the stock market fen had been shunted off to boarding school when she was eleven and was discouraged from visiting jake and tory in the holidays because of mollys quite unfounded suspicions that jake would probably seduce her driving slowly past the house jake could see his motherinlaw playing bridge with three other harpies in the drawing room the house had a burglar alarm now and a yellow rose growing over the porch and a swimming pool round the back so the colonel could do his ten lengths every morning like an old walrus jake suddenly felt hungry he hadnt had any lunch and with a hundred and fifty miles to drive home he decided to drop into the next pub being early evening he found it halfempty but as he ordered a pint of beer and a pork pie he heard a familiar bray of laughter not turning he edged down the bar there in the mirror behind the bottles he could see his stepfatherinlaw arched rather like a golden retriever over a brassy blonde who certainly wasnt his motherinlaw in amusement jake watched the colonel putting his hand over the blondes hand and lifting it with a clash of bracelets to his lips stupid old goat he thought picking up his pint he catfooted towards the table hello bernard he said softly colonel carter dropped the blonde like a waspfilled pear and turned puce suddenly the ring on his paisley scarf seemed very tight hello jake he said with a great show of heartiness long time no see what are you doing in this neck of the woods looking for a horse youve been doing very well this year getting your name in the papers even saw you on the box the other night going to crittleden are you sailor still going strong of course he is said the blonde he did well in madrid didnt he double clear indeed and billy getting concussed naughty boy macaulay was off form though i think that rupert campbellblacks dead cruel jake found himself gazing into the heavily bluemascaraed eyes of the true showjumping groupie she was showing a lot of crinkly bosom in a shiny blue and white dress her shoe straps were biting into her fat ankles and she enveloped jake in wafts of cheap scent but her face was kinder than mollys arent you going to introduce us bernard she said well as you obviously know this is my soninlaw jake lovell said the colonel even more heartily and this is vivienne a great friend of my late wife jennifer vivienne didnt look as though shed be the great friend of anybodys wife thought jake arent you going to join us she said all right just for a minute as long as bernard doesnt mind said jake maliciously hows fen not too good really said the colonel very moody never brushes her hair fights a lot with molly litters her clothes around the place moll sold her pony last week then seeing the expression on jakes face he added defensively wretched animal kept jumping out of the field had to go and collect it in the middle of the night probably lonely does fen know not yet break her heart said jake poor little soul said vivienne hows she getting on at school the colonel shook his head refuses to work just draws horses and gazes out of the window wrong place for her really they dont have riding there but molly insisted dont know why people have kids then send them away said vivienne enjoying her disapproval of molly then turning to jake pity she cant live with you if shes so horse mad jake whod been thinking the same thing was biding his time fen was only thirteen but was already showing distinct promise if he could get her under his wing he could mold her the way he wanted to and shed be very useful helping with the horses they might even be able to avoid getting a second groom what dyou like to drink he asked my round really said the colonel not getting up id like a gin and cinzano jake with lots of ice thanks said vivienne seizing the opportunity used to the colonels meanness if you twist my arm ill have a whisky and soda said the colonel whod been drinking a halfpint before attractive isnt he jake heard vivienne say as he went to the bar shame about the little girl ought to go and live with them molly worries about what her friends think mumbled the colonel likes to appear the devoted mother on the other hand said vivienne slyly fenll soon be old enough to be competition wont be much fun when mollys menopause clashes with fens adolescence the colonel didnt think so either tell us about this horse said vivienne when jake returned with the drinks hes called revenge said jake and hes got acceleration like a ferrari and christ he can jump but hes got a very bad temper and has learnt some bad habits how much do they want asked the colonel five thousand im just wondering how the hell to raise it he looked speculatively at the colonel and then at vivienne thats awfully cheap said vivienne three good wins and youll get your money back the colonel suddenly felt heady his masculinity had been badly dented by molly she was always accusing him of being an old woman about money hed show her it was time the lion roared ill buy it for you jake he said fun to have a flutter vivienne clapped her fat hands together with more jangling oh what a good idea you can split the prize money jake didnt react determined not to betray his excitement horsell take a bit of sorting out not going to hurry him probably wont see any return for your money for a year or so go on bernard itll give you an interest youve always wanted to own racehorses whatll we tell molly asked jake flatly she wasnt ecstatic last time a member of her family bought me a horse in a pub that i bumped into you said the colonel decided to help you out for a quarter of an hour they discussed technicalities rupert might well go higher if so theyd scrap the whole idea jake looked at his watch it had donald duck on the face and had been a birthday present to isa that tory had thought the child was too young for ought to get back torys keeping supper byebye jake can i have your autograph said vivienne nice lady said jake as the colonel walked him out to the car old friend mumbled the colonel friend of mollys too asked jake neednt mention her to molly need we i never met her said jake you saw me going into the pub and you stopped to say hello and we had a drink together good man said the colonel patting jake rather gingerly on the shoulders always felt sorry about that tory business worried about fen too youd be doing her a kindness jake fingered the colonels check in his pocket ill think about it jake waited until morning to ring up masters he didnt wish to appear too keen he offered you must be joking said masters anyway rupert campbellblacks coming to look at him at eleven he was the first one after the horse so i ought to let him have a butchers the butchers is where that horse will end up if you dont curb its nasty vicious habits soon said jake four grand is my offer and im not topping it if rupert offers more let him have it im going to see another horse over cheltenham way this afternoon and i want to know if ive got the spare cash to buy it so id be grateful if youd let me know what rupert says one way or the other ill ring you the moment i hear said masters placatingly dont rush into that other deal too quickly jake then had to spend the morning biting his nails it was all nerve allowing the elastic to go slack so the other person started pulling on it when masters rang back he made tory say he was out and would ring back which he didnt then masters rang again that shit campbellblack never turned up never bothered to ring the horse is yours if you want it four thou said jake four thousand five hundred four twofifty done ill come and collect him now it was another hot wearying drive and it took three stable lads george masters and jake all their persuasive power and a lot of bad language to get revenge into the lorry by which time the horse was drenched with sweat as jake drove away he could hear him stamping and kicking in rage and wondered if hed been mad to buy him two miles on he was driving along a narrow country lane brushing the buttercups and the elder flowers when suddenly a dark blue porsche hurtled round the corner and only just avoided a headon collision by skidding onto the verge and nearly removing a wild rosebush the driver a blond man wearing dark glasses swore and hurtled on there was no mistaking rupert but jake didnt recognize the brunette beside him maybe she was the reason marion had rung him up when you get there mate youll find the cupboards bare and he threw back his head and laughed revenge renewed his kicking and stamping and youd better be nice to me boy he called back to the horse youve no idea how lucky you are not to go to that bastard and all the way home as the dead gnats peppered the windscreen he kept laughing to himself until at last as the sun was setting he saw the gleaming willows and red pink walls of the mill house and felt as always that wave of joy at coming home christ he was tired darklis was still on fourhourly feeds so they werent getting much sleep tomorrow he had to get up early to drive up to a show in yorkshire and then the next week on to the royal at stoneleigh tory came out to meet him with wolf bounding ahead you got him you must be exhausted when they lowered the ramp revenge was cowering in the corner shivering as though in a fever despite the heat of the evening poor old boy he must have had a bad time but isnt he beautiful said tory as jake went towards him revenge bared his teeth and darted at jake like a cobra hes a bugger said jake no ones to go near him for the next day or so but me having tied him up securely jake rubbed him down put on a sweat rug watered and fed him but the horse didnt seem remotely interested in food and once he was let loose proceeded to pace round and round his box leave him said jake hell settle down thank god for tory he thought as he went into the house everything was tidy the toys that had strewn the hall when he left that morning were now all put away the only evidence of babies was a pile of fluffy nappies folded in the hall a smell of shepherds pie drifted enticingly from the kitchen hows things been fine really except for isa posting all the entry forms down the loo fortunately id typed them rather than filling them in in ink so they didnt run theyre drying off in the hot cupboard by the way she said after shed given him a glass of beer they were still too poor to drink wine except for special occasions fens here he looked up run away from school yes she discovered mummyd sold the pony he found fen still dressed in her school uniform slumped sobbing on the bed how could she do it she forgets my birthday then next day she sells marigold she wont even tell me where shes gone probably to a good home well find out said jake and she was too small for you i know i really have tried not to put on weight so i wasnt too heavy but she was the only thing id got i loved her so much jake patted her shoulder for a second she was crying so hard she couldnt get the words out then she said i cant stand school anymore its a horseless dogless desert going on and on she reached out for wolf whod climbed onto the bed trying to lick her tears away and i cant live with mummy anymore i hate her and i loathe him please dont send me back jake was shocked by her appearance last time hed seen her a year ago shed been a little girl now she was a teenager with lank greasy hair spots and a pasty skin flecked with blackheads although she was terribly thin he could see the first swell of breasts beneath the grass green school sweater please let me come and live with you she sobbed i wont be a nuisance ill babysit and ill get up early and work at night and at the weekends jake stroked her hair ill talk to tory come downstairs and have something to eat i cant truly id be sick oh jake im so sorry you must be knackered and to be faced with me after that drive but i keep thinking of marigold her face crumpled again how lonely and bewildered shell be ill go and ring your mother said jake fens here she heard him say on the downstairs telephone no dont talk to her tonight shes fast asleep must have walked most of the way jake overslept next morning pulling on his clothes he went downstairs to see how revenge had survived the night as he put on his shoes in the kitchen he could hear africa knocking her water bucket about and sailor pawing the door and neighing wheres my bloody breakfast all right all right grumbled jake im coming outside he froze with horror both halves of revenges door were open isa fascinated by the horses had developed a dreadful habit of standing on a bucket and letting himself into the boxes heart hammering jake ran across the yard as fast as his limp would allow inside he found fen her arms round revenges neck feeding him carrots and kissing him on the nose good boy good boy youll love it here and youre going to become a great and famous show jumper jakell see to that fen said jake desperately trying to keep his voice steady come out of there she looked up at him with an angelic smile hes so sweet can i ride him later revenge glared at jake raised a threatening front hoof and then darted his big white teeth in the direction of jakes arm stop it said fen firmly taking his head collar and giving it a shake thats bad manners you dont bite your master revenge debated the matter for a minute rolling his eyes and looking bootfaced no said fen even more firmly youre just showing off youre an old softy really revenge deciding that perhaps he was butted fen in the pockets in search of more carrots whats his name she asked revenge fen grinned revenge is sweet he really is at that moment jake decided to keep her if youre so taken by him youd better feed him and skip him out whats he been eating said fen stable boys mostly said jake but i think well try and wean him off that habit rupert drove home in a blazing temper hed tried everything to make masters tear up the check but when the man insisted hed given the buyer a receipt and refused to name him rupert lost his temper and an undignified shouting match ensued on the way home rupert took it out on sarah the brunette hed met at a show earlier in the week hed been furious with himself for bedding her that morning hed been on the way home from a dinner in london and had rung helen to say hed be late home as he was making a detour to surrey to look at a horse the detour had also taken in sarahs flat he hadnt enjoyed screwing her at all and hed fallen asleep afterwards which made him impossibly late for his appointment with masters hed taken a stupid risk too masters might easily have rung home and helen smelled a rat and been hurt unnecessarily he didnt feel particularly guilty about being unfaithful but enraged that through his stupid dalliance hed lost a really good horse hed have to get his spies out and track revenge down by the time he had chewed up a few more people he might go even cheaper since madrid macaulay had been a writeoff losing all his form and confidence hed have to go too he thought as he dropped sarah off whenll i see you again she called after him anxiously but rupert had driven off without a word even the sight of penscombe in the height of its summer beauty didnt soothe him helens clothes her endless schemes for the garden a lilac walk here a little heated swimming pool there a seventeenthcentury stone nymph there cost a fortune billy worked hard but he cost a fortune too always buying other people drinks and feeding mavis chicken the whole shooting match is dependent on me rupert thought sulkily ive got to win and win to support it he drove straight around to the stables where he found billy working one of the novices in a nearby field he admired billys patience but why was he resting the bull and kitchener this week and not at a show winning money billy pulled up and rode towards him wiping the sweat from his forehead did you get him already sold on shit that was bad luck who got him wouldnt say might have been more trouble than he was worth this is going to be a very good horse by the way good its about time he started paying his way he found marion in the tackroom cleaning a saddle she didnt look up still sulking thought rupert for a second he admired the unsupported breasts in the tight blue tshirt and the succulent thighs in the denim skirt which was only just buttoned up enough to hold it up didnt get him he said he was sold on who to marion bent over the pommel so rupert couldnt see how much she was blushing masters wouldnt say just as well i quite like having two arms and legs particularly when theyre such sexy legs she looked up wasnt aware youd noticed them recently i always notice them how was sarah it was an inspired guess but it hit home rupert didnt flicker then unable to resist a joke added rather like coventry cathedral ravishing from the outside but very disappointing once you got inside marion started to giggle you are frightful he went up behind her stroking the back of her neck she leant against him furious with herself for feeling faint with longing rupert darling called a voice in here said rupert moving away from marion to examine the diet charts it was helen also in navy blue in a dress which must have cost fifty times more than my skirt and tshirt thought marion helen was looking rather pale her newly washed hair falling to her shoulders subtly smelling of miss dior her blue high heels catching in the ridges of the floor shes as out of place here as a tiger lily in a cabbage patch thought marion darling how did you get on im coming in said rupert im filthy you can bring me a drink in the bath he was reading horse and hound in a foot of hot scented water when she walked in funny he reflected how even after two years she averted her eyes nice dress it can go back if you dont like it i do you can take it off in a minute heres your drink she said hastily hoping to distract him rupert took a deep gulp and went on reading audax on the derby why dont you come and soap my cock helen blushed billyll be in in a minute so what not in here he wont come on helen sat on the loo seat and took a birdlike sip of her drink why are you drinking vodka demanded rupert she usually had sherry its perrier actually what on earth for i went to see dr benson today he looked up sharply you ill no she took a deep breath im going to have a baby you what the next moment hed reared out of the bath like a great dripping whale and taken her in his arms drenching her oh darling he said in a choked voice are you sure positive rupert youre soaking me christ thats fantastic i cant believe it its wonderful isnt it you must rest you mustnt carry anything heavy are you sure youre up to carrying that glass of perrier when did you think you were oh sweetheart you should have told me i wanted to be sure i thought you were on the pill i stopped taking it tears suddenly filled her eyes i was real scared after the termination she almost gagged on the word i wouldnt be able to conceive then i started feeling vile in madrid she sat down on the loo seat you never told me still dripping he crouched beside her kissing her again and again she was so pleased he was pleased but she wished hed get dressed this rampant nakedness seemed incongruous somehow with the momentousness of the occasion finally he stood up my fatherll be knocked out what shall we call him eddie he might be a girl rupert started doing his sums when hes twentyfour hell be able to ride in the olympics he went to the bedroom window and opened it billy billy put something on urged helen wrapping a towel around him billee next minute billy appeared at the edge of the lawn still riding the gray yes for christs sake come here not across the lawn wailed helen mr higginsll do his nut helens going to have a baby billy threw his hat high up in the air and rode through some delphiniums fantastic you can be the fairy godfather said rupert and just think what a wonderful opportunity itll be to get nanny back to look after him over my dead body thought helen at that moment one of the jack russells wandered into the bedroom and sicked up a few frothy blades of grass on the carpet and the dogs are going to be kept outside once the baby comes she said to herself im not having them in the nursery fen never dreamt shed have to work so hard jakes indoor school was finished by the autumn which meant even as the days drew in that she was able to get up at five in the morning and work the horses for two hours before school then she would come home grab a quick bite to eat dash off her homework then back to the indoor school until late in the evening often she fell asleep at her desk her form mistress rang up tory and complained fen was not stupid just exhausted and totally unmotivated it was the twentieth century people didnt send children down the mines anymore her complaints fell on deaf ears tory remonstrated gently with jake and tried to get fen into bed by ten but it was often midnight before they finished jake was a very hard taskmaster as fen was tall for her age it was pointless to waste time learning to ride ponies she must go straight on to horses and as shed be competing initially against children whod been riding the circuit since they were seven there was a lot of ground to catch up fen found it hard to be patient she only wanted to jump and jump but jake insisted she do the groundwork first hardly letting her ride across the yard without coming to see if she were doing it properly to straighten her back and deepen her seat he gave her daily lessons on the lunge without reins and stirrups with her arms behind her back and a stick through them to keep her shoulders straight cold weather didnt deter him sometimes they worked outside with everything frozen and the snow hardening to a sheet of ice with the wind up their tails the horses would give a series of bucks and stirrupless and reinless fen would fly through the air and emerge from the shrubbery like a snowman day after day she came in with raw bleeding knees and elbows every bone in her body aching seldom did she complain she was so frightened of being sent back on the whole she was happy because she felt she was getting somewhere like jake she loved the cozy family atmosphere created by tory she adored the children wolf and the cats and the horses and heroworshiped jake revenge however was her special pet she spent any free moments in his box talking to him calming him in a way they were learning the ropes together like her when he arrived he was miserably displaced suspicious of everyone gradually they got their confidence back revenge was never worked in the same field twice horrendously highstrung he was a picky eater hated any box but his own and was liable to kick any strange stable to pieces he also fell madly in love with africa following her everywhere to sailors irritation and yelling his head off if she went to shows without him jake brought him on with infinite slowness never overfacing him retiring him over and over again going for slow clears to give him confidence never exciting him by jumping him against the clock revenge still put in the odd huge buck and had a piece out of fen if hed got out of bed the wrong side but she defended him to the death hes really a kind horse she would explain he always waits when hes bucked you off tory and fen got on well but there were undeniable tensions although she helped out in the stables fen made a lot of extra work at home she was extremely untidy dropping her clothes as she stepped out of them forgetting to bring her washing down spending hours in the bathroom washing her hair gazing at her face in the steaming mirror and leaving the bath filthy and the plughole blocked with hair she was also terribly dreamy and when she wasnt with the horses her nose was always buried in some technical horse book or riding magazine and if there was washingup she always managed to find something to do in the stable tory tried not to resent fen nor to mind her teenage moods nor to feel jealous that jake and she spent so much time together fen adored jake but unlike tory she saw his faults tory spent hours making quiches and chicken pies for jake when he was away at shows which he seldom touched because he got so nervous and which tanya the groom usually finished up so tory wouldnt be hurt jake never laughed at torys jokes seldom reacted often didnt answer she noticed how tory ended so many sentences with isnt it to evoke some sort of response how she never answered jake back jake and fen on the other hand had blazing rows one gray day towards the end of november fen was particularly tired her form mistress had sent her out of the class and the headmistress had come past and shouted at her her period was due any minute her spots were worse than ever and she felt fat and edgy jake was in a picky mood tomorrow he and tanya were off to vienna and amsterdam for two big shows everything had to be packed up and ready it was so mild that tanya had tied revenge up in the yard to wash his tail the dead dry leaves were swirling around his feet she had just finished and fen who had fed all the other horses had revenges feed ready when she suddenly remembered she hadnt added any vitamins or chopped carrot to encourage him to eat putting the bucket down beside sailors door she rushed back to the tackroom and here got sidetracked by the latest copy of riding which had a piece on her hero billy lloydfoxe alas sailor who was on a diet and incurably greedy seeing the bucket promptly unbolted his door having wolfed all revenges feed he was discovered by jake smugly licking his lips jake hit the roof fen he bellowed yes she said nervously coming out of the tackroom with a carrot in one hand and the magazine in the other cant you fucking concentrate for one minute said jake furiously filling your stupid head with dreams of wembley and lining up above rupert campbellblack with the queen telling you what a star you are well youll bloody well never get there unless you pull your head out of the clouds im sorry whats the use of saying sorry sailors just eaten revenges food youre bloody useless fen lost her temper i hate you youre a slave driver dropping riding and the carrot she raced across the yard untying revenges head collar leaping onto his back she clattered across the yard clearing the gate out to the fields thundering across them clearing fence after fence making for the hills come back howled jake that horse is valuable i dont care screamed fen picking up revenge as he stumbled over a rocky piece of ground galloping on and on until shed put four or five miles between herself and the mill house as she passed a cairn of rocks she realized how dark it had got then suddenly like a blanket the mist came down tugging revenge around she retraced her steps she came to a fork in the pathway there was boggy ground to the right she turned left the path turned upwards and upwards it must lead somewhere then she went rigid with horror as she realized they were on the edge of a ravine and had nearly tumbled over she gave a sob of terror as she realized she was totally lost gradually the enormity of her crime hit her revenge didnt even belong to jake he was colonel carters and potentially the best horse in the yard clipped and out in the cold in the middle of winter i dont know what to do she cried flinging her arms round the horses neck shuddering uncontrollably in her thin mistsoaked jersey oh god and rev please help me for a few seconds revenge snatched at the short grass then he sniffed the wind and set off purposefully fen tried to check him terrified of more ravines but he was quite determined they came to marshy ground fen petrified of getting bogged down could feel his hoofs sinking in and hear the sucking sound as he pulled them out she jumped as tall rushes brushed against her legs now he was splashing through a little stream on he plodded avoiding rocks and boulders checking carefully for holes fen tucked her frozen hands in his blond mane clinging to him for warmth letting him carry her he couldnt know the way hed never been that far from home theyd never find it the mist seemed to be clearing she could see trees below and oh god surely that was the same cairn of rocks they were going round in a circle she gave a sob of despair as revenge turned and started picking his way delicately down a steep hill it seemed to go on forever any minute shed fall off him and tumble crashing to the bottom then suddenly the mist seemed to slide away and dimly she could see lights ahead jake back at the mill house was frantic hed been out on one of the novices scouring the countryside for fen shouting calling finding nothing no sound had come back through the thick blanket of fog every time he saw a car snaking along the road he waited for a squeal of brakes and terrible screams he came home again there was no news bloody stupid girl christ why did she do it tory took a deep breath youre too tough with her jakey shes only thirteen no time to be superstitious snarled jake and rode off into the night tory sighed and went back into the house it was nearly nine oclock darklis was crying woken up no doubt by isa who was worried about fen she had just settled them when from the yard she heard africa give her deep whinny all the other horses immediately rushed to their halfdoors peering out at the clouds rolling back on a beautiful starlit night the dry leaves circled and rustled whipped by the wind the horses turned to prowl around in the straw then came back to the door and listened again each knuckering more excitedly suddenly tory heard hoofbeats africa sent out a joyful neigh into the darkness the other horses whinnied snorting and pawing at their doors revenge didnt whinny back his task wasnt over yet five minutes later he walked into the yard tory ran out oh thank god youre home fen burst into tears rev did it he bought me back im so sorry so terribly terribly sorry rushing out of the tackroom tanya caught her as she fell off the horse youre frozen pet there dont cry youre safe rev did it mumbled fen revenge didnt want a heros welcome he stumped past the other horses without a glance making disapproving noises about stupid teenagers who got lost and made him late for supper he smelt of mist sweat and exhaustion and went straight to his box and with a long groan folded up and began to roll his feet shadowboxing the air wheres jake muttered fen through frantically chattering teeth out looking for you go in and have a bath even after a bath she was still cold she put on her nightgown and three jerseys over it looking around her little room the greensprigged laura ashley wallpaper put up especially by tory was already covered in posters of billy lloydfoxe and ludwig von schellenberg the shelves brimmed over with every horse book imaginable and her collapsing pulleinthompson novels every shelf was crowded with china horses which took tory so long to dust on her dressing table was the hedgehog which jake had made her from teasels for her last birthday they had been so good to her and shed kicked them in the teeth jake would be quite right to pack her back to her mother and the colonel she picked up lester her battered teddy bear named after lester piggott cuddling him for comfort her heart sank even further at the sound of horses hoofs on the bridge muffled by the willows jake coming home hed be insane with rage he had a five oclock start in the morning his best horse had been sabotaged looking through a crack in the curtain she saw him slide off the big black gelding hand him to tanya and go into revenges box leading him out he examined his legs making tory walk him up and down fen trembled terrified hed find something wrong but he merely nodded curtly and turned towards the house fen crept away from the curtain next moment she heard him coming up the stairs and the boards creaking outside her room im not going to cry she thought desperately hes bored by tears im so sorry she stammered i should think so he said bleakly of all the bloody irresponsible things to do you could have killed yourself and the horse i didnt think she hung her head time you started cant afford passengers please dont send me back a tear splashed onto her hands if she had looked up she would have seen his face soften it would make her swollenheaded if he told her that the only reason he was so harsh with her was because he knew how good she could be he put a hand on her shoulder its all right no harm done revs okay must like it here after all he came home fen looked up eyes streaming he did he was so clever i was completely lost he brought me home like lassie there was a pause when dyou break up the eighteenth well you can leave two days early and come to olympia with me she gazed at him unbelievingly for a minute she couldnt speak then she flung her arms round jakes neck oh jakey thank you she sobbed i love you so much helen had honestly intended to go to the olympia show she still had some christmas shopping to do shed catch up on a few matinees in the afternoons and spend the evenings watching rupert friends whod gone skiing had lent them a penthouse flat overlooking holland park just a few minutes from olympia she was touched and a little ashamed by ruperts delight that she would be with him it was the first show shed been to for ages shed been so sick with the baby and felt so tired and after a tidal wave of ruperts female fans sent her flying and nearly trampled her to death at the royal international back in july shed decided to give shows a miss rupert had been competing abroad for much of the last five months and during the separations shed been very lonely and spent many restless nights worrying she might miscarry or the baby might be deformed she took her pregnancy very seriously eating the right food resting going religiously to prenatal classes and giving up drink completely so those jolly reunions after billy and rupert came back from successful shows when even helen got mildly tight were things of the past she steeled herself not to mind when rupert was away she missed him but subconsciously she built up other resources she spent a fortune on baby clothes and another fortune on a new nursery suite decorating the babys room daffodil yellow and white and putting in an oven a washing machine a dryer and a small fridge next door with a room for the nanny all done up in laura ashley beyond that she also liked being able to watch all the egghead programs she wanted on television to listen to classical music all the time and not to have to cook huge meals when she was feeling sick then rupert would come home bringing not tenderness but silver cups and suitcases of dirty washing invariably on his return he wanted a sexual marathon and although her gynecologist had reassured her that sex couldnt harm the baby ruperts lovemaking was so vigorous that she was terrified shed miscarry and found herself tensing up and going dry inside she also had the feeling rupert wasnt being supportive enough he flatly refused to go to prenatal classes or be present at the birth its too islington for words he said by way of excuse ive pulled calves ive pulled foals but ill be buggered if ill pull my own baby ive found you the best gynecologist in the country booked you into a private room at gloucester hospital let them get on with it he also laughed his head off when he found her listening to beethoven and vivaldi in order to stimulate mentally the baby in the womb dyou want to give birth to a string quartet throughout november and december hed been away on a successful but punishing round trip to geneva vienna and amsterdam which left only a hectic twentyfour hours at home before setting out for olympia even so rupert found time for sex hed won a polaroid camera as one of his extra prizes at amsterdam and was determined to take photographs of helen in the nude your boobs are so fantastic since you got pregnant helen conscious of her swelling stomach couldnt get into the swing of things at all nor did she like being photographed first thing in the morning without any makeup on its not your face im interested in said rupert laying each photograph on the dressing table so they gradually took on color and shape until he got so turned on he had to make love to her afterwards she came out of the bathroom wrapped in a towel to find a naked rupert joyfully poring over the photographs for goodness sake put them away mrs bodkin might see them she pleaded this ones much the best come and look helen approached cautiously then embarrassment turned to rage as she realized he was admiring not her naked beauty but a photograph of badger lying grinning upside down in his basket now banished to the landing i must show billy said rupert why not take one of mavis too snapped helen she was fed up with those wretched dogs and horses it wasnt a question of playing second fiddle she wasnt even in the orchestra later rupert and billy had a session with their secretary miss hawkins catching up on the mail and checking that entry forms had been sent off for the next few months when helen came down with some washing she found the dark blue diary for the next year on the kitchen table they must have been working out the first six months show dates fondly she turned to march the most important entry of all the expected date for the birth of the baby but instead to her fury she found antwerp dortmund milan scrawled across the first eighteen days in march with red marker arrows stretching from page to page indicating they wouldnt be returning to england between shows helen couldnt believe it rupert intended to be away for the most momentous event of his life she stormed into the drawing room where rupert was pouring himself and billy prelunch drinks billy will you please leave the room she said in a dangerously quiet voice i want to speak with rupert yes sir certainly sir said billy grinning and making himself scarce what on earths the matter asked rupert not sulking about badgers picture are you dyou want a drink you know i havent touched liquor since i became pregnant id like to know the meaning of this she flung the diary at rupert look at march rupert opened it well oh im sorry to be away three weeks on the trot but theyre all good shows and ill be home a lot in january and february havent you any idea what else is happening in march rupert look blank cant think our baby is to be born rupert grinned in dismay oh christ angel im frightfully sorry it completely slipped my mind dont worry i can hop on a plane the minute you go into labor or if you really think itll arrive on the seventh he glanced at the diary i could fly out late to antwerp they dont have the big prize money there till the third day helen for the first time since they were married went berserk screaming abuse at rupert her red hair flying like a maenad her face scarlet rupert looked at her in amazement are you sure you havent been drinking the next minute she was hurling ornaments at him the altered augustus john went flying through the air and hit the wall with a splintering crash then she started on the bookshelf burkes landed gentry nearly landed on target followed by ruffs guide to the turf followed by bound volumes of paradise lost and dantes inferno gibbons decline and fall fell at ruperts feet rupert laughing and dodging out of the way like a boxer annoyed her even more as the top shelf was emptied there was a knock on the door it was mrs bodkin in her hat and coat quivering with curiosity was there anything else yes said helen bring me a jug of orange juice please two minutes later mrs bodkin puffed in with the jug and two glasses on a tray thank you thatll be all mrs b see you tomorrow said helen firmly shutting the door on her then picking up the jug of orange juice she hurled it in ruperts face and collapsed sobbing on the sofa nothing rupert could say would placate her if he wasnt going to be with her when the baby was born she wasnt coming to his bloody show she still refused to speak to him when he and billy set off to london that afternoon rupert whod always believed that a room full of roses and a gold bracelet could placate any woman was slightly surprised olympia the last show before christmas always has an endofterm atmosphere most of the riders have a break afterwards until the middle of january all the glamour of the sport is concentrated and enhanced by an indoor show the collecting ring stewards and the stable manager in charge of the one hundred and fifty loose boxes have increasing difficulty keeping highspirited riders in order as the excitement mounts practical jokes and parties go on all week neither billy nor rupert however were in a particularly festive mood as their lorry rolled into the horsebox park on the eve of the first day billy was fretting because he suspected lavinia greenslade had transferred her affections to a handsome french count named guy de la tour rupert was still smarting over helens intransigence christmas shopping traffic jams were driving him wild fuck the plebs fuck the plebs he screamed leaning on his horn billy was further depressed to see a huge lorry carelessly parked like an acute accent with guy de la tour republique française in huge letters across one side lets go and get drunk said billy ruperts temper was not improved the following day when they walked past the exercise ring and saw fen lunging revenge nice horse said billy although revenge had been transformed into a picture of hard muscle health and wellbeing over the past six months he was still unmistakable with his strange zigzagging blaze and his two long white socks for a second they paused to watch him dont recognize the groom said billy i say darling shouted rupert fen swung round turning crimson she couldnt believe they were talking to her whats the name of that horse revenge who does he belong to jake lovell shit thats where hes ended up said rupert the little bastard pulled a fast one on me i wonder who tipped him off dear god prayed fen fervently make my spots go give me some decent boobs and dont let me fancy rupert campbellblack at the beginning of the week the collecting ring gossip was all of the two italian horses who had escaped and had a lovely time galloping up and down the main road now it had switched to guy de la tours romance with lavinia and to jake lovells new horse every time revenge came into the arena afternoon or evening people rushed to the ringside to have a look at the beginning of the show the lights and the crowds had upset him and he went around stargazing and leaping two foot above the jumps like a ginger hairylegged spider after fortyeight hours he settled down there had been a bad moment however on the second day jake put his foot in the stirrup and revenge put in a hell of a buck landing jake on top of a steaming pile of dung found your own level lovell jeered rupert as he rode past jakes reply was suitably obscene it took all fens tact to calm him down ill soak your breeches in bleach she said soothingly all the stainsll come out nor were the fates being kind to billy just when he was trying to woo lavinia back a local barber gave him a hideous fartooshort haircut i got so engrossed in playboy i forgot to watch him moaned billy afterwards even worse billy turned the bull too fast into the combination on the second night forcing him to put in a stop billy sailed over his head landing on a pole and knocking out his two front teeth which further damaged his beauty there wasnt time to have them capped hed have to wait until after christmas with no sign of helen ruperts eye started to rove every day there were novelty events the army did a display of tentpegging lady clowns did dressage the pony club put on a demonstration of snow white and the seven dwarfs first amused by the fact that snow whites horse had diarrhea ruperts eye then fell on a ravishing girl playing grumpy named tiffany bathgate during the week hed bought her drinks and chatted her up he even bought her a gold watch from the garrards stand as a christmas present which she permanently showed off on her wrist like a dog holding out a sore paw by the final night fen was absolutely knackered she hardly had the energy to wash her hair for the party that night living on junk food all week her spots were worse than ever she longed and longed to be a rider or at least one of the elite bunch of grooms who all knew each other swapped endless gossip and who had found time to go shopping and come back with pretty clothes from biba and bus stop she admired from afar the handsome guy de la tour he who had so captivated lavinia love had made lavinia prettier than ever she had cut off her long bubble curls and now with her hair as short as a boys looked the epitome of french chic already half the showjumping groupies who hung around the place in breeches hoping someone might mistake them for a competitor had followed suit and lopped off their long rippling manes as well fen also noticed billy looking absolutely miserable she felt so sorry for him although he had cheered up a bit earlier that evening when he and rupert won the fancy dress relay billy with a pipe in his mouth and a gannex mac had dressed up as harold wilson while rupert cavorted around in high heels a red dress and a blond wig with orange peel in his teeth as marcia falkender it had brought the house down now all the grooms were getting their charges ready for the last event the radio rentals grand prix fen with both sailor and revenge to do had her work cut out cries of give me the body brush anyone seen my sponge christ theyre calling us already were coming from all sides in the bleak midwinter frosty wind made moan sang the loudspeaker now the band was playing hiho hiho for the pony club demo rupert and billy sat side by side in the riders stand their long legs up on the backs of the seats in front watching grumpy isnt she gorgeous said rupert smugly shes coming out with me tonight how old is she asked billy sixteen or so she claims shouldnt be playing grumpy shes grinning like a cheshire cat said billy as tiffany bathgate cantered by ponytail swinging ill report her to the district commissioner shes bringing dopey with her said rupert meeting me at the flat just imagine having the two of them you ought to be ashamed of yourself snapped billy why dont you come too im going to the party afterwards i must talk to lavinia shes been avoiding me all week her parents are wild about guy because hes a count a cunt said rupert that too said billy i wonder if greenslade père realizes guy hasnt a bean said rupert he needs the greenslade cash to keep his place going in france i cannot afford to eat the underrooms he told me last night do you think i should give helen an english setter puppy for christmas no said billy snow white and her entourage cantered out of the ring with grumpy blatantly grinning at rupert as the arena party put the finishing touches to the jumps for the grand prix now the rose red curtains which parted theatrically to admit each competitor were clashing with the scarlet coats of the riders as they walked the course to a jazzedup version of oh come all ye faithful the collecting ring was very hazardous belgians crashed their horses over the jumps crying numero huit numero sept to their grooms and discussing where they were going for dinner rupert was having a row with an irish rider nicknamed wishbone because of his long bow legs because they had both tried to jump the upright at the same time fen walked her two horses around the outside keeping out of trouble sailor calming revenge who looked as beautiful as sailor looked ugly fen was still shaking from her first encounter with her mother and colonel carter since she left home as owners theyd come to the show to watch revenge molly had been absolutely livid with bernard when she discovered hed spent on a horse for jake behind her back shed denied him her bed for more than a month but gradually she was beginning to appreciate the kudos of being a winning owner everyone was tipping revenge as an olympic probable molly was already planning her wardrobe for the next games in colombia the following august she enjoyed sitting in the riders stand and talking about my horse in a loud voice molly was also very relieved that fen appeared to have totally lost her looks certainly it had been jakes show africa sailor and revenge had all won big classes you couldnt get into the lorry for silver cups sailor grew in popularity the crowd were wild about the old mule with his mangy tail and his drooping head who caught fire in the ring whenever he left the lorry now jake was mobbed by autograph hunters and fen told him someone had written i love jake lovell on the wall of the ladies and underneath lots of people had written me too joanna battie had interviewed jake for the chronicle gushing over his romantic gypsy looks jake pretended to disapprove but secretly he was delighted and had reread the piece several times he had even been interviewed by dudley diplock as he came out of the ring the fact that he hardly got a word out didnt seem to matter he smiled and when jake smiled publicly which was about once every five years the world melted the bell rang the riders left the arena in the distance you could still hear the mournful cry of the men on the gate trying to flog programs to lastminute arrivals the arena was flooded with light for the television cameras as rupert mounted belgravia he spat out his chewing gum i want it said a besotted teenager rushing forward a deafening cheer lifted the roof off as rupert rode into the ring i cant help it thought fen hes vile but he is attractive rupert jumped an untroubled clear and rode out as ivor braine rode in the collecting ring steward who had a headache from drinking too much at lunchtime was shouting at late arrivals im going to report rupert campbellblack to the bsja for calling me a fart he grumbled and youre late too he said to humpty who was supposed to be jumping next get out of my way then you little fart said humpty youre a worse nagger than my wife humpty also went clear billy waiting to jump felt near to suicide lavinia was still avoiding him now count guy was in the collecting ring crashing over the practice fence pretending not to understand the collecting ring steward who was now castigating him for being late that man is a preek he drawled to lavinia as he rode towards the rose red curtains bonne chance my angel said lavinia blowing him a kiss count guys dark brown stallion however took a dislike to the curtains and shied into a group of officials in pinstripe suits dislodging for a moment the complacency of their smooth flushed faces as they scuttled for cover then with a flurry of gallic expletives guy rode into the arena and proceeded to lay waste the course oh bad luck darling said lavinia as he came out shrugging dramatically reins dropped palms of both hands turned to heaven fucking frog muttered billy as he passed him on the way in but he was so upset he jumped badly and notched up twelve faults ive got a splinter grumbled marion ignoring her rupert went back to the riders stand to watch the rest of the rounds as he listened to a group of german riders chattering behind him his thoughts contentedly drifted towards tiffany bathgate who with her dumpy friend would at this moment be washing themselves as well as they could in the olympia showers for him there were two bottles of champagne in the flat fridge perhaps he should offer them a proper bath when they arrived goodness knows where that might lead the next moment the two girls were forgotten as jake and revenge came in jumping unevenly but very impressively revenge was fooling around between fences but when he jumped he really tucked his legs up i want that horse thought rupert grimly hes got everything i like brains temperament good looks he was suddenly aware that the woman on his right was making a lot of noise do you remember me she said turning to rupert i never forget a face like yours but im terrible at names said rupert it was his standard reply im molly carter maxwell that was tory my daughter was doing the season in you were such a debs delight all the mums were in love with you too tory of course i remember very shy treated every man as if he was going to chuck snowballs with stones in at her she married jake lovell you know it was a bit of a shock at the time but hes done awfully well helped by torys money of course said rupert oh of course hed never have made the grade without her she gave a little laugh and my husbands been helping him out recently really said rupert his brain beginning to tick revenge is our horse not by a flicker of a muscle did rupert betray how interested he was your horse jake was short of cash last june and desperate to buy revenge in a hurry some other buyer was after him so bernard put up the money i was livid at the time but he seems rather a good investment won twice as much as he cost already jake is rather maddening though yes under ruperts blue gaze molly was becoming indiscreet he could have won a lot more but jake keeps retiring the horse because he doesnt want to push him feels hes not ready to jump against the clock rubbish said rupert when a horse is as good as that youve got to press on really said molly oh do look the princess has arrived i love her dress everyone stood up with the usual clattering of seats the band played the national anthem round followed round but only ludwig and jake on sailor jumped clear helens having a baby in march said rupert getting to his feet so were not going out much but we must all have dinner sometime that would be lovely said molly giving him their telephone number bernard usually goes to london on wednesday morning to see his stockbrokers but im always there ill remember that said rupert pointedly molly smirked to herself as he walked down the steps shed always thought rupert was most attractive nice that she hadnt lost her touch six riders had to jump off jake took one look at the course for an indoor arena with limited space it was enormous ending up with an upright of five feet eight inches im not jumping revenge he said to colonel carter dont be bloody silly man theres at stake i dont care its too much to ask an inexperienced horse he jumped a beautiful round earlier lets leave it at that the colonel looked thunderous only tell how good he is if you have a go hes had a tough week mollys face was twitching i think youre being very foolish jake ive just been talking to rupert campbellblack bernard and he said hed certainly jump revenge against the clock all the more reason for me not to snapped jake quite right said fen crossly hes a young horse set him back months if he lost his confidence really fenella said molly no one asked your opinion rupert rode past on the way into the arena stupid pratt he thought listening for a second to the splendid row that bloody little man whispered molly to rupert hes absolutely refusing to jump him rupert shrugged well you know what i feel hell be sixth anyway said jake thats i said id train him my way youll have to lump it rupert rattled everyone by setting a virtually unbeatable time of seconds such a good rider said molly to colonel carter and lowering her voice youve no idea what sense he talked no one could beat ruperts time ludwig was a second slower lavinia had a fence down humpty couldnt catch him nor could hans schmidt i think thats in the bag said rupert to billy i might even take the girls to annabels jake felt sick looking at the six jumps he wondered how the hell he could beat ruperts time then when he came to the rustic poles where everyone else had gone round the wall he cut in from the other side jumping the fence sideways as he turned the crowd gave a shout and suddenly aware of a knifeedge finish bellowed him home he cleared the last fence and looked at the clock hed done it a fifth of a second faster than rupert he hugged sailor who gave three huge bucks nearly unseating him the crowd went mad well done my friend said ludwig clouting jake on the back it was his biggest win yet everyone except rupert molly and colonel carter surged forward to congratulate him the arena was now pitted with holes like a beach after a hot bank holiday several women in fur capes and ball dresses carrying rosettes and the huge silver cup walked out tiptoeing to avoid any droppings as the winners came in jake riding sailor and leading revenge the princess smiled and said shed been following sailors career and she was sorry she hadnt got any polos and hadnt revenge jumped well jake felt very happy back in the collecting ring the yuletide spirit was relentlessly reasserting itself two welsh cobs were being harnessed to a sleigh which was being loaded up with christmas trees by a man in a red coat helens old admirer monica carlton in a tricorn hat and a frockcoat was putting on a false mustache the band played all the nice girls love a sailor as sailor cantered the lap of honor under the spotlight as proud as a butler with the family silver jake went deliberately slowly knowing that rupert would have difficulty holding belgravia for christs sake get a move on snarled rupert cannoning into him its all very well thought the colonel darkly jake gets plus out of that i get a measly rupert came out of the ring looking at his watch tiffany bathgate would be at the flat in half an hour hed better step on it then he glanced across the collecting ring and his blood froze for picking her way towards him very pale but unspeakably beautiful a fur coat hiding any trace of pregnancy was helen as usual she made everyone else look commonplace rupert was off belgravia in a second handing him to marion taking helen in his arms darling im so sorry it was all my fault she said no it was mine said rupert holding her against him his brain racing looking down he saw how the fox fur coat set off the red hair and the huge eyes that were already filling with tears i missed you so much she said i nearly went to the apartment and waited for you as a surprise rupert felt dizzy with horror that would have been a fine welcome for tiffany bathgate and dopey what would you like to do said rupert his ingenuity working overtime theres a party if youre not too tired then we could have some supper anything to keep her away from the flat until the coast was clear im a bit tired but i dont want to be a party pooper ill just go and see what billys plans are said rupert have a word with malise and heres humpty and ivor i wont be a second hello stranger said humpty kissing her and as they all gathered round to welcome her she suddenly realized how nice they were and how wrong shed been to build them up as obsessed insensitive monsters rupert went over to billy who had just bought himself a treble whisky from the bar helens arrived i saw fine mess youve got yourself into i dont know why youre looking so cheerful i love my wife said rupert blandly look you must go and wait at the flat and divert those schoolgirls take them out to dinner explain that helens turned up why the fuck should i i must talk to lavinia the partyll go on for hours shell be much more receptive after a few drinks look ill pay but i promised tiffany a night out and in so be a love and give them a whirl and tell tiffany to keep herself on ice for the next time billy looked mutinous you dont want to ruin my marriage pleaded rupert you cant upset helen at this stage she oughtnt to be under any stress with the baby coming billy sighed okay ill intercept them then take them straight back to wherever they are staying and come on to the party billy was knocked sideways by the smell of warm scented flesh newly washed hair and radiantly expectant youth the two girls were bitterly disappointed and also well below the age of consent tiffany slipped up later by saying she would be doing her o levels in two years time in the end billy was too kind to dump them he gave them a slapup dinner with lots of champagne most of which he drank himself and when he saw tiffany dolefully looking at her gold watch said it wasnt an excuse honest helen really did turn up you will give him my phone number wont you she said back at olympia lights had been turned out in the stables horses dozed in their loose boxes an egalitarian christmas drunk was running up and down pinching hay out of belgravias hay net and distributing it among horses that hadnt got any the party was soon well under way this year humpty was acting as host everyone turned up at his caravan with bottles predictably driffield arrived with a bottle of airwick thought you needed it humpty said driffield splashing whisky into his glass place smells like a wrestlers armpit heavy drinking stepped up the high jinks for his officious behavior during the week the collecting ring steward was dumped in the water trough later a pretty waitress from the olympia bar well primed by the rest of the british and german teams asked humpty if she could actually meet porky boy shed heard he liked maltesers and shed specially bought some only too happy to show off his favorite asset a blushing humpty led her off to porky boys box followed at a safe distance by the other riders the waitress looked into the box first oh dear she said turning to humpty he seems to have shrunk rushing forward to defend his beloved humpty discovered to his horror that instead of porky boy one of the gray shetland ponies that had pulled snow whites wedding coach was calmly guzzling porky boys hay for a second humpty was speechless dear me said rupert looking over the halfdoor poor old porky you havent put him in the washing machine have you im sure his label said hand wash you have been geeving heem too streect a diet my friend said ludwig e as faded away perhaps porkys been using ponds vanishing cweam said lavinia everyone screamed with laughter humpty exploded whos stolen porky boy he bellowed someones stolen my horse dont you all laugh at me im going to call the police he was just dialing in the nearest telephone box when suddenly porky boy emerged from behind a bank of wilting poinsettias looking very put out at being deprived of his supper and proceeded to rush back to humpty straight through the stand of some enraged british field sports ladies who were putting green rubber trousers into cardboard boxes humpty then jumped on porky boy and chased rupert ludwig and hans round the stands and into the arena ivor braine was happily getting drunk with wishbone the sandyhaired irishman get it down lad itll do thee good ivor was saying as he filled up the irishmans glass dudley diplock was grumbling to malise about the fact that they no longer televised the presentation of the prizes its what the public likes to see but malise wasnt listening he was looking at helen campbellblack who was being pinned against a pile of straw bales by monica carlton who was still wearing her mustache and tricorn hat excuse me said malise and went over to rescue her oh shove off malise said monica i get little enough chance to talk to this exquisite creature so do i said malise she looks ill he thought and supposed it was the tired last months of pregnancy fortunately monica soon got sidetracked by the pretty waitress are you okay malise asked helen slightly lowering his voice fine she said brightly i like to take a fatherly interest in the wives of my team he said in what he knew was an unnaturally hearty voice i wish rupert would take a fatherly interest in our baby said helen bitterly its probably jealousy said malise and apprehension he sees the looming challenge to his own identity and privacy i know i felt the same but i became positively doting once they arrived i sure hope so sighed helen they watched lavinia and count guy arm in arm working their way through the crowd towards them like lavinias new barnet asked monica carlton twirling her mustache pity shes chucking herself away on that frog i didnt know said helen startled is it serious i think so said malise oh poor billy said helen in distress i dont think lavinia would have been quite right for him but then i dont think anyone would be special enough for billy might just be the making of him said malise hes too soft too protected by your husband drinks too much too were just going lavinia said to helen adding fondly guy doesnt like parties over here because he hates not being able to talk fwench but i just wanted to intwoduce him ah la belle hélène said the handsome count softly he took helens hand pressed it to his lips then gazed into her eyes everyone speaks of your great beauty but none did you the justice now i understand why rupert keep you hidden away whens your baby due said lavinia rather pointedly and when helen told them guy not appearing to mind in the least not talking french proceeded to express amazement that helen was still so slim and launched into a long dissertation on what she ought to eat and how his aunt hortense had just had her sixth child and how he hoped helen would come and stay in his château when the next paris show was on must go and have a word with jake lovell said malise i thought you wanted to aller guy said lavinia petulantly were getting married she told helen oh im so pleased for you both come on darling said lavinia dragging the reluctant guy away helen wished she could go too she was feeling absolutely shattered nearby wishbone was trying to sell humpty an irish horse but whos he by humpty kept saying ah said wishbone smiling engagingly who would you like him to be by malise found jake in a corner talking to hans and ludwig beside them fen had fallen asleep on a hay bale thats a very good horse of yours jake said malise vitch von said hans schmidt zay are both top hole revenge said malise you ought to be thinking of him in terms of the next olympics not enough mileage said jake flatly i disagree i saw that horse when he was carting annie buscott all over the place the improvements been remarkable jake blushed slightly olympics arent till september said malise what about sailor said jake quickly great nations cup horse not sure if hes olympic stature no dont look bootfaced i know how you feel about sailor but his wind isnt that good and in a highaltitude country like colombia he wont be very happy africas a great horse too but i notice she likes soft going more and more these days i only discovered this evening that revenge is owned by your fatherinlaw taking my horses name in vain said colonel carter whod been eavesdropping think hes got olympic potential well i certainly wouldnt rule him out what are you going to do with him now colonel carter asked jake hed had enough to drink to become bullying turn him out for a couple of months he needs a break well dont leave him out too long said malise he needs the experience but i congratulate you jake hes a credit to you sos she he looked down at the sleeping fen been watching her in the practice ring living with you full time now is she jake nodded shell be knocking on the front door herself in a few years time said malise jake made sure fen was asleep then said shes a little cracker the party dragged on wishbone and ivor were singing danny boy when billy finally arrived at two in the morning rupert buttonholed him immediately everything okay fine said billy ive delivered them safely back you can go home now he helped himself to the last four fingers of whisky with a trembling hand how was little tiffany asked rupert upset but not nearly as much as me ive just seen lavinia necking in the street with guy de la tour shes certainly out for the count so will you be if you keep on drinking helen and i are off come with us did lavinia say anything said billy rupert looked at him straight yes im afraid she said she and guy are getting married look im sorry but you can do better than her as billy was leaving he bumped into malise seeing billys face malise said why dont you come back to my flat for a cup of coffee terribly kind but i think id rather be by myself are you sure where are you going dont know really bit of a shock i was going to ask her to marry me you see when this guy suddenly turns up he was very drunk but despite the awful haircut and the missing front teeth he had a stricken dignity tenners were falling out of his overcoat pockets malise gathered them up my fancy dress winnings explained billy ill look after them for you said malise come on where are you staying addison gardens with rupert as they passed the mens lavatory they could hear ivor supervising wishbone being sick get it oop lad get it oop its all right as long as tha knows the way its going ill walk you up there please id rather be alone said billy all right said malise look lavinias a nice girl and i cant imagine she and guy will last very long if thats any comfort to you but i honestly think you can do much better than that as helen said earlier youre special billy shook his head i loved her but i suppose theyd have been frightful inlaws good night it was bitterly cold outside programs crisp packets streamers old number cards and wisps of straw were whipped round his feet by the icy wind in the bleak midwinter billy sang frosty wind made moan his voice broke and tears poured down his cheeks as he set out unsteadily in the direction of addison gardens back at the mill house good as his word jake turned his horses out for a rest it pleased him to see them really enjoying their grass even revenge dropped his belly like an old hunter in february a program was announced for olympic possibles the riders mustnt overjump their horses and they must take part in the olympic trials at the bath and wells show and crittleden in june the probable team would then be chosen for a trial over the huge demanding fences at the aachen show in germany in july after which the olympic team four riders and a reserve would finally be selected officially the olympic committee told jake they were interested in both sailor and revenge unofficially malise rang jake and asked him if in the event of one of the other riders say rupert being selected without a decent horse would jake be prepared to jump sailor and lend revenge to rupert the answer was an extremely curt negative if revenge made sufficient progress to be selected over jakes dead body would he let anyone else ride him particularly rupert malise appreciated his sentiments and reported back to the olympic committee who felt somewhat differently colonel roxborough the chairman master of the westerham a bronze medalist before the war whod never moved an inch to get any of his five wives was not the only member who felt jake was behaving in a thoroughly unsportsmanlike fashion after all belgravia and mayfair whod both been overjumped were not as good as they used to be and macaulay after a dazzling start had suddenly lost form altogether the committee were heartened however by billy lloydfoxe at last hitting top form trying to forget lavinia avoiding parties where he might bump into her and cutting down on his drinking he had concentrated on his horses with dramatic results the bull and often kitchener were in the money at every show they went to and both were regarded as olympic possibles among the other possibles were humpty driffield ivor braine and lavinia de la tour who had married guy in march billy managed to be abroad for the wedding but sent them a kingsize duvet as a wedding present adding a wry little private note for lavinia if i cant spend the rest of my life lying on top of you at least my present can as a newlywed no doubt subjected to endless demands by guy lavinia lost form it was agony for billy to see her with guy on the circuit but he found his heart didnt ache quite so much if he was beating the hell out of both of them in march while rupert was driving from dortmund to vienna helen went into labor as his lorry was snowbound on a mountain road no one managed to contact him for thirtysix hours flying straight back to gloucestershire he found that helen had nearly died after a long and very difficult birth and that the baby was in the intensive care unit seeing her paler than her white pillow her red hair dark with sweat and grease rupert was overwhelmed with remorse how could he have done this to her i guess nanny was right about good childbearing hips im sorry darling he said taking her hand not by a single word did she reproach him but he saw the hurt in her huge eyes and knew that his absence would be held against him later as he sat with her in her private room various doctors came and talked to him and nurses popped in to have a gaze actually the sister in charge was frightfully pretty but after three hours rupert was rigid with boredom and turned on the television it was benny hill who always made him laugh but when he looked around and saw helen was crying he turned it off he was delighted to have a son particularly after his smooth and expensive gp friend dr benson had turned up and assured him that both child and mother should pull through but i really think you should stick around for a bit rupe shes had an awful time and constantly called out for you i appreciate your advice said rupert coolly you can do better than that said benson equally coolly you can act on it unless you want helen to wind up in a bin rupert rang billy and told him he wouldnt be coming to vienna and would he bring back ruperts horses whats the baby like asked billy got red hair so we know its helen then rupert sat down and wrote letters putting baby marcus rupert edward down for st augustines and harrow looking at the tiny baby with his sickly face like a howling lemon and the brackenred stubble of hair it seemed impossible that he would ever attain such heights in the evening rupert went home to penscombe and slept for fourteen hours but after that scrupulously visited helen every day she seemed pathetically grateful for the attention but was distressed that she was unable to breastfeed what the hell does it matter asked rupert how do you think cow and gate became millionaires i thought you wanted your figure back he was further irritated that helen had struck up a friendship with another mother called hilary stirling in her early thirties hilary denied her unquestionable good looks by wearing no makeup and scraping her dark hair into a bun a passionate supporter of the womens movement a braless undeodorized vegetarian with unshaven legs and armpits she had just had her second baby kate named after kate millett by natural childbirtha wonderfully moving experience she told helen hilarys husband crispin who appeared to do everything in the house cook clean and look after germaine their first child had been present at the birth he was very earnest with long thinning hair and a straggly beard and came to visit hilary in hospital with germaine now age eleven months hanging from his neck in a baby sling helen thought him extraordinarily unattractive but at least unlike rupert he had been caring and supportive it suddenly seemed to rupert that every time he rolled up to see helen bringing bottles of champagne gulls eggs smoked salmon and armfuls of spring flowers from the garden that hilary was sitting on helens bed breastfeeding her disgusting baby and flashing her goaty armpits admittedly she was ultrapolite its so kind of helen to let me take refuge in her private room although we personally wouldnt dream of using anything else but the nhs admittedly she immediately made herself scarce despite helens protestations ill leave you dear you see little enough of rupert alone as it is ill come back after hes gone but every word was spat out with contempt helen thought she was wonderful shes a very talented painter look at this little sketch she did of me this morning looks as if youve been peeling onions oh rupert dont be silly shes real clever too got several degrees and every one below zero snapped rupert in between visiting helen he had not been idle he worked the novices and kept up his search for an olympic horse which included dining with colonel carter and even forcing himself to flirt with the appalling molly after a fortnight helen was allowed home and baby marcus was installed in ruperts old cradle newly upholstered in white frills in his beautiful buttercup yellow nursery next to rupert and helens bedroom with ruperts old nanny who had already settled in to look after him sleeping in the room on the other side rupert thought this was insane how can billy and i wander around with no clothes on if nannys two doors down billy might easily come home plastered and wander into her room by mistake the baby ought to be on the top floor with nanny like adrian and i were but id never see him protested helen i want him near me you cant expect poor nanny to stagger along the passage and down two flights of stairs every time he cries helen grew stronger physically but sank into postnatal depression she had ears on elastic every time a lamb bleated out in the fields she thought it was marcus crying and raced upstairs rupert had the lambs and ewes moved to another field out of earshot but helen was still impossibly jumpy rupert was hustling her to sleep with him again and was furious when egged on by hilary she refused a power struggle too was developing between her and nanny if marcus cried in the night often they hit headon over the cradle like shiny red billiard balls nanny insisted on putting marcus in long white dresses and refused to have anything to do with disposable nappies she also wanted a strict routine you had to show the baby early on who was master helen again egged on by hilary and mrs bodkin believed that babies should be fed on demand and cuddled a lot if they couldnt sleep you took them into bed with you whereupon nanny launched into horrific tales about ladyships in the past whod done the same thing and suffocated their babies one day when rupert was away marcus wouldnt stop crying his frame wracked his little lungs bawling the house down how could such a tiny thing make so much noise leave him hell exhaust himself insisted nanny helen terrified of losing marcus and utterly fed up with this whiskery old boot hanging over him and calling all the shots summoned the doctor dr benson who was more than a little in love with helen was delighted to confirm her fears babys hungry needs more food afterwards there was a standup row and nanny packed her bags terrified of ruperts wrath helen rang up hilary who offered only praise best thing youve ever done dont let that mcp talk you around later rupert walked into the nursery to find helen changing a nappy and with a look of horror walked out again really he was the most unrolereversed guy with a hand that trembled slightly she powdered marcus and rather clumsily put the disposable nappy inside the harrington square she fastened the two blue safety pins tucked him into his cradle and gave him a kiss with a gurgle of contentment he fell asleep immediately obviously not missing nanny rupert was waiting outside why the hell are you doing that is it nannys afternoon off helen took a deep breath i gave her notice this morning you what thundered rupert where is she gone you sacked nanny without asking me its nothing to do with you said helen losing her temper youre never here never take any interest in marcus balls i havent been away from home for more than a night since you had him youve only been back three weeks screamed helen going into her bedroom you turned her out just like that shes out of date she was my nanny and my fathers before that were healthy enough cant be much wrong with her why dont you put her in the antiques fair then im not having her upsetting mrs bodkin and anyway hilary figures for successful parenting dont you quote that bloody dyke at me successful parenting my arse and whos going to look after the baby now hes called marcus right and i am most mothers do look after their kids you know i dont want marcus growing up caring more for nanny than me like you did and how dyou intend to get away its crittleden next week rome the week after tory lovell takes her baby with her christ you should see it caravan festooned with nappies tory shoving distilled suede boot into some bawling infant who spits it all out then bawls all night keeping every other rider awake well ill stop at home then sobbed helen suddenly from next door there was a wail go and see to him snapped rupert now arent you sorry you sacked nanny fortunately billy chose that moment to arrive back from vienna trailing rosettes bringing ruperts horses and panting to see the new baby so the row was temporarily smoothed over what a little duck he said taking a yelling marcus from helen isnt he sweet look at his little hands no shush shush sweetheart thats no way to carry on youll upset your mummy amazingly the next minute marcus shut up gazing unfocused at billy enjoying the warmth and gentle strength isnt he a duck he said again youd better take over as nanny said rupert with a slight edge in his voice then we wont have to fork out for an ad in the lady helen thought for the millionth time how glad she was billy hadnt married lavinia greenslade he was such a comfort you will be godfather wont you she said billy blushed of course although im not sure ill be able to point him in a very christian direction who else have you asked only my new friend hilary so far said helen shooting a defiant glance at rupert i cant wait to have you two meet ill know youll enjoy her every night for the next week they were woken continually by marcus crying driving rupert to frenzies of irritation thats my nights sleep gone he would complain then drift off to sleep two minutes later helen would get up feed marcus soothe him to sleep and lie awake for the rest of the night in april billy and rupert set off for crittleden leaving helen and marcus alone in the big house except for one of the girl grooms whom rupert had insisted sleep in resentful of rupert helen poured all her love into the delicate little boy thank goodness hilary lived only a few miles away so they spent alternate days together discussing books plays paintings their babies and inevitably rupert jake lovell was having his best year yet his horses couldnt stop winning revenge brought in from grass fat mellow and almost unrecognizable was now fit and well muscled again even jake realized his olympic potential but in four years time tory and fen however were wildly excited when a form arrived for jake asking him to fill in his measurements for an olympic uniform which included a blazer and trousers for the flight and the opening ceremony aware that forms had been sent to all the other possibles jake had no intention of tempting providence by returning the form until his selection had been confirmed after aachen he was appalled when he discovered that tory with her usual efficiency had filled in the form and posted it despite this tempting of providence the first olympic trial at the bath and wells show went well both sailor and revenge jumped accurately and were only beaten by seventeenhundredths of a second against the clock by the bull humpty was fourth driffield fifth ivor braine sixth rupert a poor seventh not even getting into the jumpoff the rest were nowhere before the second trial in june at crittleden jake was a good deal more edgy colonel carter was never off the telephone throwing his weight around trying to organize revenges career until jake lost his temper and told the colonel to get stuffed more sinister jake noticed an unfamiliar misselthrush singing in the willow tree nearest the stables the day before they were due to leave for crittleden jake chased it away but it came back and went on singing when he lived with the gypsies a misselthrush had sung all day outside the caravan of the old gypsy grandmother one day she was in rude health the next she had died jake believed in omens all day he worried about the children isa and little darklis who at thirteen months had grown into the most enchanting blackhaired blackeyed gypsy girl the apple of jakes eye he even went and fetched isa from the playgroup himself he didnt tell tory of his fears they had decided not to bring the children to crittleden as jake and fen needed a good nights sleep before the trial and children around might be distracting are you sure you dont mind not coming jake asked tory i can watch you on television she said anyway id be so nervous for you id wind you up i know youre going to make it jake hated leaving them all whenever would he get over this crippling homesickness every time he went away as they left on the hundredandfiftymile drive it was pouring with rain and the misselthrush was still singing it was even wetter and colder at crittleden jake and fen spent a lot of time blocking up holes in the horses stables on the way to the secretarys tent to declare for the next day jake bumped into marion fuming as usual with rupert hes only got mayfair in the running now he used the tack rail on belgravia so much one of his legs went septic so hes off for a fortnight ruperts talking of using electrodes on mayfair the horse is a bundle of nerves and macaulay said jake sold on to an arab sheik rupe met playing chemmy at the claremont so hes off to some middle east hellhole poor sod you know what that means yes said jake bleakly hell cart the sheiks son and heir once too often and end up in the stone quarries can you get me the address marion said shed try but rupert had been very cagey about this deal because helen who was in an uptight state might be upset if she found out the horse had gone not that shes showing any interest in anything except marcus at the moment jake shook his head why dyou stay with rupert marion shrugged i guess im hooked on the bastard and at least i can make the lot of his horses a little easier all the next day the rain poured down like a waterfall the riders put up the collars of their mackintosh coats and shivered as he finished walking the course jake was accosted by a reporter from the local evening paper this is the toughest course ever built at crittleden jake anything to say jake kept walking im sorry i cant talk to you before a class but ive got a deadline wailed the reporter arrogant sod he added furiously but jake didnt hear and when he passed humpty and driffield he barely nodded trying to cocoon himself to get a grip on his nerves he found fen holding revenge and sailor three drowned rats sailor who loathed the cold looked more miserable and hideous than ever you okay he asked fen she nodded whats the course like not okay said jake dead and holding itll put five inches on all the fences smug in the covered stands after a good lunch the olympic committee smoked their cigars and waited jake who had a latish draw watched one rider after another come to grief which did his nerves no good he noticed that the dye of his cheap red coat was running into his breeches if he survived this ordeal hed bloody well buy himself a mackintosh coat only porky boy and the bull went clear revenge went in at number twenty and despite having to carry two stone of lead because jake was so light he jumped strongly and confidently with only a toe in the water for four faults jake felt passionate relief that he wouldnt have to jump again but in one of the boxes from which colonel carter would not emerge because molly didnt want her newly set hair rained on jake could see them both looking disappointed rupert went in next jumping a very haphazard clear and came out looking none too pleased he was followed by driffield who despite olympiclevel bellyaching beforehand had only four faults sailor looked even more fed up as fen took off his rug but he nudged jake in the ribs as if to say i dont like this any more than you do so lets get on with it i heard rupert saying its like a skating rink in the middle on the far side of the rustic poles said fen so jump to the right yes sir said jake trying to stop his teeth chattering your breeches look like a sunset said fen hope thats not symbolic of my career said jake sailor was cold and it took him the first four jumps to warm up he gave jake a seizure when he rapped the double very hard but fortunately though the pole trembled it didnt come out of the cup and jake managed to steer him clear of the skating rink at the rustic poles although jake was aware what a tremendous effort sailor had to make at each fence carrying so much lead he completed the course without mishap jakes heart filled with gratitude what horse could be more gallant as he patted him delightedly and gave him half a packet of polos he wondered if subconsciously he was holding back revenge because he so wanted to take sailor to colombia keep him warm and under cover he said to fen and went off to check the jumpoff course he found all the clearround riders having a frightful row with the crittleden judges for christ sake said rupert weve gone clear isnt that enough for the buggers its like jumping out of quicksand porky boy might easily slip said humpty its a sod of a course agreed billy but the judges were adamant the olympic committee wanted them to jump again this time porky boy had three fences down rupert and driffield two and jake and billy one each cant ask us to go again said billy grinning at jake at least thats a grand in each of our pockets sailors finished said jake couldnt even jump over a pole on the ground billy nodded dont worry theyre not that crazy but once again the olympic committee or rather colonel roxborough who had once won a bronze medal wanted a duel to the death seems a bit extreme when jakes horse is carrying so much lead protested malise they really are ghastly conditions could be just as ghastly in colombia said the colonel are we conducting an olympic trial or are we not you couldnt divide a gold medal malise had to go down and tell billy and jake they had to jump again knowing he must not transmit the grave doubts he felt im retiring sailor said jake then youll scupper your olympic chances said malise just take it very slowly sailor was too exhausted even to look appalled as jake rode him through the driving rain back into the collecting ring jake couldnt bear to watch billy but he heard the subdued cheers as he rode out with twelve faults rain was dripping in a steady stream from malises hat as he walked up to jake now i mean it take it really slowly hes got no bloody choice after what youve put him through snapped fen malise knew he should have slapped her down but she was speaking the truth jake hated having to ask sailor to do it he felt like a murderer as he cantered slowly into the ring tory must be watching at home and worried too if only that bloody misselthrush had shut up rain at fifty degrees was making visibility almost impossible im sorry boy im sorry he ran a reassuring hand down sailors dripping gray plaits there were only seven fences sailor managed the first and second but the ground was so churned up that he slipped on takeoff at the third the wall and sent all the bricks and nearly himself flying it was like riding on a kitchen floor after youve spilt hot fat frightened now sailor knocked down the oxer and rapped the upright which trembled but as in the first round didnt fall perhaps they were in luck after all somehow he nursed sailor over the rustic poles now he was coming down to the combination by some miracle despite a nasty skid he cleared the three elements now it was only the parallel ears flattened against the rain tail swishing in irritation sailor looked for a second as though he was going to stop go on baby go on muttered jake sailor made a mighty effort girding his loins then with an extra wiggle threw himself with a groan over the fence only eight faults they had won despite the deluge the crowd gave him a tremendous cheer as jake pulled sailor to a walk patting him over and over again then just in front of the selectors box like some terrible nightmare sailor seemed to stop make an effort to go on then physically shrink beneath jake and collapse in the mud jake whose good leg was trapped beneath him took a few seconds to wriggle free scrambling up covered in mud he limped over to sailors head cradling it in his arms sailor just lay there then he opened his walleye tried to raise his head gave a halfchoked knucker and his head fell back sailor whispered jake its all right sweetheart youll be okay in a minute wheres the vet he howled looking around frantically at the horrified blur of the crowd the next minute the vet ran onto the course through the torrent of rain carrying his bag quickly it must be his heart do something pleaded jake the vet opened sailors eye and shook his head im afraid i cant hes dead he cant be said jake through pale trembling lips he cant be not sailor and suddenly his face crumpled and tears were mingling with the raindrops sailor he sobbed kneeling down putting his arms round sailors neck dont die please you cant dont die in an instant the immaculate crittleden organization swung into gear the tractor and trailer were chugging through the mud from the collecting ring and the arena party ran on putting eightfoot screens round jake and the horse and the loudspeaker started booming out music from south pacific the crowd stood stunned not moving colonel roxborough descended from the stands malise ran in from the collecting ring but fen got there first flinging her arms round jake and sailor cuddling them both sobbing her heart out too any hope asked malise the vet shook his head heart attack im afraid fen turned round its your fault she screamed at malise and colonel roxborough your bloody bloody fault jake didnt want to jump him now what have you proved malise went up and put his hand on her shoulder awfully sorry very bad luck might have happened at any time dont touch me hissed fen shaking him off youre all murderers malise went over to jake who was still cradling sailors head in his arms crying great strangled sobs it was the misselthrush he kept saying over and over again he seemed almost deranged come on jake said malise gently bloody bad luck but lets get him out of the ring it took three of the arena party to pull jake off and the rest of them to get sailor into the trailer half the crowd and all the grooms were in tears the riders were visibly shaken the organizers were in a tizzy about whod won its in the fei rules jake wasnt mounted when he left the ring said grania pringle who was about to present the prizes then billys got to get it said colonel roxborough lets get on with it get peoples minds onto something more cheerful bloody good thing it happened today just think if hed collapsed in colombia thats what olympic trials are for grania pringle turned on him her beautiful makeup streaked with tears bloody well shut up roxie dont be so fucking insensitive as the tractor came out with its grisly burden billy near to tears himself rode up to jake christ im sorry of all the ghastly things to happen we all knew how you felt about him but im not taking first prize malise jake won it he must have it very kind of you billy but we have to abide by the rules he looked at jake it was hard to tell now which was downpour or tears the rain had washed all the mud from the white shrunken face bastard jake spat at malise and turned in the direction of his lorry suddenly he turned back where are you taking sailor he demanded dont worry your head about that said malise get out of those wet clothes youre not taking his body away for cat food he wont go for cat food said malise reasonably theyll take him to the hunt kennels jake shot him a look of pure hatred as if that were any better take him to my lorry fen dried revenge off and fed him while jake loaded the two novices into the box she couldnt bear to watch them loading sailor so she went and rang tory to tell her they were coming home as she came out of the telephone box malise was waiting for her she was about to walk past him when he said look i know how you both feel i should doubt it said fen coldly and dont try telling jake its only a horse he loved sailor more than any human she added suddenly with a wisdom beyond her years he felt they were both ugly both laughed at both despised and rejected together they were going to show the world malise looked at her thoughtfully hes very lucky to have you cant you stop him driving in this condition its simply not safe you didnt worry too much about sailors safety did you snapped fen so i dont think youre a very good judge and in this condition which you put him into all he needs is tory jake didnt speak a word on the way home fen found it unbearable the way revenge kept nudging sailors body waiting for his wise old friend to scramble grumbling to his feet and tell him not to worry they reached the mill house at midnight jake drove the box straight around to the orchard the rain had stopped leaving a brilliant clear night moonlight flooded the dripping apple trees and the grave which had already been dug for them by the nextdoor farmer he stayed to help them unload sailor which was a good thing as he was stiff and cold now and terribly heavy it was so bright you could see the flecks on his fleabitten coat his mane still neatly plaited jake wrapped him in his white and maroon rug and patted him goodbye jakes face was set and expressionless as he covered the body with earth pressing it down neatly later when hed unloaded and settled the other horses he made a cross and put it on the grave by a supreme effort tory managed not to cry in front of him and when they finally fell into bed around four oclock he just groaned laid his head on her warm friendly breasts and fell asleep next day he spent a long time digging up wildflowers to plant around sailors grave outwardly he appeared calm but tory knew he was bleeding inside in the afternoon malise rang up jake refused to talk to him how is he asked malise all right said tory but he wont talk about it well it might cheer him up to know he and revenge have been selected to go to aachen probably hes suffering from shock hell be okay in a day or two he rang up again two days later just confirming jake and revenge are available for aachen well its a bit awkward said tory let me speak to him im afraid he doesnt want to talk to you and hes completely gone off the idea of going to the olympics but thatd give him an interest best possible therapy said malise he cant deprive his country of a horse like that colonel carter was less reticent he rang repeatedly complaining about jake refusing to take revenge to aachen and poor tory who had to field the calls received a torrent of abuse its preposterous fellows a milksop blubbing in the ring suppose hes lost his nerve for once tory lost her temper dont you realize theyve broken his heart the village sent a wreath to put on sailors grave letters of sympathy poured in we all loved him wrote one woman to us sailor was show jumping im sending you my pocket money wrote one little girl i expect the other horses are missing him and you might like to buy them some polos on the thursday morning after sailors death fen having spent two hours on the novices in the indoor school was just eating a piece of toast and marmalade and dashing off an essay on mercutio before racing off to school when wolf started barking frenziedly and she heard the sound of wheels on the bridge going out she found a plump blonde with a sweet round face and two toughlooking men getting out of a horse box yes she said they all looked faintly embarrassed then the girl said im petra rupert campbellblacks new groom weve come for the horse what horse revenge whimpering fen bolted back upstairs to wake tory and jake jake unable to sleep had only dropped off with the aid of a sleeping tablet at six oclock he came down zombielike eyelids swollen eyes leaden with sleep wearing only jeans noticing his stickingout ribs fen thought how much weight hed lost recently what did you say theyve come for revenge dont be bloody silly said jake going to the open back door bugger off all of you the girl went very pink we understood youd been told what that rupert campbellblack bought revenge yesterday jake went very still are you certain she nodded pitying him jake had long been one of her heroes i dont believe it snapped jake just one of ruperts silly games ill go and ring up bernard the colonel was out molly answered hard put to conceal her elation bernards been trying to get through to you for three days jake is it true yes rupes been after revenge for months it was rupe now was it jake leant against the hall table suddenly dizzy with hatred ill buy him offer him to me i hardly think you can top rupes offer how much fortyfive thousand pounds said molly maliciously youre crazy hell ride that horse off its feet in six months well that doesnt really matter now that bernards got the cash said molly anyway im sure rupert wont hes taking him to the olympics bernards set his heart on that we tried to talk to you last night to say the deal had finally gone through but you wouldnt come to the telephone oh bernards just come in have a word with jake the colonel picked up the telephone fraid its true jake had the feeling you were a bit chicken about the olympics bit out of your depth really he who dares wins you know campbellblacks man enough to have a go hes a sadist said jake rubbish hes a brilliant horseman with a lot of experience not fair to revenge to hold him back jake hung up and rang malise ruperts told me i tried to dissuade him but the deal had gone through im awfully sorry jake but theres not much i can do its carters horse jake got dressed and went out to the yard to find fen standing outside revenges box with a twelvebore in her hands and wolf snarling beside her keep away from that door she hissed this is our horse if you lay a finger on him ill blast you full of lead youve been watching too many westerns love said the taller of the two men but he backed away slightly jake strolled across the yard put that gun down fen no he isnt their horse to take im afraid he is he said bernards sold him to rupert it was too much for fen revenge was her baby the horse shed transformed from a nervous napping wreck to a loving happy and willing horse she dropped the gun with a clatter and rushed up to the men please dont take him away she sobbed we lost sailor last saturday please dont take away revenge too im sorry love i know its hard but orders is orders jake turned to tanya go and get revenge it took only a few minutes to put one of ruperts rugs and a head collar on revenge jake went to the book they kept in the tackroom describing each horses likes and dislikes and the training and the feed hed been getting and which of jakes medicines he needed numbly he wondered whether to give it to rupert it would certainly help the horse then he thought sod it and tearing out the page he crumpled it up and threw it in the bin it gave him a terrible pang to see how merrily and confidently revenge bounced up the ramp of the lorry thinking he was going to a show hed been such a devil to load when hed arrived he looked worth every penny of now jake went up and stroked him and gave him a handful of stud nuts it gave him an even worse pang to think how revenge would react when he got to the other end and didnt find fen to welcome him he couldnt look as the lorry drove off over the bridge through the fringe of willows africa was the first to notice revenges absence shed been looking out for sailor since jake came back leaving her manger after a quick mouthful coming to the halfdoor with a puzzled expression on her black face and calling out for him now revenge was gone too she was irritated and nervy circling her box picking up straw letting it hang from her mouth like the village idiot jake went up and put his arms round her neck fighting back the tears i miss them too she seemed to be saying with her wise kind eyes but you still have me please love me because im the one who always loved you best and suddenly jake felt ashamed africa the goodest truest gentlest of them all and hed been neglecting her recently because sailor and revenge seemed so much more important he went into the tackroom looking at the rows and rows of rosettes across the yard in the sitting room lovingly polished by tory were all his silver cups pride of place had been given to the cup hed won at olympia with sailor then hed been king of the castle now he was at the bottom of the heap again with only africa and half a dozen novices to his name he looked up at the cupboard on the opposite wall where well out of reach he kept all his poisons belladonna henbane for galls hemlock and the grounddown toadstools which if sparingly administered could cure colic or purge a sick horse to recovery in an old silver snuffbox he kept warty caps one spore of the fungus would attach itself to ruperts throat giving all the symptoms of consumption but causing death in a few weeks it was a nice thought but he preferred to beat rupert in other ways he went upstairs to fens room noticing the threadbare landing carpet tory was desperately trying to comfort her poor little fen first marigold then revenge he put a hand on torys cheek and stroked it she looked up startled blushing at the unexpected tenderness relieved he wasnt as shattered as shed expected fen he said ive got an idea i think its high time africa had a foal fen didnt react she just lay there slumped her shoulders heaving and its high time you had your own horse he went on think ive found one for you shes only five and roan not a color i like but her mother was a polo pony so she turns on a sixpence and she jumps like a cricket already almost blindly fen reached out for jake its so terribly terribly kind of you she sobbed but its no good i cant stop thinking about revenge the more rupert rode revenge the better he liked him hed never sat on such a supple wellschooled animal it was like playing a stradivarius after an old banjo they clicked the moment he got on the horses back it was easier for revenge to carry ruperts twelve stones than jake plus two unmovable stones of lead the horse also loved jumping against the clock he had already won one class at the royal highland where he had trounced all the other possibles now he was in aachen with the probables for the final trial and attracting a huge amount of interest from the worlds press how would gyppo jakes horse go with rupert over such huge fences rupert in fact had received a lot of flak after sailors tragic death the public felt it was very unfair on jake that the other horse hed spent so much time bringing on should be snatched from under his nose as soon as marion heard that rupert had appropriated revenge she handed in her notice properly this time then went straight to fleet street and told them exactly how much rupert had paid for the horse an offer the frightful colonel couldnt refuse and then went on to give them some choice titbits about the cruelty of ruperts training methods the news of the world felt the material was too hot to print but private eye had no such scruples rumors were rife no one could get any comment from jake on the subject so the reporters besieged rupert well ill concede jake lovells a good trainer he said diplomatically but the horse needed an experienced rider on his back winnings about taking chances jake wasnt even prepared to take the horse to colombia as for the cruelty charges theyre too ridiculous to discuss horses wont jump if they dont want to and now it was the eve of the trials and rupert knew perfectly well that if revenge beat the rest of the international field as well as the english probables tomorrow and was picked for colombia people would conveniently forget how the horse had been acquired helen was so wrapped up in little marcus that she hardly appreciated the furor rupert had hoped she might leave marcus with mrs bodkin and fly out to aachen but she was still looking desperately tired and said she didnt feel quite confident enough to leave him rupert however was finding consolation in his new groom petra whom he had nicknamed podge he was glad marion had gone he was fed up with her tantrums and her beady eyes following him all the time podge on the other hand with her chunky body and legs though not as upmarket or as handsome as marion had a nice smooth skin and was always smiling and she adored the horses almost more than she worshiped rupert naturally revenge was homesick at first any horse coddled as jakes were would feel the draft when he left the yard but podge had made a huge fuss of the horse and after a few days kicking his box out and spurning his food he had settled in it was the eve of the aachen trials and having seen the horses settled rupert and billy took a taxi back to their hotel there was something about a hotel bedroom that made rupert want to order a bottle of champagne and a beautiful girl to drink it with what shall we do tonight billy pushed aside ruperts clothes which littered both beds and collapsed onto his own bed go to bed early im absolutely knackered ludwigs having a barbecue at his house i dont want a hangover tomorrow but just think of all that kraut crumpet rupert went to the window and gazed down the tidy village street then said casually thought i might take podge oh for christs sake leave her alone you know how it rotted up your relationship with marion pity there isnt a gideon bible then i could read you the seventh commandment all over again well im not getting much joy out of my wife at the moment shes temporarily closed like the m billy put his hands over his ears i dont want to hear you know i adore your wife the telephone rang rupert picked it up hello darling i was just talking to billy about you next moment the lazy smile was wiped off his face its marcus sobbed helen hes been hospitalized he cant breathe and hes gone purple in the face oh rupert i know hes going to die please come back ill be on the next plane youre at gloucester hospital dont worry darling hell pull through the campbellblacks are very tough he rang malise in his room who came over straightaway you must go back at once im sorry helens in a frightful state hardly surprising theyre terrifying these illnesses of little children i remember going through them with henrietta and he paused with timmy i hope everythingll be all right give helen our love and sympathy rupert was lucky enough to get a plane at once and he reached the hospital by midnight he hadnt bothered to change he was still wearing boots breeches and a tweed coat over his white shirt and tie my names campbellblack he said to the receptionist my wife came in this afternoon with our baby named marcus he may be in the operating theater his hand shook as he brushed his hair back from his forehead the girl looked down her list wishing shed bothered to wash her hair that morning she remembered rupert from earlier in the year when hed caused such a stir when helen had the baby marcuss in the childrens ward on the fourth floor the lift was occupied with a patient coming back from the operating theater rupert ran up the stairs the sister met him in the passage my son marcus campbellblack he panted he was brought in this afternoon oh yes with maddening lack of haste the sister went back into her room to check the chart hes in room twentyfive is he is he rupert choked on the words going to be all right of course he is he had an attack of croup whats that no one quite knows why it comes on the baby goes blue and cant breathe parents invariably think hes swallowed something and is choking to death all he needs is to inhale some moisture were keeping him in the humidifying tent for tonight dr benson says hell be as right as rain tomorrow are you all right she asked staring at ruperts horrified expression it must have been a terrible shock for you mrs campbellblack will be so pleased youve come back she was very upset but dr bensons given her something to calm her down can i get you a cup of tea and she brought me all the way back for this thought rupert in the middle of the final olympic trial in room twentyfive he found marcus lying happily in a huge cellophane tent inhaling friars balsam from a humidifier helen was sitting on the edge of the bed wiggling marcuss toes she got up and ran to rupert oh im so glad you came i was so frightened i thought he was going to die rupert patted her shoulder mechanically nanny would have recognized croup he thought darkly behind her on the bed he could see his son and heir pinkly gurgling digging his pink starfish fingers into his shawl and felt a black rage look said helen fondly diving under the tent and holding marcus up in a sitting position he can hold his head up now dont you want to cuddle him im sure he ought to be kept quiet said rupert he listened while she poured out her worries and tried not to contrast the innocent fun hed be having in aachen getting tight with billy at ludwigs barbecue with the terrifying world of childrens illness and the dark claustrophobic intensity of helens love im sorry i brought you back she said i was so terrified you might find him dead i needed you so badly im sorry ive been offish lately but it must be worth coming all this way just to see him hes so cute isnt he do you think hes grown i need a drink said rupert next moment dr benson walked in hello rupert he said heartily you must have been worried stiff but as you can see hes all right nothing to worry about you need a drink come on im sure matrons got something tucked away benson obviously wanted a hearttoheart matron had only sweet sherry but at least it was alcohol immediately benson launched into the subject of helen bit worried about her only twentyfour very young to cope on her own with a big house and a young baby she misses you you know i miss her said rupert somewhat shirtily but christ she wont come to shows with me i got her a marvelous nanny and she promptly sacked her i asked her to come to aachen ive got an olympic trial tomorrow ill have to fly back in the morning benson looked pained so soon i do have a living to earn i know said benson soothingly i do think it would help if you could get a nanny a young cheerful girl who helen wouldnt feel threatened by then in time shed feel confident enough to leave marcus she needs a holiday best holiday she could have would be for the baby to get well and strong but im afraid all the indications are that hes going to be an asthmatic christ are you sure pretty certain well do some tests while hes in here and you know thats not a condition helped by the mothers anxiety with any luck he should grow out of it or at least be able to handle it as he gets older rupert drained the glass of sherry pulling a face want another asked benson rupert shook his head he felt absolutely shattered he had been up at five that morning whats your schedule well the trials tomorrow then the international in london then if im picked for colombia a brief rest for the horses before we fly out and after that you could take her and marcus away for a long holiday rupert shook his head virtually impossible in the middle of the season horses lose their precision if you rest them too long benson nodded appreciate your problem ive got patients on the tennis circuit has she got a friend she can stay with rupert thought of hilary he guessed she had been stirring things not really ill have to find her a nanny can i take her home this evening good idea the childs in no danger now do her good helen was aghast when rupert told her hed be flying back in the morning she lay in the huge double bed with that pinched defiant look of roses touched by the frost in december then as rupert joined her she lay back staring at the ceiling wanting to be soothed and comforted and told she was being splendid rupert comforted her in the only way he knew by trying to make love to her after a few minutes she started to cry christ whats the matter now im too worried about marcus i cant switch off and now youre going back darling the trials tomorrow afternoon horse horse horse she was suddenly almost hysterical surely marcus is more important than a horse trial it was a debatable point thought rupert but he merely said benson says theres nothing to worry about rupert left at nine oclock and ran into bad weather arriving only just in time to walk the course once again he contrasted podges lovely smiling welcome with helens set martyred face as shed said goodbye that morning hows marcus asked podge oh im so relieved hes okay we was all so worried revvie and i missed you he was restless last night so i slept in his boxspect i look like it lucky rev said rupert he looks in the pink anyway hes great on top of the world youll just have to sit on his back what a contrast to marion thought rupert for the first time in his life he was suffering from nerves it must be tiredness he longed for a stiff drink but podge had made him a large cup of strong black coffee instead he knew the worlds press was watching as he rode into the ring his fears were groundless revenge jumped like an angel literally floating over the vast fences after the trial the selectors went into a huddle elated almost sure of a place rupert went off to ring helen now back in the hospital with marcus he carefully spent five minutes asking how they both were before telling her revenge had come first beating even ludwig going like a dream and muzzling any critics im very glad for you said helen in a tight little voice whos that in the background said rupert hilary and the kids said helen shes driving marcus and me home from hospital and staying the night shes being so supportive as he came off the telephone a german reporter accosted him meester black it is unusual for zee english to beat zee germans in this country no no said rupert coldly i think youre forgetting the last two world wars and stalked off feeling utterly deflated he went back to the stable where an ecstatic podge was chattering to revenge as she settled him for the night didnt you do well darling its colombia here we come well have to make you a sun hat to keep off the flies dont count your chickens said rupert checking revenges bandages you look really tired said podge then blushing added i bet you didnt eat last night nor this morning i made you a shepherds pie for tonight its not very good and im sure youd rather go out with billy rupert pulled the halfdoor behind him id much rather stay in right in he said softly drawing her towards him and i absolutely adore shepherds pie oh we cant squawked podge not here not in front of rev want to bet said rupert pushing her against the wall jake lovell heard the news on the tackroom wireless as he was filling in the diet sheets fen who was cleaning tack didnt dare look at him after a successful trial in aachen germany said the announcer the following riders and horses have been picked for the olympics in colombia charles hamilton and porky boy billy lloydfoxe and the bull rupert campbellblack on revenge fen gave a gasp of horror brian driffield on temperance with ivor braine as reserve fen went over and put her arms round jake im so so sorry she said it was you who made him a great horse rupert just had to get on his back molly carter delighted that revenge had been selected felt a trip to colombia would be in order we must give a celebration party for rupert and helen before he leaves phone him up bernard and fix an evening hes free and then we can invite everyone else and do ask him about hotels in bogota and say to make sure we get tickets to watch rev colonel carter came off the telephone magenta in the face most peculiar rupe says revenge belongs to him now and there is no possible way hes coming to any party oh bernard snapped molly you know what a tease rupert is he must have been joking ill ring him up rupert she said archly two minutes later bernard must have got the wrong end of the stick we want to give a little celebration party for you well you can count me out said rupert curtly i never mix business with pleasure and you and the colonel were strictly business believe me you can say that spluttered molly after all weve done for you yes said rupert go and spend your fortyfive grand on buying a few friends its the only way youll get them and hung up billy couldnt believe hed been selected for the olympics for days he floated on a cloud of bliss he felt sorry for lavinia not being picked but it would make things much easier in colombia if she wasnt there to upset him all the team had been much too superstitious to fill in their clothes measurement forms so there was a lastminute panic to get the uniform in time rupert made a terrible fuss about the clothes i am not going to wear a boating jacket with a badge on he said disdainfully throwing the royal blue olympic blazer across the room and these trousers make us look like wombles billy didnt care he was so enchanted to be in the team hed have worn a grass skirt if necessary the only blot on the horizon was the tension in ruperts marriage billy didnt like hilary one bit he thought she was bossy strident and disruptive and having a very bad effect on helen she was always around the house these days breastfeeding her baby in the drawing room or shoveling brown rice down little germaine despite disapproving of ruperts stinking capitalist habits she had no compunction about drinking his drink or using his washing machine all day you couldnt get a pair of breeches washed these days for revolving nappies the excuse for hilarys presence was that she was doing a painting of helen like the sketch she had done before she made helen look the picture of victimized misery belsen thin her face all eyes tears streaking her wasted cheeks rupert who like most rich people detested freeloaders grew so irritated that after half a bottle of whisky one night he crept in and painted a large black mustache and a beard on the picture with a balloon coming out of helens mouth saying monica carlton had me first billy fell about laughing helen was absolutely livid hilary merely looked pained assumed a theyknownotwhattheydo attitude and started another painting so rupert achieved nothing one evening when she was giving marcus his late bottle billy tackled helen angel i dont want to interfere but i think you ought to come to colombia i cant leave marcus well bring him hes too little hed never cope with the climate billy tried another tack i know rupe seems very tough on the outside but he needs the applause most of all from you hes too proud to plead but i know hes desperate for you to go hilary could look after marcus helen cuddled marcus tighter a look of terror on her face when marcus had croup the other day and i thought he was dying i made a pact id never leave him you do have a husband as well but helen wouldnt be persuaded the last show before the olympics was the royal international rupert and billy left the bull and revenge to enjoy a wellearned rest in gloucestershire and drove up to london with kitchener and belgravia and a handful of novices on the wednesday billy and kitchener won the king george v cup an allmale contest and one of the most prestigious in the world the following evening while the women riders were competing for the queen elizabeth cup all the british olympic team except rupert who had other unspecified plans went out on the tiles together they started in a west end pub called the golden lion ivor billy and humpty had all bought rounds of drinks and were deliberately hanging back to see if they could make driffield put his hand in his pocket thats mine said billy as the barman tried to gather up the second half of billys tonic im hoping someone is going to buy me the other half looking pointedly at driffield he put the tonic bottle into his breast pocket he was still coming down to earth after his win everyone was hailing and congratulating him on that and on getting picked to go to colombia looking around the bar he was aware of some wonderful girls in summer dresses eyeing him with considerable enthusiasm he wished he could ask one of them out it was a glorious july evening the setting sun was lighting up the dusty plane trees in the square the door of the bar was fixed open and people were drinking in the streets im thirsty driff he said im thirsty too said humpty i didnt know you were thirtytwo said ivor surprised i thought you were only thirty humpty i was saying i was thirsty driff said billy winking at the others he flicked his stilllit cigarette end in the direction of the open door but it missed and landed in the lap of a girl in a cyclamen pink dress who was sitting on a bench nearby oh christ billy bounded towards her im frightfully sorry but as he leaned forward to remove the cigarette end the tonic from the bottle in his pocket cascaded forward all over her dress for gods sake look what youre doing said her companion oh hell said billy im dreadfully sorry the girl burst out laughing it really doesnt matter itll dry in a sec its so hot its nice to have an impromptu shower billy looked into her face and his heart skipped several beats she was certainly one of the prettiest girls hed ever seen she had a smooth brown skin with a touch of pink on each high cheekbone slanting dark brown eyes a turnedup nose a mane of streaky tortoiseshell hair and a big mouth as smooth and as crimson as a fuchsia bud her pink dress showed at least three inches of slim brown thigh and a marvelous rift valley of cleavage billy couldnt tear his eyes away im most awfully sorry he repeated in a daze it couldnt matter less said the girl highly delighted at the effect she was having on him billy pulled himself together getting out one of ruperts blue silk handkerchiefs he started to wipe away the ash but it all smeared into the tonic oh dear thats much worse look let me buy you another dress theres no need for that snapped her companion he was about thirtyfive with a pale sweating face that was even more rumpled than his gray suit then let me buy you a drink both of you what would you like youve caused quite enough trouble already the man said why dont you buzz off dont be beastly victor said the girl in her soft husky voice wed love a drink the man looked at his watch well be late the tables booked for nine and they dont like to be kept waiting theyll wait for me said the girl blandly anyone would said billy have a quick one but the man had got to his feet no thank you very much he said huffily i must have a pee said the girl you go and get a taxi vic there was a great deal of allyooping and badinage from the rest of the riders as billy waited for her to come out what would rupert do in the circumstances he wondered probably accost her and get her telephone number but he couldnt do that with the frightful victor hovering as she came out he caught a heady new waft of scent shed teased her tortoiseshell hair more wildly and applied more crimson lipstick he wanted to kiss it all off perhaps that luscious mouth would pop like a fuchsia bud he took a deep breath i dont mean to be presumptuous but youre the prettiest girl ive ever seen thats nice she said my names billy lloydfoxe the great show jumper she said mockingly i know you won the kings cup yesterday he blushed scarlet id adore to see you again as she smiled he noticed the gap in the white slightly uneven teeth the raspberry pink tongue of the good digestion you will she patted his cheek with her hand i promise you oh look victors managed to get a taxi how extraordinary she ran out into the street and he hadnt even asked her name nil out of ten for initiative if rupert had been here he would have lynched him on the other hand if rupert had been here the girl would have gone off with rupert instead billy spent the rest of the week at the international feeling horribly restless praying the girl from the golden lion might turn up after lavinia hed vowed hed never let another girl get under his skin and here he was moping around again even in the excitement of setting out for colombia he was unable to get her out of his mind in the weeks leading to the olympics jake lovell sank into deep depression then unable to face the razzmatazz and hysterical chauvinism of the actual event he flew off to the middle east to try and find macaulay he had located the sheik but when he got there after a lot of prevarication he discovered that macaulay had indeed blotted his copy book by savaging the sheik himself and had been sold on less than six weeks before to a dealer who kept no records and couldnt or probably didnt want to remember where macaulay had gone jake went to the british embassy who were very unhelpful with a big oil deal going through they didnt want to rock the boat after repeated nagging they sent jake to miss blenkinsop who ran a horse rescue center in the capital and as far as jake could see was a constant thorn in the authorities flesh as she waged a onewoman battle against appalling middle eastern cruelty and insensitivity towards animals miss blenkinsop was a gaunt sinewy woman in her late fifties totally without sentimentality and with the brusque rather desexed manner of someone who has always cared for animals more than people she gave jake a list of sixtyodd addresses where he might find the horse hope your nerves are strong youll see some harrowing sights arabs think its unlucky to put down a horse so they work them till they drop dead and they dont believe in feeding and watering them much either horse has probably been sold upcountry youve as much chance of finding him as a needle in a haystack but here are all the riding schools and the quarries the most likely spots within five miles of the city ill lend you one of my boys as interpreter hes a shifty little beast but he speaks good english and you can borrow my car if you like for jake it was utter crucifixion he was in a bad way emotionally anyway and he had never seen such cruelty like some hideous travesty of brook farm riding school he watched skeletons lame often blind frantic with thirst shuffling around riding school rings or tugging impossibly heavy loads in the street or in the quarries being beaten until they collapsed and then being beaten until they got up again for five days he went to every address miss blenkinsop had given him bribing wheedling cajoling for information about a huge black horse with a white face and one long white sock no one had seen him sickened and shattered he returned every night to his cheap hotel where there was no airconditioning the floors crawled with cockroaches and drink was totally prohibited as the coupdegrâce on the fifth night he couldnt resist watching the olympic individual competition on the useless black and white hotel television as billy rode in the picture went around and around but sadistically it held still for rupert and revenge who produced two heroic rounds to win the bronze ludwig got the gold on his great hanoverian mare clara carol kennedy the american number one male rider got the silver black with despair and hatred jake went up to his cauldron of a room and lay on his bed smoking until dawn he had nearly run out of money and addresses today he must go home emptyhanded around seven he must have dozed off he was woken by the telephone it was miss blenkinsop dont get too excited but i may have found your horse hes been causing a lot of trouble down at the stone quarries she gave him the address if it is him dont bid for him yourself theyll guess somethings up and whack up the price give me a ring and ill come and do the haggling at first jake wasnt sure the big muzzled gelding was so pitifully thin and so covered in a thick layer of white dust as he staggered one step forward one step back trying to shift a massive cartload of stone that it was impossible to distinguish his white face or his one white sock then the arab brought his whip down five times on the sunken quarters five black stripes appeared and with a squeal of rage macaulay turned and lunged at the driver showing the white eye on the other side thats my boy thought jake with a surge of excitement theyll break his back before they break his spirit miss blenkinsop had a hard time making the arab owner of the quarry part with macaulay although vicious he was the strongest horse theyd ever had and probably still had six months hard labor in him but the price the hideously ugly englishwoman was offering was too much for him to refuse he could buy a dozen brokendown wrecks for that when jake took miss blenkinsops trailer to collect him macaulay was too tall to fit in so jake led him very slowly back through the rushhour traffic macaulay twice clattered to the ground with exhaustion and several times they narrowly missed death as the oilrich arabs hurtled by in their huge limousines but macaulay displayed no fear he was beyond that now and most touchingly he seemed to remember jake from the time hed treated his lacerations after ruperts beatingup in madrid when jake came to fetch him his lackluster eyes brightened for a second and he gave a halfwhicker of welcome that night after he had made the horse as comfortable as possible jake had supper with miss blenkinsop she drew the curtains and produced an ancient bottle of madeira after two glasses jake realized he was absolutely plastered after arab food the macaroni cheese she gave him seemed the best thing he had ever eaten jake always found it difficult to express gratitude in case it was construed as weakness i dont know how to thank you he finally mumbled dont bother said miss blenkinsop do something about it spread the word when you get back to england we need cash not sympathy and a law banning the exporting of all horses to the middle east if i can get macaulay back on the circuit said jake the publicity for you will be so fantastic the moneyll start flooding in hes in a very bad way think youll be able to do it jake shrugged hes young my grandmother cured a mare with a broken leg once bound it in comfrey and she went on to win four races im going to have a bloody good try for a second he stared at his glass miles away then he said i had a horse called sailor once he was near death when he arrived but he did pretty well in the end even when jake and macaulay got back to england the news that great britain had won the team silver medal billy clinching it with a brilliant clear didnt upset him very much kings they came home after a grueling thirtyhour journey from colombia to stansted airport the bull and revenge accompanied by tracey and podge had a good nights sleep at colonel roxboroughs yard next day they drove the horses in the lorry to heathrow to meet rupert and billy they had quite a wait because of scenes of hysterical excitement at the airport press and television cameras were everywhere police had to keep back the huge crowd britain hadnt notched up that many medals at colombia not to be very proud of her showjumping bronze and silver at last they all set off for penscombe at around four oclock in the afternoon in tearing spirits sharing several bottles of champagne on the way tracey was soon laughing like a hyena only podge was sad in a couple of hours she would have to give most of rupert back to helen but thered be other shows she tried to tell herself outside cirencester rupert was stopped by a policeman for speeding who solemnly got out his notebook then asked for their autographs every time people saw their lorry with the lettering rupert campbellblack and billy lloydfoxe great britain they started cheering even rupert was thrown by the welcome as they neared home as they entered chalford there were crowds all along the route cheering waving british flags and holding up placards saying well done billy and rupert three cheers for the bull and revenge rupert looked at billy shall we ride home billy nodded too moved to speak the horses were still tired but delighted to be out of the lorry and in familiar territory the bull proceeded to stall and stall in the middle of chalford high street to the delighted screams of the crowd and the photographers and they were cheered all the three miles home rupert and billy riding in front followed by tracey and podge in the lorry hooting victory salutes on the horn two miles out henrietta one of the junior grooms arrived with an ecstatic badger and mavis red white and blue bows attached to their collars billy scooped up mavis onto the saddle in front of him where she ecstatically licked his salty face after that the bull had to guide himself home because billy needed one hand to clutch mavis and the other to wipe his eyes the bull didnt care with garlands of flowers round his massive neck he must have put on a stone between chalford and penscombe with all the sweets carrots and sugar that were fed him along the route to rupert penscombe had never looked so lovely as on that golden september afternoon with the valley softened and blurred by a slight blue mist and great pale cream swathes of travelers joy there was the weather cock glinting on penscombe church and suddenly towards them came the village band sweating in their red tunics playing land of hope and glory somewhat out of tune this is really too much said billy half laughing and half crying as the band shuddered to a straggly halt in front of them then turned round striking up rule britannia to lead them in the village was decked out like a royal wedding every house had put out the flags a huge streamer stretched across the village street saying welcome home our four heroes photographers ran along the pavement snapping as they went by the war memorial the mayor was waiting for them shaking them both by the hand he read a speech of welcome that revenge tried to eat rupert was looking everywhere for helen cant even bother to come and meet me he thought savagely and suddenly there she was on the pavement in a yellow sleeveless dress holding marcus in her arms looking apprehensive and not at all sure of her reception in an instant rupert was off revenge and kissing her passionately but not too hard in case he squashed marcus and the photographers went crazy show us your medals rupe they yelled so rupert ultracasual got them out of his hip pocket and hung them round marcuss neck but when he tried to pick up the baby and cuddle him marcus arched his back rigidly and started to yell so rupert handed him back to helen helen looked up at rupert incredulously hilary had spent so much time putting the boot in that she had imagined some devil would roll up shed forgotten how beautiful he was even after a long drive and an even longer flight as he came through those hysterically cheering crowds laughing and joking he seemed like a god again it was only just coming home to her the magnitude of his achievement she picked up the bronze and the silver medals and examined them wonderingly you made it you honestly made it oh rupert i missed you so much and suddenly she knew she was speaking the truth as she realized shed kept him at a distance since she got pregnant and maybe it was her fault did you said rupert his face suddenly serious horribly can we really try and spend some time together and make a go of it rupert kissed her again he felt ridiculously happy as long as you give thrillary the bullet helen looked disapproving then giggled were not quite so close she is rather overly directive shes more of a male bloody chauvinist pig than i am said rupert next day after all the excitement billy was ashamed to find himself overwhelmed with a feeling of restlessness and anticlimax after checking the horses he decided to give himself a day off and spent most of the morning opening mail as a result of his silver medal there were countless offers of free stud nuts tack rugs breeches a lorry manufacturer was offering him a large sum of money to do a press campaign several television companies were waving fat fees to make films of his life i shall have to turn professional he told miss hawkins their secretary halfjokingly perhaps the depression was caused by the fact that everyone in the world seemed to have written to congratulate him except that wonderful girl hed seen at the golden lion he hoped each letter might be from her but as he didnt know her name he couldnt identify her anyway for the thousandth time he kicked himself for not being more forceful at the time some man from the press named jamie hendersons written to ask if he can come down and interview you said miss hawkins i penciled in next sunday i thought you could take him up to the pub for lunch as hes coming all the way down from london its the only day youve got really youll be off to athens portugal and germany the next day she was highly delighted that billy was for once getting as much attention as rupert his lordship still in bed she went on in surprise are those two having a second honeymoon when his depression didnt lift in the days that followed billy thought it might well be due to the fact that rupert and helen suddenly seemed to be madly in love again helen had agreed to get a nanny rupert had agreed to come home more often and for them to do more things together billy was happy that they were happier but it only emphasized his own isolation what was the point of being a conquering hero if you didnt make any conquests the sunday jamie henderson was due billy rose early because it was so hot worked all the horses that needed it then hacked the bull out because it was such a beautiful day the stream at the bottom of the valley was choked with meadowsweet and as he rode home he could hear badger howling at the church bells as part of their new togetherness campaign helen and rupert were just leaving to go out to lunch with marcus as billy walked in through the front door well be at the paigntonlaceys said helen so you and this press man will have the house to yourselves theres no need to lunch out theres cold chicken and potato salad in the larder and ive washed a lettuce all youve got to do is pour french dressing over it and dont leave the butter in the sun she added this baby needs more luggage than a horse said rupert tramping out to the car with a blue plastic chamber pot in one hand a packet of disposable nappies in the other and several bottles under his arm one never gets enough to drink at the paigntonlaceys billy took the carrycot from helen and put it in the back as he waved them off to the accompaniment of marcus yelling and vivaldi on the car radio rupert looked at him and raised his eyes to heaven billy had a bath and put on a clean shirt and a pair of jeans he was nervous for he never knew what to say to reporters sitting outside with a jug of pimms he read the sunday papers which were still full of olympic news there was a nice picture of him in the sunday express and a piece in the telegraph with a headline about ruperts shadow coming out of the shadows he was pleased about that too he took off his shirt might as well try to top up his olympic tan in no time at all he seemed to have finished the jug the valley looked even more beautiful now the apples were reddening in the orchard the dogs panted on the lawn insects hummed in the michaelmas daisies september was such a lovely month why wasnt there someone here to share it with him he watched an emerald green volkswagen pause on the road running along the top of the valley towards penscombe he looked at his watch jamie henderson was late the doorbell rang followed by a frenzy of barking then a voice said all right down im a friend not a foe billy went down into the hall after the dazzling sunshine it took a few seconds before he could distinguish the figure in the doorway dressed in white hot pants and a red shirt her hair streaked by the sun her long long legs and body rising up to the wonderful breasts like a trumpet stood the girl from the golden lion ive brought you some freesias she said they should have been sweet williams billy opened his mouth and shut it again i must be dreaming he said slowly please dont let me wake up she came towards him and gave him the gentlest pinch on his bare arm youre awake all right didnt i promise wed meet again i know but i never believe in good fortune come through to the kitchen and ill get you a drink i made a jug of pimms but i drank it all waiting for some boring reporter whos supposed to be interviewing me thats me i dont expect hell take long what did you say thats me janey henderson oh my god our secretary put down jamie i was expecting a fella are you really a journalist she nodded and turned her palms towards him look ive got pen marks on my hands he got an apple some cucumber and an orange and started chopping them up janey admired the broad mahoganycolored back youre very brown i suppose that was colombia congratulations by the way i watched you on telly wasnt me it was the bull i was so shitscared my mind went a complete blank he just trundled me around just getting some mint he stepped out of the kitchen windows raided the herb bed and came back look i cant believe this are you really a journalist janey grinned rather a good one she took the mint from him and started to strip off the leaves and put them in the jug oh dear said billy should i have heard of you not really if youve never seen my paper they want me to do a big piece on you i dont read enough said billy apologetically helen ruperts wife is always accusing us of being intellectual dolts you can read the instructions on a pimms bottle and thats enough for me shall we go outside janey considered she didnt want to get flushed and shiny we can pull the bench into the shade said billy they wanted me to bring a photographer but i said it would cramp my style the way her eyes wandered over his face and body when she said it made him feel hot and excited she sat in the shade billy in the sun they talked about the bull honestly i worship the ground he trots on said billy hes such a trier and hes got such a beautiful mouth so have you said janey billy didnt know what to do with his mouth now is it true that youre thinking of turning professional billy nodded ive had my shot at the olympics so theres no excuse really not to i cant go on living with rupert forever im twentyseven now dont you find it difficult the three of you easy for me must be hard for them sometimes they dont mind you coming in late bringing back girls havent been many of them lately janey looked at him until he dropped his eyes what about lavinia greenslade billy filled up her glass before answering i was very cut up when she married guy but at least i had something to get stuck into with the horses since we split up ive had my best season are you getting over her billy ate a piece of apple out of his pimms yup i got over her in the golden lion about six weeks ago it was six weeks three days to be exact billy sidled down the bench and took her hands i didnt know how to find you every time anyone interviewed me in colombia all i wanted to say was that id got a message for the girl in the golden lion you look a bit like a lion and would she please come back i spent more time thinking about you than worrying about the next days rounds then an awful thought struck him youre not married or engaged are you janey shook her head the ash came out of the dress by the way reluctantly billy let go of her hands do you interview lots of people robert redford last week cassius clay the week before that billy felt quite faint with horror you didnt meet them first in a pub he asked they finished the pimms and they talked and talked billy had never felt such a strong sexual attraction to anyone she was so glowing and she had a special way of swiveling her eyes and gazing up at him from under her eyelashes that made him quite dizzy with longing it was so hot they had lunch in the kitchen at first he sat opposite her then he came and sat beside her do you have hundreds of brothers and sisters yes im the youngest theyre all married my mother despairs of getting me off the shelf thats ridiculous how old are you janey paused for a second twentyfour neither of them ate much lunch but they finished one bottle of muscadet and started on a second i hope this piece is going to be okay sighed janey my shorthand keeps misting over how long have you lived here she asked since i was twentyone although before that i used to come here sometimes in the school holidays i adored the place even then if rupert and i had fights i used to wander off down the valley theres a secret glade with a pond where i used to look for a kingfisher whats he like rupert oh marvelous i know him so well its like a marriage janey put the top on her pen and putting her notebook away then said in a deceptively casual voice whats his own marriage like off the record very happy said billy firmly he knew that journalists were always trying to catch him out over rupert must be under terrible pressure now shes got a baby and cant go everywhere with him with girls mobbing him wherever he goes theyve got it worked out and if you met helen shes so stunning no one would want to wander from her anyway its always a honeymoon whenever he comes home oh dear he hoped he hadnt landed rupert in it but somehow he wanted to convince janey that marriage to a show jumper wasnt impossible can we go and see the bull can you ride said billy gathering up the fruit from the pimms jug ive tried but i cant stay on when they start running billy grinned ill teach you they seemed to have spent an awfully long time over lunch the sun was already dropping shining into their eyes the bull was delighted with the pimms fruit why dont we go and look at your secret glade said janey all right said billy lets leave your notebook in the tackroom youre not going to need it there wasnt a breath of wind but the great heat of the day was beginning to subside smoky gray ash trees seemed to shiver in the stillness the cows were lying down and the young horses in the big field were trying to crowd into the shed to get away from the flies as they walked up the fields their hands occasionally brushed janey felt the corn stubble bristling against her sandals as the path narrowed she moved in front billy admired the length of her smooth and tanned legs the softness of her upper thighs beneath the white shorts made his throat go dry i always come up here when i am very happy or when i am very sad when i was dropped from the british team when i was picked for the olympics janey gave him another sidelong glance and picked a blackberry which do you feel now not sure thats up to you she didnt answer they had dropped down now to a little spring crowded with forgetmenots and pink campion which had almost dried up she noticed unlike me thought janey who could feel herself bubbling between her legs they came to a gate on the right was a mossy old wall skirting a poplar grove hell said billy looking down the path its overgrown with nettles youll get stung he added as janey clambered over the gate ill carry you no squeaked janey pulling away from him if only shed stuck to her diet last week and been down to her target nine stone shed have let him but nine stone seven was too heavy hed rupture himself well go back said billy reluctantly no said janey i need to see this enchanted glade where you seduced all those pony club groupies and lavinia greenslade billy construing this as rejection was suddenly cast down she was coming here so she could get some good quotes janey ran down the path thirty yards down on the left she found a willowfringed pool with its green banks completely secluded in the green gloom shed forgotten how much nettles hurt ow ow ow she moaned collapsing onto a bank tears stinging her eyelids white spots jumping up on her brown legs oh angel said billy you should have let me carry you your poor beautiful legs let me get some dock leaves he picked a handful green and smooth dipping them in the pool christ it hurts said janey through clenched teeth he lay down on the bank beside her there she said pointing to the outside calf of her right leg and the inside of her ankles thats better a bit higher billy crooning with contrition moved the dock leaves up to her knees i shouldnt have let you come down here oh yes you should said janey softly a bit higher his hand had reached the inside of her left thigh now his fingers were so gentle she could feel the damp cool of the dock leaves against her burning red legs higher she whispered as though acting on their own billys fingers crept up and dropped the dock leaves as he met a fuzz of damp pubic hair dividing around the skimpiest of pants he looked up and found her smiling at him through her tears enter these enchanted woods you who dare she said mockingly go on thats the only way you can cure the hurt oh christ janey he muttered feeling the moisture between her legs the next minute he had moved up the bank beside her putting his arms around her and kissing her almost reverently and she was kissing him back her tongue expertly caressing his tongue and the inside of his lips his hand found the wonderful generous breasts with the nipples hard as hazelnuts and he felt her draw in her stomach as his hand crept downwards she had exactly the right amount of flesh on her her hands were caressing his bare back her fingers burrowing in his hair jesus he said to himself incredulously this amazingly beautiful girl really wants me oh please god dont let me botch it up by coming too quickly he undid the buttons of her shirt with trembling hands and buried his face in the billowy cleavage breathing in her scent my nettle stings at the top need a bit more attention janey said with a gasp of laughter so he slid his hand underneath her pants finding her clitoris which was as hard as her nipples oh please go on please please she moaned then shuddered and gave a long contented sigh and he felt her throbbing to stillness come inside me i want you she said a moment later not yet his experience of outdoor screwing was that one always got worried about keepers crashing through the bracken and came too quickly but she wouldnt listen to him sitting up with her breasts tumbling undoing his belt with practiced skill jeans were really hell to get out of he thought like getting a woman out of a rollon and his cock stuck out through the hole in his pants so he had difficulty getting them off too after all her london lovers janey suddenly realized what a marvelous body billy had with the broad shoulders flat stomach and the incredibly muscular buttocks and thighs from riding so much god youre strong she said billy laughed you should try rupert when he squeezes a horse with his legs you can hear it groan ill never last a second he warned as he was sucked into the warm spongy whirlpool feeling her vaginal muscles gripping him feeling her hands caressing his buttocks moving with him im sorry i cant help it ive got to come for a few seconds he lay on top of her feeling the delicious warmth then he rolled off pulling up a handful of grass to wipe her dry janey grinned i hope there arent any nettles in it are they still murder much better im beginning to understand about the pleasurepain principle maybe de sade had a point he brushed a green beetle out of her hair sorry i came so quickly i should have been offended if you hadnt wouldnt have said much for my sex appeal anyway id already come once when you were stroking me so i could afford to be generous billy looked down at his flaccid cock a bad workman blames his tool he said he lit them both cigarettes to keep off the midges janey lay on her elbow looking up at him through halfclosed eyes how come you sell yourself so short when youre such a megastar billy shrugged ive always hunted in pairs with rupe so no ones likely to look at me when hes around so he usually gets the girls thats not what i heard janey combed her hand through his black chest hair i think youre stunning and i dont meet many girls like you i didnt want to rush my fences he put out a hand to bracket one of the brown breasts youre so beautiful he felt his cock rearing up like a kite i think i might hit better form this time or are the midges eating you id much rather something else ate me billy looked at her lascivious face mascarasmudged under her eyes crimson lipstick kissed away slowly she edged up the bank until her bush was level with his face oh she murmured as he rolled over and got to work oh sweet sweet william this is definitely the lap of honor billy laughed and carried on by the time they set off back to the house a huge red setting sun was spiked on the poplar copse like a balloon about to pop pigeons flapped towards the wood helen and rupert are back said billy come and say hello janey shook her head i must get home but you cant he said appalled youve only just come janey giggled you can say that again im not up to meeting anyone at the moment anyway theyre virtually inlaws you cant just go billy looked like a small boy left behind by his parents after the first day out from prep school im going to lisbon tomorrow he went on we havent talked about anything why dont you come with me ive got to work will you write to me ill be back for the horse of the year show on the first of october ill be back from america about the third or fourth you can leave a number with the features desk please dont go i cant bear it its been so perfect she said i dont want to come in and make polite conversation i must get back to london and write it all down before i forget it not all of it no the glades our secret see you at wembley and with that he had to be content he couldnt go straight into the house he walked round in a daze watching the sun set and the stars come out he couldnt believe it just as when he was a small boy he couldnt believe anyone as dazzling as rupert could choose him as a friend he walked into the kitchen to find helen rather ostentatiously clearing away the remains of lunch and heating a bottle for marcus im sorry helen lunch was marvelous badger didnt think so hes just thrown up most of the chicken and potato salad on our bedroom carpet you left the larder open and the fridge and the freezer and the butter in the sun are you in love or something the next day they set off for portugal greece then germany then back without a break for the horse of the year show at wembley it was the longest four weeks of billys life when he couldnt get janey on the telephone he nearly flew back he discussed her endlessly with rupert you know im hopeless at playing the field i want to marry her rupert looked thunderstruck you cant marry her you dont even know her ive spent a whole day with her you havent even screwed her yet i have too said billy sulkily and it was marvelous rupert looked even more disapproving then shes just a whore going to bed with you on the first date it wasnt even a date she came to interview you wormed it all out of you you wait until her piece appears billy lloydfoxe is not only a silver medalist he also gets the gold in the sack oh fuck off said billy furiously why dyou reduce everything to your own disgusting level the moment billy got back he rang the news desk at janeys paper to be told that she was away her interview with jack nicholson had taken longer than expected billy wondered miserably what form it had taken and she was expected back sometime that week now it was the fifth day of the horse of the year show and there was no sign of her he must have passed the competitors board fifty times a day in the hope of a message every time he saw a tawny mane of hair in the crowd his stomach disappeared his fears that shed been nice to him only because she wanted some good quotes were multiplied when he talked to joanna battie and dudley diplock did they know her he asked course i do said joanna shes her papers star writer hang gliding one week going into battle in a tank the next interviewing prince charles the next pretty highpowered stuff very pretty said billy very said dudley with a wolfish laugh puts herself about by all accounts fleet street claims she got to the top on her back on her front said joanna janeys much too liberated to accept the missionary position billy felt quite sick are you sure well lets say shes a bloody good journalist and like most of them shes not too particular how she gets her information they pay her well i reckon shes on twenty thou a year dont you joanna after a sleepless night billy talked to rupert as they exercised the horses rupert was reassuringly outraged for gods sake remember the things theyve said about you and me in the past even implying were a couple of fags you know its all fairy tales they make it up to excite themselves christ revenge is sluggish im going to have to nail up his box during the day to stop the public stuffing him with goodies at that moment humpty hamilton came waddling past in a pale blue quilted waistcoat hi sweet william he said and waddled on roaring with laughter next to come by was driffield hello great lover he sneered seen the paper finally as billy was handing the bull back to tracey lavinia rode into the practice ring hello sweet william she said an acid note creeping into her voice you have made a conquest heart thumping billy ran to the newsstand hi sweet william said the man behind the counter handing him a newspaper youve boosted my sales so much this morning you can have it for free billy retired behind a pillar janeys piece was in the middle opposite the leader page with a huge heading sweet sweet william and a picture of billy taken from an extremely flattering angle when i went to see billy lloydfoxe janey had written i took him a bunch of freesias they should have been sweet williams since he is easily the nicest man i have ever met then there was a lot of guff about his jeanpaul belmondo looks and his clinching the team silver and winning the kings cup then it ended we all know of his sympathy with animals his brilliant horsemanship and his ability to smile even in the bitterest defeat last year he admits he was heartbroken when his longstanding girlfriend lavinia greenslade married french hearthrob guy de la tour since then the only female in billys life has been mavis his blond mongrel who follows him everywhere bestowing a sliteyed expression of marked disapproval on any lady intruder billy lives with helen and rupert campbellblack and his soothing easygoing presence must be a great help in sustaining a somewhat volatile marriage but billy with characteristic modesty says he owes everything to rupert including money he adds with a smile he also has the highest praise for his chef dequipe martinet malise gordon and of course the bull who eats the fruit out of the pimms jug with whom he jumped a final clear in the team event to clinch the silver for britain he may only have got a silver but hes got a heart of gold i havent heard a bad word about him on the circuit after seven hours in his company all i can say is please give me back my heart billy our offices are open to accept parcels twentyfour hours a day billy read it incredulously over and over and over again it was a love letter he rushed to the telephone there was still no answer at janeys flat the features desk said shed got back last night and was racing to finish the nicholson piece and had probably switched off her telephone billy couldnt bear it he had to see her he told rupert he was going into london for a couple of hours well dont be too long said rupert grinning youre obviously better in the sack than i thought and whats this about my somewhat volatile marriage what does volatile mean that im always out on the tiles billy took a taxi to janeys flat it was a long time before she answered compared with her glamorously tawny appearance before she looked pale and black under the eyes and rather unadorned like a sitting room the day after the christmas cards are taken down billy she said how lovely to see you she didnt sound as though it was at all im sorry to barge in but ive missed you like hell she backed away nervously darling im terribly sorry i cant stop the office want jack nicholson by tomorrow lunchtime so ill have to work all night surely you can stop for five minutes i cant honestly ive got complete brain freeze ive just got to crack it the piece you wrote about me it was so kind and ludicrously flattering she smiled looking suddenly more like the janey whod come down to penscombe did they run it today they must have held it back for the horse of the year i filed the copy weeks ago and perhaps she feels quite differently about me now thought billy he was dying to ask about jack nicholson instead he said its the last night tomorrow will you have dinner with me afterwards i dont know im supposed to be dining with some mp as a preliminary interview what time dyou finish about eleven but im off to washington new york and toronto on monday and i must see you you must go now but i really will try and make it tomorrow ill leave a ticket at the gate janey i love but shed shut the door on him billy was filled with black despair she hadnt seemed pleased to see him dismayed in fact and rather guilty and not looking him in the eye if shed filed that copy weeks ago she was bound to have met someone else in america back in her flat janey henderson felt equally suicidal her vanity wouldnt allow her to explain to billy that shed already been home for fortyeight hours on a crash diet in order to look ravishing for him on saturday night hed caught her at the worst possible moment shed been writing and hadnt got dressed or had a bath or used deodorant for two days her body had that rank smell of fear and sweat that always drenched her when she was wrestling with a piece she was convinced her breath smelt from her allmeat diet she hadnt shaved her legs since shed last seen him her hair was filthy she was sure she had dandruff and she couldnt meet his eyes because hed caught her with unplucked eyebrows and no makeup also her ginger cat harold evans had been sick in the bathroom that morning and she hadnt had time to clean it up the flat looked a tip because her cleaner had walked out while she was away and the neighbor whod come to feed harold evans had failed to change his litter box hardly a lovers bower janey knew she ought to go back and wrestle with jack nicholson instead she reread the proof of the piece on billy she had actually lied to him and had only telephoned the corrections through the previous night it really was rather good and he looked even more gorgeous just now in a battered barbour he must have masses of girls after him she mustnt seem too keen shed lusted and lost too often over the last ten years she was in fact twentynine that was another lie shed told billy would he ever trust her when he found out janey henderson came from a respectable uppermiddleclass family her father had been in advertising her kind easygoing mother had stayed at home brought up the children and encouraged them to have careers but never taught them how to do anything around the house janey the baby of the family had been the most successful she possessed a strong sex drive which led her into trouble but was bourgeois enough to be paranoid about being talked about used to adoration at home she expected it from her lovers and in order to keep them happy she would tell lies and when they rumbled her and grew angry she tended to move on to another one who could be fooled for a few weeks that she was absolutely perfect her father doted on her and if she had any troubles with landladies or bills or angry bosses shed run to him in the old days he had always bailed her out but since his advertising agency had folded in the economic collapse of he suddenly found himself very short of money janey henderson was attracted to power as a journalist she had racketed around and met endless stars she had mixed with the rich and famous and longed to live like they did she was a good if sloppy writer an inspired listener who was able to sift out the minutia that mattered a teenager in the swinging sixties she had enjoyed the fruits of the permissive society and benefited in her career from the rise of the womens movement she had also seen her girlfriends trying to do their own thing raising their consciousness and their husbands blood pressure finally walking out on these husbands and then being absolutely miserable as single parents at twentynine janey realized there was nothing one needed more than a good man she wanted to settle down and have children she had seen ruperts beautiful house and assumed that servants and land and unlimited pimms were all the normal perks of a showjumpers life janey also longed to be a more serious writer if she married billy she could be more selective producing one piece a month instead of two or three a week and could even write books janey henderson pondered on these things the sight of the blank page in the olivetti and the mess in the flat brought her back to earth there was no mp to be interviewed tomorrow night if she had to hand in copy at lunchtime she reckoned it would take her till late evening to clean the flat and make herself look ravishing harold evans was weaving furrily round her ankles demanding lunch i must take you away from all this squalor harold said janey picking him up how would you like to live in gloucestershire back at wembley billy was inconsolable despite the fact that rupert had good news of a possible sponsor he approached me to test the water i said youd need at least a year to stay on the road what a lot of money what does he make cat food the bull wont have to eat it will he no but he might have to change his name to moggie meal charlie or something christ whats this sponsor like oh frightful thatched hair jangling initial bracelets frilled duck egg blue evening shirts firm handshakes fake american accent and calls you by your christian name every second sentence whats his name kevin coley rather suitable under the circs puts a lot of himself into his products billy grinned whats in it for him social mountaineering hes made his pile and now he wants upmarket fun and some smart friends he thinks you have tremendous charisma glad someone does said billy gloomily he wont much longer if the bull goes on knocking down fences i think you should talk to him said rupert fifty grand a years not to be sniffed at your mothers not likely to croak for at least twenty years and i thought you wanted to marry that girl after today i dont think shell have me billy was sure that janey wouldnt turn up the following night even his horoscope was ambiguous it warned pisces subjects to watch out for fireworks and make travel plans in the evening it had been the germans wembley hotfoot from the olympics and their double gold they had jackbooted their way through the week winning every big class except the sunday times cup which had gone to rupert on the last night the crowd was really hungry for a british victory the big class was the victor ludorum a tworound competition in which riders with double clears jumped off against the clock for rupert jumped clear in the first round and so did billy although he was very lucky the bull rapped every fence and had the upright swinging back and forth like a metronome on lente but he didnt bring it down and the crowd went wild they had given him and the bull a colossal welcome whenever hed come into the ring that week but each time dudley diplock had announced them as that great olympic combination billy lloydfoxe riding the bull the little horse had raised two hoofs at the commentary box and knocked up a cricket score he was tired after a long season tonight however he felt more bouncy youve got to win billy urged him to impress janey if she comes now billy sat in the riders stand biting his nails watching rupert jump his second round revenge was also a bit tired he flattened twice and had eight faults at the combination and a brick out of the wall as he came out of the ring rupert patted revenge consolingly determined to refute any charges of cruelty knowing the television cameras were still on him billy met him in the collecting ring just wait till i get this bugger back to his stable said rupert im going to beat the hell out of him hes had a long year protested billy think how well he did in the sunday times cup he did hope the honeymoon between rupert and revenge wasnt over as he mounted the bull to warm him up over a couple of practice fences he could hear dudley diplock waxing lyrical over ludwigs second clear thats that dudley moore said a fat woman who was leaning over the rail to her friend hes done the commentary here for years billy felt desperately low janey was obviously not coming his mind was a complete blank he couldnt remember the course or how many strides there were between any of the fences the bull clouted the practice fence for gods sake pick your bloody feet up snapped billy with unusual irritation the bull looked martyred and limped a few paces as billy turned him to jump it again he heard a voice calling hello william and there she was her lovely hair all tortoiseshell and lionlike as it had been at penscombe she was wearing a black and gray striped silk rugger shirt with a white collar and very tight black trousers billy found it impossible to wipe the silly grin off his face as he trotted across the collecting ring towards her you made it god thats wonderful and you look bloody marvelous was the mp furious you ditched him livid i dont blame him i heard ruperts out already she said ive just passed a stand absolutely hung with whips spurs boots and strange leather devices exactly like a tarts store cupboard i dont know what you get up to in show jumping really i dont billy laughed janey patted the bull im sorry i was a bit offish yesterday im always awful when im working did you finish the piece yes she shot him a sly look it wasnt nearly as complimentary as the one about you number fortythree shouted the collecting ring steward wheres number fortythree billee theyre calling you shouted hans schmidt for the last time number fortythree i think theyre calling you said janey billy came down to earth oh my god so they are dont move i wont be long i want to watch you stop coffeehousing said rupert and get into the ring oh thank goodness rupe this is janey will you get her a drink and look after her till i get back how dyou do said janey i hear you had two legs out of the combination it sounds awfully rude oh please billy prayed as he rode into the ring dont let her fall for him he must concentrate but joy seemed to surge along the reins and the bull bounced round the course rapping nothing and the crowd went berserk as billy pulled off the only british double clear well done said janey who was sitting in the riders stand with rupert clutching a large vodka and tonic you were marvelous and you got a bigger ovation than the rolling stones she giggled i asked rupert who that fat man in the ring with a tape measure was he said hes the course builder i said how did he know he was coarse you do have the most extraordinary terminology in show jumping what on earths a rustic pole shed obviously made a hit with rupert who generally didnt like people taking the piss out of the sport there were six riders in the jumpoff three germans wishbone count guy and finally billy ludwig went first and jumped a very fast clear from then onwards there were no clears until hans schmidt came in theyre so controlled those german horses youd never think they could motor said janey look at his stride twice as long as the bulls said rupert hans incredibly knocked two seconds off ludwigs time cutting every corner billy wont make it asked janey i dont think so the bull simply isnt fast enough hans came out a broad grin on his round face beat zat he said as billy rode into the ring and here comes billy lloydfoxe on the bull our olympic silver medalist riding for great britain said dudley trying to be heard over the cheers must be hell having to jump while youre having a shit said janey the cheers continued as the bull circled his fluffy noseband like a blob of shaving cream cantering along on his strong little legs bottom lip flapping ears waggling taking in the applause billy gave him a pat he was a medieval knight jousting for janeys hand if he wins everythingll be all right and hell ask me to marry him said janey crossing both fingers as the bell rang the cheering started as he rose to the first fence it increased and it increased in a steady crescendo as he cleared each fence riding for his life as he turned for the last two fences the double and then the huge wall billy glanced at the clock realizing he was in with a chance the cheer rose to a mighty roar and the whole crowd rose to its feet as one to bellow him home the bull was over the double and hurtled over the wall nearly crashing into the side of the arena before billy could pull him up the ten thousand crowd turned to the clock billy turned around putting his hands over his eyes as he took them away a mighty roar took the roof off he had won by a tenth of a second the scenes that followed were worthy of a cup final people were leaping over the stands into the arena rushing forward to cheer and pat the bull spectators were throwing hats cushions handbags into the arena rupert looked at janey and saw all her mascara had run wasnt he wonderful she said you do love him dont you she nodded getting out a paper handkerchief well mind you look after him billy and the bull got another deafening round of applause as they came into the ring to collect their rosette then the band played little white bull and the bull very smug after all the attention bucketed round the ring twice deliberately keeping within the circle of the spotlight afterwards billy came up to see janey you were so wonderful she said ive never been so proud in my life what an absolutely sweet horse he is from all sides people were congratulating billy but he had eyes only for janey look ive got to go back into the ring for the personality parade will you be all right how did you get on with rupert great but hes not nearly as attractive as you billy blushed he must have been pulling his punches the cavalcade that brings the horse of the year show to an end must be the most moving event in the equestrian calendar among the celebrities were little stroller and two of the police horses whod displayed exceptional bravery in an ira incident followed by ponies hacks and hunters the heavy horses and finally the olympic team then malise not without a tremor of emotion in his voice read out ronald duncans beautiful poem to the horse and janey found herself in floods of tears again what a wonderful dashing romantic colorful world she was moving into she thought after three large vodka and tonics on an empty stomach as billy came out to the collecting ring a man came up to him whom he instantly recognized from ruperts description as kevin coley bill lloydfoxe he said pumping him by the hand kev coley billy was almost blinded by his jewelry i think rupes spoken about me of course said billy trying not to laugh he was most impressed so was i by tonights win great stuff bill great stuff im ready to talk terms why dont we have dinner together billys heart sank well actually ive got someone with me bring her too said kev expansively my wife enids up in the stands the girls can chat while we talk business suddenly they were interrupted by an old lady tears pouring down her face oh mr lloydfoxe i read in the paper you were thinking of turning professional you wont sell the bull will you billy smiled of course not ive bought him some polos she got a dusty packet covered in face powder out of her bag gosh thats terribly kind of you said billy dont you worry your head maam said kevin coley if bill turns professional hell never have to sell the bull billy found janey in the lorry repairing her face tracey had already hung the rosettes up on the string across the window darling i cried my eyes out it was so chokemaking she mustnt hug him too hard or her new trousers might rip sweetheart do you mind if we go out to dinner with a man who wants to sponsor me no yes i do i want to be alone with you and see the conquering hero come putting her hand down she touched his cock suddenly billy realized that if he married this wonderful girl he could sleep with her every night for the rest of his life we can do that later on he said it just means that if i pull this deal off i can ask you to marry me rupert joined them wearing a dark suit and smelling of aftershave i hear youve met up with medallion man he said then in an undertone to billy do you mind frightfully saying that i had dinner with you all tonight if helen asks i am sure she wont where are you off to said billy well do you remember a little unfinished business called tiffany bathgate and added as billy looked disapproving and anyway i thought id make myself scarce in case you and janey wanted to use the lorry later at four oclock in the morning billy lay in janeys arms in the double bed in her flat they had just made love and he was thinking how beautifully she kept the place there were clean dark blue sheets on the bed and three bunches of freesias on the bedside table had driven out any smell of cat what a glorious talented creature she was ouch he said trying not to wake her as harold evans kneaded his stomach billy she said theres something ive got to tell you promise you wont hate me for it billys heart sank the lovely iridescent soap bubble was about to burst im twentynine not twentyfour she went on billy started to laugh with sheer relief is that all i wouldnt have minded if youd said fortyfour are you sure you wont find it infra dig to marry a younger man billy found himself very nervous about telling helen he was getting married rupert had been no problem in fact rupert and janey both experienced passionate relief that they enormously liked but didnt fancy one another they were too alike perhaps and rupert having set up the sponsorship which enabled billy to marry janey and start his own yard felt he had masterminded the whole affair which mitigated any jealousy nothing would happen in a hurry anyway billy would have to find somewhere to live and although it might be difficult to go on being partners if billy were a professional rupert was sure they could work something out although it would be a struggle financially rupert wasnt prepared to turn professional until hed had another stab at a gold medal in los angeles in four years time helen however was shattered when she heard the news without billy the precarious balance of their marriage would surely be destroyed he was so sweet to marcus and he could always jolly rupert out of a bad mood by making him laugh nor did the two women really take to each other after billy and rupert returned from their american trip billy brought janey down for the weekend both girls were set back on their heels by the glamour of the other janey never expected helen to be that beautiful helen didnt expect janey to be that sexy janey had never worn a bra and her clothes were always a little too tight because she kept falling by the wayside on her diets and her shirts and dresses were always done up a button too low helens were always buttoned up to the neck after six years in fleet street janey was virtually unshockable and during dinner on the friday she arrived kept both rupert and billy in stitches providing wildly inaccurate lowdown on the sex lives of leading public figures helen had taken great trouble to cook a superb dinner crab pancakes in cheese sauce gigot of lamb and the most perfect quince sorbet it was a good technique if one wanted to establish a reputation as a brilliant cook reflected janey to serve very small helpings as helen did so everyone wanted seconds janey not having eaten all day was starving and had thirds of everything praising helen like mad everyone drank a lot janey got happily tight how nice thought rupert to find a woman with such an appetite hed never admired lavinia she was a drip janey was fun and tough she would be good for billy between helen and janey there was also professional jealousy janey asked helen about her novel helen said it was coming on very very slowly im an academic you see and im not prepared to put up with anything secondrate why dont you try journalism asked janey helen said she didnt really feel she could bring herself to do anything like that shed never read the post but shed heard it was very sensational janey registered the snub and said that in her experience writers who were any good wrote ive got a book coming out in the spring she said a collection of interviews i just got the piece i did on you in at the end darling she added to billy she and billy were so in love they couldnt keep their hands off each other helen wistfully tried to remember the time when she and rupert were like that the attempt at a second honeymoon after the olympics had not lasted very long marcus was brought down and admired and fed how can such goodlooking parents produce such a hideous baby thought janey but realizing it would endear her to helen she asked if she could give marcus his bottle billy tells me youre getting a nanny well a girl said helen itll mean i can spend more time with rupert she must try to like this selfconfident sexy creature im so pleased youre getting married to billy she said when they were alone hes so darling but hes kind of vulnerable too you will look after him wont you strange rupert said the same thing said janey i actually hope hes going to look after me everyone else thought janey was marvelous the dogs the grooms marcus miss hawkins mrs bodkin for whom janey left a fiver there was a bad moment however when janey was changing for dinner on saturday night and couldnt be bothered to go down the passage to the loo instead she got a chair and was crouching over the basin having a pee when helen walked in to turn down the beds helen was shocked rigid and even more annoyed that rupert thought it was very funny janey sensitive as radar realized helen didnt approve of her shes a bit linedskirtandpetticoat or halfslip as shed call it isnt she she said to billy i bet she makes love in long rubber gloves billy laughed but he refused to bitch about helen we really must look for a house very soon said janey rupert persuaded helen to give a party at penscombe for billy and janey as shed done up the house so beautifully he said it would be nice for everyone to see it and they hadnt had a party since their marriage she wouldnt have to do any work theyd get in caterers and as the drawing room wasnt big enough for dancing theyd hire a marquee the party would be held in the middle of december just before the olympia christmas show so all the foreign riders would be in the country there were frightful arguments over the guest list all the showjumping fraternity had to be asked but not malise gordon or colonel roxborough i dont want any grownups said rupert oh we must have malise protested helen hes so civilized he wasnt very civilized when ivor braine took the wrong course in the nations cup last week if he comes hell start telling me to go to bed early because ive got a class next year you ought to ask him said billy hed be awfully hurt oh all right but im not asking jake lovell his fat wife wouldnt get through the door by the time theyd included janeys fleet street friends and most of the celebrities she had interviewed who knew rupert and billy anyway as well as all ruperts smart friends the numbers were up to three hundred rupert flipped through the final selection ive slept with practically every woman on this list gives me a feeling of déjà vu he said to billy you havent slept with hilary shes not coming bloody is according to mrs b shes been round a lot recently rupert furious stormed off to find helen either that woman doesnt come to the party or i dont all your friends are coming said helen i dont see why i shouldnt have one of mine shell bring that disgusting baby and start whipping out a triangular tit in the middle of the party hilary is not just a good painter shes a highly intelligent concerned human being crap said rupert all right ill ask all the grooms then you cant said helen aghast they can never hold their drink a week before the party while rupert and billy were in amsterdam the au pair marieclaire slipped on the yellow stone steps in the hall and landed painfully on her coccyx the next day hilary slipped carrying kate but managed to keep her balance helen suddenly decided to carpet the hall and the stairs a pale avocado green to match the pale pink and green peony wallpaper the carpet men worked overtime the dogs sat in a martyred row on the tintacked underfelt and everything was finished and tidied away by the eve of the party when rupert and billy were due home helen had just got marcus to sleep when they arrived and woke him up with all the din of barking neighing shouting and the banging down of lorry ramps why the hell did they make so much noise she had to spend a quarter of an hour soothing and rocking marcus back to sleep and went downstairs to the kitchen just as rupert was coming in through the back door there was snow in his hair hello darling he said kissing her you all right i see the marquees up everyones coming the germans the french team the italians all the irish its a complete sellout go and get a drink theres a surprise for you in the hall said helen rupert went out there was a long pause the new carpet was so soft helen didnt hear him come back his face was expressionless do you like it i didnt know marcus could be that sick said rupert that carpet is exactly the same color as regurgitated heinz pea and bacon dinner what the fuck have you done helen bridled its called pistachio pissedtachio after everyones spilt red wine over it tomorrow night said rupert the steps were a death trap snapped helen pity your friend hilary didnt fall down them more often thats cotswold stone youve just covered up those steps were dangerous marcusll be walking in a few months hell walk right out of the house when he sees that carpet well everyone thinks its very pretty helens voice was rising mrs bodkin marieclaire thats only because you pay them who else thrillary i suppose expect its her idea matches her complexion it was in fact a great party rupert and billy mixed a champagne cocktail to start off with which with one and a half hours solid drinking before dinner got everyone plastered janey looking sensational in seethrough black was such a hit with all the foreign riders that billy put her on a leading rein and screaming with laughter towed her around after him their happiness was totally infectious even driffield couldnt find anything to grumble about only helen in priceless ivy green silk a boatshaped neckline showing off her slender white shoulders seemed tense she was not a natural hostess and she was only too aware of all the biancas and granias and gabriellas of ruperts past nor could she bear to see drink rings spreading like olympic symbols on her furniture and cigarette ash and wine stains on her new carpet rupert tried to persuade her to enjoy herself but once dinner was over he felt he could relax his duties as host people knew where they could get a drink from then on he was seen coming off the dance floor with one beauty after another hilary arrived late armed with a carrycot she marched down the hall sending international show jumpers flying and up the stairs straight up to my wifes bedroom said rupert sourly next moment helen went past with a babys bottle is that for hilary marcus is crying you should have sent him to mrs bodkin where the hells marieclaire she disappeared into the shrubbery with one of the french team two hours ago and hasnt been seen since snapped helen i told you the drink was too strong upstairs helen collected marcus and went into the bedroom where she found hilary combing her hair oh you look beautiful she gasped hilary had been to the hairdressers and had her dark hair set in wild snaky curls round her face she had rouged her cheekbones and kohled her eyes and was wearing a red and black gypsy dress with a flounced skirt and hooped earrings i never dreamed you could look so wonderful helen said in genuine amazement i wanted to prove to your bloody husband i wasnt a complete frump said hilary ive even shaved under my armpits she held up her arms showing not a trace of stubble and i absolutely hate myself well i sure appreciate you said helen hilary drenching herself in helens miss dior said hows it going sounds wild enough im not great at parties rupert shouldnt subject you to them what did he say about the carpet he hated it why did the conversation always return to rupert wondered helen the excitement had stepped up when they went downstairs ludwig was blowing a hunting horn billy plastered and blissful was necking on the sofa with janey mavis curled up beside them looking resigned come and dance helen said humpty hamilton who was wearing one of ruperts tweed caps back to front you havent met hilary have you said helen at that moment rupert came off the dance floor with a ruffled blonde evening he said to hilary without any warmth doesnt hilly look lovely said helen rupert looked her up and down rather like one of jake lovells relations next moment a very drunken hans staggered up and bore helen off to dance what a beautiful place you have ere mees helen what a beautiful woman you are he sighed lucky rupert in front of them in the crepuscular gloom she could see count guy wrapped like a wet towel round marieclaire so it was that member of the french team she thought wondering if she ought to stop them poor laveenia hans shook his head i bet she weesh she marry billee now but what a beauty hes got heemself what a beautiful girl yes shes very nice did you know ludwigs geeving billee a horse as a vedding present a very good one mandryka count guys arm was up to his elbow down marieclaires dress really she couldnt be a very suitable person to look after marcus thought helen over in the corner she saw hilary dancing with malise they were talking intently that was good theyd get on together the party ground on the local mfh trying to find his way home drove over the haha podge was sick in the flower bed helen was dancing with billy his hair all over the place its a wonderful party angel i cant tell you how grateful i am youve made janey so welcome she cant get over it i say theres hilary doing the tango with ludwig shes looking really very sexy this evening and you know im not her greatest fan billy went back to janey as an excuse to escape from the party for a second helen decided to check if marcus was okay there were wine stains all over her beautiful carpet why couldnt they all go so she could get the place straight again in the hall rupert was talking to hans and a couple of italians when hed drunk too much he seldom betrayed it but his eyes tended to glitter now they were like sapphires under a burglars flashlight where are you going he said not turning around just to check marcus if he doesnt shut up ill come upstairs and ram a cricket stump up his arse quivering with rage helen fled upstairs how could rupert say terrible things like that just to get a laugh when marcus was so darling despite the din he was still fast asleep whoops and yells from downstairs made her rush out onto the landing hanging over the stairs she heard rupert saying to a rather pale podge go on darling go and get him mrs cb wont like it shell have to lump it podge opened the front door helen could see a flurry of snowflakes and she was gone you cant rupert said janey half laughing dont be a sod not on helens new carpet its taken quite enough punishment as it is helen went back and turned off marcuss light what could they be talking about she powdered her nose and combed her hair oh god she was tired if only she could go to bed and read mansfield park then she heard more cheers and a commotion downstairs for a minute she thought she must be dreaming for there was revenge in the hall and rupert was jumping onto his back riding into the drawing room to colossal cheers and screams of laughter blazing with fury she ran down the stairs what the hell are you doing she screamed over the laughter no one heard twentyfive pounds you cant jump that sofa said count guy done said rupert and the next moment hed cleared it narrowly missing the chandelier rupert screamed helen what are you doing on that horse everyone suddenly went quiet no partys complete without revenge said rupert and popped him back over the sofa get him out of here she screamed hysterically out out out all right said rupert but as revenge came into the hall unnerved no doubt by the occasion he crapped extensively which was greeted by howls of mirth i think hes trying to say he doesnt like your new carpet said rupert helen gave a scream of horror and fled upstairs throwing herself down on her bed sobbing her heart out how could he do this to her how could he how could he malise met hilary at the bottom of the stairs they had already had a long discussion about the campbellblack marriage and knew whose side they were on go to her said malise at once ill see someone clears up this mess hilary found helen a sodden heap on the bed i cant bear it i cant bear it why does he humiliate me like that i dont know dear hilary stroked her hair hes a monster as i keep telling you youre exhausted take a couple of pills and go to sleep ill help you get undressed just as she had got a still sobbing helen out of her clothes and was fetching her nightgown from under the pillow rupert walked in get out he said to hilary i might have guessed youd be here ive just given your wife a couple of sleeping pills now leave her alone she cant go to sleep shes the hostess you stop being a hostess after something like that how could you do that to her youre the most uncaring man ive ever met it was a joke and for a bet said rupert tonelessly all the mess has been cleared up theres not a mark on the carpet now get out please stay sobbed helen im not leaving till you fall asleep dear said hilary oh for christs sake exploded rupert storming out of the room helen surprisingly was so exhausted she fell asleep almost immediately hilary stayed a few minutes folding up her clothes and tidying the room and her own appearance switching off the light she quietly closed the door then moving down the landing checked first marcus and then kate out on the landing she found rupert waiting with a glass in his hand his hatred was almost palpable theyre all asleep no thanks to you she said downstairs they could hear a tantivy the band was playing the post horn gallop rupert stooped to pat badger who was trembling he hated rows and was rising like a souffleé out of one of the jack russells baskets why do you drool over that dog and neglect helen whats she ever done to you rupert stood up she was perfectly happy before you came along and started breastfeeding her this feminist crap thats not true she was nearly dying when i first met her and you werent even there i happened to be trapped in one of the worst blizzards of the winter not much i could do about it you grumble that she has no friends and then when she finds one you insult her you always treat me as if i dont exist perhaps you dont i detest women that come on like supergirl and you detest me he said coming towards her breathing in the hot feral sweat of her body because your pratt of a husband couldnt even satisfy a hamster dont you dare say anything against crispin screamed hilary you have to go round poisoning other peoples marriages rupert went on well bloody well stay away from helen she needs a few allies not like you she doesnt he was taunting her now i know what your game is you liked undressing her didnt you shes beautiful isnt she and youve been running after her as fast as your unshaven legs can carry you you bloody dyke well she wont enjoy it shes not very keen on that sort of thing next minute hilary had slapped him very hard across the face without a thought rupert hit her back even harder she burst into tears and somehow a second later she was in his arms and he was kissing her forcing her mouth open frantically she struggled flailing her fists against his back so much broader and more muscled than crispins suddenly she relaxed mouth separating and was kissing him back even more fiercely i hate you she sobbed you dont you want me like hell youve wanted me ever since you saw me at gloucester hospital thats why youve been smarming over helen all this time youre a brute of course he took her hair and yanked her head back so he could kiss her again fingers splayed on her back his thumbs caressed her shaven armpits thats a great improvement he said softly it was getting so long you could have plaited it he drew back the landing curtain the snow was three inches thick on the window ledge and still coming down we mustnt she said pulling away from him its so unsupportive not nearly as unsupportive as youre going to be he whispered evilly im going hunting tomorrow get rid of crispin after lunch he can take germaine tobogganing for an hour or so unable to face the hassle of a big wedding billy married janey in gloucester registry office at the beginning of january thus forfeiting the large number of wedding presents which are so useful to a couple setting up house rupert was best man helen was disappointed that they didnt even bother to have the marriage blessed in penscombe church but billy felt that first year with janey that the gods were blessing him anyway never had he been so happy just before they married janey negotiated a fat deal with her paper that she would write a series of racy interviews around the world which enabled her to travel with billy on the circuit all expenses paid from antwerp to paris to madrid to athens to new york her portable typewriter gathered airline stickers as she talked to presidents rock stars and distinguished tax exiles often there were tensions when she had to file her weekly piece a sweating tearful teethgritting janey bashing away at her typewriter in some foreign hotel bedroom wasnt conducive to billy getting any sleep before a big class nor did janey hopelessly unpunctual endear herself to other members of the team by making them late for dinners and parties billy was too besotted to notice his horses were going well mandryka the dark brown hanoverian ludwig von schellenberg had given as a wedding present upgraded himself incredibly quickly and was showing all the makings of being as great a horse as the bull or moggie meal al as he was now renamed billy winced but not much at a year from kevin coley it was worth wincing for anyway he was still the same bull in the stable in fact in that first year of marriage janey and billy were extremely rich janeys salary plus expenses plus billys steady winnings plus kevins sponsorship added up to nearly a year and although billy was always buying rupert drinks and gave helen his winnings for housekeeping when he hadnt spent them celebrating gas electricity telephone and heating bills at penscombe were invariably picked up by rupert when they were in england billy and janey lived with helen and rupert and muttered vaguely about househunting in the end it was again part of ruperts colossal generosity towards billy that he let them have lime tree place an enchanting but dilapidated seventeenthcentury cottage on the penscombe estate which had just become vacant on condition they pay for doing it up planning permission had to be obtained to extend the kitchen and build on a dining room two more bedrooms and a nursery being twentynine janey hoped to start a baby almost immediately in time they would turn the moldering mossencrusted outbuildings into stabling for a dozen horses helen came down to the cottage and talked a lot about closet space and knocking down walls and inspired by the beauty of penscombe janey felt there was no need to spare any expense for janey and billy that first year seemed effortless because at home they were backed up by helens clockwork domestic routine which ironed billys breeches washed his shirts remembered to get his red coats and dinner jackets back from the cleaners and by miss hawkins who saw that billys entry forms were sent off and bills were paid and appointments put in the diary for janeys liking they had spent rather too much time with kevin and enid coley who flew out to several of the foreign shows and were always hanging about at wembley crittleden and olympia billy made excuses for kevin saying he was merely proud that billys horses were going so well and particularly that moggie meal al came second in the european championships in paris and if kevin did tell billy how to ride and malise exactly how to run the british team billy felt malise was perfectly capable of taking care of himself janey was rather less tolerant as a wedding present the coleys gave them a large china poodle lifting its leg on a lamppost janey wrote enid a gushing letter of thanks and put the poodle in the cellar there were also too many invitations to visit château kitsch as janey called kevins mock tudor castle in sunningdale where there was lots of horseplay and one was likely to be pushed into the heated swimming pool at any moment but on the way home they enjoyed lots of giggles about the electric toadstools that lit up on either side of the drive at night and the huge luminous moggie meal cat symbol outside the front door which winked and meowed when you pressed the doorbell and the button in kevins den which had merely to be pushed for the entire leatherbound works of dickens and scott to slide back revealing a bar offering every drink known to man janey reared in fleet street could drink even billy under the table looking out of the window one evening helen saw them coming up the drive hysterical with laughter as billy pretended to lift his leg on every chestnut tree billys being kevins china poodle explained janey christ my feet are killing me we ran out of petrol and had to walk from stroud helen had mixed feelings about janey in the end you couldnt help liking her she was fun and marvelously iconoclastic about show jumping but she was a bit too easy to talk to any secret confided would be round penscombe and fleet street in a flash and janey was so messy wandering round the house with her cat harold evans riding like a parrot on her shoulder eyes screwed up against the cigarette smoke spilling ash and leaving a trail of dirty cups and after midday glasses helen so fastidious couldnt bear the fact that janey kept pinching her perfume and makeup and borrowing her clothes there was an embarrassing occasion when helen and rupert were away for the weekend and janey borrowed one of helens dresses to go out to dinner with the coleys and split it not even down the seam so it was beyond repair even worse was the time helen came downstairs ashen because her mink coat given to her by rupert on their second anniversary was missing she was about to ring the police when janey suggested they look round the house first isnt this it bundled up in the downstairs loo janey announced rather casually two minutes later mrs bodkin must have brought it down for refurbishing haha thats a joke or something it was unfortunate that janey had left three toffee papers and a program for a michael frayn play that had been on in bath in the pocket helen was very upset but too nice to shout at janey instead she went to church and asked god to make her more tolerant occasionally janey cooked but made such a mess in the kitchen that it took helen twice as long to clear up afterwards and she wished janey wouldnt take books out on her library tickets read them in the bath and forget to return them or even worse lose them abroad helen whod never kept a library book too long and always renewed them was upset and bustled in a way billy and janeys presence helped rupert and helens marriage rupert tended not to be so intolerant if the others were there but in another way their happiness showed up the flaws rupert was wildly jealous of the love helen lavished on marcus im so enjoying him she kept saying as though marcus was a quadruple vodka and tonic said janey he was also envious of the relaxed hedonistic relationship billy had with janey when had helen ever got tight with him when had they last been hysterical with laughter he heard the giggles and gasps of pleasure issuing from their bedroom mrs bodkin was always finding empty bottles under the bed janey helen thought brought out the worst in billy she encouraged him to drink more bet more always dine out rather than eat at home billy more emotional and physically less strong than rupert couldnt cope with such excess the blatant sexuality of the relationship unnerved helen too billy and janey were always sloping off to bed you only had to look at janeys washing on the line mrs bodkins mouth disappeared in disapproval at the black and scarlet crotchless knickers the cutout bras the gstrings suspender belts and fishnet stockings janey careless and thoughtless left her vibrator in their unmade bed which was found by mrs bodkin billys got a bad back its for massaging his spine explained janey airily mrs bodkin was not convinced janey was a minx helen and janeys attitudes to each other were ambiguous janey was jealous of helens beauty helen even looked gorgeous in a bath cap and billy would never say a word against her helen spurred on by janeys fame and journalistic success started working on her novel again she talks as if shes writing hamlet grumbled janey it irritated the hell out of janey that helen was always slightly dismissive of janeys journalism she never commented on janeys pieces even if they were spread across two pages of the paper even when she produced her much praised interview with kissinger entitled youre only as good as your last peace helen merely said when pestered that she didnt feel janey had quite captured the full weight of kissinger it was part of her puritan upbringing that you must never praise if you didnt admire but in this instance duty became a pleasure she doesnt mean it bitchily billy kept protesting oh she does buster she does said janey grimly helen in fact was jealous of janey for being so sexy occasionally she worried that billy rupert and janey spent so much time abroad together rupert did little to dispel this fear it diverted any suspicions she might have had about him and hilary show jumping and rupert changed during the midseventies as the sport became more popular and sponsorship increased so did the prize money before the showjumping season had lasted from april to october now riders could jump all the year round and because of the number of indoor evening shows they were kept busy by night as well as by day when he started in the sport rupert would buzz off to argentina to play polo or go racing at longchamps or skiing at klosters now show jumping had become an allconsuming passion always on the circuit he was jumping his horses so hard he wore them out in a year or so and as a result was endlessly searching for new ones if he was at home he was training horses or selling them on horses took over his life so determined was he not to turn professional podge traveled with him adoring satisfying his physical needs suffering but not sulking if something better took his fancy and on the rare occasions he was back in gloucestershire there was hilary ranting cantankerous and insatiable but exerting a horrible fascination over him after the party for janey and billy helen retreated into herself becoming more and more houseproud spending her time rubbing female fingerprints off rupert said janey helen spent a great deal of money on clothes and at the hairdressers and did a lot for charity hilary didnt help for her own good reasons she kept urging helen to walk out on rupert you are a talented writer inhibited by a fascist pig virtually a oneparent family what support does he give you looking after marcus she demanded unlimited funds helen had to admit truthfully our parents generation sacrificed their careers for marriage went on hilary you mustnt make such sacrifices it is impossible to be happily married a good mother and have a career helen hoped she was a good mother she was certainly an adoring one marcus was walking now and his first word was mummy and he had several teeth he had grown into a beautiful child shy with huge solemn eyes and a riot of titian curls which rupert was always urging helen to cut marcus was wary of rupert who was not amused by jammy fingers on clean white breeches or by the fact that marcus screamed his head off if ever rupert put him onto a horse calm and sunny when his father was away marcus picked up the vibes from helen and became whiny and demanding on his return another bone of contention was the dogs having read articles in the guardian helen was terrified marcus would catch some obscure eye complaint from them she wanted them kept outside rupert flatly refused the dogs had been there before she had he pointed out coldly in fact since marcus was born he reflected the dogs were really the only things pleased to see him when he came home both he and helen festered inside with a sense of grievance billy was saddened by the increased deterioration in ruperts marriage and discussed it at length with janey one hot evening at the end of july on the eve of their departure for aachen they lay in bed at penscombe sharing a bottle of moët how on earth said janey can anyone as beautiful as helen be so uptight if i had those kind of looks you do said billy snuggling up against the spongy cushion of her bottom feeling for her breasts dyou think id look nice with my hair up like helen asked janey id rather you shaved your bush dyou think theyll split up no i think underneath they still love each other besides helens too scared of the outside world and rupert doesnt believe in divorce marriage is for children and having someone to run your house you get your fun elsewhere i hope you dont feel like that no said billy sliding his hands down over the smooth folds of her belly janey pressed her stomach in i must lose weight do you think hes gone off her physically hard to tell he nearly killed an italian diplomat who made a pass at her a couple of years ago shes one of his possessions hes very territorial do you think hes good in bed cock like a baseball bat used to bat bread rolls across the room with it when we were at school lucky helen janey sat up excited at the thought am i big enough for you asked billy anxiously janey climbed on top of him holding on to the brass bedstead causing frightful creaking quite big enough look how good i am at rising at the trot hilary in fact was ruperts first serious affair since he had met helen and it was a complete lovehate relationship despite her protestation that all men were beasts hilary herself was an animal in bed insatiable almost a nymphomaniac she didnt bathe enough she was a slut she had a bad temper and rupert had to keep kissing her to shut her up and later cut her nails himself to stop her lacerating his back he detested her hypocrisy in still going on being a friend to helen it was the one affair about which he never boasted to billy knowing how appalled billy would be making love to hilary was like eating a pork pie when you were desperately hungry then discovering by the date on the discarded wrapping that it should have been eaten a month before if you ever breathe a word about this to helen ill throttle you he frequently warned her and she knew he wasnt joking this however did not prevent her from rocking the boat the night before rupert was due to leave for aachen hed stood her up and she had rung up penscombe in a rage screaming at rupert down the telephone rupert who was in bed with helen at the time reading his horoscope in harpers held the receiver to his ear for a minute then said calmly have a word with helen about it shes just here and hilary was forced to pull herself together and issue an impromptu invitation for helen and rupert to come to a dinner party in three weeks time which meant she had to go to all the expense of giving one for hilary despite her ranting was mad about rupert and grew increasingly strident as he showed no inclination to move in with her part of the fascination for him was that they saw so little of each other perhaps a couple of hours a month hilary was sure she could nail him if they had a little more time together while rupert was in aachen at the end of july she flew out to germany leaving the children with the longsuffering crispin her excuse was that she needed to be alone to paint after aachen rupert sent podge home with billy and the horses saying he was off horsehunting and would be home in a day or two he had been very shorttempered with podge all week because he felt guilty and nervous about hilary coming out together he and hilary drove to a hotel in the black forest chosen by hilary their stay was a disaster having screwed her rupert found it a nightmare to have to make conversation with her at dinner or walk with her in the forest or be greeted by her carping rather common voice when he woke in the morning after fortyeight hours they had a mighty row and returned home on separate planes podge meanwhile had returned home twentyfour hours earlier with billy and janey to find england in the grip of a drought day after day the sun blazed down young trees and flowers withered penscombes green valley turned yellow the streams dried to a trickle leaves were turning in gloucestershire people were forbidden to water the garden or wash their cars and there was talk of standpipes and water rationing when they got back janey and billy collapsed into bed for sixteen hours to get over the journey but podge and tracey still had to get up at six next morning after four hours sleep because the horses had to be looked after when a telephone message came through that rupert was coming back that evening podge redoubled her efforts usually to reestablish his ascendancy as master of the house and the yard he came home in a picky mood criticizing everything shed done and then biting her head off for sulking by late afternoon the relentless heat showed no sign of letting up most of the horses were inside to avoid the flies and were let out at night arcturus a gray irishbred stallion was ruperts latest acquisition he showed potential but had blotted his copy book by jumping sloppily at aachen wearing only a black bikini and espadrilles her sweating hair in a ponytail podge chattered away to him as she strapped his dappled coat to firm up his muscles bugger off sweetheart she said as arcturus nudged her lovingly in the back your masters coming home tonight and hell want you looking lovely hope hes cheered up and not cross with us anymore arcy you didnt mean to hit that last triple and i didnt mean to bugger up the mapreading on the way out he can be orrible arcy if he wasnt so lovely when he was being lovely i dont spose wed put up with the orrible bits i dont expect you would said a voice behind her but im in one of my lovely moods today arcturus jerked up his head as podge jumped out of her skin dropping the whisp and going crimson i didnt think you was coming back till this evening she muttered obviously not or youd be properly dressed sorry she picked up the straw whisp and attacked arcturuss already gleaming flanks again but its been ever so ot you look very fetching said rupert pulling her ponytail i just dont want phillips getting ideas phillips the undergardener had an unrequited crush on podge youre my property added rupert podge was filled with a happiness so intense that tears stung her eyelids hey said rupert giving her ponytail another gentle tug you dont seem very pleased with me i am i am she brushed away the tears with the back of her hand leaving a smear of dirt across her face i just thought you was cross with me and if i got everyfink perfect for when you got back you wouldnt be everything looks fine said rupert im going to change finish off arcy and then well walk up the fields and see geminis foal he sauntered off followed by badger and two of the jack russells podges hands shook as she filled the haynet and arcturuss water bucket then she shot up to the loft and frantically washed her face oh that awful muddy smear down one side and shed wanted to wash her hair before he got back it must still reek of billy and janeys chainsmoking on the drive home she had a frantic shower twice washing under her arms and three times between her legs and making herself sneeze by shaking on so much talcum powder shed just pulled on a faded orange tshirt and skirt which clung to her wet body when she heard rupert yelling from downstairs as she came backwards down the ladder out of her attic flat rupert was waiting sliding his hands up under her skirt his thumbs biting into her plump bottom dont she shrieked he was wearing nothing but a pair of old jeans and he smelt of an expensive french aftershave which she couldnt pronounce suddenly she had difficulty breathing not here she gasped what about phillips and mrs campbellblack in london come on whyd you change you looked sexy in that bikini too fat muttered podge pulling on gum boots what the hell are those for adders muttered podge phillips killed one by the tennis court last week and nettles and thistles as they walked up the scorched fields rupert carrying the hasselblad camera hed won in aachen the chestnut trees were raining down orange leaves the thistles were turning to kapok and the little copse of hornbeams rupert had planted earlier in the year had already died there were huge cracks in the ground in the distance they could hear the jangle of a fire engine if we dont get some rain soon were going to be in trouble said rupert goingll be murder at crittleden the nettles on the way down to billys secret pond which used to reach to four feet and close over the top were shrunk to a pathetic eighteen inches and no threat to podges legs today the pond was almost empty sweat was running in rivulets between podges breasts and down her sides she felt her heart pounding which horses are you taking to rotterdam she asked you asked me that five minutes ago youre not concentrating rupert said mockingly as they reached the bottom of the path he took her hand and turned right geminis in the oak meadow said podge quickly well go and see her later said rupert ive got more pressing plans for you he put his arm round her waist then moved it upwards till his hand squeezed her left breast very pressing then he let her go they reached the stream that ran down the valley with water meadows on either side it was greener here the stream choked with figwort and forgetmenot a circle of ash trees formed a sun trap no one could see them from the road what happens if someone walks across the fields private property ill have them for trespassing rupert raised his hand and smoothed the sweat from her face ive missed you podge he said gently get your clothes off an expression of doubt flickered in her eyes but she took off the orange tshirt so that her breasts fell out full pointed and sloping downwards lean against that tree said rupert adjusting his camera for the light instinctively podge put her hand up to loosen her hair no leave it tied back i want to see the expression on your face i havent any makeup on suits you put your arms above your head and lean back against the trunk beautiful christ youve got gorgeous boobs now turn sideways keep your arms up lovely he took another picture then came over running his hands over her breasts then kissing her he tasted of toothpaste and animal health and wonderful digestion putting her arms round him podge kissed him back so violently they nearly toppled over steady he whispered i havent finished yet he undid the drawstring of her skirt and she stepped out of it then he pulled her panties off the mouse brown bush was flattened and he ran his hands through it to fluff it up then he spread the pink lips a shiny snails trail was trickling down both thighs all right keep your legs apart dont be shy sweetheart if you knew how fantastic you look now turn around dont tense your bum up relax she heard two more clicks she waited clinging onto the ribbed surface of the tree throat dry heart crashing against her ribs then she felt a warm hand on her back rupert wasnt even sweating lovely arse he said softly running his fingers down the cleft before he came to the sticky warmth between her legs christ he said his hand like a burrowing ferret you are the most welcoming thing he thought of hilarys tantrums of her vacuumcleaner kisses her sharp teeth and scraping hands he thought of helens cool distaste and he compared them with podges ecstatically grateful gentleness why dont you take your clothes off she said turning around and kissing him passionately as she fumbled with the zip of his jeans and then his briefs then sinking to her knees she buried her face in the blond hair of his groin sucking him as pleasurably as a child with a lolly steady sweet i dont want to come yet as he turned to remove his trousers she seized the camera now its my turn to photograph you giggling hysterically she photographed him as he was turning then caught him again as he was coming towards her half laughing half angry the next moment hed caught up with her pushing her down on the grass parting her legs and kissing her damp bush she writhed tensed gave a gasp of pleasure and came so blissfully quickly thought rupert recently hilary seemed to come later and later like the christmas postman he turned over lay back and pulled podge on top of him feeling her muscles so tight but so oily gripping him breasts swaying like party balloons when the front door opens really she was gorgeous the sun had disappeared behind the ashwood by the time they had finished sated with pleasure and exhaustion podge rinsed herself out in the stream startling several minnows as they walked home up the sundrenched valley rupert picked grass seed out of her hair there isnt time to see geminis foal he said ive got to go and give the prizes at cheltenham flower show they were greeted in the yard by tracey and phillips mrs campbellblacks just rung from london said tracey i couldnt find you will you ring her back just been up to the oak meadow to photograph geminis foal said rupert coolly thats funny muttered phillips bitter with jealousy to ruperts departing back the grass was so poor we moved them up to long acre this morning rupert went off to rotterdam two days later the day before he was due back helen drove into cirencester to shop and bumped into hilary in the market crossly buying cheese for the dinner party shed been forced into giving the following night rupert is going to be back isnt he she demanded not that hes a great asset at dinner parties always making fascist remarks and falling asleep but ive got ten smoked trout and i dont want my numbers messed up helen who found herself increasingly irritated by hilary said you could never be sure with rupert but she thought itd be percent certain well make sure hes there said hilary no about an inch more dolcelatte please hilary had realized by the time she got back from the black forest how much she was going to miss the excitement rupert provided in her drab life she must get him back it would be too cruel if he didnt turn up tomorrow night leaving her helen popped into the chemist to pick up the rolls of film shed found lying around on ruperts dressing table hed actually taken some of marcus last time he was back and she was dying to see them mr wise the chemist had popped out and hadnt checked the photographs as he normally did he always liked to look through the campbellblacks folders they often contained pictures of famous people and interesting places abroad the drought didnt seem to be deterring the trippers at all stuck in a holiday traffic jam on the way back to penscombe helen couldnt resist looking at the photographs that was a gorgeous one of marcus but she wished badger wasnt licking his face and a lovely one of the rose bower and a rather boring one of the jack russells and arcturus why must rupert always photograph animals that was lovely of the herbaceous border and the valley how yellow it was now that must be geminis foal shed finished one folder and shook the photos out of the next the first thing she saw was a plump topless girl mr wise must have given her the wrong set of photographs here was another one of her full length legs apart in the most disgustingly provocative pose helen looked closer and stiffened the girl looked like podge she looked at four more pictures all disgusting yes they were definitely podge the next one taken at an angle half cut off the mans head but the rest of him looked decidedly familiar the next also naked was definitely rupert full frontal and roaring with laughter a second later helen had rammed the porsche into the car in front with a sickening crunch she banged her head hard and the bonnet of the car just buckled up like the face of a bulldog in a cartoon film why dont you look where youre going yelled the driver of the car in front he found helen crying hysterically trying to collect together the scattered photographs before anyone else could see them rupert flew in from rotterdam around six the following evening tired but once again victorious hed left the grooms to bring back the horses phillips met him at the airport in helens mini and gleefully told him that mrs campbellblack had pranged the porsche the previous afternoon serve the bastard right he thought as he saw ruperts look of fury shouldnt go down in the woods with podge helen walked up and down her bedroom wondering how the hell to tackle rupert by some miracle in four years of marriage shed never actually caught him being unfaithful shed suspected other women marion janey grania pringle several of ruperts exes but never in a million years podge with her fat legs her cockney accent and her plain homely face it had come as a terrible terrible shock helen couldnt stop shaking it was so revolting too taking photographs of her in one of their own fields where anyone might have walked past she wished she had a girlfriend to pour her heart out to but janey was still on the way back from rotterdam with billy and anyway janey wasnt safe she thought of ringing hilary but hilary would just say i told you so she still had a blinding headache from yesterdays shunt in the porsche and a huge bruise on her forehead beneath her hair the usual frantic barking told her rupert was home for once instead of going to the stables he came straight upstairs into the bedroom i hear you pranged my car are you all right perfectly thank you helen gazed out of the window quivering with animosity refusing to look around how the hell did it happen i was in a jam looking at some of your photographs just back from the drugstore she swung around handing him the folders theyre kind of interesting have a look casually rupert picked them up when he was feeling trapped his eyes seemed to go a darker more opaque shade of blue and lose all their sparkle i thought id taken some nice ones of marcus thats good and sos that and theres a gorgeous one of badger and arcy christ hes a goodlooking horse pity you shut your eyes in that one he gave a low whistle whos that you know perfectly well screamed helen its that slut podge phillips must have borrowed my camera god shes got quite a shape on her it was you who took them hissed helen and your hand is remarkably steady which is more than can be said for podges when she took photos of you rupert flipped through the photographs playing for time whos that headless chap got a cock like the post office tower its yours said helen in a choked voice and i guess you cant deny the fact that the next one is you im afraid it is said rupert then he committed the cardinal sin of starting to laugh helen lost her temper how dare you go to bed with her who says ive been to bed with her dont be ridiculous and i suppose janey and billy know all about it how could you how could you rupert scratched his ear looking at her meditatively do you really want to know he said softly yes i bloody well do i fucked her because she was at home when i got back and she wanted me helen flinched and shes a bloody miracle in bed and im not i suppose no you are not my pet if you want the truth youre like a frozen chicken fucking you is like stuffing sausage meat into a broiler im always frightened ill discover the giblets helen gasped unable to speak you never react never display any pleasure never once in four years of marriage have you asked for it if i want you i have to sit on the street with a begging bowl and im bloody fed up with it every time you part your legs a degree you behave as if youre bestowing a colossal favor its not your fault your bloody mother instilled it into you behave like a lady at all times my god helen gazed at him too stunned to say anything just watching him strip off his clothes in front of her down to the lean beautiful suntanned body that was so terribly reminiscent of the photographs for a horrifying moment she thought he was going to pounce on her but he merely went off into the shower to emerge five minutes later dripping and rubbing his hair dry with a big pink towel have you got the message he said i dont get my kicks at home so i get them elsewhere youve got to fire her whispered helen through white lips i cant go on meeting her knowing this having seen those disgusting pictures whats disgusting about those pictures kodak obviously enjoyed them shes got a nice body and whats more important shes not remotely ashamed of it you could pick up a few tips from her he went into his dressing room and got out his dinner jacket and a white dress shirt where are you going helen asked numbly out to dinner its hilarys dinner party remember you insisted i should be back on time no one could dress more quickly than rupert when he chose you cant go out to dinner after this helen whispered in bewilderment why not the drinks free its much better than staying here and listening to the hysterics that youre about to give way to any minute i dont like having books thrown at me and that scent bottles dangerously large dont you think youd better get changed too he was frowning in the mirror now as he tied his tie arent you even going to apologize for you and podge rupert flicked the bent tie expertly through the gap why should i apologize for your inadequacies now he was brushing his still damp hair with silver brushes back over the temples and in two wings over the ears he picked up his jacket dont bother to wait up for me ill tell ortrud or whatever her name is this week youve got a migraine helen simply couldnt believe that he could treat an act of such magnitude so lightly and the terrible things he had said was she really that awful in bed was it all her fault the moment hed gone she threw herself down on the bed sobbing her heart out not for the first time she wished she hadnt put marcuss nursery next to their bedroom within seconds there was thumping on the door and cries of mummy mummy helen gritted her teeth where the hell was ortrud the thumpings grew more insistent mummy why are you crying helen put on her dark glasses and opened the door marcus almost fell inside he was wearing blue and white striped pajamas and clutching a stuffed purple skunk rupert had brought him from aachen mummy crying he said doubtfully helen picked him up reveling in his newly bathed softness mommas got a sore head she banged her hand against her temple then the skunks head against the window mummy go bang in car thats why shes crying marcus seemed to accept this helen looked nervously for the thin trickle of mucus from his nose that always heralded an asthma attack usually triggered off by ruperts presence but there was no sign story said marcus pointedly i cant face it thought helen ortrud she screamed down the stairs but ortrud on hearing that helen would be staying in had pushed off to the jolly goat in stroud to meet her friends rupert having vented his wrath on helen because he felt so guilty was not enjoying hilarys dinner party hilary despite her arbitrary comments to helen about even numbers was delighted he had come alone whats the matter with her she asked migraine said rupert tersely you mean a row said hilary out of the corner of her mouth have some of crispins elderflower wine to cheer you up rupert looked round dismissively at the earnest women their bulges concealed beneath ethnic smocks and their bearded husbands looking selfconscious in dinner jackets if it hadnt been hilary and crispins wedding anniversary they would have refused to dress up everyone except rupert brought presents hilary put him on her right at dinner there wasnt even a decentlooking woman for him to flirt with or make eyes at across the table the dinner was disgusting smoked trout then jugged hare of all unbelievable things in august with hilarys slovenly cooking it was probably jugged hairs as well whats the matter youre not your usual dazzling self said hilary in a low voice letting her hand brush against his as she passed the red currant jelly rupert didnt return the pressure whats really the matter with helen she asked she was all right yesterday shes all wrong now said rupert he turned to the german woman with plaits round her head on his right it must be a lonely life working with horses she said to him no said rupert its very overcrowded what an idiot hed been to shit on his own doorstep hed have to sack podge now and arcy and the other horses who were absolutely devoted to her would be upset at the height of the season grooms werent hard to find but ones as good as podge virtually impossible why the hell too had he ever embarked on an affair with hilary she revolted him now she insisted on lingering for hours over coffee i hate breaking up the ambience rupert grew increasingly restless as the dwindling candlelight flickered on the shiny unpainted faces the woman on ruperts right went off to the loo crispin was out of the room making more coffee no doubt caffeinefree hilarys lugubrious paintings glared down from the walls hilary could bear it no longer helens found out about us hasnt she ruperts eyes narrowed who us you and me of course rupert laughed no about someone else actually i dont understand helen found out i was knocking off someone else a long time ago no ten days ago hilary gasped you bastard you rotten bastard she hissed youre deliberately winding me up i dont believe you what are you two looking so secretive about crispin appeared at their side sorry i was so long dear i was changing kate more coffee rupert rupert looked at crispins hands he bet he hadnt washed them no thanks he got to his feet i must go been a lovely evening but i got up at four oclock this morning and i dont like to leave helen too long he never minded in the past said hilary to herself furiously why dont you ring up shes probably fast asleep pity to break up the party what party said rupert so only she could hear him our particular party is over my darling what happened to your porsche asked crispin watching rupert curl his long legs into helens mini helen had a prang yesterday then he was gone he was home by a quarter to twelve ortruds light was on so was podges over the stables probably the whole household knew hed gone out after a screaming match with helen he wandered down to the stables it was still impossibly hot a full moon upstaged the crowded stars the horses were moving restlessly arcturus came to the halfdoor rupert gave him a carrot hed pinched from hilarys crudités dish on the way out wish i was a stallion like you he said arcy rolled his eyes and took a nip at rupert who cuffed him on the nose one day when youre famous he told the horse youll be encouraged to fuck any mare you like why cant i rupert knew podge would be waiting up for him but he went straight back to the house he didnt fancy sleeping in the spare room it was supposed to be haunted and he wasnt tight enough not to mind after finally settling marcus helen had had a bath bathed her eyes washed her hair and put on the plunging black silk janet reger nightgown rupert had given her for christmas but which she had never worn because she had no cleavage now she lay in the big bed without the light on with the moonlight pouring in through the windows as rupert tiptoed past the door she called out to him he entered cautiously waiting for abuse his hair gleaming as silvery as one of his hairbrushes im sorry she said in a choked voice its all my fault rupert completely wrongfooted was unbelievably touched i understand exactly why you went for podge she went on im hopeless in bed its just my upbringing that makes me so dreadfully inhibited but i love you so so much i cant bear the thought of losing you ill try and make as many overtures as rossini she was trying to make a joke but her voice cracked rupert sat down pulling her against him no its my fault he said stroking her bare arms ill get rid of podge tomorrow ill pay her off so you never have to see her again i suppose its my upbringing too fidelity wasnt the familys strong point but i love you ill go and buy black sexy underwear like janeys and read sex books and learn how to drive a man to the ultimate of desire you do already have i ever not wanted you i just got tired of trying to fuck someone who didnt want me that night tabitha was conceived gradually billys and janeys cottage got into shape and although billy drew the line for a time at a swimming pool or a tennis court the place seemed to have every other luxury if i have a fantastic season and you write your arse off we should be straight by the end of next year give or take a few bottles of bells billy told janey when they moved in in october but he never expected the bills to be quite so astronomical having no wedding presents he and janey had to buy everything from a garlic crusher to a dishwasher billys mother was very rich and could have helped out but she didnt like janey who described her as an old boot with a tweed bum or in kinder moments as the emperor vespasian in drag mrs lloydfoxe had the big nose and thick gray curls that look better on a man she thought janey was tarty and agreed with helen that janey wrote very overthe top articles in the paper last week janey had written about her marriage giving rather too many intimate details most people including billy thought it was very funny mrs lloydfoxe did not hows dear helen and darling little marcus she asked every time she rang janey knowing it would irritate her mrs lloydfoxe had daughters who seemed to lay babies with the ease that chickens produce eggs it was up to janey her motherinlaw implied frequently to produce a son as soon as possible then therell be a little lloydfoxe to carry on the line helen feeling slightly sick but much happier after her rapprochement with rupert was thrilled she was having another baby janey wanted to be pregnant too and hadnt taken the pill since shed been married to billy but each month it was just the same she went to see her doctor who said it was very early days and suggested she had her tubes blown youve also been racketing round the world a lot he told her why dont you stop work for a bit play house look after billy and get in a nesting mood try to confine intercourse to the middle of the month between your periods janey in fact was bored with racketing around she was fed up with living out of suitcases interviewing pop stars and heads of state she wanted to stay at home and watch the lime trees round the cottage turn yellow and go out mushrooming in the early morning there was also the matter of her expenses which were colossal and which had very few bills to back them up because janey had lost them there had been too many dinners for ten at tiberios or maxims with janey and billy treating the rest of the team the showjumping correspondent jealous of her pitch being queered by janey had sneaked to the sports editor about unnecessary extravagance the editor mike pardoe nearly had a coronary when he saw the total and summoned janey from gloucestershire pardoe had once been janeys lover as she looked at his handsome watchful wolfish face janey thought how much much nicer billy was these expenses are a joke said pardoe how the hell did you spend so much money in athens did you buy one of the greek islands well the copy was good you said so its gone off recently most of it seems to have been written with your pen dipped in mouton cadet and from a hotel bedroom i want you to come back to fleet street where i can keep an eye on you and put you on features i need youre a good writer janey but youve lost your edge i want to write a diary from the country rather like the diary of a provincial lady protested janey who the hells interested in that janey was livid she looked at pardoes fridge laden with drink and the leather sofa on which hed laid her many years before and which had just been upholstered in shiny black she didnt want to go back to that wild uncertain prebilly existence where you shivered on the tube platform on the way to work in the dress youd worn the night before and everyone knew you hadnt been home she went off and lunched with a publishing friend and told him she wanted to write a book on men and where they stood at this moment in the sexual war im going to call it dispatches from the yfront good idea said the publishing friend make a nice change from all this feminist rubbish pouring off the presses take in the lot divorcées adulterers house husbands is the postpermissive male better in bed make it as bitchy funny and as contentious as possible ill give you a advance tight after lunch janey went back to pardoe and handed in her notice youll be back he said if you ever finish that book which i very much doubt i might serialize it i doubt it said janey because youll certainly be in it and youll be too vain to sue janey was not that worried about how long shed take over the book her father had supported her mother why shouldnt billy support her billy came back from hamburg to be told janey had resigned but was being paid a big advance to write a book im going to be a proper wife like helen she went on billy said he preferred improper wives and although he liked the idea of her living in the woodcutters cottage like little red riding hood he did hope too many wolves wouldnt turn up dressed as grandmothers he was also slightly alarmed that along with the bill from the builders there was a tax bill for and janeys vat for suddenly there didnt seem to be anything to pay them with give the bills to kev said janey airily thats what hes there for but all worries about money were set aside with the excitement of moving in and the furniture looking so nice on the stone floors and lighting huge log fires in the drawing room and cutting back the roses and honeysuckle which were still in flower and darkening the windows then there was the bliss of waking up in their own bed in their own room looking through the lime trees at the valley how could they not be happy and prosper in an enchanted bower like this janey missed billy when he started going off to shows without her but she was enjoying getting things straight and it was heaven not having to get up at five oclock in the morning to drive off over mountain passes or break down on icy roads the winter that followed was very cold and the wind whistled past their door straight off the bristol channel but janey merely turned the central heating up to tropical and thought idly about her book the muse must not be raped she must be given time to yield her secrets rupert missed them both terribly when they moved out all the fun seemed to have gone out of the house he was making heroic attempts to be a good husband and helen was trying equally hard to be more sexy but when you were feeling sick and heavy with pregnancy it wasnt easy badger missed mavis most of all and spent days down at the cottage whenever rupert was away when rupert arrived to fetch him he would lie in front of the fire in embarrassment with his eyes shut pretending that because he couldnt see rupert he wasnt there as an ingratiating gesture janey invited kev and enid coley to her first dinner party the huge china poodle was unearthed from its home in the cellar dusted down and put in its place of honor in the drawing room unfortunately janey had sprayed oven cleaner all over the inside of the cooker the day before and had forgotten to wash it off so when she removed the duck from the oven the kitchen was flooded with toxic fumes and the duck was a charred wreck the size of a wren so everyone screamed with laughter and billy was sent off to stroud to get a chinese takeout just as well perhaps when billy checked the mustard janeyd put on the table he discovered it was the horses saffron antifly ointment janeys very attractive commented enid coley on the way home but im not sure shes a homemaker by the time christmas came things were very tight the bull bruised a sole before the olympia show and billy didnt have a single win with the other horses he sent a christmas card to his bank manager and decided hed have to tap his parents whod invited them down for christmas only for a couple of days janey told mrs lloydfoxe firmly we cant really leave the horses the visit was not a success janey who always left shopping until the last moment was forced to spend an absolute fortune on christmas presents which shocked billys frugal parents who gave them a hideously ugly piece of family silver instead of the check they had anticipated the lloydfoxes lived in a house called the maltings which was so cold that janey couldnt bring herself to get up until lunchtime and then only to hog the fire billys mother was not tactful she came back incessantly to the subject of babies it was so sad at bridge parties not to be able to boast of a little lloydfoxe baby in the offing she was so pleased dear helen was being sensible and having a second child ill iron billys shirts for him she said coming into the bedroom and picking them off the floor i know how he likes them and ill make you an apple pie to take back to gloucestershire he so loves puddings shell get it in her kisser if she doesnt shut up muttered janey out of sheer irritation janey left her room like a tip with the fire on and didnt bother to make the one bed theyd slept in out of the two single beds billy was the only form of central heating in the house and as at noon and six oclock janey moved towards the vodka billys mothers jaw quilted with muscles she was very tired with cooking and she could have done with a little help and praise from janey finally on boxing night billy asked his father for a loan mr lloydfoxe hummed and hawed and said it had been a bad year with the squeeze and although he had twenty thousand to spare he had divided it between billys sisters arabella and lucinda i feel they need it more than you and janey do as youre both working janey didnt even bother to kiss her motherinlaw goodbye and it was only after theyd left that mrs lloydfoxe discovered janey had painted the letter l out of the the maltings sign on the gate after christmas the bills came flooding in billy whod never paid a gas or telephone or electricity bill in his life had no idea theyd be so high he also read his bank statement which was infinitely more scarlet after janeys christmas shopping spree did you honestly spend on that cushion for my mother pity i didnt hold it over the old monsters face said janey the tax man and the builders were also hustling for payment another shock was that the advance on the manuscript was divided into three on signature on delivery and on publication how soon do you think youll deliver asked billy the original date had been march but janey whod made only a few random notes said there wouldnt be a hope before the summer which meant that autumn publication was very unlikely janey had no idea either of the astronomical cost of running and traveling a string of horses nor was she any good as a backup team she kept forgetting to post entry forms which meant billy drove two hundred miles to a show to find he wasnt eligible to compete often fasttalking got him in sometimes it didnt billy was one of the best riders in england but he was not a natural jockey like rupert he had to work at it and keep schooling his horses to get really good results nor did janey understand billys temperament that he lacked selfconfidence and needed to be kept very calm before a big class rows and requests for money sapped his concentration he needed to distance himself and with a lovely wife in a warm bed at home he tended to spend less time in the indoor school at night and to get up later in the morning in march he came home from a threeweek trip abroad hed missed janey desperately and deliberately rang her at southampton to say hed be home in time for dinner adding rather plaintively that he hadnt eaten all day as he settled the horses at ruperts a marvelous smell of boeuf bourgignon drifted out of the kitchen and he wondered if janey would be cooking something nice for him as he came up to the front door he tripped over a pile of milk bottles the place stank of cat not rabbit stew and as he took the last finger of whisky to the sink to fill the glass up with water he found it full of dirty dishes the dishwasher had broken explained janey the man hadnt come to mend it yet as he went back into the drawing room he noticed the drink rings on the georgian table helen had given them as a wedding present the place looked rather as penscombe used to before helen came and tidied it up somehow these days mess got on his nerves he had had a bad week hardly in the money at all he tried to ignore the pile of brown envelopes unopened on the hall table there was no more whisky only vodka but no tonic drink it with orange squash im starving im sorry darling i forgot to get anything in and it was too late by the time you rang lets go out too bloody expensive ill have some cornflakes billys stomach was churning painfully he wondered if he were getting an ulcer he had an early start in the morning he went upstairs the hot cupboard was bare and there was nothing in his drawers have i got any clean shirts or breeches oh christ said janey clutching her head i left them in the launderette in stroud the washing machines up the spout too what time do they open about eightthirty ive got to leave at six im sorry darling truly i am look give me your breeches and shirts and ill wash them by hand then we can dry them in front of the fire and ill get up early and iron them its all right ill borrow some from rupert im only away for a couple of days this time im desperately sorry said janey suddenly catching sight of two unposted entry forms in her outtray and shuffling them under a pile of papers im going to mix you a nice drink after two glasses of vodka and orange squash which didnt taste so bad after all billy felt fortified enough to open the brown envelopes janey darling he said five minutes later we shall simply have to pull our horns in these bills are frightful cant you take a trip to château kitsch harold evans caught a finch in the herb garden today and came in with his mouth full of chives and parsley hes also got a liver complaint billy looked up alarmed have you taken him to the vet then janey giggled no hes complaining theres not enough liver billy grinned but was not to be deflected sweetheart we must try and cut down we dont need a swimming pool we simply cant afford the deposit or even less to pay for it when its finished janey pouted itll be so nice for you to flop into the pool when you come back from shows theres only about three months a year warm enough to do that in gloucestershire ive been trying to economize mrs bodkins got flu and i took her a bunch of daffodils without leaves today because they were twenty p cheaper but we havent been really living it down have we there are five halfopened tins of cat food gathering mold on top of the fridge and mavis really doesnt need half a chicken every day shes getting awfully fat well badger often drops in for lunch you know how helen starves those dogs i think we ought to cut down mrs bodkin to half a day a week said billy ignoring janeys frown and give up miss hawkins you could do my fan mail do your fan mail said janey outraged what about my fan mail just for a little till we get straight janey started to get angry and hysterical ive got to finish this book its got to be handed in by july i havent got time for anything else im writing every day i get up at eight and ive only just finished this evening stupid not to grab inspiration when it takes you she didnt point out that most of that day had been spent drinking coffee and later whisky with one of the builders after all she rationalized she had to get the roughtrade view for her book somehow i know darling said billy soothingly all im saying is that we must not do any more to the house at the moment go to kev said janey emptying the last of the vodka into his glass kev will provide the great ape im going to make you some scrambled eggs she went towards the kitchen i say she popped her head round the door a moment later helen gave me a chapter of her novel to read today any good she cant write bum on a wall she said janey i want you to be real honest with me which meant she wanted me to lie convincingly she told me a much funnier thing today shes got frightfully thick with the new vicar and evidently when rupert flew back from geneva for the night last week he found the vicar holding a lenten meeting in the drawing room with everyone including badger meditating with their eyes shut billy laughed rupe told me he wandered into the kitchen trying not to notice the mess or the way janey threw the eggshells into a huge box where they joined about a hundred other eggshells that must account for the odd smell he picked up a jar of coffee on the dresser and looked at the price christ coffees expensive im going to drink liquor in future janey came and put her arms round him i do love you she said dont worry about money ive got a lovely bottle of st emilion after three huge vodkas and a bottle of st emilion the problem didnt seem so bad billy would ride with panache janey would write like a maniac while he was away they would soon get out of their mess spring came more longedfor than ever after the hardness of the winter and the woods were filled with violets anemones primroses and birdsong chaucers people thought about pilgrimages janey thought about new clothes the wild garlic made her feel homesick for drunken lunches in soho she knew marriage to billy was far more precious and durable but she missed the jokes and the gossip she lived on the telephone to her mother she was finding it increasingly difficult to buckle down to her book she was used to the weekly clapping of journalism the steady fan mail people coming up to her at parties and saying you were a bit near the knuckle last week in the country there was no second post no evening standard no capital radio she found it difficult to get used to the slow rhythms gloucestershire was a soporific county and she found herself falling asleep in the afternoon she had her fallopian tubes blown which was not really painful but affected her more than she expected she sank into despondency and to premenstrual tension was added postmenstrual depression when she found she wasnt pregnant one afternoon billys mother dropped in with a bridge friend the cottage looked awful there was no cake only some stale bread no jam and a teapot already full of leaves mrs lloydfoxe followed her into the kitchen any news she asked janey shook her head but was so upset that she burnt the toast what a beautiful view said the bridge friend looking out of the window the only views i like these days said janey are my own the bills poured in janeys tax bill arrived and billy realized that as her husband he was liable for an extra with a further owing to vatman every time janey went shopping wherever she looked baby clothes seemed to be mocking her she seemed to be alone in a world of mothers she took her temperature and wrote it down on the back of a christmas card every day and billy was supposed to leap on her when her temperature went up but invariably shed mislaid the card or billy wasnt there on the right day in may helen gave birth to a daughter whom they called tabitha rupert was present at the birth and although to helen he seemed to spend more time making eyes over his white mask at the pretty nurses and seeing how all the machinery worked he was at least present if incorrect and from the moment he set eyes on tabitha and she opened her cambridge blue eyes rupert was totally enchanted she was indeed the most angelic baby she gurgled and laughed and almost immediately she slept through the night and if she woke it was rupert who got up without a murmur displaying a sweetness and patience helen had never seen before where rupert was concerned it was the great love affair of the century here was someone he could love unstintingly and who adored him back later her first word was daddy and when she took her first steps they were towards rupert and almost before she could walk she screamed to be put on a pony and screamed even louder when she was lifted off rupert would do anything for her bathing her playing with her for hours watching as she slept plump pinkcheeked blond and ravishing in her cot delighted at first with ruperts delight helen gradually became irritated by it drawing even closer to marcus who couldnt understand at two why his father didnt dote on him and bring him presents and cuddle him on his knee as a result when rupert wasnt around he would punch and pinch little tab and fill her cot with toys one day rupert caught him trying to suffocate tab with a pillow and gave him a backhander which sent him flying across the room two hours later marcus had one of his worst asthma attacks he recovered but by that time rupert had moved on to another show the christening upset janey very much she was a godmother but it was such a tribal affair such a ritualistic celebration of fertility all the campbellblacks were there in force going into ecstasies over such a ravishing baby mrs lloydfoxe sent tab a beautiful silver mug janey got drunk afterwards and spent all night in floods of tears billy was in despair weve only been married a year and a half darling ill see a doctor it might be my fault all the riders were now revving up for the world championship which was being held at les rivaux in brittany in july only six british riders would be selected to go considering billy a certainty kevin coley had reserved a big tent at les rivaux and was intending to make a party of it flying out all his important customers for a jolly as it was only may billy wasnt too worried about qualifying he was bound to hit form soon the bull had got over a virus complaint and was back on the circuit another key event from kevin coleys point of view was westerngate a big show in the midlands towards the end of may the moggie meal factory was just a few miles outside westerngate and kevin coley had a tent at the show where all his senior staff were expected to turn out in their best clothes and mingle with important customers the highlight of the day for all of them was to meet billy and watch his horses moggie meal al moggie meal kitch kitchener and moggie meal dick mandryka jumping they were also keen to meet billys beautiful and famous wife janey whom many of the wives had thought a scream when they read her pieces westerngate was about eighty miles north of penscombe billy was expected to be on parade all three days of the show and kevin and enid coley were naturally disappointed that janey was working on thursday and friday but were very much looking forward to seeing her on saturday for lunch do i have to come grumbled janey it is important urged billy theyre our bread and butter marg and sliced bread if you ask me i hate to leave the book she lied when its going so well ill come home on friday night and collect you said billy and we can drive down in the morning but well have to leave early ive got a novice class around eleventhirty on the monday before the show billy had gone to kevin to ask for an advance of to keep some of his creditors at bay kevin thought for a minute yes ill help you out billy thats terribly kind of you said billy heaving a sigh of relief it isnt kind its fucking generous but im not going to help you out that much im only going to give you or youll lose your hunger billys heart sank youll have to win the rest cut down on the booze and lose some weight its a tough world im counting on you for the world championship ive booked that tent for les rivaux so youd better start winning and qualify billy wished kevin hadnt booked the tent it was tempting providence bad luck seemed to pursue him he had such a hangover at fontainebleau he forgot to check if tracey had screwed in kitcheners studs kitchener went into the ring and promptly slipped on takeoff putting him out for the whole season which left billy with only the bull and mandryka janey was sympathetic when he rang but she was four days late with the curse and cocooned in secret expectations on wednesday night billy came home from fontainebleau and found janey had put three pairs of breeches and four white shirts in the washing machine with one of her scarlet silk scarves so they came out streaked red like the dawn billy was very tired or he wouldnt have hit the roof i cant think what youre worrying about im not complaining janey shouted back at him and ive ruined a perfectly good scarf ive been so busy youre lucky to have your shirts washed at all why dont you go out and win something then you could afford to send them to the laundry billy felt that terrible clawing pain in his gut that was becoming so familiar these days a large glass of whisky seemed the only answer going upstairs in the faint hope of finding some clean shirts he saw instead the beautiful new iron bedhead above the spare room bed where did that come from i bought it weeks ago and paid for it not yet janey didnt meet his eyes why dyou buy bloody bedheads when i cant afford boots why dont you buy cheap vino instead of paying a bottle why are you always buying drinks for people giving them the shirts off your back even if they are streaked red like the dawn as i said why dont you win something im fed up with playing second fiddle to a string of bloody horses billy went back upstairs when she joined him he was lying in bed wearing pajamas buttoned up to the neck even though his face was turned to the wall she caught a waft of bad digestion and drink fumes billy she said apologetically he didnt answer but she knew he was awake nothing however could dent her happiness she was eight days late she woke up in the night and billy was so still she thought hed committed suicide so she woke him up in a panic and halfasleep he instinctively put his arms round her forgetting the dreadfulness of the row he left before she woke in the morning to go to westerngate but returned on friday night in better spirits the bull had come second in a big class so perhaps his luck was turning janey was delighted who beat you jake lovell of all people hes back on the circuit whos he you know jake oh id forgotten you probably never met him he was a cert for the colombia olympics with two topclass horses then one had a heart attack at crittleden appalling bad luck should never have been jumped and then rupert set his heart on the second and got it no doubt said janey he always gets anything or anyone he wants yes he did it was revenge actually belonged to jakes stepfatherinlaw rupert made him an offer he couldnt refuse left jake without any horses now hes really back on form im glad i always felt bad about that business cheered up by billys second they got mildly tight together im so pleased youre coming tomorrow said billy theyre all dying to meet you i want to show you off janey didnt feel like being shown off she felt fat and bloated perhaps it was the first stirrings of pregnancy in anticipation of maternity and to cover the bulges she was ten days late now she was wearing one of billys streaked shirts and nothing else do you like short hair she said pausing at the daily mail fashion page i do on mavis can i shave your bush tonight it was all rather erotic billy had bought her a porn magazine to read and laid her on a towel on the bed and used his razor and masses of soap and hot water wincing in case he nicked her she read a story about a victorian maid and her boss which was too absurd for words and full of misprints and anachronisms which she kept reading out to billy i want to lock your bunt said the vicar his hot six rearing up but it soon had her bubbling over inside the libido was an awfully bad judge of literature janey decided christ you look fantastic said billy as he rinsed away the last soap and hairs janey peered at herself rather like an old boiler chicken itll be fantastic going down on you did you ever allow any of your other boyfriends to do this to you asked billy as he leapt on her can we play for a long time janey however having come quickly herself wanted to get it over with she was suddenly tired and wriggled frantically trying to bring him to the boil and then exciting him with a story of how pardoe took her in the back of his jaguar one summer night janey fell asleep immediately afterwards billy lay awake and fretted mandryka had put in a nasty stop yesterday he must get to westerngate early and sort it out janey woke up in the morning with a hangover feeling billys prick nudging her back his hand stroking her shaven flesh what time ought we to leave ten at the latest i havent declared and i promised kev wed be there for prelunch drinks janey didnt want sex but to get herself in a more receptive mood she fantasized she was a schoolgirl in a gym tunic being ticked off by a very strict headmaster in a dog collar next moment the headmasters wife walked in and they both decided to have her shall i tell you a story to excite you asked billy im fine said janey who was deep in headmasters nearly there the next moment pleasure flooded over her she longed to go back to sleep you look so fantastic said billy how about soixanteneuf janey couldnt face a huge cock down her throat i cant billy not with a hangover please stay inside me i want to feel you coming afterwards they both fell asleep when they woke it was five to ten what are you doing said billy when he went into the bathroom five minutes later washing my hair but you cant weve got to leave now youll just have to drive a bit faster or go without me i cant he said aghast theyre expecting you your hair looks fine its only a show its you they want to see not your hair i know what theyll all say not as attractive as her photograph nothing to look at in the flesh snapped janey who was now upside down head in the bath rubbing in shampoo i do have a public image to keep up it was you who wanted bloody sex they didnt leave until after eleven revving up is actionable hissed janey coming out of the house so is being an hour late snapped billy and my fringe has separated billy didnt think that a striped rugger shirt with a rather dirty white collar flared jeans and an old denim jacket were suitable but he didnt complain as he would have had to wait another twenty minutes rancid with ill temper they drove all the way to westerngate with janey trying to do her face snapping at billy every time he went round a corner the traffic was terrible they were held up for thirtyfive minutes by a couple of gays unloading some carpet into an antique shop in broadway high street billy kept looking at his watch kevs going to flip his lid im going to be too late to declare his stomach was killing him they arrived at halfpast one billy went straight off to try and square the secretary leaving janey to park the car in the sponsors car park there was the moggie meal tent there was the awful cat winking on the flag oh god here was kevin coley coming towards her wearing a suit the color of a caramel cupcake he looked simply livid hi kev she said casually the traffic was awful where the hell is billy hes been late once too bloody often and theyve put their foot down theyve closed the declaration theyre already walking the course that means hell probably be dropped for the royal and for aachen and its too bloody near the world championships hes gone to talk to the stewards now theyll let him in the crowd have come to see the bull dont you bank on it everyones been waiting for you too we held lunch until a quarter of an hour ago its not bloody good enough it was with great difficulty that janey stopped herself shouting back at him matters were hardly improved when billy turned up abject with apologies and said they were going to allow him to jump and he had better go and walk the course see you later darling he said to janey go and have some lunch face set she ignored him kevin coley took her arm none too gently youd better come along to the tent and repair some of the damage and smile for christs sake youre being paid for it in the tent they found customers and staff stuffing roast beef and lobsters most of them were already tight kevin clones were everywhere with thatched hair and lightweight and lightcolored suits the wives also all seemed to wear beige or pastel suits many wore hats on the back of their heads with too much hair showing at the front and high heels which kept catching on the raffia matting and sinking into the damp earth beneath enid coley in a brown check suit and yellow shirt with a pussycat bow was not the only one who looked disapprovingly at janeys jeans and rugger shirt i dont care i dont care thought janey im eleven days late and im going to have a baby the little coley children or the sprats as billy called them had all been at the bottle and were rushing around being poisonous ill never let my children grow up like that janey thought to herself kevin put her between two directors wives who were eating strawberries and cream the gardens arent as good as the ones at buckingham palace said one no said the second although i didnt really notice the ones at buckingham palace the first time i went next moment helen walked into the tent looking like a million dollars in an offwhite canvas suit and flat dark brown boots im real sorry i couldnt make lunch you did get the message didnt you but with young kids its so difficult to get away she said to kevin and enid who looked as though theyd been kissed under the mistletoe enid pink with pleasure took helen on a tour of the more important clients helen was so nice to all of them then suddenly she saw janey and her face lit up janey how lovely i didnt know whether youd be able to get away we were just saying the bsja ought to club together and buy you a bra janey said enid coley later janey sat in the riders stand with helen watching the big class she had been pleased with her rugger shirt and jeans until she saw helens suit which was french and cost at least when they had walked through the crowds earlier all the men had stared at helen so janey had taken her dark glasses off so people could see her sexy slanting eyes but they still looked at helen so she took off her denim jacket to show off her splendid bosom but they still looked at helen why the hell couldnt billy be as rich as rupert so she could afford decent clothes she was still furious with kev who was sitting on her other side in the nextdoor stand he had booked seats for all his frightful clients who clapped and shrieked when riders fell off and cheered before rounds were finished and stood up and took pictures all the time to the rage of the people sitting behind them isnt kev hell she whispered to helen i bet he streaks his chest hair i think hes charming said helen in surprise billys stomach was killing him like a giant clenching a huge fist in his gut the only answer as kevin was safely in the riders stand was to nip into the bar for a couple of quick doubles those hangover pills you gave me arent doing much he grumbled to rupert when he got back to the collecting ring i should think not said rupert theyre for backache dyou know i really think tab is very bright she smiled at me today they dont usually smile till three months lucky you janeys not smiling at me suddenly billy thought of the shaved bush under those jeans and overwhelmed with lust he waved at janey janey ignored him it was a tough course ludwig went clear two americans just arrived and accustoming themselves to european fences in anticipation of the world championships went clear the usual mighty roar of applause went up as billy and the bull rode into the ring all kevins guests stood up to take photographs my husband may not be the most successful but hes certainly the most popular rider in england said janey shooting a venomous look at kevin who was tugging at his goalpost mustache and twisting his initial bracelet come on billy come on the bull yelled the crowd they too refused to adopt moggie meal al i cant bear to look said janey and didnt continuing to talk to helen about straightlegged jeans billy was clear and jumping beautifully until he came to the penultimate fence when a great cheer went up from the moggie meal contingent and distracted the bull who jumped the wing instead of the fence and catching his front leg went head over heels the moggie meal supporters let out piercing shrieks and started clicking their cameras frantically billy was unhurt and managed to hang on to the reins getting up and running like mad after a thoroughly rattled bull nearly crashing into a flag billy picked it up and waved it in mock fury at the bull who backed away in terror billy started to laugh threw down the flag snatched up a handful of grass and gave it to the bull reducing the crowd to fits of laughter vaulting onto the bulls back he cantered out of the ring grinning broadly thats two grand up the spout thought janey i dont know what hes got to look so cheerful about billy came into the stand kissed helen hello and sat down between her and janey sorry kev he said janey caught a waft of whisky and hoped it didnt reach kevin after two minutes billy got to his feet whod like a drink not for me said kevin coley pointedly nor me said helen standing up i must go and ring bergita has anyone got any change be my guest said kevin coley going pink again as he handed her the coins thats what i call a real lady said kevin as helen made her way along the row thanking everyone for getting up as opposed to me muttered janey to herself crossly pity she doesnt come to shows more often but then shes such a caring mother kevin went on janey looked stonily down at the collecting ring where a blackhaired rider was walking towards a girl groom with long mousy hair who was leading a large gray horse whos that hes attractive she said to billy thats jake lovell said billy i was telling you about him last night and that grooms his sisterinlaw fenella maxwell she won a novice class this morning and shes only sixteen shes bloody good jakes trained her really well isnt she pretty shes certainly a most attractive young lady said kev im surprised you can tell for the spots said janey meow said kevin oh go eat your own product snapped janey she went downstairs to the loo she really must stop being a cow glancing at her reflection under the fluorescent lighting she thought how awful she looked piggyeyed and shadowed she did hope she wasnt going to be one of those women who felt sick for nine months as she sat on the loo she felt the sudden cold on her shaven bush just to convince herself she slipped her finger between her legs then pressed it against the white gloss lavatory wall she couldnt believe it she reached further into her vagina pushing against the neck of the womb she pressed the white wall again it was unmistakable a second dark red fingerprint she gave a groan tears spilling out of her eyes she was wracked with despair oh god the red badge of discouragement it was so ironic before she was married the red fingerprint was all she craved shed been so terrified all the time of getting pregnant now she knew why it was called the curse the curse of not having babies she leant against the wall and cried and cried twenty minutes later she came out of the loo huddled behind her dark glasses kevin was waiting outside where the hell have you been billy was looking for you hes just about to jump moggie meal dick he told me to tell you whats the matter he lifted off her dark glasses why are you crying nothing its nothing worried about money her lip trembled i thought i was pregnant i was ten days late you see ive just discovered im not been trying long about eighteen months since we married really may not be your fault janey gave a bitter laugh billys mother thinks it is kevin looked at her thoughtfully enids got a firstrate gynecologist ill tell her to give you a ring mandryka got four faults and was out of the running rupert was first jake lovell second it was noticed that both men stared stonily ahead not exchanging a single word as they lined up for their rosettes helen drove home with rupert i really do think janey should look after billy better all his boots need heeling he was wearing a filthy shirt and kevin said she made him really late today rupert shook his head theres no doubt that william has made a marriage of inconvenience billy went abroad again he was very loath to leave janey when she was so depressed and also miss the opportunity of sleeping with her in the middle of the month when she was at her most fertile he was tempted to fly back for the night but he simply couldnt afford it janey promised him shed try not to worry and would concentrate on her book concentration was not easy the tax man dropped in so did the builders and the vat bully boys all wanting money janey explained that billy was away and that she wasnt entitled to sign checks unless he was here but fear came in great waves she hadnt liked the way the vatman looked at her furniture the days were so long too she got up early which meant she was starving by midday and started miseryeating having worked until six in the evening she was shattered and ready to dive into a quadruple vodka evenings yawned ahead she went to see helen and grumbled how bored she was helen suggested she did something for charity why didnt she join the local distressed gentlefolks committee janey went sharply into reverse saying that that would be carrying coals to newcastle and she was bored only because she had so much work to do the third day after billy left janey tried and failed to write a chapter on schoolboys she didnt know any schoolboys all her brothers were older she ought to go to eton or harrow or the local comprehensive and talk to some but research took time and was invariably expensive she wrote down all the men shed been to bed with rather too many of them hoping this might give her inspiration it didnt then she tore the list up in case billy found it and was upset the house looked awful she went from room to room trying to find some free table space shed written in the bedroom and the kitchen and the drawing room and even the dining room and left them all in a mess everywhere except the future nursery she was not going in there it made her cry the garden looked so pretty full of hollyhocks and roses and honeysuckle hanging heavy on the warm june air the lime trees were in yellow flower filling the air with sweet heady scent the lime tree bower my prison she thought to herself she looked again at her contract and trembled words it said she hadnt really produced any of them and her publisher kept ringing and saying hed be only too happy to come down and discuss what shed already done she wished she were in athens with billy it was no good trying to work shed go out and weed the front garden and think about married men but after shed weeded up two snapdragons she decided shed better just think about weeding perhaps her subconscious would start working overtime mavis sat aggrieved and shivering ostentatiously behind her going outside meant walks not weeding harold evans came out and rolled in the catmint mavis gave halfhearted chase and harold shot up a tree tail flushed out like a lavatory brush after half an hour janey peered in at the kitchen clock two minutes past six hooray it was drinks time she went in and poured herself some vodka an inch up the glass two inches oh well it was mostly ice she couldnt be bothered with lemon but splashed in some tonic god what a wasted day she tried to think about men in a twocareer family not easy really she and billy could do with a wife each to look after them she looked round the kitchen and shuddered at the mess shed really clear up before billy came home she picked up the paper there was a brilliant piece by one of her rivals which depressed her even more at least there was a carry on film on television to cheer her up she heard the sound of voices but it was only two farm laborers going past the gate tired and red from the sun returning home to supper and a pint of beer perhaps because theyd earned it how lucky they were the despair of another wasted day overwhelmed her after three vodkas she was starving she made a herb omelette with six eggs throwing the eggshells into the cardboard box which she still hadnt emptied she meant to share the omelette which turned into scrambled eggs with mavis but mavis didnt like herbs so janey ended up eating the lot the boring pan had stuck shed clean it late she ran her hands through her hair a snow of dandruff drifted down she hadnt washed it since westerngate god she was going to seed she bolted all the doors and having poured herself another vodka was just about to turn on the television when the doorbell rang who the hell would call at this hour of the night it was bound to be some rapist out in the woods or even worse the bailiffs shed ignore it mavis was barking her head off and and the bell rang again terrified she unbolted the door and opened it an inch on the chain whos that she said peering through the gap next moment she was assailed by paco rabanne its me kevin she could see his medallion catching the light come in she said weakly i thought you were the vatman or a rapist probably both knowing my luck relief that he was neither gave way to panic which was the least sordid room to take him into im working she said plumping for the drawing room im afraid i only tidy up before billy comes home so i see said kevin the drawing room faced north and was cold there were dead flowers the skeleton of a threemonthold fire coffee cups and dog and cat plates janey shivered lets try the kitchen kevin followed her wrinkling his nose he looked quite amazing in a black velvet suit a white silk shirt slashed to the navel three medallions and his blond hair newly washed you look different she said ive shaved off my mustache thats right muttered janey fuzzily its right that a goalpost mustache should come down in the summer ive just left your husband in athens this morning i had to attend a function in this area thought id look in how is he said janey her face brightening bit choked moggie meal al seems to have lost his confidence since he hit the wing at westerngate moggie meal dick keeps fourfaulting which ones he kevin frowned the frown deepened as he saw the mess of cups and dirty milk bottles the sink full of dishes ive been working so hard janey explained again kevin looked pointedly at the halffull glass still with unmelted ice cubes what would you like to drink she said a dry white wine please well be a duck and get it from the cellar i must go to the loo upstairs she looked at herself in despair her hair looked like a mop her face was red her eyes tiny from drinking and lack of makeup old trousers and a shrunk tshirt made her bum and boobs look huge scraping a flannel under her armpits spraying her crotch with scent she slapped on some liquid foundation and failed to pull a comb through her tangled mane she went to the typewriter and wrote men shouldnt drop in with one finger downstairs kevin up from the cellar was holding a bottle and looking bootfaced i gather you dont like our wedding gift janey went white oh no no no we just put it there because er billys mother came to dinner and she had a poodle which er died and we thought shed be upset she shrugged helplessly it had been worth a try then there was the hassle of finding a corkscrew and a clean glass and then a basin that wasnt full of dirty dishes to wash it in theres a basin in the downstairs loo said janey then worried she might have forgotten to pull the chain she seized the glass and rushed off but it was all right she had why dyou buy whiskas instead of moggie meal said kevin looking at another of harolds plates which was gathering flies im sorry kev i know im a lousy wife but id just learnt the names of billys horses when you changed them all and the village shops run out of moggie meal i get so bombed when im writing and i havent eaten all day kev raised an eyebrow at the remains of scrambled egg in the pan hows the book going all right im up to married men based on billy billys too nice most married men i know are like babies into everyone she wondered if he used hot tongs as well as a blow dryer and had got that butterscotch smooth tan out of a bottle he was in good shape though his flat stomach emphasized by the big gucci belt she was dying to get herself another drink but he was only a quarter way down his kevin didnt drink much it made his accent slip she felt mesmerized by his flashing gold cuff links and medallions dont you get frightened when youre here alone he asked ive got a panic button wired up to ruperts house and a burglar alarm but since harold kept setting it off i gave up using it you were pretty scared when i arrived i thought you were the bailiffs please dont come home bill bailiff she giggled lamely kevin got up and walked round the kitchen this place is a tip and you look frightful id never allow enid to let herself and our place go like this janey felt livid she got up and poured another drink but nothing came out it helps if you unscrew the top of the bottle said kevin do you honestly think janey went on furiously that if you walked into solzhenitsyns house hed be dusting or putting cups in dishwashers or making chutney you bet theres a mrs solzhenitsyn playing the volga boatman to calm his nerves and bringing in the samovar and caviar butties every ten minutes and typing his manuscript as well as keeping his house clean christ enid looks after me you bet she does because youre so jolly rich she doesnt have to work she doesnt have a money problem in the world any more than helen does so they can spend all day washing their hair and waxing their legs and thinking about paintwork and getting your underpants whiter than ever my mother went out to work and she cleaned the kitchen floor every day so what snapped janey she wasnt a writer writers think about writing all the time not cleaning tickets and if theyre worried about money all the time they cant write itd be better said kevin if instead of writing rubbish about the opposite sex which makes you restless you scrapped that book and spent more time looking after billy he looked like a tramp in athens breeches held together with safety pins pink shirts dinner suit covered in stains holes in his shoes he picked up a pile of envelopes flipping through them these envelopes should have been posted weeks ago youre a slut he went on turning to face her and youre overweight if you were my wife id send you straight off to a health farm ridiculously bloody expensive said janey blushing scarlet id rather buy a padlock for the fridge i am trying to write a book you drink too much so does billy its impairing his judgment if hes not careful he wont be selected for the world championships i expect hes fed up with being hassled by you thats not the way you should talk to your husbands sponsor said kevin getting to his feet and putting down his halffinished drink well im off janey was shaken she was so used to rows with billy ending up in bed that she couldnt cope with the progression of this one arent you going to finish your drink no thanks get some sleep and when youre sober well do some straight talking its hardly been crooked talking this evening said janey sulkily following him unsteadily to the door in the doorway he turned shoving his fist against her stomach just a second before she hastily pulled it in god that zips taken some punishment ill come back on thursday and take you out to dinner he said it was all billys fault thought janey as she shaved her legs three days later for telling kev to drop in on her beastly jumpedup creep the bath looked as though a sheep had been sheared not a follicle of superfluous hair was left on her body her bush had started to grow again like a badly plucked chicken so shed even shaved that too she hadnt had anything except three grapefruit and two bottles of perrier since shed last seen kevin shed cleaned the house and washed her hair and painted her nails and rubbed body lotion in all over even into the back of her neck she couldnt tell billy about kev because he hadnt rung which boded ill too he always rang if he won oh well shed be a good wife and nice to billys sponsor and at least kev would be useful for her chapter on arrivistes janey detested kevin coley but she cleaned the bedroom most thoroughly of all putting roses on one bedside table and the moggie meal sponsored book of pedigree cats beneath the bible on the other she felt much thinner but her nerves were jangling from so many slimming pills nothing was going to happen tonight she kept telling herself but she hadnt felt so jumpy since shed gone to wembley for her first date with billy kev hadnt said what time he was coming probably he had high tea and would arrive at five he turned up at eight when she answered the door he said sorry must have come to the wrong house and turned back down the path kevin have you been drinking he turned grinning is it really you you look quite different from the lady i saw three days ago he stared at her for a minute wow he said sliding a hand round her waist you look delightful quite the old janey for a second he fingered the spare tires above her straining white trousers you could lose another stone and a half without missing it but youre on the way and the place smells fresher too no one reflected janey would be able to smell anything except paco rabanne im only coming out with you to research my chapter on married men she said he had a buffcolored mercedes frank sinatras songs for swinging lovers was belting out of the tape deck christ he must be old to like that kind of music thought janey that brushedforward hair must cover a multitude of lines the village boys idly chatting and guffawing in the evening sun stared as they passed thatll reach mrs bodkin and probably helen by tomorrow thought janey lovely properties remarked kev as they drove along lovely old cotswold places he was wearing a white suit and a black shirt and a heavy jet medallion youd get a black eye if he kept it on in bed janey was appalled to find herself thinking interesting that hed made such an effort for her beyond seeing that his suits were reasonably well cut in the first place billy didnt think about clothes he was without vanity that was one of the things she loved about him kev took her to a very expensive restaurant in cheltenham the menus had no prices and although he showed off and was very rude to waiters snapping his fingers complaining the wine wasnt cold enough and sending food back on principle they treated him with undeniable deference how do you keep so fit she asked looking at his waistline i exercise a lot enid and i have joined the country club you have to be elected i play a round of golf whenever feasible i jog on weekends i exercise with weights in the morning janey giggled do you swing enid above your head dont be silly said kevin coldly for the first course janey lapsed and had huge sticks of asparagus dripping in melted butter naughty chided kevin at least three hundred calories i dont care said janey lasciviously taking an asparagus head in her mouth ill go back to grapefruit tomorrow kevin had melon and left the maraschino cherries followed by steak well done with runner beans and a green salad janey noticed he left the spring onions she felt a great weariness probably because she hadnt had enough to drink she was fed up with talking about product attributes and growth potential then suddenly when she thought the evening was beyond redemption he ordered another bottle of sancerre and some of his cronies came over plainly impressed by janey im taking care of her while billys abroad said kev and winked suddenly janey was enjoying herself there was nothing like the high that went with the possible beginning to an affair kev kept looking at her holding her eyes a second longer than necessary as if he was caressing her he was so tough and positive and knew exactly where he was going dyou want to go somewhere and dance he said as he signed the bill she shook her head ashamed of the hopeless desire that was sweeping over her as they left the restaurant she swayed and he caught her arm sorry kev dont ask a girl to drink and diet it had been a clear hot day followed by a dewy short night theyd been haymaking the fields had that mingled honey scent of mown grass and drying manure as they drove home she said youll be the first man since billy so i should hope itll be like losing ones virginity all over again kevin put a perfectly manicured hand on her thigh the diamond in the center of the thick gold ring on his third finger glittered in the moonlight ive wanted you since the first night we met but youve always been so bloody superior not a lady like helen youre a snob shed never have sneered and put me down the way you have im sorry i suppose i hated billy being dependent on someone else he removed one of the two bracelets on her right wrist and threw it on her lap and dont jangle you jangle enough she said when they got back to the cottage mavis followed her around like a disapproving duenna kevin went to have a pee janey went into the kitchen it was so hot she opened the fridge and getting a piece of ice out of the tray ran it over her tits to make the nipples stand up then she poured herself a huge drink to steady her nerves the next minute kev walked in and took it from her and poured it down the sink you dont need that sort of booster anymore he said i hate him she said to herself hes everything that darling billy isnt mavis whod done sterling service as a hot water bottle all winter was outraged when kevin tried to shut her out of the bedroom she always comes in protested janey not anymore she doesnt said kevin booting her with his foot you would get on well with helen sighed janey i dont approve of pets in bedrooms ouch howled kev as mavis bit him sharply on the ankle it took all janeys selfcontrol not to giggle there was no plaster in the house but finally kev stripped off except for one of billys handkerchiefs tightly bound round his ankle climbed into bed i hope your alarm clock works he said ive got a meeting in bristol at ninethirty janey looked at him through halfclosed eyes are you sure you dont want to send me back because im not at room temperature she put her hand on his cock which was inching upwards and was about to add that in terms of growth potential he was not bad himself but she didnt think hed be amused he made no comment about her shaved bush until afterwards you do that no billy does relationship still very much alive then yes said janey it was very nice to be made love to by someone so scented and powdered and tasting of gold spot which janey was less keen on but all the perfumes of arabia couldnt conceal the feral whiff of the jungle killer beneath his trappings kev was a wide boy a thug as ruthless as rupert she was ashamed of betraying billy by sleeping with kev in their bed on the other hand it was bliss not to have to get up and go home dribbling afterwards kev had only brought a slimline briefcase with him inside was a clean shirt a toothbrush and toothpaste in a case and a disposable razor hes everything that billys not thought janey once again perhaps thats why i fancy him and thats what i really need billy rang up next day things werent thrilling he was missing her hed be back on sunday did kev ring you good mandryka got a third yesterday but the bulls a bit stale im going to rest him next week before the world championship hows the book going fine said janey who hadnt touched it she felt guilty but safer kev wouldnt let her starve by the way where were you last night asked billy janeys mind galloped i had dinner with helen thats nice putting down the telephone she rang helen and suggested they had supper at the local bistro before she went out she was fortified by a telephone call from kev shed been waiting all day wondering if hed ring she found she couldnt eat anything so pushed her food around her plate youre not pregnant are you asked helen no no i was so disgustingly fat i took the opportunity of billys being away to go on a diet now my stomach seems to have shrunk thank god dont talk to me about reducing sighed helen ruperts given up liquor until after the world championship hes lost ten pounds and he looks great but golly it makes him mean for once helen unbent a bit rupert had bought her a gym tunic and wanted her to dress up as a schoolgirl but i cant ive got knobbly knees and im terrified hes going to start fancying the real thing janey remembering billys tales about tiffany bathgate rather thought rupert already had i wish billyd occasionally look at another woman she said idly itd be such fun getting him back janey was doing no work on her book but the house looked absolutely marvelous although women deny it they very seldom have a new man in their lives without idly thinking what hed be like to marry janey coley sounded perfectly dreadful it really wouldnt do on saturday morning janey steamed open their bank statement was appalled at what she saw hastily stuck it up again and went out and bought a pair of white dungarees a white canvas skirt and two striped tshirts the weather was so lovely she lay in the sun she could always tell billy shed been typing in the garden kev came and screwed her on saturday afternoon both of them were sober and the pleasure was even more intense janeyd lost eight pounds and was beginning to feel beautiful again afterwards they lay in each others arms did billy ring you asked kevin yes not much joy sometimes i wish he wasnt such a good loser hes a loser said kevin brutally lets make no bones about it how are we all going to cope at les rivaux billys so sweet he wont suspect anything but im not so sure about enid suddenly she was startled out of her wits by the doorbell it was a member of the tory party canvassing for a byelection im just changing to go out janey called out of the window but you can rely on my vote got to get that bloody man callaghan out somehow said kevin next time the bell went kev had to unplug himself janey staggered to the window this time it was the labor party no you dont need to convince me you can rely on my vote she said thats done it said kev getting up ive got to go anyway janey was appalled at how miserable she felt they had a bath together too small really said kev as he dried himself you ought to come in my jacuzzi at sunningdale you will one day feeling happier janey put on her new white overalls which just covered her boobs and nothing else her newly washed hair divided over her brown shoulders as she made the bed she instinctively removed hairs looking for kevidence she told herself with a giggle she persuaded him to have a drink before he went they were in the drawing room when they heard a step outside janey went to the window expect its the liberal party oh my god its billy its all right said kev calmly billy told me you were depressed and to drop in to cheer you up i just happened to be in the area janey patted her hair frantically in the mirror do i look as though ive just got out of bed she asked kev laughed you always do anyway billy was absolutely thrilled to see them both hed always been worried that they got on so badly and this would certainly make things easier he looked awful thoroughly tired out his hair a tangled mess eyes bloodshot he smelt of curry and drink he needs some gold spot thought janey how did the last days go asked kevin bloody awful the competitions so hot because everyones over for the world championship youre lucky if you get in the money at all heres some arpège for you sweetheart he also put down a bottle of dutyfree whisky your wifes been on a diet said kev doesnt she look great sensational said billy so does the house he looked around really lovely you must have worked hard im filthy i must go and have a bath and change have a drink first said janey sloshing three fingers of whisky into a glass she was nervous kev might have left some of his jewelry in the bedroom billy accepted it gratefully anything to postpone the opening of the brown envelopes and his bank statement they discussed the world championships he would either jump mandryka or the bull the bull i mean moggie meal al is a bit stale im going to rest him for the next fortnight the gods that had blessed billy during the first year of marriage seemed to withdraw their sponsorship during the second the following week billy rang jubilant from a show in the south saying hed just come first in a big class and won a car he was going to pop up to london in the morning for a ten oclock appointment with enids gynecologist whod been making some tests then pop back to the show compete in the afternoon then drive the car straight home afterwards tracey would drive the lorry and as the car was still being run in he was afraid theyd both arrive in the middle of the night but i really feel my lucks turning darling janey spent the afternoon in bed with kevin so she was glad billy was going to be late at midnight the telephone rang it was from a call box billy yes darling where are you on the penscombebirdlip road are you all right i dont know i was driving home when a wall jumped out and hit me christ im afraid i was a bit over the limit and i think the cars a writeoff stay where you are said janey ill come and get you she drove in her nightie frantic with worry the first thing she saw was a concertinaed pile of scrap metal god knows how billy had escaped alive then she saw billy sitting on the wall singing billy lloydfoxe sat on a wall billy lloydfoxe had a great fall all kevins horses and all kevins men couldnt put billy together again he was absolutely plastered she must get him home before the police came along and breathalyzed him billy lloydfoxe sat on a wall he began again shut up and get in the car she had to help him in his legs kept giving way when they got home she helped him upstairs he collapsed on the bed white and shaking there was a huge bruise on his forehead must have a pee he got to his feet and staggering towards the wardrobe opened the door and was about to step in billee the loos the other way oh yes he took two steps back one forward and veered off towards the loo i didnt know anyone could pee that long said janey when he came back ive done one minute fiftyfive seconds before now rupert timed me he collapsed on the bed again she knelt down beside him whats the matter he looked at her not focusing i went to the doctor and what did he say that its me not you ive got a zilch sperm count he showed me it under the microscope not a tadpole in sight he hung his head he said we should think seriously about adoption janey put her arms around him oh angel im so sorry but it doesnt matter of course we can adopt but i wanted you to have my babies you wanted one so badly and i cant give you one christ she felt desperately sorry for him but she couldnt help feeling relief in a way for herself and boo sucks to his bloody mother she put him to bed and within seconds he had passed out he woke with a most appalling headache and went to the doctor who said he had concussion as well and he should rest for a week billy ignored him the following morning he set off with rupert for aachen janey rang kevin as soon as hed gone and feeling disloyal told him about the car and the sperm count in a way she felt shed been dealt a marked card shed married billy thinking he was a star and the star had almost immediately started falling out of the firmament that shed contributed almost entirely to this fall didnt enter her head she forgot how miserable shed been racketing from lover to lover in fleet street waiting desperately for telephone calls often spare at weekends she remembered only the fun and excitement kevins propaganda was softpedaled but lethal honey billy is simply not macho enough for you youre like a beautiful lily youll only thrive if tied to a very strong stake hes too weak too piscean hes totally dominated by rupert he simply cant cope on his own hes never going to get himself out of this mess hes over the top everyones saying so by contrast kev was so positive ordering her about paying restaurant bills with wads of fivers she even suspected he put her on expenses billy rang her from aachen he sounded depressed and slightly tight darling please dont worry about babies i promise ill sort us out after the world championships i miss you horribly i wish you were here janey proceeded to plead with him not to ring her until he got home i hate to hear you so down it really upsets me puts me off work i know youll get in the money soon feeling faintly guilty janey then left mavis with mrs bodkin and flew off to spain with kev billy was due back on sunday shed be home by saturday lunchtime she spent a fortune on clothes and having her hair streaked beforehand she felt subconsciously that if she made the financial situation worse some kind of confrontation would be triggered off kev had never mentioned any permanent relationship he was too fly for that but the affair was certainly hotting up billy got home at midday on saturday his heart like lead there was no barking janey must have taken mavis for a walk he had difficulty opening the front door for letters on the doormat he was so tired it took him a little while to realize that among them were his own letters and postcards from aachen and there was the telegram hed sent yesterday saying he was coming home early unopened the house was very tidy harold evans weaved furrily round his legs but there was no sign of janey anywhere he felt faint with horror perhaps shed been murdered or kidnapped he poured himself a large whisky and telephoned mrs bodkin shes gone away researching for her book in norfolk she said and staying with her mother shes coming home today ive got mavis shes been as good as gold dyou want to come and pick her up relief gave way to a dull anger mrs bodkin looked secretive and overexcited when he arrived her mouth disappearing in disapproval she loved billy he was as nice a gentleman as you could find and so thoughtful but he should never have married that trollop after two more drinks back at the cottage he heard a car draw up there was janey running up the drive in a faded purple tshirt and sawnoff pink trousers her tortoiseshell hair was incredibly bleached by the sun billy didnt recognize streaking and she was browner and thinner than ever his stomach twisted with desire and the pain of his ulcer all he could think of was how much hed like to fuck her darling how lovely you said you werent coming back until tomorrow cried janey must have a pee she didnt look as though shed been staying with her mother thought billy she never bothered to wear makeup or scent when she went down there i bought you some norfolk strawberries darling she lied actually shed bought them in cheltenham on the way from the airport in case she needed an alibi they went back into the house sweetheart you look awfully pale said janey suddenly noticing whats happened i sent you this telegram you havent read it he turned away fighting a terrible desire to break down and cry janey opened it with shaking hands had he heard something about her and kev smoothing out the paper she read mandryka broke leg had to be shot coming home love billy she turned in horror oh my angel im so sorry she went over and put her arms round his shaking shoulders what happened it was my fault he missed his jerk hit the top pole smack got caught up in the rest of the poles and that was that it was horrible his face worked like a little boy about to cry he was such a great horse i know he was badtempered but he could be so brave come to bed she said gently ill take care of you upstairs he rolled on top of her took her perfunctorily then immediately fell asleep theres no choice said billy facing the ruins of his career next morning its the bull for the world championship at least kevs keeping away and not breathing down my neck at the moment christ knows what hell say about mandryka he was away the next two days jumping the grade b and c horses at crittleden janey spent the second afternoon in bed with kevin where they did more talking than copulating billy said kevin had been drunk in aachen when he jumped moggie meal dick that was why he put the horse wrong at the fence where he broke his leg everyone was talking about it he was gone long before billy got home giving janey plenty of time to wash off scent and makeup get back into her old clothes and be sitting dutifully at her typewriter good day she asked not bad heres the tatler rupert gave it me theres a picture of tab and helen i think rupes bought up every copy hes so chuffed billy went upstairs and changed into his dressing gown secured with his old harrovian tie the belt had been lost years ago as there was no sign of dinner he poured himself a drink and then started opening the new pile of brown envelopes he started to tremble he knew janey had been depressed about babies and probably needed to cheer herself up but these bills for clothes were ludicrous and how the hell could she have spent at the hairdressers she hadnt even had a haircut he poured himself another drink and sat down on the sofa darling we must talk about money janey however was deep in the tatler oh look theres mike pardoe and theres ruperts mother she is amazingly well preserved she must be over fifty billy tried again ive just been through the returned checks the bank say theyre going to bounce anything more we submit soon i wont be able to feed the horses oh dear said janey in mock horror of course the horses always come before everything else how long dyou think itll be before the books finished how can i tell oh that is a sweet one of tab and helen looks marvelous she is so bloody photogenic and theres caroline manners what an incredibly plain child you said july last time i asked more likely october so it wont be published this year nope oh look henrietta pollock got engaged poor man billys heart sank he was hoping to keep the manager sweet by a promise of by christmas he tried again we simply cant go on like this weve got an overdraft of we owe the tax man twenty grand and the builders fifty grand and the vatmans threatening to take us to court and you spend at the hairdressers and on clothes expecting me not to notice dyou take me for a complete fool not complete pity you pranged the car oh theres ainsley hibbert shes gone blond not a bad guy with her too janey have you listened to a word ive said yes i have we owe rather a lot of money about in fact youll have to tap darling mumsie wont you she wont let poor billy starve billy was having difficulty keeping his temper if the books not going to be finished yet could you do some journalism just to pay the more pressing bills janey got up i must go and put on the parsnips i dont want any dinner if you honestly think i can eat it doesnt seem to stop you drinking why dont you go out and win something its awfully boring being married to a failure billy put his head in his hands why dyou always try and make me feel small you are small said janey you told me youd lost a lot of weight recently for christs sake cant you take anything seriously if we really try i know we can get straight borrow something from rupert hes pushed himself at the moment paying for the new indoor swimming pool said janey walking out of the room two minutes later billy followed her putting his arms round her angel we cant afford to fight janey laughed bitterly i should have thought that was the only thing we could afford to do the telephone rang billy went to answer it oh hello yes i see i quite understand it was very good of you to let me know good luck anyway very slowly he put the receiver down as he turned he seemed to have aged twenty years that was malise ive been dropped for the world championships he wanted me to know before i read it in tomorrows papers theyve selected jake lovell instead what thought janey was kev going to say stuck with a tent in les rivaux and all his male customers revved up for a stag freebie full of ohlalas although there was colossal prestige in being picked for the olympics it meant one competed only against amateurs the competition the riders wanted to win almost more therefore was the world championship which took place every two years midway between the olympic games and which was open to amateurs and professionals alike the championships were also considered more of a test of horsemanship because in the last leg the four finalists had to jump a round on each others horses as well more and more show jumpers were forced to turn professional vot is zee point as ludwig told dudley diplock in an interview in competing at zee olympics when so many of zee best riders are banned and only votching zee event on television it was with considerable trepidation at am on a tuesday in midjuly that jake set off with fen and tanya for les rivaux in the lorry to take the ferry at southampton the lorry had been loaded up with hay hard feed and woodshaving bedding the night before tory was to follow later with the car the caravan and the children everything was planned to the last tincluding a large jar of lemon sherbets for macaulay even so it turned out to be a nightmare journey the temperature was up in the eighties cow parsley along the motorway verges had given way to hogweed holding its flat disks up to a cloudy gray sky through which the sun shone opaque like an alkaseltzer jake drove tanya mapread fen kept them both supplied with cups of black coffee as they neared the coast the sky darkened at the port fen lost the horses health papers and the entire lorry had to be turned out before she found them where they should have been all the time in the horses passports by now they had missed two ferries and the horses picking up the vibes of anxiety were stamping and restless after a further delay despite blackening skies and large whitetipped agitated waves the ferry decided to sail a storm blew up in midchannel bucketing the boat from side to side and throwing fens new pony the young and comparatively inexperienced desdemona into such a panic she nearly kicked the box out fen having had repeated strips torn off her by jake for losing the health papers was further upset by two lorryloads of little calves on the boat mooing piteously with their pathetic faces peering out between the slats in turn she went and tore a strip off their driver for not giving them any water finally they reached the french port at seven oclock and set off for les rivaux jake was going mad at being stuck behind juggernauts but this was fens first trip to france and she couldnt contain a surge of excitement as the sun came out and they drove past orchards poplarlined rivers and a ravishing château halfhidden by trees its reflection glimmering in a lake she was bitterly disappointed that her hero billy lloydfoxe hadnt been selected hed bought her a drink at westerngate not that that meant much for hed been buying everyone drinks but perhaps she might meet some handsome frenchman at the world championship whod sweep her off to his château and make fantastic love to her behind peeling gray shutters her dreams were rudely shattered by a loud bang the lorry swerved terrifyingly somehow jake managed to steer it into the slow lane and despite frenzied screeching of tires from all sides avoided a crash they had blown a tire causing the most frightful traffic jams which resulted in apopleptic frenchmen no doubt missing their dinners leaning continually on their horns which did nothing to improve jakes nerves eventually just as the breakdown van arrived and towed them onto the side of the road a vast dark blue juggernaut with the familiar emerald green words rupert campbellblack great britain on the side flashed past blowing a derisive tantivy on the horn and making no attempt to stop and help it was three oclock in the morning and many more cups of black coffee later before they finally rumbled into the horsebox park to find as a final straw that two of their boxes had been appropriated by ruperts horses and a third by a horse belonging to someone named dino ferranti hes the american number three said jake fen loved jake despite having so many strips torn off her that she was practically fleshless she knew this kind of hassle was the last thing he needed before a championship he was all for putting the horses in other stables and sorting it out in the morning but fen seething with protective indignation was determined to drag ruperts new groom dizzy out of bed it wasnt hard to find ruperts caravan even though it was parked some way from the others under an oak tree every light was blazing and such sounds of laughter and revelry disturbed the hot summer night that even the stars looked disapproving throwing open the door she found rupert ludwig and a languid very goodlooking boy with streaked blond hair lazy gray eyes and an olive complexion playing strip poker dizzy wearing only a gstring was stretched out on one of the bench seats another beautiful darkhaired girl was sitting on ruperts knee wearing one of his striped shirts and nothing else ludwig was down to his underpants a riding hat and one sock the languid boy was just in jeans and rupert who was off the drink and smoking a joint was the only one fully dressed they were all high as kites laughing uproariously and half watching a blue film on the video in which a plump redhead was doing unmentionable things to a supine father christmas having glanced at the film fen went crimson and looked back at the table hastily averting her eyes as one of the brunettes breasts fell out of the striped shirt bon soir said rupert asseyezvous its fifty pence in the back stalls come on honey drawled the handsome boy in a strong southern accent his eyes crossing like a siamese cat come and sit on ma knee no you come and neck wiz me said ludwig getting to his feet and clicking his bare and socked heels together youre all disgusting stormed fen and whats more she said turning on rupert you and some creep named dino ferranti have stolen our stables aw cmon honey come over here said the american boy holding out long sunburnt hands well youd better find somewhere else to put your donkeys said rupert you havent met dino ferranti have you no nor do i want to said fen losing her temper look she screamed waving the papers under ruperts nose numero quatrevingt et un deux trois quatre its as plain as the nez on votre visage we didnt realize they were your stables said dizzy pouting i suppose youre too thick to read like most of ruperts grooms temper temper said rupert you bloody well come and shift them if youd had the decency to stop and help on the motorway wed have arrived at the same time as you and there wouldnt be this stupid muddle ive never met anyone so deficient in team spirit what dyou want me to do asked rupert start singing forty years on billys the singer and hes not been selected thanks to your fucking brotherinlaw fen didnt rise she turned and went down the steps all right if you wont move your horses ill let them out dont play silly games snapped rupert youll regret it come on dino its your deal whos that shes kinda cute drawled the american boy taking a swig out of the whisky bottle and handing it to ludwig jake lovells sisterinlaw said rupert wass he like hell hes got a chip or as my wife would say a french fry on his shoulder his lack of charm seems to have rubbed off on her five minutes later dino lost the round and had to take off his jeans getting up to unzip his fly he looked out of the window beautiful night he drawled moonlights bright as day look theres the big dipper ah dont know if ahm imagining things but ah just saw a gray horse trotting past the window ludwig got unsteadily to his feet and peered out its snakepit and zee other horse he said zee leetle maxvell ees taken zem avay you better pull zee thumb out rupert dino ferranti started to laugh well ill be damned in a flash rupert had tipped the brunette onto the floor and was out of the caravan streaking across the grass in his bare feet come back he bellowed to fen fen trotted on keeping a safe distance ahead of him not till you promise to get your horses out of our stables despite the month off drink and two miles jogging every morning rupert couldnt catch up with her his language deteriorated tuttut said fen and in front of a lady too if you dont promise ill let them loose in the forest they need a break cant be much fun being owned by a revolting bully like you for five minutes which seemed an eternity to rupert she cantered slowly ahead until she was under the dark brow of the forest well she said rupert agreed all right well move them now give them back to me you little bitch and have you run me down ill take them back and tie them up outside your stables ill sue you for this we could sue you for pinching our stables and making a wide circle she galloped off yelling over her shoulder i hope you sleep horribly for grooms there is no lyingin two and a half hours later fen had to stagger out of bed to feed and skip out the horses having not eaten the day before after being sick on the boat she felt desperately hungry on the way back to the lorry for some breakfast she bumped into humptys groom bridie after swapping notes about their respective horses they decided to go and have breakfast together goings bloody hard said bridie gazing at the ground which was splitting and cracking like a great brown jigsaw no sign of rain either not going to suit lord campbellblack she lowered her voice hes been overjumping all his horses i saw them at crittleden last week theyd just come on from the royal and from aachen arcturus was lying down in his box so exhausted i thought he was dead it was sheer exhaustion they havent had a break since january arcy cant move unless hes drugged up to the eyeballs when the effect wears off hes in agony whos rupert going to jump in the championship snakepit said bridie fen groaned trust rupert to put in a sod needs two people in the stable one to groom one to keep an eye on him hes got a terrible cow kick already killed one of ruperts jack russells perhaps he wont make the final on current form he cant fail they went into the breakfast tent fen was piling apricot jam onto her fourth croissant when bridie asked her if shed seen dino ferranti i met him briefly last night said fen coldly dont you think hes devastating sighed bridie those snake hips and those terrific shoulders and that angelically depraved face and he dresses so well he was halfnaked when i saw him said fen after that the whole story came out bridie looked at fen in awe you didnt let out ruperts horses yes i did and rode snakepit yes probably didnt play up because you werent frightened of him mind you i think ruperts devastating too if he lifted a finger in my direction id go i wouldnt i think hes hell four hours later ludwig and dino ferranti both in dark glasses and both with fearful hangovers not improved by the midday sun tottered down to the stables to work their horses they paused at the sight of isa lovell not a day over six cantering macaulay round the practice ring okay fen he shouted in a shrill birmingham accent put it up and cantering towards the upright cleared fivefeet threeinches without any trouble dino ferranti had the puffy eyes of the heavy sleeper but at this moment he couldnt believe them look at that id rather not said ludwig with kids zat good im not going to be vorld champion much longer they stopped and watched for a few minutes as the child put the horse over several more jumps thats the girl from last night said dino ha said ludwig mees maxwell jake lovells groom maybe thats zee horse jakes going to jump looks very familiar no it cant be looks bloody well said dino les rivaux is one of the most beautiful seaside ports in brittany the showground is about a mile outside the town halfringed on the inshore side by the forest in which fen had threatened to let ruperts horses loose in front lies the sea on the day of the first warmup class of the show it lay like a film of motherofpearl on the platinum blond sand too many foreigners said a large english lady tourist disapprovingly as two italians nearly fell off their horses at the sight of ruperts groom dizzy riding past in a tight turquoise tshirt and no bra les rivaux was already swarming with dutch riders in leather coats portuguese with hot eyes and chattering teeth argentinian generals americans in panamas and dark glasses all gabbling away in different languages all lending a ritzy illicit flavor to the showground the weather was still muggy and hot and although the swallows were flying low and the cows lying down there was no sign of rain to soften the punishingly hard ground a large crowd gathered to watch this first event a small speed class in which most of the riders had entered the horses they would later jump in the world championship in the big afternoon class they would jump their second horses rumors had already begun to circulate round the showground that jake lovell was jumping one of ruperts old horses jake was not to be drawn nor was fen and when rupert first saw tanya leading macaulay and desdemona quietly round the collecting ring that morning he stared for a minute at the familiar big black horse with dinnerplate feet and the ugly white face but made absolutely no comment it was a mark of ruperts nerve that it had no effect on his riding he continued to bitch and mob up the other riders which was always his way of psyching himself up before a class then produced a round that threw everyone else into a panic not only was his speed faster than light but from the way he had to exert every ounce of brute strength to keep snakepit on course the horse was obviously a devil to ride guy de la tour the star on whom the french crowd had pinned their hopes jumped a slower but stylish clear to a storm of bravos he was followed by ludwig recovered from his hangover but who despite claras long legs couldnt catch rupert speed was not macaulays strong point he was too careful and jumped too high jake was very happy with a slow clear putting him in eleventh place as the americans were hot favorites for the nations cup there was a lot of interest in how the horses would react to a french course neither the number one male rider carol kennedy nor the number two the redheaded mary jo wilson had found their form yet and notched up eight and four faults respectively interest was therefore centered on dino ferranti riding a young liver chestnut thoroughbred called presidents man dino had never competed in europe before but even fen whod had another row with him in the practice ring because his groom dismantled the upright when she was about to jump it had to admit he was a glorious rider for the purist he lounged in the saddle like a cowboy and sat a little too far back but he was so supple he seemed made of rubber and was able to throw his weight completely off the horse while it was in the air yet somehow touch down smoothly as he landed loose mane and long tail flying in the american fashion presidents man loped round the course like a cottontail rabbit there was consternation and raised eyebrows all round when the clock said he was three seconds faster than rupert well done said everyone as he came out thats very lucky to win the first class in the show said humpty that is a handsome animal whos he by great our first win said mary jo rushing up and hugging dino thats rupert second ludwig third and guy fourth do you mind said a shrill voice barging through the circle of mutual admiration i havent been in yet soixantesix called the collection ring steward numero soixantesix je suis ici shouted fen ramming her hat down over her nose and galloping into the ring desdemona was only little more than a pony her father was a thoroughbred her mother a polo pony and she was fast and nippy with amazing acceleration between fences but like her mistress her courage at this stage was much greater than her technical skill laughing and joking ludwig dino rupert and guy had their backs to the ring all admiring the comely mary jo suddenly they heard cheering from the crowd and turning saw the little roan mare flying round the ring she turned in the air over the stile whipped over the double and took the wall at full gallop clearing it by inches jake put his hands over his eyes as she thundered down towards the combination looking in wonderment through splayed fingers he saw her pop pop pop over the three fences like a pingpong ball knocking a tenth of a second off dinos time she had to gallop halfway round the ring before she could pull up pink in the face with elation she made a discreet but perfectly noticeable vsign at the group round mary jo as she came out of the ring darklis and isa were yelling like savages jake bawled her out for bloody irresponsibility you could have brought her down at any moment then his face softened but it was a great round they were calling for the winners fen stuck her nose in the air and rode into the ring dino caught up with her in a white stock black coat and the tightest of white breeches with her newly washed hair tucked into a net she was almost unrecognizable as the angry child whod barged into ruperts caravan the previous night lady ah sure underestimated you fen ignored him you look real pretty when youre mad but ah sure wish youd smile i will when they give me my rosette ah thought you were jake lovells groom so i am so are isa and darklis we all muck in everyones everything are you going to ride that pony in the world championships fen patted desdemona lovingly no im too young thank christ for that said dino looking them up and down i guess its only a matter of time though news of ruperts strip poker party and fens moonlight flit with his horses spread round the ground like wildfire rivaled as gossip only by stories of billys drinking and speculation as to whether jakes horse now registered as nightshade was really macaulay then an italian rider found a bucket of bran in his horses stables not put there by any of his entourage and immediately everyone started panicking about sabotage security was tightened up all around the americans and the germans hired security guards with rotweillers even rupert went so far as to employ a man to sleep all night outside snakepits box terrified fenll let him out again said dizzy i bet you wouldnt have taken him she added to fen if youd known what a sod he can be only equaled at the moment by his master i dont know what the hells the matter with him rupert was missing billy in every major competition hed ever jumped billyd been there to fool around with bounce ideas off and talk out problems rupert was too proud to go to malise for advice hed lecture him and then be irritated if rupert didnt follow the advice helen was too ignorant and not really interested hyped up to a peak of physical fitness rupert longed to swim in the sea but thought it might put his eyes out for the nations cup tomorrow he longed for a drink but hed vowed not to touch a drop till the championship was over french girls mobbed him if anything more than english ones but he was finding easy lays less and less satisfactory and helens arrival the following day would put the kibosh on that he was also livid with helen for not bringing out the children lavinia de la tour had offered them the run of guys château thirty miles away but helen was too nervous about french food and water and rabid dogs and the effect of the heatwave on marcuss delicate skin tab whom rupert was dying to show off helen felt was too young rupert had never suffered from nerves before but he didnt want to ride macaulay in the final hed watched the gypsy rabble of the lovell gang those beautiful children with their frightful birmingham accents and their fearlessness swarming all over jakes horses polishing and plaiting them up kissing them playing round their feet as if they were big dogs hed never seen horses so relaxed or children so happy he compared marcuss cringing terror and he vowed tab would never grow up like that he was drawn to dino ferranti whom hed met while jumping on the florida circuit as he was drawn to ludwig as the rich beautiful and successful are invariably drawn to one another dino reminded rupert a little of billy they were both easygoing and had the same sense of the ridiculous but at twentysix dino was tougher and more ambitious he was vainer than billy too with his pale silk shirts his beautiful suits his expensive cologne and his ash blond hair that fell perfectly into place however much he ran his hands through it but beneath that almost effeminate languor dino had a will of iron and physical strength like rupert that allowed him to be in the thick of a party until five oclock in the morning yet still able to wipe the smile off the opposition next day dinos grandfather had been an italian immigrant who loved messing around with flowers and had started a small perfume factory he produced a perfume called ecstasy which became as famous and enduringly popular as joy arpège or chanel no his son paco had a shrewd head and capitalized enough on his fathers talent to become a millionaire as president and founder of ferranti inc which made all kinds of scents colognes soaps and aftershaves which sold worldwide later he diversified and started an engineering business his three elder sons all went dutifully into the company but dino his favorite the youngest and most beautiful rebeled from an early age he was interested only in horses riding his own ponies and even though he was beaten for it his fathers racehorses assuming he would grow out of this obsession paco let his son ride as much as he liked feeling deeply relieved when dino reached six feet by the time he was seventeen obviously too tall for a flatrace jockey at six foot two he was too tall for a jump jockey and turned instead to show jumping but there was no way he could make big money out of the sport in america his brothers complained he always smelled of the stables and flew off to further the cause of the ferranti empire whenever he came home deciding to cut his losses dino enrolled at massachusetts institute of technology to major in business economy when he took his freshman exams his papers were exemplary until the last exam when such was his despair he staggered in dead drunk in a dinner jacket just as everyone was picking up their pens waving a halfempty gin bottle he proceeded to offer it round to other shocked and frantically shushing candidates before passing out at his desk such was the brilliance of his other papers all straight as that the examiners overlooked such a lapse dino was elected president of the next years class paco was so delighted that the day dino was due to come home for the vacation a plane landed on the campus airstrip pacos reward for his sons success dino promptly flew home kissed his mother and having thanked his father asked for a private word in the library dad business isnt for me paco was astounded but youre doing so well i didnt want to embarrass you by having a ferranti fail and i guess i hate losing too but i dont want to spend the rest of my life in an office youve got other sons to do that im going to jump horses paco sighed still still why cant you do both because horses need you twentyfour hours a day just as a successful business does im a great rider i know it i want to be up there competing against the best in the world it is the only life i want to lead are you asking or telling me telling said dino gently if youre prepared to help me ill be eternally grateful if not ill make it on my own you cant make a living out of it in europe i can he saw the sadness in his fathers eyes im not a loser i wont starve id never forgive myself if i didnt try paco looked at his favorite son reflectively all straight as all but one when you were loaded i never guessed how much you were hating it that takes guts maybe youll make a go of it ill make a bargain with you ill help you out for the first five years so you can stay in the states five years later almost to the day dino arrived in les rivaux the world championships start with a nations cup the twenty riders in this event who have the least faults go through to the next leg which consists of three grueling individual competitions the four riders who average out the least faults in these go through to the final a compulsory rest day follows then the final takes place in which each of the four riders jump their own horse and then in turn the horses of the other three riders great britain had patchy fortunes in the nations cup rupert produced two dazzling clears on snakepit humpty trying to impress a new sponsor jumped disastrously with over twenty faults in both rounds driffield went clear then went to pieces in the second round jake had eight faults in the first round then went clear the americans jumped brilliantly so did the germans putting them first and second with the british a poor third this meant four american riders four germans rupert jake wishbone piero fratinelli the italian number one a couple of mexicans and to the ecstasy of the french crowd guy de la tour went through to the semifinal by the third and final competition of the semifinal ludwig and rupert were so far ahead on points that they virtually only had to stand up to get into the last four the class consisted of ten enormous fences with a jumpoff against the clock rupert got eight faults ludwig twelve which ensured them a place in the final dino went clear only jake and count guy were left to jump itll be you me ludwig and guy rupert said to dino as he came out of the ring one from each country very suitable jake was so incensed by ruperts contemptuous assumption that there was no likelihood he would make the final that he was prepared to carry macaulay over the fences if necessary you must win this class even to qualify said malise giving macaulay a pat as jake rode off into the ring macaulay was obviously determined to give all his supporters a heart attack fooling around pretending to shy at the crowd bucking and getting up to all sorts of antics between fences he nevertheless went clear kicking up his heels in a sort of equine vsign everyone got out their calculators trying to work out whether he was in or not in came guy who was ahead of both dino and jake on points laughing handsome he was turned on by a big crowd particularly of his own people he could feel the waves of love and admiration wafting over like a hot blow dryer coming up to the penultimate fence a huge upright which had unsettled everyone except macaulay guys spectacular black gelding charlemagne gave it a mighty clout everyone held their breath but the pole stayed put alas guy made the mistake of looking round like orpheus and the eurydice he lost was his place in the championship his concentration snapped and he put charlemagne wrong at the combination the horse hadnt enough impulsion to get far enough over the first element and demolished the second and the third the crowd groaned all round the course riders and their retinues were frantically tapping their calculators its worse than alevel math grumbled fen next moment malise came up to jake with a barely suppressed expression of delight on his face youre in he said americans were crowding around dino punching him on the arm were in were in no one dared show any elation in the face of such bitter french despair financially and from the point of view of national morale it was essential that the host nation had at least one rider in the final the crowd were too stunned to clap the commentator was too stunned even to translate into english his announcement that rupert dino ludwig and jake would go through dino and jake decided not to jump off they wanted to rest their horses for the final they rode into the ring together twenty thousand francs would be divided between them but not the huge vase that went to the winner it looked just like an urn oh my god we cant exactly break it in half said dino you better keep it jake im sure its to put your ashes in hell thought rupert im going to have to ride that black bugger after all it was one thing to get through to the final but quite another to have to think about it for the next two days ludwig was lucky the german team liked each other ate drank sightsaw sunbathed and worked their horses together all were firmly rooting for ludwig a german victory was all that mattered dino received the same support from the american team malise sighed and wished he could unite the british in the same way but rupert humpty and driffield were all individuals motivated by selfinterest and ambition and frantic jealousy nor could you expect any solidarity from jake lovell a loner who liked to keep to himself at shows at earlier shows billy had kept everyone sweet particularly rupert now he was absent tempers and hatreds flared up driffields persistent grumbling was getting on everyones nerves humpty was in despair knowing his newly acquired sponsors would be far from happy he hadnt made the final rupert and jake made no secret of their mutual animosity it was ironic thought malise that each would get more of a kick from finishing in front of the other than winning the championship determined to create some sense of union however malise insisted the entire team and their wives including fen went out to dinner that night to celebrate having two british riders in the final tomorrow was a compulsory rest day so it didnt matter if they suffered a few hangovers jake promptly refused on the grounds they couldnt get a babysitter alas they got back to their hotel to find the patrons wife who had given them frightful rooms overlooking a noisy main road had suddenly discovered from the evening paper that she had as a guest a potential world champion nothing she insisted was too much for monsieur lovell she and her husband would immediately move out of their quiet bedroom overlooking the courtyard so jake and tory could have the double bed and ensure two good nights sleep before the great ordeal all this was overheard by malise who was staying at the same hotel perhaps he asked madame would be prepared to babysit that evening to jakes fury madame was only too appy darklis and isa would have dinner in the kitchen and watch the sound of music on television it is arguable whether monsieur or jake felt more like strangling madame at that moment by the time their rooms had been sorted out fen jake and tory were the last to arrive for dinner the restaurant at the end of the town took up the entire ground floor of an eighteenthcentury château on the edge of an estuary gleaming virginia creeper jacketed the walls and threatened to close the shutters pale crimson geraniums cascaded into the khaki water smell that wine and garlic sighed fen ecstatically oh cheer up jake at least itll be a change from hamburgers and mars bars malise suntanned and elegant in a cream linen suit and dark blue spotted tie and colonel roxborough sweating in gray flannel rose to welcome them but not before rupert had turned to humpty saying here comes prince charmless and the two ugly sisters rupert implored helen blushing scarlet hi jake congratulations i was so excited when i heard you were in as the actress said to the bishop said rupert youre privileged jake you must be the only person whos excited my dear wife in years i certainly dont helen had arrived at les rivaux after a long long detour to visit some cathedral so she had missed seeing rupert go through to the final theyd had a row because she refused to sleep with him insisting she must wash her hair before dinner thats not true im over the moon about you making the final its just marvelous to have two british riders there must be difficult for you helen do you support us or the yanks asked humpty particularly when you see dino ferranti said humptys wife doreen hes out of this world come on sit down said malise you go next to doreen jake and fen can go between me and rupert and tory on ruperts other side torys going to need a long spoon said fen glaring at rupert touché he said and laughed whats everyone going to have to drink said colonel roxborough still on the wagon rupert only till saturday then im going to get legless christ im starving he looked across at a side table where a waiter was slicing up a long french loaf with a bread knife just imagine that that was ones cock he said with a shudder thinking she must make some attempt at conversation but feeling eighteen and a fat deb again tory asked rupert how tabitha was fine said rupert and proceeded to ignore her totally talking across to colonel roxborough about count guys débâcle and staring at a luscious brunette at a table nearby jake longed to rescue tory but he was trapped by doreen hamilton insulated by successive waves of exultation and apprehension at making the final he looked at the slice of lemon in his gin and schweppes counting the pips i will win i wont i will must have the best of three there were two pips in mrs hamiltons lemon i will i wont despondency struck then he looked across at colonel roxboroughs glass two slices two pips on the top he bent his head three on the bottom which added up to an uneven number relief overwhelmed him he would win doreen hamilton looked at him oddly what are you doing jake grinned counting lemon pips odd numbers i win evens i dont thats cheating you start with an odd so theres more chance of ending on an odd tell me she lowered her voice how is macaulay going to behave when rupert gets on his back very badly i hope rupert was making no secret of the fact that he found the company boring doreens incessant chatter gave jake plenty of opportunity to look around helen with her sadness and red hair reminded him of autumn he noticed the rapt expression on malises face as he talked to her so that was the way the wind blew shed be much happier with malise thought jake hed look after her but he was far too upright and oldschooltie to make a play for her soupe de bonne femme driffield was looking at the menu whats bonne femme good woman said rupert of absolutely no interest to anyone at last the food and several bottles of wine arrived im sure this octopus comes out of a tin grumbled driffield i wish id chosen hors doeuvres like you fen said humpty looking disconsolately at his piece of pâté the size of a matchbox i must say im terribly hungry said fen spearing an anchovy rupert was eating cepes he glanced up and caught fen looking at him a franc for your thoughts i was hoping one was poisonous even if it were id be okay for the final have no fear do you honestly think hopalong chastity stands a chance against me hell beat the pants off you snapped fen and dont call him that hasnt got the bigmatch temperament hell go to pieces he beat you at olympia this is the big time for a second he stared straight into her eyes and suddenly it was as though he was putting a spell on her youre going to be a knockout in a couple of years he said lowering his voice big deal for an ugly sister you heard did you im sorry almost matteroffactly as if he were examining a horse he ran an appraising finger down her cheek she winced away aware of the bumpiness of her complexion those spots would go with regular sex and youd soon lose that puppy fat he said you ought to come and work for me id let you ride in all the senior classes youre ready for it that was a stunning win at the beginning of the week jakes holding you back like revenge i suppose i dont forget so quickly she said her color mounting revenge won two medals he said im quite serious you and id make a great team in bed and out he was speaking almost into his buttonhole so none of the table except she could hear what about helen hissed fen i suppose she doesnt understand you for a minute the candlelight flickered on the predatory cold unsmiling face then he laughed making him human again on the contrary i dont understand her she uses much too long words fen gave a shriek of laughter then as the smile faded and he went on staring at her she was appalled to feel her stomach curl overwhelmed with a squirming helpless longing for him her plate of hors doeuvres was taken away hardly touched humpty looked reproachful what a waste nor could she eat her chicken kiev jake deep in conversation with doreen and colonel roxborough about other peoples horses had also drunk a great deal more than hed eaten suddenly he glanced down the table and saw little fen staring at rupert she was curiously still hed seen that look in frightened mares confronted by stallions terrified yet sexually excited hed felt the same terror without the excitement when revenge was taken away from him rupert was not going to take fen he stopped eating his steak fingering his knife helen had noticed it too suddenly she stopped talking to malise about proust its like asking me to go over to the russians fen was saying furiously and furthermore i dont like the way you treat your horses youve absolutely no idea how i treat my horses you just listen to gossip youre only sucking up to me because you think ill be so overwhelmed by your glamour ill give you a lot of tips about how jake rides his horses but it was the helpless snapping of courtship desperately helen turned to tory whats the name of the horse jakes riding in the final she asked christ she ought to know thought fen shes married to a finalist hes called nightshade mumbled tory nervously but in the stable we call him macaulay said fen how weird said helen rupert had a horse called macaulay once named after me macaulay was my maiden name ruperts face was a mask its the same horse said fen slowly spitting out every word it cant be said helen bewildered she turned to rupert he died of a brain tumor you said he did i did not said rupert in a tone that made fen shiver everyone was listening now i sold him to that sheik kalil who bought half a dozen horses a couple of years ago and you bought him from kalil helen asked jake no said jake flatly i found him in the stone quarries he was pulling a cart loaded with bricks said fen and he was starving they dont feed horses out there or water them just drive them in the midday sun till they collapse then they whip them till they get up again a muscle was flickering in ruperts cheek youve been listening to fairy stories again he said to fen weve got photographs hissed fen her fury fueled by guilt and anger because she found him irresistible jake saved his life i know you all sneer at all the medical knowledge he picked up from the gypsies but it bloody well works and it worked on macaulay he was just skin and bone held together by weals he could hardly walk its taken jake two years to get him right helen looked appalled is this true rupert rupert shrugged his shoulders how should i know if youre prepared to accept any cockandbull story i run a yard on a very tight budget and i cant ensure every horse i sell on is going to be mollycoddled for the rest of its life you sold him to the middle east said fen knocking over her wineglass as she jumped to her feet you must have known what would happen you ought to be bloody well ashamed of yourself bursting into tears she fled out of the restaurant there was a stunned silence rupert picked up his knife and fork and went on eating his steak whats up with her said driffield looking at the puddings on the menu perhaps shes eaten something that doesnt agree with her said ivor adolescent girls said colonel roxborough up one moment down the next overemotional my daughter was like that its their age how old is she he asked tory sixteen muttered tory staring at her plate she detested scenes and she felt desperately sorry for fen but need she have gone quite so over the top probably tired said malise needs a good nights sleep said doreen hamilton comfortably needs a good screw said rupert he hadnt noticed that jake had got to his feet and had limped down the table until he was directly behind rupert what did you say rupert didnt turn his head you heard yes i heard jakes eyes glittered like deadly nightshade berries his face ashen against the tousled black hair you leave her alone you bastard youre hardly in a position to call me that at least my parents were married to one another in church too unlike yours rupert exploded malise you leave my parents out of this hissed jake im warning you keep away from her why drawled rupert have you got the hots for her if you read your prayer book youd realize that sort of things very frowned on thou shalt not covet thy neighbors wifes sister and all that the next moment jake had grabbed ruperts shirt collar with one hand and snatched up the bread knife from the side table with the other jerking rupert towards him he held the knife against ruperts suntanned neck keep your foul mouth shut he gritted if i catch you putting one of your filthy fingers on her ill run this through you you fucking sadist and very slowly he drew the blade across ruperts throat no one moved no one spoke everyones eyes were mesmerized by the knife blade glinting in the candlelight then helen gave a strangled sob jake said malise quietly give me that knife its all right colonel gordon said jake without looking in his direction this time its a warning rupert but you heard me you stay away from her next time you wont get off so lightly he threw the knife down so it fell across fens red wine stain giving an illusion of spilt blood then limped out of the restaurant are you all right gasped helen rupert sprang to his feet ready to give chase but malise was too quick leaping up he blocked ruperts path no he said sharply he might have been speaking to a rabid dog about to pounce stay here it was all your fault rupert looked at him incredulously that man has just tried to kill me theres a simple remedy to that said malise dont wind him up bloody bad form said colonel roxborough fellow cant hold his drink lets have some brandy think we all need it i want some crêpes suzette said driffield rupert sat down his face absolutely still malise looked round none of this is to go any further than this table we dont want the press getting hold of it rupert was simply taking trouble to be nice to fen she overreacted because shes protective about macaulay jake overreacted because hes protective about both her and the horse isnt that true tory blushing scarlet tory mumbled that jake was probably uptight about the final and she better see whered he got to and thanking malise for a lovely dinner she stumbled out of the restaurant knocking over a chair as she went tory the elephant packed her trunk and said goodbye to the circus said rupert fen didnt stop running until she got to the stables it was dark now a huge full moon with a smudged apricot pink face gazed down at her reproachfully how could she have let herself go like that she went straight to macaulays box he was enchanted to see her and nuzzled her pockets inquiringly as she sobbed into his solid black neck oh mac im sorry i shouldnt dump on you when youve got so many worries of your own but im in such a muddle i should never have said all those awful things malisell never pick me for the team now gradually her sobs subsided as macaulay stood in silent titanic sympathy youre such a duck she said in a choked voice please buck that pig off the day after tomorrow she heard a step outside jake malise rupert she couldnt talk to anyone she melted into the dark of the box behind macaulay the top halfdoor was stealthily opened behind macaulays stalwart frame she couldnt see who it was then she heard the sound of something hitting the water bucket then the door was shut and bolted hell she was locked in for the night next minute the evergreedy macaulay had shot towards the door and she heard the sound of munching desperately she snatched the bucket from him no darling you mustnt eat it we dont know what it is snorting with exasperation macaulay pursued her around the box suddenly the top half of the door was opened again who is it she said in terror what the hell are you doing here said jake talking to mac disturbing his beauty sleep more likely you okay he added more gently yes but look what someones put in his box she held up the bucket jake lit a match and then whistled jesus christ what is it beet unsoaked he said grimly someones trying to nobble him rupert said fen jake shook his head hes still in the restaurant might be one of his supporters but i dont think its ruperts form too easily traced and hes just longing for a chance to make me look silly in the final more likely some kraut fanatic or one of the yanks brits dont knobble brits all the same well have to take turns to sleep outside the box ill stay here tonight you go back and share our double bed with tory you ought to get a decent nights sleep im so bloody tired id sleep on a bed of nails back in their hotel still wearing a pale gray silk petticoat helen campbellblack removed her makeup with a shaking hand turning her head to catch different reflections in the threesided mirror rupert was already in bed watching a tape of clara jumping on the hired video machine every so often he froze the film so he could study the angle of ludwigs body or the position of his hands each fence was played over and over again then he got up and strolled naked across the room changing the tape to one of dino jumping presidents man in florida the horse was young and inexperienced giving each fence at least a foot because he hadnt yet learnt to tuck his legs under him manny as dino called him would need much more riding in the final rupert could see dino carefully positioning him at each fence pity there wasnt any film of hopalong jumping macaulay as helen picked up a different jar to remove the makeup round her eyes she caught a glimpse of rupert in the mirror with his back to her he must have lost ten pounds hed always had a marvelous physique but now he was fined down to a leaner even more muscular hardness he seemed to burn with excess energy and restlessness i must be married to the most desirable man in the world she thought despairingly so why do i feel so undesiring since the affair with podge shed tried so hard to make advances to be more imaginative but it was as though he pressed the freeze button on her each time turning her to stone robbing her of any spontaneity was he attracted to fen she wondered or had he just been baiting jake she knew jake pulling a knife wouldnt put him off in the least malise had dismissed the incident as a drunken brawl but she was frightened by the obsessive black hatred in jakes eyes she delayed getting into bed as long as possible praying that rupert might fall asleep but when she finally came out of the bathroom he had turned off the television and was lying on the bed looking at the latest photographs of the children shed brought from england he flipped past the ones of marcus with hardly a glance but examined every angle of tabs sweet pink face perhaps tab would be the one female in his life he could love unstintingly without despising her or himself take your nightdress off he said without even looking up helen sighed and complied rupert pulled her towards him not even bothering to kiss her ill be so dry inside she thought in panic and hes so huge its going to hurt instinctively her mind and her body went rigid his cock reminded her suddenly of the gray stone gargoyles jutting hard and ugly out of the walls of the cathedral whats the matter rupert prised her legs open with his hand jake pulling that knife i cant get it out of my mind what aspect of it he said mockingly were you turned on by such a macho display on jakes part or the thought of being a rich widow oh stop it sobbed helen or were you jealous of fen shes only a child gasped helen as his fingers moved up inside her its not fair to her or you said rupert look do you honestly think im going to chat up a fat pustular schoolgirl for any other reason than to rile hopalong chastity and i certainly succeeded none of the lovell contingentll get any sleep tonight and what about macaulay you never bothered about him when i had him any solicitude after hes sold on seems a bit out of place he took her then helen lay back quite unable to participate it was over in a couple of minutes and she was certain hed been thinking about fen tense and miserable she knew she should drop the subject but she couldnt help warning rupert to stay away from fen jake was obviously unbalanced about her when he didnt answer she thought he was really taking in what she said it was five minutes before she realized he was fast asleep rupert was right none of the lovell contingent slept fen lying on one edge of the bed couldnt stop thinking about rupert my only love sprang from my only hate she whispered to herself as helen had five years earlier tory lay on the edge of the other side she was worried about jake a row like that was the last thing he needed before the final she felt even more guilty that she was suddenly racked with jealousy of fen her baby sister who was growing more beautiful every day rupert who had never treated tory with anything but contempt had really taken the trouble to chat up fen and she too had seen the black hatred in jakes face when he held that knife to ruperts throat she tried to tell herself that jake was fiercely protective of anything he owned particularly his family she tried to suppress the thought that jake was falling in love with fen jake after an hours deep sleep was woken by the barking of the rotweiller guarding ludwigs horses hatred of rupert churning around and around in his head prevented him dropping off again next morning despite all malises stipulations the story of the knife was all around the showground grooming the horses next day fen found she had never been the recipient of so much chatting up the public flowed by to get a glimpse of a possible future champion suddenly every german american and english groom or rider seemed to have time to stop and gossip and ask her how she and macaulay were getting on what he was like to ride what sort of temperament he had watching the lovell children swarming all over him they could be excused for thinking he was as mild as an old sheep dino ferranti rolled up about midday hi he said buzz off said fen applying the body brush with more vigor that is a cute horse and you sure have a cute ass when youre grooming him hows he feeling today just fine snapped fen i really like him jakes smart doesnt jump him that often does he pulls him out for the big event i never heard of him before this week fen turned pink from exertions and anger dont smarm over me just because you want information about mac im not telling you anything about him honey youre overreacting i admire your boss howd you like to have dinner with me tonight no thanks we wont mention macaulay once right i just need an attractive girl to help me relax why should i help you relax youre the opposition he really is attractive she thought reluctantly lounging against the door with that wide untroubled smile and the marvelously relaxed elongated body he shook his head you ought to get out theres more to show jumping than the inside of a tackcleaning bucket you ought to have some fun anyway he added slyly i am just dying to hear what happened last night did jake really pull a bread knife on rupert you must be the most foughtover girl in france shut up said fen blushing to the roots of her sweating hair i dont want to discuss it now please go away later in the day all the finalists tried to relax leaving helen to visit the house in which proust spent his childhood rupert went racing with count guy and lavinia and had three winners which seemed a good omen the copy of the evening standard specially flown in for patric walkers horoscope also predicted scorpios would have an exciting and successful weekend so he felt he could legitimately relax the german team swam and sunbathed together the americans took a plane to paris and went sightseeing jake took tory fen tanya and the children for a picnic in the brittany countryside finding a perfect place shaded by a glimmering silver poplar copse by the side of a meandering river tory and tanya slept the children swam and made daisy chains with fen jake wandered off with binoculars reveling in the wildflowers and butterflies he found a very rare orchid stocked up on the medicine cupboard and also to his joy discovered a clump of tansy so he had a fresh lucky sprig to put in his left boot for tomorrow night fell jake and tory were safely tucked up at the hotel in a sleeping bag outside macaulays box fen took up her position with lester the teddy bear it was quiet and very hot all she could hear was the occasional stamp of a horse and the sound of ruperts bodyguard pacing up and down outside snakepits box the indigo sky was overcrowded with stars too many like my spots thought fen they suddenly seemed to have doubled it must be the curse coming perhaps that was why she was so jumpy now she was alone she could think about rupert and dino she was in such a muddle jake had kept her so busy over the past three years that truthfully there had been no time for men in her life except for her longdistance crush on billy lloydfoxe now she was assailed by all kinds of longings and despairs if only she were helen able to roll up at the championship with gleaming hair bathed in a beautiful uncreased dress after eight hours of sleep she hated rupert and dino who had asked her out only because he wanted to pump her but it made her realize how much she was missing by devoting herself so exclusively to horses if only she felt tired she stiffened as a step approached then she caught a waft of scent it was dino couldnt sleep no point in jumping rounds in my head so i just came by to check no ones been after manny they havent said fen dyou want a drink he produced a flask from his pocket its only bourbon ive only had two drinks all evening christ id like to get looped may i talk with you for a few minutes he slid down the stable wall beside her sitting with his long legs bent at an acute angle in the faint light she could see the perfect profile are you nervous he nodded sounds kinda girl scout but i dont want to let the team down theyve been so great or the horse or my daddy or mumma they were great too to back me i guess none of us needs the money like jake how come he hates rupert so much fen explained about the bullying at school and the barrage of insults and the annexing of revenge and the cruelty to macaulay guess thats enough to be going on with said dino handing her his bourbon flask he noticed with a flicker of encouragement that she didnt bother to wipe the neck before she drank jakes terribly torn explained fen he wants to beat rupert so badly but hes crucified at the thought of what it might do to macaulays confidence having rupert on his back again it must be hell like going to a wifeswapping party on ones honeymoon bad enough the thought of ones darling wife sleeping with three other men but even worse if she enjoyed it more than she did with you dino laughed yeah that just about sums it up im kind of ambivalent about rupert too i really like the guy he makes me laugh but that was before i met his wife what about her fen tried to sound casual well shes so beautiful i mean seriously beautiful the way he carries on with girls they were coming out of his ears on the florida circuit and boy they threw themselves at him i figured hed made some kind of marriage of convenience to some dog then i had dinner with them this evening i mean how could you cheat on that christ id never let her out of my sight and he treats her like shit putting her down all the time i was appalled doesnt she have anyone on the side she could get anyone fen suddenly felt horribly depressed because rupert was so unfaithful to helen one tended to write her off as a sexual threat ive never heard anything about other men i think shes too frightened of rupert and so are the men one of the italian team kept her too long on the dance floor once and his hands started to travel and rupert hit him across the room that figures like hamadryas baboons like what huge baboons that live in the desert in abyssinia theyre more interested in fighting off other male baboons than in screwing their wives in fact they neglect their wives when theres no one to fight off im telling you im going to be in britain for crittleden and i am going to make one helluva pitch she doesnt deserve that kind of treatment i wonder if jakes getting any sleep said fen shouldnt guess so its like henry the fifth on the eve of agincourt id better go and get some insomnia night honey this time tomorrow well be bombed on euphoria or despair lying awake at the hotel jake looked at his watch three oclock within fourteen hours hed know if hed pulled the mightiest from their seats his good leg ached because it hadnt been relaxed with sleep he kept breaking out in a cold sweat at the thought of riding snakepit he knew he wasnt strong enough to hold him if he fell off and wrecked himself there wasnt anyone to ride the horses he also knew tory had been awake all night beside him thank god she knew when to keep her trap shut tory he said reaching out for her yes she put her arms round him do you want to talk or turn on the light and read she could feel him shaking his head in the darkness its going to be all right horses always go well with you youre going to win i wish i was riding sailor hed have looked after you but he might have looked after the others a bit too well macaulay hasnt got such a conscience she slid her hand down the empty hollow of his belly and touched his cock would that help it might but i wont be much use to you i dont need it the bedsprings creaked as she clambered down the bed then he felt the warm soft caress of her lips and the infinite tenderness of her tongue because he knew she liked doing it there was no hurry no tension i was so right to marry you he mumbled tory was filled with an overwhelming happiness in the eight years of their marriage hed probably paid her as many compliments but when they came they were worth everything she felt bitterly ashamed that she had wasted so much emotion being jealous of fen rupert got up and dressed where are you going said helen for a walk its hot i cant sleep oh darling you must rest shall i come with you no go back to sleep a quarter of an hour later he paused beside fen her long hair fanning out already slightly damp from the dew teddy bear clutched in her arms he toyed with the idea of waking her but she needed sleep hed put her on ice for a later date as he pulled the sleeping bag round her she clutched the teddy bear tighter muttering dont forget to screw in the studs when he let himself into the lorry dizzy hardly stirred in her sleep smiled and opened her arms rupert slid into them ludwig von schellenberg had such selfcontrol that he willed himself into eight hours dreamless sleep world championship day dawned there were a couple of small classes in the morning to keep the rest of the riders happy but all interest was centered on the four finalists each box was a hive of activity of plaiting and polishing and everyone giving everyone else advice it was hotter than ever in the lorry jake watched an algerian schools program on television trying to steady his nerves and wondered if there was any hope of his keeping down the cup of tea and dry toast hed had for breakfast tory was frying eggs bacon and sausages for the children it didnt look as though anyone would have time to cook them a decent meal before the evening and at the same time ironing the lucky socks breeches shirt tie and red coat that jake had worn in each leg of the competition the new tansy lay in the heel of the highly polished left boot jake had seen one magpie that morning but had been cheered up by the sight of a black cat until driffield informed him that black cats were considered unlucky in france milk bottles tins eggshells in the muck bucket were beginning to smell fen was studying a german dictionary it doesnt give the german for whoa youll have to fall back on dummkopf lieberlein and achtung or auf wiedersehen said jake as clara bucks me off and gallops off into the sunset the american for whoa must be starp starp she went on you remember that red tshirt you wore when revenge won at olympia said jake ive got it here said fen dyou mind wearing it this afternoon fen did mind very much it was impossibly hot and shed got very burnt yesterday and the red tshirt would clash with her face but it was jakes day she mustnt be selfish of course not she said jake was encouraged by the number of telegrams british hopes rested with rupert but jake had generated an enormous amount of goodwill people were obviously delighted to see him back at the top again there were telegrams from the princess and one from the colonel of the regiment at knightsbridge barracks whod somehow discovered that their old horse macaulay had ended up with jake the one that pleased him most was from miss blenkinsop in the middle east he knew that she as much as he enjoyed the sheer pleasure of showing the world that he could succeed with a horse rupert had thrown out every time macaulay won anything hed religiously taken percent of the winnings and posted them to miss blenkinsop for her horse rescue hospital if he won today she would get if he won oh my god he said and bolted out of the caravan through a crowd of reporters and into the lavatory where he brought up his breakfast why dont you bloody well go away shouted fen to the reporters you know you wont get any sense out of him before a big class in the end they had to be content with interviewing darklis who sat on a hay bale smiling up at them with huge black eyes my daddys been thick four times this morning he doesnt theem to like french food i love it weve had steak and chips every single night at last there was the course to walk which made jake feel even worse it was far bigger than hed imagined the water jump seemed wider than the channel the heavy thundery blue sky seemed to rest on the huge soaring oxblood red wall and jake could actually stand underneath the poles of the parallel malise walking beside him winced at the french marigolds clashing with purple petunias and scarlet geraniums in the pots on either side of each jump how could the french have such exquisite color sense in their clothes and not in their gardening a couple of english reporters sidled up to them did you really pull a knife on rupert gyppo bugger off said malise hes got to memorize the course do you want a british victory or not thats tricky he added to jake looking at the distance between the parallels and the combination its on a halfstride the waters a brute youll get hardly any run in there youll need the stick macaulay never needs a stick said jake through frantically chattering teeth the sheer impossibility of getting snakepit let alone presidents man over any of the fences paralyzed him with terror rupert walked with colonel roxborough wearing dark glasses but no hat against the punishing brittany sun he seemed totally oblivious of the effect he was having on the french girls in the crowd the german team walked together so did the americans count guy in a white suit made by yves st laurent was the object of commiseration over his great disappointment now he shrugged his shoulders philosophically at least he didnt have to jump five rounds in this heat and his horses would be fresh for crittleden the following week in the collecting ring ivor braine had been cornered by the press and was telling them in his broad yorkshire accent that he was convinced jake had been brandishing a knife because the steaks were so tough i wish saddleback sam had made it said humpty for the thousandth time driffield was busy selling a horse at a vastly inflated price to one of the mexican riders wish it was a wiferiding contest said rupert i wouldnt mind having a crack at mrs ludwig although i would draw the line at mrs lovell once again he wished billy were there hed never needed his advice more or his silly jokes to lower the tension obviously drunk at ten oclock in the morning billy had already rung him to wish him luck rupert had asked after janey billy had laughed bitterly shes like a wet log fire if you dont watch her all the time she goes out next week reflected rupert grimly he was going to have to take janey out to lunch and tell her to get her act together despite the lack of a french rider in the final all the publicity had attracted a huge crowd there wasnt an empty seat or an inch of rope unleaned over anywhere malise sighed if there was a british victory all the glare of bad publicity of the feuds between riders might be forgotten he watched rupert cool as an icicle putting snakepit over huge jumps in the collecting ring jake was nowhere to be seen he was probably being sick again at two oclock each of the four finalists came on led by their own band ludwig came first to defend his title on the mighty clara yellow browband matching the yellow knots in her plaits her coat was the color of oak leaves in autumn her huge chest like a steamer funnel unruffled by the crowd her eyes shone with wisdom and kindness then came dino on the slender presidents man who looked almost foallike in his legginess the same liver chestnut as clara he seemed half her size dino lounged totally relaxed in the saddle like a young princeling his olive skin only slightly paler than usual hat tipped over his nose as though he was taking the piss out of the whole proceedings then rupert eyes narrowed against the sun the object of whirring cameras and cheers from the huge british contingent motionless in the saddle as the plunging eyerolling snakepit shied at everything and fought for his head and finally jake his set face as white as macaulays who strutted along pointing his big feet enjoying the cheers like a council of war the four riders lined up in front of the presidents box the bands forming a brilliant scarlet and gold square behind them les rivaux can seldom have produced a more breathtaking spectacle with the flags limp in the heat the scarlet coats the plumes of the soldiers the gleaming brass instruments the grass emerald green from incessant sprinkling the forest which seemed to smoulder in its dark green midgy stillness and in the distance the speedwell blue gleam of the sea the bands launched into the national anthem each crash of cymbal and drum sending snakepit and presidents man cavorting around in terror macaulay and clara stood like statues at either end of the row fen body aching from grooming fingers sore from plaiting her red tshirt drenched with sweat waited for macaulay to return to the collecting ring she was far more nervous than usual she had a far bigger part to play with the three other grooms she would spend the competition in the cordonedoff part of the arena and change jakes saddle onto each new horse nearby was dizzy braless and ravishing in a pink tshirt her newly washed blond hair trailing pink ribbons one day im going to look as good as her vowed fen then she squashed the thought of her own presumption and had another look at the vast fences how absolutely terrifying for jake the field emptied large ladies bustled round with tape measures checking poles for the last time ive bet a hundred on campbellblack said the colonel in an undertone to malise i reckon itll be a jumpoff between him and ludwig with the american third and lovell nowhere he simply hasnt got the nerve helen seeing the riders in their red coats was reminded of the first day shed met rupert out hunting dear god she prayed please restore my marriage and make him win but only if you think thats right god tory in the riders stand with darklis and isa prayed the same for jake but without any qualification i wonder when daddys going to be thick again said darklis then a hush fell as in came ludwig as he rode past the presidents box and took off his hat the rest of the german team whod all been at the champagne rose to their feet shooting up their hands in a heil hitler salute to the apoplexy of colonel roxborough who went as scarlet as his carnation the only sound was the snort of the horse the thunder of hoofs and the relentless ticking of the clock girding her great chestnut loins a symbol of reliability clara jumped clear malise lit a cigar at least we know its jumpable he said dino came in talking quietly to the young horse thats a pretty horse said malise and a pretty rider thought helen who was sitting near him being so much slighter presidents man seemed to go twice as fast dinos thrusting acrobatic style and almost french elegance and good looks soon had the crowd cheering he also went clear then came rupert hauling on the plunging snakepits mouth hotting him up so he fought for his head all the way around by some miracle of timing and balance he too went clear and snakepit galloped out of the ring giving two colossal bucks and nearly trampling a crowd of photographers under foot god help those who come after sighed malise im not taking a penny less than said driffield fen gave macaulay a lastminute pat and a kiss good luck remember youre the greatest and remember what youve got to avenge jake looked suddenly gray i cant go in yes you can youre doing it for macaulay and miss blenkinsop im going to throw up no you are not keep your mouth shut and off you go numero quatre called the collecting ring steward irritably jake rode into the ring obviously quite untogether he might never have been on a horse in his life he had the first fence down and the second he took completely wrong macaulay stumbled and nearly came down on the hard ground then he hit the third twelve faults hes been nobbled thought tory in despair hes blown it drawled dino oh my god said fen in anguish she watched the tenths of seconds pirouetting on the clock as jake pulled macaulay up to a standstill stroked his neck spoke to him and started again cant even ride his own horse said rupert scathingly it was a freak he got to the final anyway hes bound to get time faults said colonel roxborough jake set off again in a somewhat haphazard fashion and cleared the rest of the ten fences but never really connected all the way round notching up three and a half time faults he shook his head as he rode up to fen a great start huh competitions young you wait she said giving macaulay a lemon sherbet then when jake had dismounted she removed the saddle which had to be put on snakepit the horse jake was riding next youve got three minutes to warm him up she said looking at her watch needs cooling down if you ask me ludwigs groom came over to collect macaulay who went off looking very put out turning his head continually to gaze back reproachfully at jake jake went up to snakepit who flattened his ears and rolled his eyes now youll get your comeuppance dizzy hissed at him in the ropedoff arena macaulay did several wild jumps nearly unseating ludwig he didnt like the discipline of the german rider he went into the ring a mulish martyred expression on his white face look at the old moke giggled fen isnt he lovely despite his disapproval however macaulay gave ludwig a good ride and went clear interesting what that horse can do when it gets a proper rider on its back said rupert dino went in on clara he was very nervous and gave clara very little help but each time he put her wrong she was so well trained she got him out of trouble rising like a helicopter off her mighty hocks jake didnt want to watch rupert on presidents man he was getting acquainted with snakepit he spent several minutes rubbing his ears smoothing his sweating lathered neck talking to him softly and giving him pieces of sugar faced with the challenge of a new horse he was too interested to be nervous next minute he was up determined not to hang on the horses mouth he went on talking to him snakepit was so short in front it was like sitting on the edge of a cliff a cliff that might crumble any minute and turn into an earthquake he rode quietly round for one of the two minutes left stroking and still talking then put him over a jump letting him have his head suddenly snakepit seemed to sweeten up what dyou reckon very good said fen must be a nice change for him like a weekend on the riviera after working in a factory cheers from the ring indicated rupert had gone clear on presidents man urging him on by sheer brute force and driving power the horse however was upset jake rode snakepit into the ring snakepit tugged at the bridle and found no one hauling him back so he stopped pulling and gave jake one of the easiest rides of his life as they came to the upright jake out of sheer nervousness hooked him up a stride too short but snakepit reveling in his newfound freedom made a mighty effort and cleared the fence easily bloody hell said rupert hed have stopped if id done that to him looks a different horse said malise in a pleased voice having insisted that jake was selected he was desperate for him to ride well the colonel grunted still going to win my bet at the end of the second round everyone was clear except jake who was on fifteen and a half faults the crowd was beginning to get bored they wanted trouble crashes upsets and falls it was ludwigs turn to ride snakepit i vas in two brains vether to ride heem ive got a vife and children said ludwig to jake but after your round i doubt if ill have any trouble wiz him snakepit however thought otherwise he didnt like the harsher more rigid style of the german who like rupert wouldnt give him his head he deliberately knocked down the upright and kicked out the second part of the combination rupert had no trouble going clear on clara jake who was warming up presidents man couldnt resist having a look at dino on macaulay the american chef dequipe told him to give mac a good whack at the water said fen gleefully and dinos neglected to take off his spurs too jesus its like riding a charging elephant muttered dino to himself hasnt he got any brakes macaulay lolloped crossly into the ring with a mulish expression on his face im not a seaside donkey giving rides he seemed to say as he ran out at the upright then having been given a clout with the bat he jumped it then proceeded to bring the wall tumbling down joshua at the battle of jericho said fen oh goodie dinos whacked him again coming down to the water macaulay ground to a halt them jumped the small brush fence with no effort at all landing with a huge splash in the middle of the water absolutely soaking dino then he put his head down and started to drink the crowd particularly the lovell children screamed with laughter dino finished the course and rode out grinning i didnt expect an impromptu shower he said to his teammates that rounds probably lost him the championship muttered fen hes a good loser presidents man was frightened puzzled and muddled having been broken and trained by dino hed seldom carried other riders but now he liked the gentle hands and the caressing singsong voice of the man on his back trying to imitate dinos acrobatic style jake managed to coax a beautiful clear out of him bloody hell said dino shaking his head youd figure mannyd want to avenge me after what macaulay did to me it was the start of the last round the excitement was beginning to bite the crowd had woken up this is a gymkhana event grumbled colonel roxborough id never have let my baskerville boy go in for this ruperts on zero ludwigs got eight faults dino eleven jake fifteen and a half but hes got the easiest round to come said malise who was busy with his calculator ludwig rode in first on presidents man the young horse was really tired and confused now he had jumped his heart out for three clears and hed had enough like snakepit he preferred the gentleness of his last rider despite brilliant tactics from ludwig he knocked up eight faults glory alleluia said fen rushing up to jake as he mounted clara ludwigs got half a fault more than you now riding clara was like driving a lamborghini with the slightest touch of the leg she seemed to surge forward jake had never known such acceleration he felt humble to be riding such a horse the crowd were growing restless again with three clears under his belt rupert was obviously going to walk it oh dear oh dear said fen with a total lack of sympathy snakepits carting dino snakepit thoroughly over the top galloped around the ring taking practically every fence with him notching up twentyfour faults actually he did bloody well to stay on fen conceded as snakepit carried him unceremoniously out of the ring i think ive won my bet said colonel roxborough looks like a british victory said malise wishing he felt more elated rupert used to own that horse said the colonel smugly hell find him a piece of cake macaulay thought differently rupert had decided not to warm macaulay up the horse had already jumped three rounds and anyway when rupert had gone up to him macaulay had promptly flattened his ears given a furious squeal of rage and recognition and struck at him like a cobra rupert only just jumped out of the way in time dont look said fen to jake itll only upset you concentrate on clara i think rupert needs our help said colonel roxborough humpty malise driffield colonel roxborough dizzy and tracey all stood round macaulays head holding on to his bridle for grim death as he stood at the entrance to the arena they blocked macaulays view as rupert got onto his back but he knew instantly he seemed to tremble in terror his ears glued to his head his eyes seemed all whites in a white face but with six of them hanging on he could do nothing in you go said colonel roxborough good luck they all jumped away as macaulay shot forward the moment he got into the ring he went up on his hind legs huge feet shadowboxing his white face suddenly a mask of malevolence then he came down oh look said fen in ecstasy hes not going to fail us taking no notice of ruperts brutally sawing hands macaulay went into a rodeo act bucking and bucking and catjumping and circling in the air frantic to get rupert off he ought to join the royal ballet said fen ivors mouth was open so long a fly flew in even driffield stopped selling his horse do something said helen frantically to malise hes going to kill him with any luck muttered fen dear god said jake in misery i should never have subjected macaulay to this it was amazing that rupert stayed in the saddle so long macaulays mouth was bleeding badly now bits of red foam flying everywhere it was quite obvious to the crowd that the great black horse like a maddened bull had only one aim in life to get the rider off his back rupert plunged his spurs in and brought his whip with an almighty thwack down on macaulays quarters you cant shift me you black bugger he said through gritted teeth ohlala quelle domage said fen happily oh bien fait macaulay dino shot her a sidelong glance youre being kind of unsporting he drawled as a final maddened buck sent rupert flying through the air it was lucky he let go of the reins a second later macaulay had jammed on his brakes and swung round in pursuit rupert had never run so fast in his life as he dodged behind the wall macaulay followed him squealing with rage teeth bared the crowd were in an uproar stop him screamed helen someone do something rupert had shot into the oxer now hiding behind the brush part peering out from a lot of sky blue cinerarias like ferdinand the bull macaulay was too fly to be thwarted he cantered round to the other side where rupert was protected only by a large pole and went for him darting his head under the pole missing him only by inches rupert ran out of the oxer belting towards the combination taking refuge in the third element which was a triple only two hundred and fifty yards from the collecting ring i dont know why he doesnt take up athletics said fen hed certainly qualify for the olympics malise strode up to the french chief steward you must send in the arena party to head him off he said and get them keeled said the steward he is still within the time limit the squeak of the elimination hooter went off at that moment making everyone jump out of their skin macaulay was prowling around and around the triple darting his head at rupert tail swishing furiously quivering with rage that horse doesnt seem very keen on rupert said ivor braine hardly surprising said humpty it used to belong to him four gendarmes entered the ring gingerly fingering their pistols macaulay turned revving up for another charge rupert snatched up one of the poles it was extremely heavy like a caber as macaulay advanced rupert brandished it at him the collecting ring steward rushed up to jake i theenk meester lovell you better go and collect your horse at that moment macaulay reared up striking at rupert missing him only by inches knocking the pole from his hands rupert backed away he had no protection now jake walked into the ring a small figure totally insignificant without a horse watch this said fen to dino as macaulay turned to go in for the kill jake put his fingers to his mouth and whistled macaulay stopped in his tracks looking wistfully at rupert for a second then turning trotted back across the arena whickering with pleasure nudging jake in the stomach licking his face the crowd having been frozen with terror suddenly burst into a huge collective roar of laughter well done said jake softly and not even bothering to take hold of macaulays bridle he walked out of the ring macaulay trotted after him giving him great sly digs in the ribs as if to say didnt i do well malise turned to colonel roxborough even the ranks of tuscany could scarce forbear to cheer ive just lost a hundred and weve lost the championship i dont know why youre looking so bloody cheerful tarry a little said malise rupert came out of the ring his face like marble helen rushed forward darling are you all right no i am bloody not spat rupert pushing her out of the way im going to object that was deliberate sabotage on jakes part the reporters surged forward clamoring for a quote what are you going to do rupe lodge an objection that horse should be put down instantly its a total delinquent jake put it in deliberately to fuck me up he was so angry he could hardly get the words out the collecting ring was in an uproar malise elbowed his way to his side im going to object said rupert malise shook his head cant make it stand up macaulays no more difficult a horse than snakepit he was all right with all the other riders hes like a lamb with the lovell children well jake trained him to do it then you saw how he called the bugger off when he wanted he tried to kill me the other night and he tried to kill me now the reporters were avidly writing down every word the competition isnt over rupert said malise lowering his voice jakes got to ride clara to hell with him snarled rupert if the jury wont accept an objection ill have the law on him for attempted murder and he stalked off in the direction of his lorry jake rode clara into the ring holding his hands up high sitting very straight in the saddle trying to copy ludwigs style of riding it seems a shame to ask you to beat your master he said oh clara please do a cleara said fen the crowd had witnessed near tragedy and then high comedy the commentator had to put everyone back on course ludwig had sixteen faults after four rounds dino had thirtyfive rupert campbellblack had been eliminated jake after three rounds was half a fault lower than ludwig he could not afford a single fence down if he was to win he kicked clara into a canter over the first fence she sailed over the second over the third she gave the parallel a clout but the bar didnt budge ludwig smoking frantically stood with his back to the arena the rest of the german team giving him a running commentary fen eyes tight shut was slightly moving her lips what are you doing asked dino asking god to help jake said fen not opening her eyes rather unfair to jake said dino i guess he can do it by himself malise suddenly turned to driffield for christs sake stop selling that horse and come and watch this alone in the ring it was as though jake was in another world he was conscious only of the joy of riding this beautiful beautiful horse thinking he could clear the stands even the eiffel tower on her he turned for the water come on lieberlen or dummkopf i forget which it is clara took a great leap happy to have an expert on her back jake was aware of the blue water going on forever and the anxious upturned faces of the photographers but he found the perfect stride and was safely over the crowd couldnt forbear a cheer then shushed themselves the three elements of the combination then the huge triple and he was home overcome with nerves he made clara take off too early at the first element she only just cleared it so he turned her to the left at the next element giving her room for an extra stride and placing her perfectly at the last element he was over magic riding raved malise oh come on jake unable to restrain itself the crowd broke into a huge roar the triple seemed to rush towards him he lifted the mare up and up the poles flew beneath him thatll do he thought in ecstasy im world champion all around the thunderously cheering arena union jacks were waving as he rode out of the ring patting the gallant mare over and over again he won screamed fen hugging tory and then flinging her arms round dino and kissing him dino taking advantage kissed her back thats almost worth only coming third he said all the british team except rupert were going mad with excitement malise and colonel roxborough were throwing their hats in the air jake came out of the ring and slid off clara into torys arms for a second they clung to each other not speaking he could feel her hot tears on his cheek and the thunder of congratulatory hands raining down on his back a magnum of champagne was thrust into his hands he opened it and soaked everyone around then they all had a swig there was no sign of malise or rupert they were closeted with a member of the international jury rupert shouting in only too fluent french and malise trying to pacify him but there was no case said the frenchman there was nothing in the rules about not putting in a difficult horse macaulay plainly hadnt liked rupert but hed behaved with all the other riders and snakepit certainly hadnt been an easy ride for anyone except jake jake was undeniably the winner and theyd better get on with the presentation muttering that he was going to report jake to the bsja rupert stormed out of the tent where are you going said malise not back into the ring to get the booby prize snarled rupert my dear boy said malise gently drawing him aside im sorry it was bad luck youve had a great disappointment and probably a very frightening experience balls said rupert ive been robbed you must have beaten macaulay severely for him to go for you like that he was my horse what fucking business is that of anyones the rspca for a start and the fei not to mention the bsja it wont do your image any good nor will a lot of emotive stuff about selling macaulay to the middle east and him starving and ending up in the stone quarries if you believe that story i do said malise and it could ruin you the press are longing to get you and you know what the english are like about cruelty to animals itll take a lot of guts but go back into the ring and keep your trap shut bet youll get a lot of marks back came the bands but this time the four horses were too tired to be disturbed by the drums and the cymbals ludwig shook jake by the hand well done my friend well done clara was the besttrained horse you should have won it said jake you fought back from a terrible start zat is more important dudley diplock ran up to jake seuper absolutely seuper he cried giving macaulay a wide berth can i interview you immediately after the presentation rupert rode in last the crowd gave him almost the biggest cheer in sympathy he was handsomer than robert redford he had jumped three spectacular clears and certainly most of the women in the audience had wanted him to win jake rode forward leaving the other riders lined up behind him and removed his hat as the band played the national anthem his hair was drenched with sweat and there was a red ring on his forehead left by his hat in a daze he was given an assortment of rosettes so you could hardly see macaulays white face for ribbons there was also a purple sash which clashed with jakes scarlet coat and a huge laurel wreath for macaulays neck which he tried to eat then to jakes intense embarrassment one beautiful girl in matching green suits after another came up and presented him with prize after prize a gold medal a sèvres vase a limoges tea set a silver tray a magnum of champagne an enormous silver cup and finally a check for there was nothing except one rosette and much smaller checks for the others cant we each have one of those girls as consolation prizes said dino even when prince philip came up and shook him by the hand jake was too euphoric even to be shy and managed to stumble a few sentences out aware that the place was swarming with photographers and television cameras macaulay resolutely stuck his cock out and refused to put it in again just like rupert said fen as jake came out of the ring he was cornered by dudley diplock may i personally shake macaulay by the hoof how the hell did you get him to do it he added lowering his voice ive been waiting ten years for someone to give that shit campbellblack his comeuppance the whole showjumping world will club together and give you a medal gradually it was dawning on jake that most people seemed more delighted rupert had lost than that he had won after the television interview with dudley which was not very articulate but so full of euphoria and gratitude to macaulay and tory and all the family and malise that it charmed everyone malise joined them neither he nor jake were demonstrative men but for a second they hugged each other you were brilliant said malise in a strangely gruff voice sorry i didnt get to you earlier but ive been with rupert he wanted to object nothing to object about said dudley quite said malise but thats never deterred him in the past fortunately they werent having any of it but he has been badly humiliated so i think the less crowing about that side of it the better come on he added to jake everyones waiting to talk to you who the worlds press for a start i want to ride mac back to the stable ive got nothing to say to them i won isnt that enough malise looked at him was there a flicker of pity in his eyes it wont have had time to sink in he said but things are never going to be the same again youre a superstar now a world beater youve got to behave like one on the way they passed helen campbellblack she was crying both malise and jake hoped that rupert wasnt going to take it out on her as they fought their way into the crowded press tent euphoric english supporters stripped to the waist including humpty ivor braine and driffield were already getting plastered fucking marvelous you beat the bugger said driffield thrusting a glass into jakes hand while ivor overfilled it with champagne three cheers for the champion said humpty hiphiphooray everyone joined in the noise nearly lifted the roof off lovell for prime minister yelled an ecstatic british supporter opening another magnum he sprayed the entire press conference with champagne jake was carried shoulderhigh to the table with the microphones he collapsed into a chair and was bombarded with questions he answered the foreign ones through an interpreter he was extremely happy he said but very very tired one didnt sleep much before a championship hed won because he was very lucky macaulay was a great horse perhaps not in the class of any of the other horses but he had been rested all year clara was the besttrained horse she didnt knock down a single fence she ought to get a special prize everyone was still clamoring for information about macaulay jake said carefully that hed always liked the horse and when rupert sold the horse on hed tracked him down and bought him did you deliberately put him in to sabotage rupert asked paris match jake caught malises eye of course not id no idea how hed feel about rupert did you know rupert had sold the horse because he was vicious asked joanna jake looked up the somber black eyes suddenly amused whos vicious he said rupert or the horse everyone laughed later a celebratory party went on until four oclock in the morning but rupert and helen gave it a miss and flew home soon all that was left of the world championship was a few wheel tracks and a bare patch at the corner of the collecting ring where all week ecstatic grooms had snatched up handfuls of grass to reward their successful charges as they came out of the ring aweek after the riders came back from the world championship billy went up to london to speak at the sportswriters association lunch if theyd known i was going to be dropped they probably wouldnt have asked me he thought wryly janey needed the car to go shopping only food from the market its so much cheaper she added quickly so she dropped billy off at the station he couldnt face horse and hound itd be too full of the world championship so he bought private eye which always cheered him up except when they were foul about rupert as he sat on the station platform he turned to grovel he read a marvelous story about a member of the spanish royal familys sexual perversions and another even more scurrilous about a trade union leader and a pit pony then his heart stopped beating the next story began exslagaboutfleet street janey henderson sacked for the size of her expenses is now trying to write a book about men despite encyclopedic knowledge of the subject janey felt the need for further research and recently returned from four days in marbella with loathsome catfood tycoon kevin coley meanwhile her amiable husband billy lloydfoxed as hes known on the circuit is forced to turn a blind drunk eye coley is his backer to the tune of a year billy started to shake it couldnt be true it couldnt not janey shed always laughed at kev private eye got things wrong they were always being sued he read it again the words misted in front of his eyes he didnt even hear the train come in the ticket collector tapped him on the shoulder you want this one dont you billy yes no i dont know no i dont running pushing aside the people coming off the train he rushed out of the station flagging down the first taxi take me home all right mr lloydfoxe no one was there janey was still out shopping he pressed the lr button on her telephone to find out the last number shed rung it was kevin coleys at the head office hating himself he looked in her top drawer janey had started a letter which shed crumpled up darling kev i wont see you today so im writing god i miss you im just coming down to earth after marbella cant you think of somewhere nice and far to send billy he gave a moan of horror his legs were trembling so much he could hardly stand the bottle clattered against the glass and the whisky spilt all over the carpet he drained it neat in one gulp then he ran all the way to ruperts he found him in the yard selling a horse to an american one look at billys face and rupert said to the buyer sorry ive got to go if youre interested in the horse give me a ring later then putting a hand on billys shoulder he led him inside as soon as the drawing room door was shut behind them billy said did you know janey was being knocked off by kevin coley yes how the hell helen saw them lunching together in cheltenham and mrs bodkins been chuntering and mrs greenslade said in les rivaux that she saw them coming off a plane its all over private eye why the hell didnt you tell me i thought janeyd come to her senses said rupert pouring him a large drink christ if youd have told helen every time id had a bit on the side shed be back in america probably doesnt mean a thing to janey shes just a bit bored with one bounder she was free said billy miserably shes been so cheerful in the last three weeks she was so down before i thought it was because the book was going well it must have been kevin what the hell do i do punch him on the nose i cant at a year very expensive bloody nose find another sponsor not so easy im not the bankable property i was two years ago rubbish youre just as good a rider youve just lost your nerve rupert looked at his watch arent you supposed to be making a speech in london billy went white i cant you bloody well can dont want to go ratting on that theyll say youve really lost your nerve ill drive you up billy somehow survived the lunch and making his speech paranoid now he imagined all the audience there looking at him curiously wondering how he was coping with being cuckolded the journalist in the front row had a copy of private eye in his pocket even worse that evening he and janey had to go to some dreadful dance at kevs golf club in sunningdale billy didnt say anything to janey he had a faint hope as he had when he was a child that if he kept quiet and pulled the bedclothes over his head the nasty burglar might assume he was asleep and go away janey he noticed didnt grumble at all about going as she would have done once and looked absolutely ravishing in plunging white broderie anglaise she was easily the most beautiful woman in the room all the men were gazing at her and nudging kev for an introduction billy wondered how many of them had read private eye and proceeded to get drunk enid coley was made of sterner stuff having tried to fill up janeys cleavage with an orchid and maidenhair fern wrapped in silver paper which janey rudely refused to wear she waited for a lull in the dancing then she walked up to janey holding a glass of wine as though she was going to shampoo her hair and poured it all over janeys head what the hell dyou think youre doing demanded billy ask her what shes been doing hissed enid look in my husbands wallet and youll see a very nice picture of your wife since youve been away shes been seducing my husband shut up you foulmouthed bitch dont talk to me like that if you werent so drunk all the time you might have done something to stop it taking janey dripping and speechless by the hand billy walked straight out of the golf club it was not until they were ten miles out of sunningdale that she spoke im sorry billy when did you know i read private eye at the station oh my god must have been terrible wasnt much fun beastly piece too i wasnt sacked i resigned kev in fact was rather chuffed hes never been in private eye before billy stopped the car in the light from the streetlamp janey could see the great sadness in his eyes do you love him i dont know but hes so macho and im so weak i guess i need someone like him to keep me on the straight and narrow hes hardly been doing that recently said billy look i love you its my fault i shouldnt have left you so much or let us get into debt or been so wrapped up in the horses it must have been horrible for you with no babies and struggling to write a book on no money ill get some money from somewhere i promise you i just dont want you to be unhappy on monday kevin coley summoned billy ive had a terrible weekend i havent slept a wink for worrying were his opening words im so sorry what on earths the trouble asked billy i knew i had to break the news to you that i cant go on sponsoring you my only solution is to withdraw pity your father didnt do that forty years ago said billy kevin missed the joke he was too anxious to say his piece the contract runs out in october and im not going to renew it you havent won more than in the last six months im losing too much money and fucking my wife that has nothing to do with it then i tried to hit him billy told rupert afterwards but i was so pissed i missed hes talking of sponsoring driffield oh well said rupert i suppose one good turd deserves another winning the world championship had transformed jake lovell into a star overnight wildly exaggerated accounts of his gypsy origins appeared in the papers women raved about his dark mysterious looks young male riders imitated his deadpan manner wearing gold rings in their ears and trying to copy his short tousled hairstyle gradually he became less reticent about his background and admitted openly that his father had been a horsedealer and poacher and his mother the school cook sponsors pursued him owners begged him to ride their horses his refusal to turn professional his extreme reluctance to give interviews im a rider not a talker all enhanced his prestige the public liked the fact that his was still very much a family concern tory and the children helping out with the horses fen under malises auspices won the european junior championship in august and although still kept in the background by jake was beginning to make a name for herself most important of all jake had given a shot in the arm to a sport that in britain had been losing favor and dropping in the ratings the fickle public like heroes the fact that gyppo jake had trounced all other nations in the world championship dramatically revived interest in show jumping wherever jake jumped now he was introduced as the reigning world champion which was a strain because people expected him to do well but also increased his selfconfidence for the rest of the year and well into the spring he and macaulay stormed through europe like attila the hun winning every grand prix going two of his other novices laurel and hardy had also broken into the big time laurel a beautiful timid highly strung bay who started if a worm popped its head out of the ground in the collecting ring was brilliant in speed classes hardy a big cobby gray was a thug and a bully but had a phenomenal jump both were horses the public could identify with but it was macaulay they really loved while other riders changed their sponsors and were forced to call their horses ridiculous constantly changing names macaulay remained gloriously the same following jake around without a lead like a big dog nudging whoever presented the prizes and responding with a succession of bucks to the applause of the crowd in november jake was voted sportsman of the year macaulay came to the studios with him and exceled himself by sticking out his cock throughout the entire program treading firmly on dudley diplocks toe and eating the scroll that was presented to his master for the first time the public saw jake convulsed with laughter and were even more enchanted enraged by his humiliation in the world championship and the appalling publicity he received over selling macaulay to the middle east rupert decided to up sticks for a couple of months loading up six of his best horses he crossed the atlantic and boosted his morale by winning at shows in calgary toronto washington and madison square garden helen had always sighed wistfully that her parents had never had the opportunity to get to know their grandchildren rupert took her at her word flying the whole family out plus the nanny he dumped them in florida with mr and mrs macaulay while he traveled the american circuit and enjoyed himself as mrs macaulay pointed out sourly staying with her parents with the two children shattered one of helens illusions even if things got too bad with rupert she could never run home to mummy anymore the whole family were glad to get back to penscombe in november two weeks after rupert left for america billy had gone on a disastrous trip to rotterdam where he had fallen off paralytically drunk in the ring and sat on the sawdust laughing while one of his only remaining novices cavorted round the ring refusing to be caught the english papers had been full of the story billy got home to find that janey had walked out taking all her clothes her manuscript harold evans and worst of all mavis billy had stormed drunkenly round to the flat where she was living with kev and tried to persuade her to come back she had goaded him so much and become so hysterical that finally hed blacked her eye and walked out with mavis under his arm a week later he received an injunction from janeys solicitors accusing him of violent behavior and ordering him to stay away next day the bull whod been lackluster and off form for weeks had a blood test not only was he anemic but had picked up a virus said the vet and should not be jumped for three months billy took refuge in the bottle selling off his novices and pieces of furniture to quiet his creditors and to buy more whisky refusing to see anyone he also sacked tracey because he couldnt afford to pay her anymore she refused to go no one else could be permitted to look after the bull shed live on her dole money she said and wait until billy got his form back rupert was shattered when he got home to find billy in such a state typically whenever hed spoken to rupert on the telephone from america billy had pretended things were all right and he and janey were ticking along now sitting in a virtually empty cottage surrounded by empty bottles he had gone gray and aged ten years immediately rupert set about a process of as he called it rehabbillytation ordering helen to get billys old room ready at penscombe packing billy off to an alcoholics home to dry out and searching for a new sponsor helen while sorry for billy could not help being secretly delighted she had never really approved of janey now with billy back in the house they would have fun together like the old days but it was not the same it was like sending your son off to the wars all youthful glorious and confident in his plumed uniform and having him come home in the royal blue suit and red tie of the wounded hobbling around on a stick billy talked incessantly about janey mandryka and his failures he didnt drink anymore he was quiet sad and pathetically grateful helen once again marveled at ruperts kindness and gentleness one evening in early december when shed been talking to higgins the gardener helen heard shouting from the indoor school peering around the door she found billy walking around the willful eightyearold bay thoroughbred named bugle which rupert had picked up in america unable to get a tune out of him rupert had handed him over to billy now he was haranguing billy because of his reluctance to take bugle over a line of jumps all well over five foot billy was shivering like a whippet on a cold day i simply cant do it yet rupe he groaned give me a few more weeks get moving and get over those bloody jumps yelled rupert this is not a holiday camp oh rupert dont force him helen began and you can bugger off said rupert turning on her furiously helen retreated to the drawing room and tried to read the times literary supplement twenty minutes later rupert walked into the room ashen and trembling even more than billy had been whats the matter asked helen in horror rupert poured himself three fingers of neat whisky which he drained in one gulp he jumped them he said he jumped them beautifully and all clear half a dozen times im sorry i shouted at you but i just cant afford to let him see how scared i am for him the problem was to find billy a sponsor janeys departure the failure of the horses and the heavy drinking had been so widely publicized that billy would have to show himself in the ring sober and successful before anyone would come forward you can ride for me for the rest of the year said rupert i have my pride said billy and ive bummed quite enough off you and helen billy made his comeback at the olympia christmas show not the best occasion to return with the merrymaking and hellraising and the memories it evoked of both lavinia greenslade and janey all the other riders and grooms were very friendly and welcomed him but he knew that behind his back they were saying how much hed aged that hed lost his nerve and would never make the big time again never had he been more desperate for a drink than half an hour before the first big class rupert whod been watching him like a warder frogmarching him away from the bars had just been called away to do a quick television interview tracey was walking bugle around the collecting ring inside the ringside bar billy could see christmas drinkers knocking back doubles slapping each other on the back guffawing with laughter surely one drink wouldnt hurt one quick double to steady his nerves if he was this strung up hed transmit his fears to young bugle rupert gave him pocket money now easing his last fiver out of his breeches pocket he was just going into the bar when a voice said hello billy how lovely to see you back for a second he didnt recognize the plumpish but ravishingly pretty girl with the long light brown hair tied back with a black velvet ribbon like the young mozart its fen fenella maxwell how are you stepping forward she kissed him on both cheeks are you in the next class he nodded so am i malise has persuaded jake to let me jump im absolutely terrified makes two of us said billy still staring at her rupert says youre riding a super new horse yup hes super all right whether ill be able to get him around is another matter suddenly they were surrounded by a group of ecstatic teenagers its fen they screamed pushing billy out of the way can we have your autograph hows desdemona as she signed their books with a new and rather flashy signature which shed been practicing during the long journeys in the lorry she saw billy sliding away here she said to the teenagers dont you want his as well the teenagers looked inquiringly at billy then politely handed him their books whos he muttered one of the teenagers as they wandered off examining billys signature more closely billy someone said her friend also examining the autograph didnt he used to ride the bull hes the best rider in england fen shouted after them billy shook his head ruefully fen tucked her arm through his i told you it was high time you came back she said lets go and walk the course the course seemed enormous billy sat in the riders stand clutching a coke and wondered how the hell the riders could coax their horses over such enormous fences to ruperts intense irritation jake lovell jumped a beautiful clear on macaulay as did fen on desdemona that yard simply cant put a foot wrong at the moment said malise high time you were back to redress the balance billy despite the heat and stuffiness of the arena billy began to shiver he could feel his white shirt drenched beneath his red coat in the old days there had been excitement and nerves not this cold sickening sensation of leaden nausea could everyone see as he mounted bugle he noticed two young riders with jake lovell haircuts swapping stories once they had looked up to billy and would certainly have watched him jumping on a new horse now they nodded briefly carrying on with their conversation he jumped one practice fence and nearly falling off left it at that oh god they were calling his number ruperts face swam in front of him i think ive got a sponsor interested a victor block from the midlands hes the cutie cup millionaire makes bras and corsets you may have to change bugles name to cutie bcup but hes worth a lot of bread and hes up in the stands so dont have three stops at the first fence if i ever get to the first fence said billy in a hollow voice for christs sake hurry up billy snapped the collecting ring steward dont spend so long in the bar next time as he rode into the ring panic assailed him he should never have agreed to ride the saddle was hard and unfamiliar his legs felt cramped and powerless refusing to meet the leather and blend into it his hands on the reins were numb and heavy without any flexibility in the old days hed fallen into the rhythm of any horses stride now he humped along like a sack of cement and here comes billy lloydfoxe on dougall seuper absolutely seuper to see you back billy lets all give billy a big hand the applause albeit tentative unnerved the inexperienced bugle the first fence loomed up higher and higher desperately billy tried to balance himself hands rigid on the reins interfering with the horse pulling him off his stride bugle rapped the pole it swayed but didnt fall oh god groaned tracey her nails digging into her palms oh dont let him be over the hill is this the bloke you want me to sponsor asked victor block doesnt look much cop to me you wait said rupert trying not to show his desperate anxiety bugle approached the second fence battling for his head billy felt the horse steady himself judge the height rise into the air and making a mighty effort twist over the fence forgive me said billy in wonder sending up a prayer of thankfulness now his hold on bugles neck was relaxed the bays pace increased covering the churnedup tan with long lolloping strides suddenly billy felt the blessed sustaining confidence start to come back fence after fence swept by he was riding now helping rather than hindering bugle was jumping beautifully billys heart swelled in gratitude he was oblivious of the cheering gathering momentum he took off too far away from the wall but it flashed oxblood red beneath him and bugle cleared it by a foot what a horse what a horse he had to steady him for the last double and nerves got to him for a second but he left it to bugle to find his stride over and clear a huge roar went up billy concentrated very hard on bugles perfect black plaits to stop himself breaking down as he circled the horse before riding him out of the ring on the way he passed guy de la tour who was smiling broadly well done mon ami well done and riding up to billy he shook him by the hand and then leaning over kissed him on both cheeks the crowd broke into a great roar of approval billy the prodigal had returned mr block turned to a jubilant rupert happens youre right ill sponsor him but ill have to organize the money side so he can get on with the riding in the jumpoff jake went fastest with rupert second guy third and fen fourth billy anxious not to hurry a young horse was fifth as jake rode back into the ring to collect his rosette and cup followed by the rest of the riders rupert turned to billy i had to get you back on the circuit he said one of us has got to break the run of luck of that murdering gypsy bastard all runs of luck come to an end after a brilliant march in which he swept the board in antwerp dortmund and milan jake rolled up for the easter meeting at crittleden a course which had never really been lucky for him since sailors death it had rained solidly for a fortnight beforehand and the ground was again like the somme in the first big class macaulay who was probably a bit tired and didnt like jumping in a rainstorm slipped on takeoff at the third element of the combination hitting the poles chest on he somersaulted right over jakes good leg was the padding between the ground and half a ton of horse spectators swear to this day that they could hear the sickening splinter of bones without treading on jake macaulay managed to scramble to his feet immediately and shake himself free of the debris of wings and colored poles most horses would have galloped off but macaulay sensing something was seriously wrong gently nudged his master alternately looking down at him with guilt and anguish and then glancing over his shoulder with an indignant cant you see we need help expression on his mudspattered white face humpty hamilton reached jake first come on gyppo up you get he said jokingly theres a horse show going on here my fucking leg hissed jake through gritted teeth then fainted he came around as the ambulance men arrived normally a loose horse is a nuisance at such times but macaulay was a comfort standing stockstill while jake gripped onto his huge fetlock to stop himself screaming looking down with the most touching concern he also insisted on staying as close as possible as jake puttycolored and biting through his lip in anguish was bundled into an ambulance fen took one look at the casualty department at crittleden hospital and rang malise who was in london jakes done in his good leg she sobbed i dont think a local hospital should be allowed to deal with it malise agreed and moved in pulling strings getting jake instantly transferred to the motcliffe in oxford where the xrays showed the kneecap was shattered and the leg broken in five places the best bone specialist in the country was abroad but realizing the fate of a national hero rested in his hands he flew straight home and operated for six hours afterwards he told the crowd of waiting journalists that he was reasonably satisfied with the result but there might be a need for further surgery tory managed to park the children and arrived at the hospital out of her mind with worry just as jake came out of the theater for the first fortyeight hours they kept him heavily sedated raving and delirious his temperature rose as he babbled on and on were any of his family in the navy said the ward sister looking faintly embarrassed he keeps talking about a sailor tory shook her head sailor was a horse she said when can i ride again was his first question when he came around malise was a great strength to tory it was he and the specialist johnnie buchannan who told jake what the future would be when tory couldnt summon up the courage johnnie buchannan sat cautiously down on jakes bed anxious not in any way to jolt the damaged leg which was strapped up in the air youre certainly popular he said admiring the mass of flowers and getwell cards that covered every surface of the room and were waiting outside in sackfuls still to be opened i havent seen so many cards since we had james hunt in here jake his face gray and shrunken from pain and stress didnt smile when can i ride again look i dont want to depress you but you certainly cant ride for a year what whispered jake through bloodless lips thatll ruin me i dont believe it he went on suddenly hysterical i could get up and discharge myself now he tried to rise off the bed and remove his leg from the hook gave a smothered shriek and collapsed tears of pain and frustration filling his eyes christ you cant mean it he mumbled ive got to keep going malise got a cigarette from the packet by the bed put it in jakes mouth and lit it you nearly lost the leg he said gently if it hadnt been for johnnie you would never have walked again let alone ridden your other leg weakened by polio would never have been able to support you on its own youve got to get your good leg sound again jake shook his head i didnt mean to sound ungrateful its just that its my living thisll ruin me it wont said johnnie buchannan if it knits properly youll be out of here in five or six months and can conduct operations from a wheelchair at home if you dont play silly buggers and take the physio side of it seriously you could be riding again this time next year jake glared at them determined not to betray the despair inside him then he shrugged his shoulders all right theres not much i can do youd better tell fen to turn all the horses out they could use the rest isnt that a bit extreme said malise no said jake bleakly who else can ride them for a workaholic like jake worse almost than the pain was the inactivity lying in bed hour after hour he watched the leaves slowly breaking through the pointed green buds of the sycamores and the ranks of daffodils tossing in the icy wind and fretted he had no resources he was frantically homesick missing tory the children fen and the horses and wolf the lurcher the anonymity of the hospital sickeningly reminded him of the time when he had had polio as a child and his mother seldom came and visited him perhaps feeling too guilty for never bothering to have him inoculated for a fastidious reserved and highly private person he couldnt bear to be totally dependent on the nurses he was revolted by the whole ritual of blanket baths and bedpans lying in the same position his leg strapped up in the air he found it impossible to sleep he had no appetite he longed to see the children but with the hospital eighty miles from home it was difficult for tory to bring them often and when she did jake was so ill and tired and weak he couldnt cope with their exuberance for more than a few minutes and was soon biting their heads off he longed to ask tory to come and look after him but he was too proud and anyway she had her work cut out with the children and the yard the friday morning after the accident fen had been to see him such was his despair he had been perfectly foul to her and sent her away in tears wracked with guilt he was therefore not in the best of moods when malise dropped in during the afternoon bringing three dick francis novels a biography of red rum a bottle of brandy and the latest horse and hound youve made the cover he told jake theres an account of your accident inside they say some awfully nice things about you must think im finished said jake broodingly thanks anyway ive got a proposal to make to you im married snapped jake its about fen if youre grounded why dont you let her jump the horses dont be bloody ridiculous shes too young shes seventeen said malise remember pat smythe and marion coakes shes good enough what she needs is international experience i dont want her overfaced anyway shes daffy shed forget her own head if i wasnt there to tell her what to do its not as though your horses were difficult said malise macaulay dotes on her shes ridden laurel and hardy and desdemonas been going like a dream no said jake reaching for a cigarette what is the point youve brought all those horses up to peak fitness and youve got two grooms who need wages why throw the whole thing up and just lie here worrying yourself sick about money let her have a go shes your pupil you taught her havent you got any faith in her jake shifted sideways giving a gasp of pain pretty grim huh jake nodded can you get me a drink malise poured some brandy into a paper cup itll give you an interest she can ring you every night from wherever she is and wheres that going to be malise poured himself a drink to give himself the courage to answer rome then she can fly back for the royal windsor then paris barcelona lucerne and crittleden no said jake emphatically why not too young im not letting a girl her age abroad by herself with wolves like ludwig guy and rupert around ill keep an eye on her ill personally see shes in bed alone by eleven oclock every night she needs a long stint abroad to give her confidence hows she getting to rome in ruperts private jet i suppose griselda hubbards got a lorry which takes six horses she can easily take two or three of yours griselda hubbard said jake outraged thats scraping the barrel mr punch has turned into rather a good horse said malise but not with grisel on him fens far better than her exactly said malise thats why i want to take her back at the mill house fen was battling with blackest gloom and trying to cheer up macaulay it was nearly a week since jakes fall but the horse still wouldnt settle he wouldnt eat and at night he walked his box every time a car came over the bridge or there was a footstep in the yard hed rush to the halfdoor calling hopefully then turn away in childlike disappointment since jake had rescued macaulay from the middle east they hadnt been separated for a day fen had tried to turn him out with the rest of the horses but hed just stood shivering by the gate in his new zealand rug yelling to be brought in again poor mac thought fen and poor me too shed thought about dino ferranti so often since the world championship hoping so much that shed bump into him on the circuit this summer and now jake had ordered the horses to be turned out and thered be no going abroad and shed be stuck with taking desdemona to a few piffling little local shows that jake considered within her capabilities a rather attractive journalist whom shed met at olympia had rung up that afternoon and asked her if shed like to sail over to cherbourg for a party on the saturday night shed had to refuse just as she kept having to refuse dates and parties because there was always some crisis cropping up with the horses and now jake was in hospital she had ten times as much responsibility shed been up all last night with hardy who having gorged himself on the spring grass suddenly developed a violent attack of colic brought into the stable he had promptly cast himself and been so badly frightened when he couldnt get up that fen had had to call out the vet it was some compensation that morning that a recovered hardy instead of taking his usual piece out of her had butted her gently with his head and then licked her hand in gratitude added to this jake had been perfectly bloody when shed visited him in hospital she knew he was depressed or he wouldnt have been so awful but sometimes it was difficult to make allowances and finally it was sarah the new grooms third night off that week she was very good at her job sarah and extremely attractive with long black hair which never got greasy and a flawless creamy skin which never got spots she was also quite tough she had turned down a job with guy de la tour because it was underpaid at his stable you were expected to work twentyfour hours a day seven days a week the only compensation was being screwed by count guy when he felt like it instead she had taken a job with jake your brotherinlaw said sarah may be moody and prefer fourlegged creatures to anything on two legs but at least he pays properly and gives you plenty of evenings off not if youre family he doesnt thought fen gloomily as she watched sarah tarted up to the nines drive off to a party in her pale blue sports car once again fen repeated dinos words there is more to life than the inside of a tackcleaning bucket she was fed up with bloody horses she wanted some fun a delectable smell of chicken casserole drifted out from the kitchen looking at her watch she was surprised to see it was halfpast nine inside she found tory stacking up a pile of envelopes she had spent the evening canceling shows and wondering which bills to pay first poor lovie you look shattered she told fen lets have a drink before dinner can we afford it said fen looking at the bills i think so said tory at the moment anyway it just infuriates me that having paid for all that foreign stabling in advance we wont be able to use it having opened a bottle of red wine and filled two glasses fen slumped in the armchair by the aga although it was the end of april it was still cold wolf the lurcher who was missing his master even more than macaulay leapt onto fens lap for comfort poor old boy said fen cuddling his shivering shaggy body hows mac said tory draining the broccoli still off his feed his whole routines been disrupted ouch she screeched as wolf hearing the sound of a car on the gravel leapt off her knees scratching her thighs with his long claws next moment he was through the back door and had rushed off barking frantically into the yard who the hell could that be said fen wolf obviously knows him said tory hes stopped barking may i come in said malise oh hell muttered fen hell think weve eaten and stay gassing for hours hello said tory blushing with her usual shyness youve come at the right time weve just opened a bottle she filled up another glass malise sat down at the long scrubbed table enjoying the warmth admiring the childrens paintings and the newspaper photographs of the horses on the corkboard alongside this years already substantial number of rosettes for which there was no longer space in the tackroom he looked at the pile of envelopes youve been busy canceling shows said tory hoping we might get some of our money back why dont you stay for supper she stammered weve got masses im sure there isnt enough said malise tory always cooks for five thousand and its always marvelous said fen malise suddenly realized he hadnt eaten all day well itd be awfully nice its only chicken said tory apologetically ill get it out said fen typical tory she thought as she got four huge baked potatoes and a large blue casserole out of the oven nice kitchen said malise as he put butter in his baked potato hows macaulay devastated sighed fen he even misses shows every time the telephone goes in the tackroom he starts cantering around the field this is excellent tory said malise i hadnt realized how hungry i was by the way ive just been to see jake oh how kind how was he pretty miserable still frustrated bored and still in a lot of pain asked tory yup but at least i gave him something to take his mind off his leg youd better get the horses in tomorrow fen hes agreed you can jump them poor jake said fen i drove over to see him this morning he looked awful what did you say she stopped with a piece of carrot on the way to her mouth hes going to let you ride the horses where stammered fen malise laughed rome paris windsor barcelona crittleden lucerne just for starters fen opened her mouth and shut it again then she turned to tory is this true tory laughed and hugged her if malise says so it must be but we cant afford it of course you can youll be jumping as a member of the british team so those expensesll be paid and if im anything to go by youll be in the money very soon fen looked at him incredulously thank you she said in a choked voice then jumping to her feet and falling over wolf she ran out into the yard muttering that she must go and tell macaulay oh please god forgive me she prayed as she buried her face in macaulays neck i didnt mean it when i said i wanted to give up show jumping the following day fen loaded up macaulay in the trailer and drove to oxford without asking anyones permission she unboxed him in the woodstock road and rode him across the emerald green billiardtablesmooth hospital lawn and cavalierly trampling a bed of dark red wallflowers underfoot banged on the window of jakes room jake sunk in the depths of gloom thought he was hallucinating when the great white face with the white eye peered through the glass at him fortunately it was a slack period matron was at lunch patients were resting and comely sister wutherspoon who was a showjumping fan pushed jakes bed so it was flush to the opened window the reunion touched everyone at first macaulay couldnt quite believe it pressing his face against jakes shoulder whickering in ecstasy then licking his pajama jacket and his face with a great pink stropping tongue for a minute jake couldnt speak but at last his face took on some color as he fed macaulay a whole pound of grapes and a bar of chocolate and an apple word soon spread round the hospital a crowd of nurses had soon gathered in the room to pat and even take photographs of the world champion thrilled to see the delight on jakes face they had all been worried about his slow recovery and his black depression in the middle the matron walked in and everyone melted away fortunately she was also a showjumping fan we really dont allow visitors out of hours mr lovell but i suppose we can make an exception in macaulays case after twenty minutes fen put macaulay back in the trailer and came back to talk to jake thanking him over and over again for letting her go promising to ring him every night when are you off friday morning grisels collecting me she saw him again once before she left on the way home from a day trip to london he was so busy giving her lastminute instructions he didnt notice she never took the scarf from her head romes tricky he said youll find the fences coming off the corners very fast and at dusk the trees around the arena throw shadows across the poles which make it very easy to make mistakes macaulays eyesights not brilliant if youre in any doubt dont jump him you wont like rome lots of wops with machine guns pinching your bottom dont carry money or your passport in your bag the muggers are frightful and put any winnings in the hotel safe at once if there are any said fen in a hollow voice i gather billy lloydfoxe is back in the team too said jake if you have any problems go to him rather than malise he has to ride the horses he knows what hes talking about ive been very wicked said fen when she got back to the mill house three hours later and found tory in the kitchen darning fens lucky socks ive bought three pairs of trousers three shirts two dresses and a bikini i promise ill win it all back and i passed a poster of janey lloydfoxe in the tube telling me to read her column every week so i drew a mustache on her and wrote bitch underneath i hope no one saw you said tory in alarm lets see what you bought and i went to the hairdresser said fen casually i covered it up with a scarf because i thought jake might freak out its gone a bit flat she removed the scarf tory just gaped at her fen had gone out that morning with dark mouse hair trailing almost to her waist now it was streaked white blond and no longer than two inches all over her head tendrils curled round her face and down to a point at the nape of her neck she had been on a crash diet for the last ten days since she heard about the trip and now weighed no more than eight stone as a result of so many salads the spots had gone for good the new hairstyle emphasized the emerging cheekbones the brilliant slanting aquamarine eyes and the long slender neck im sorry fen hung her head but i thought it would be easier to keep like this certainly it wont be easier to keep men at a distance thought tory malise was going to have his work cut out as a chaperone suddenly with a flash of equal pain and pleasure she realized that fen was no longer a child a little sister almost since this morning shed grown up into a beauty its gorgeous she said in awe the hairs heaven fen grinned with relief griselda wont be able to keep her hands off me fen had seldom met anyone she disliked more than griselda hubbard having told fen to be ready at fivethirty she rolled up while it was still dark at four fortyfive just as fen was feeding desdemona and macaulay refusing to come in for a cup of coffee she sat drumming her fingers on the wheel of her vast eightgear juggernaut gazing at the immaculate yard as though it was a pigsty forcing fen into a complete panic and sabotaging all her downto thelastminute organization macaulay loathed getting up early at the best of times there was no way you could hurry him over his breakfast or sarah over blowdrying her hair itll dry all crinkly if i leave it was her only answer in reply to fens frantic pleas what on earths that said griselda as fen installed a huge sweetshop jar of lemon sherbets taking up a large corner of the very limited cupboard space macaulays reward if he jumps well youre optimistic said griselda dismissively she was bullterrier solid rather than fat with huge fleshy thighs stretching a maroon track suit and a hard face with short permed dark hair small beady eyes and more than a suggestion of mustache on her upper lip she might have been any age between thirty and fortyfive but in fact was only twentyeight i am not sitting next to her muttered sarah georgie griseldas girl groom as thin and wiry as griselda was solid had a pointed nose watery blue eyes and a long beige plait down her back there was a lot of fuss about loading griselda had four horses with her star mr punch on the outside im not having that brute next to punchie she said as fen started to lead macaulay up the ramp he wouldnt hurt a fly protested fen punchie is not a fly said griselda and thats not what rupert campbellblack says put desdemona next to punchie desdemona gets scared its easier if shes between mac and hardy and mac goes in first look if you hitch a lift with me said griselda you abide by my rules handling the monster lorry like a man griselda calmly knocked down two of torys carefully nurtured lilac trees on the grass verge by the gate fen shivered for desdemona and macaulays safety as grisel overtook juggernaut after juggernaut on the motorway she got to the ferry two hours early which meant lots of hanging around fen insisted on feeding her horses at the docks which to griseldas intense irritation had mr punch and the rest of her horses clamoring for their lunch too to upset fen there was the inevitable lorryload of bewildered thirstily bleating little calves the driver said they were destined for the pot why cant they bloody kill them in england said fen eec regulations said the driver dont be so sentimental said griselda you eat meat dont you when they were at sea they had lunch in the restaurant grisel ordered a huge steak i need my fuel im the only one doing any work fen who was starving ordered a grilled sole which seemed less bloodthirsty the moment it arrived grisel made a point of asking her to go down to the hold and check the horses throughout the threeday journey she treated fen with even more contempt than the grooms insisting she mapread then hitting the roof when fen gazed out of the windows at the pink and white apple blossoms and wondering how she would put desdemona at all the fences that flashed past twice navigated grisel on to the wrong motorway every sixty miles or so griselda ordered sarah or fen to make her yet another cup of strong black coffee with three spoonfuls of sugar jake always stopped to water and graze his horses on the way griselda believed in pushing on well never make fontainebleau by nightfall if we bugger around blowing them out with grass whod like a lemon sherbet theyre macaulays snapped fen hell hardly get through that lot no wonder hes so podgy certainly likes her pound of flesh muttered sarah to fen although why she should want any more flesh defeats me the ugly cow shes supposed to have a boyfriend said fen must have picked him up at st dunstans finally two days later with the ave maria ringing out all over the city they drove into rome fen was knocked sideways by the beauty of the churches the statues the lakes reflecting the yellow and turquoise sky and the great humpbacked dome of st peters the streets swarmed with people parading up and down gossiping and showing off their new clothes the traffic was terrifying griselda however drove the lorry on undaunted on the principle that if she crashed into a ferrari it would come off worst sarah sitting by the window was the object of repeated wolf whistles i always felt id like to end my days in rome she said smugly you probably will if griselda doesnt drive more slowly said fen oh look at that beautiful park over there through the gap in the houses she could see a rustic amphitheater circled with umbrella palms thats the showground said sarah its supposed to be the most beautiful in the world the stables part of a military barracks were splendid with big roomy boxes enabling the horses to look out into the yard theres snakepit and the bull said sarah so rupert and billy are already here fen suddenly felt nervous and wondered what theyd think of her new hair hello said dizzy coming out of snakepits box we flew out we were lucky have you had a frightful journey marvelous lied fen because griselda was in earshot where are the team staying griselda asked dizzy the apollo just round the corner well im off said griselda i expect youll want to settle your horses fen can you carry my cases to the taxi rank georgie and mind you brush out the horse area and clean up the living area bitch said fen glaring at griseldas solid departing back with georgie running after her buckling under the cases were getting home some other way she added to sarah even if we have to carry the horses having examined the loose boxes for stickingout nails and jagged edges of wood they put down wood shavings and fed and watered the horses macaulay however had a more pressing need dropping down folding like a camel he rolled and rolled god im so tired i could sleep on a clothesline said fen where shall we have supper said sarah theres a nice trattoria round the corner said dizzy can i come with you asked fen no you cant said driffield whod been checking his horses youre staying at the apollo with the team and youll be expected to dine with them too come on well share a taxi pay for it you mean said fen under her breath knowing driffields meanness you can sleep in the hotel room alternate nights and ill sleep in the lorry she said apologetically to sarah malise wont put up with that said driffield youve made the grade now dear and youll have to behave like one of us the hotel apollo was a sprawling yellow villa its stuccoed walls peeling the walls of the lobby were decorated with friezes of apollo in various guises cavorting with bathing nymphs bemused maidens and hairylegged flute players there was a rackety lift but fen preferred to climb a huge baroque staircase to her room on the second floor which turned out to be the height of luxury meanwhile downstairs in the bar malise hiding his disappointment that helen hadnt made the trip to rome this year was giving billy and rupert a pep talk i need your help chaps he said with unusual heartiness fenella maxwells not eighteen yet tory and jake are in a panic shes going to get seduced by some wop i promised them wed keep a close eye on her torys overreacting said rupert i cant actually envisage fen having to fight them off poor old jake said billy looking down at his glass of coke bloody bad luck when hed just battled his way to the top i must send him a pleasedontgetwell card drawled rupert he tried to kill me last year remember pity he didnt succeed said driffield nastily billy thought wistfully of the old days when predinner drinks were the nicest part of the day to celebrate or cheer you up after a lousy round youd start with a pint of beer because you were thirsty and after that you had several large whiskys with increasing merriment in anticipation of some exotic food heightened by plenty of wine and several brandies afterwards life had seemed framed in a halo studded with buttercups now all meals had a terrible sameness with people getting sillier or more aggressive the first wild agony of losing janey had given way to a dull numbing loneliness he had become aware of the appalling sameness of the showjumping circuit the faceless bedrooms the endless traveling before it had been redeemed by hellraising with rupert or living it up with janey everywhere he went he was reminded of her and the good time they had had and every night he watched the other riders ring home to check up on their families and report the latest success he had no one to ring now no one who gave a stuff if he won or lost except his creditors whom he was gradually paying back the money from each small win was sent to mr block who kept what was necessary for billys livelihood took his cut and passed the rest on to the tax man in fact if he could get back on form and notch up about five really good wins he could discharge the whole debt once janey had filed for divorce billys mother making no secret of her relief had come to his aid not giving him a huge sum but enough to settle the most pressing bills rupert had been wonderful looking across at him a fond father showing photographs of the twelvemonthold tabitha to malise billy felt a wave of passionate gratitude for his support and kindness never once had rupert tried to persuade him to have a drink as other people constantly did malises voice broke into his thoughts hope you dont mind coming here again too much he said in an undertone im fond of this place even if it is a bit quaint billy smiled of course not that was all part of the act to be cheerful never to show the cracks in his heart he pointed to one of the more grotesque figures portrayed in the frieze round the walls of the bar what did that poor chap do raped apollos mother he was pegged down so that birds could peck continually at his liver sounds like mine in the old days said billy another coke asked malise no im fine billy looked across at griselda hubbard massive in a red track suit what a disgustingly ugly pig she was and already badmouthing poor little fen shes a hopeless mapreader and kept making the most ridiculous fuss about stopping to graze and water the horses if id listened to her wed still be in france jakes mad to let her ride the horses when shes so soft theyll be walking all over her in a week or two and shes no sense of hierarchy treats her groom like an equal even a superior shell have both her and the two horses tucked up in her hotel bedroom watching the telly at any minute i hope we can get english food here grumbled driffield brandishing an empty glass and looking around hoping someone would buy him a drink rupert was discussing declining television viewing figures with malise they ought to sack dudley hes such a pratt what we need on the circuit is crumpet whos talking sneered driffield not groupie crumpet competing crumpet some goodlooking riders like lavinia said malise she was never good enough or pretty enough said rupert ahem said billy anyway she married a frog i am talking about someone like ann moore or marion coakes someone every little ponymad girl can identify with its the ponymad girls that make up the audiences and bring in their parents what about fenella maxwell said malise well if she shed about a stone and a half most of which is spots thank you rupert said a shrill voice everyone turned round mamma mia said billy christ said rupert you have grown up fen stood staring at them eyes widened like a faun drained sea green shirt tucked into drained sea green bermuda shorts espadrilles on the end of her long smooth brown legs her spiky blond hair was still wet from the shower not a spot spoiled her smooth brown cheeks just a faint touch of blusher she looked like a wary but very beautiful street urchin oh god thought malise how am i going to chaperone that in rome as it was very late they went straight in to dinner ivor braine and amazingly driffield made concerted efforts to sit next to fen ivor just crumbled gristiks and gazed at her with his mouth open all the team except griselda who was obviously feeling upstaged were incredibly nice asking her about jakes leg and the horses and how the glamorous sarah was settling in the waiters flashing teeth and menus kept filling her glass with chianti not having touched a drop since shed started dieting she suddenly felt very lightheaded im starving she told driffield i dont think i could ever look at a grapefruit or a lettuce leaf again how much have you lost not enough for rupert across the table rupert laughed and raised his glass to her i overestimated you look delectable dont lose an ounce more im going to have fettucine said griselda sourly followed by abbacchio al forno whats that said ivor roast baby lamb cooked whole said griselda watering at the mouth probably one of those lambs that came over on the ferry thought fen savagely bloody carnivore suddenly she felt less hungry whats ucelletti little songbirds roasted on a spit said griselda theyre very good god this is a barbaric country said billy im surprised they dont casserole all those stray cats hanging round the street not enough meat on them said rupert next moment a messenger arrived at the table with two telegrams for fen one was from jake and tory and the children when she opened the other she gasped and went bright scarlet but failed to shove it back into the envelope quickly enough to stop driffield reading it congratulations he read out and good luck look forward to seeing you this summer dino ferranti consorting with the enemy are we you could do a lot worse for yourself evidently his fathers as rich as croesus its nothing stammered fen we just met briefly at the world championship i wonder how he discovered id been selected rupert was looking across at her with a dangerous glint in his eyes the sly fox he said must have been working overtime at les rivaux as well as making a play for you he was running like mad after helen not nearly as much as macaulay was running after you began driffield then stopped when he saw the blaze of anger on ruperts face sorry dangerous subject dino said rupert leaning over to fill up fens glass even pursued helen when we were in america while she was staying with her mother he was evidently never off the telephone pestering her to go out with him fen felt her happiness evaporate seeing her face billy said quickly never met dino cant imagine him pestering anyone he sounds far too laid back dinner seemed to go on for hours fen found she couldnt finish her spaghetti is billy all right she said to driffield in an undertone he seems to have lost all his sparkle and his hairs even grayer than it was at olympia hasnt really had a good win since then said driffield malise is only keeping him in the team for sentimental reasons hes still so attractive who is asked rupert throughout dinner his eyes had flickered over fen he was the only man shed ever met who could stare so calculatingly and without any embarrassment as though he was a cat and she a birds nest he was going to raid in his own good time no one she said quickly she turned to ivor tell me about your new horse is he really called john i think youve lost your audience ivor said rupert five minutes later fen had fallen fast asleep her head on the red raffia table mat three days later fen had reached screaming pitch the week had been one succession of disasters she remembered jake warning her that his first show with the british team had begun catastrophically but nothing could have been as bad as this she didnt even dare ring him at the hospital on the first day shed entered desdemona in a speed class for horses who had never jumped in rome before the little mare had gone like a whirlwind treating the course with utter disdain sailing over fences she couldnt see over whisking home in the fastest time by a couple of seconds fen was so enchanted by such brilliance she promptly jumped off and flung her arms around desdemonas neck to the delight of the crowd the british team were less amused you berk said rupert as starryeyed she led desdemona out of the ring youve just lost yourself a grand but she won gasped fen she may have done but you disqualified her by dismounting before you left the ring oh my god said fen oh des im sorry i didnt think what on earth will jake say shouldnt tell him least said soonest sewn up said ludwig cheerfully who as the new winner rode grinning into the ring to collect his prize money in the big class later in the day fen made two stupid mistakes putting macaulay out of the running then on the second day in the relay competition because rupert always paired with billy and ivor with driffield fen was stuck with a reluctant griselda ill show her fumed fen waiting on desdemona holding her hand out ready for the baton as griselda cantered up to them after a clear and surprisingly swift round on mr punch desdemona however had other ideas mr punch had nipped her sharply several times on the journey out and at the sight of him thundering down on her she jumped sharply out of his way causing fen to drop the baton what dreadful language said rupert who was standing nearby grinning from ear to ear what a good thing all those nice italian spectators cant understand what griseldas saying to fen determined to redeem herself in the big class in the evening fen rode with such attack that when macaulay decided he didnt like the jump built in the shape of a roman villa and started to dig his toes in fen shot straight over his head covering herself in bruises the previous day malise had organized some sightseeing they went to st peters and saw the statue of st peter with the stone foot worn away by the kisses of the pilgrims i came here with janey fen overheard billy saying to rupert i swore that by the end of our life together id have kissed her more than the pilgrims had kissed that foot perhaps thats why she pushed off he was trying to make a joke of it but fen could sense his despair being superstitious all the riders wanted to visit the trevi fountain isnt it beautiful said fen admiring the bronze tritons the gods and goddesses the wild horses and the leaping glistening rushing cascade of water only thing missing is rossano brazzi said driffield whos he asked fen he was in three coins in the fountain christ you must be young do you think he added looking at his loose change an irish penny would work no its bad luck said rupert chucking in a fiftypence piece i expect youll sneak back at dusk and fish that out driffield fen threw in a tenpence piece please fountain she prayed when i come back let it be with a really nice man who loves me as much as i love him opening her eyes she found billy beside her he had also tossed a fiftypence piece into the fountain watching it float down to land on the bronze and silver floor his lips were moving his face haggard his hair even grayer in the sunlight hes wishing hell come back to rome with janey thought fen oh poor poor billy back at the show in the afternoon she hadnt fared any better and now shed been packed off to bed at eleven oclock with soothing reassurances from malise that she was not to worry shed soon find her feet and to get a good nights sleep how could she possibly sleep with all that din and merrymaking in the streets below her mood was not helped by the fact that sarah and dizzy had been asked out by two american tennis stars over for the tournament which ran concurrently with the horse show both grooms had come and had used fens room to bath and wash their hair and change then had gone off in raging spirits looking gorgeous fen went out on the balcony here i am in the most beautiful city in the world she thought with the spring in its green prime with the streets and parks filled with lovers kissing holding hands necking in traffic jams lying on the grass everywhere she went gorgeous italian men with hot pansydark eyes followed her wolf whistling and pinching her bottom but rupert and billy and malise chaperoned her so fiercely she wasnt allowed near them only that evening at a drinks party shed been chatted up by a fantasticlooking french tennis player who was just asking her out to dinner when rupert came up and told him to piss off whats that you say asked the frenchman so rupert told him in french even more forcibly and the frenchman had gone very white and backed off that was another thing rupert had made terrific verbal passes at her at the world championship but now he was treating her as though she was a very boring nineyearold child he was expected to look after and that night no doubt he and billy had gone off on the tiles she knew she ought to undress and try to sleep but it was so hot and stuffy she stayed on the balcony watching the lights twinkling in the grounds of the villa borghese even the moon was wrapped in a gold lurex shawl of cloud as though she was going out for the evening nothing in excess apollos motto was carved over the door at the entrance to the hotel im obviously not going to get a chance even to have anything in moderation fen thought sulkily please apollo she pleaded i promise i wont be excessive just let me have a bit of fun as if in answer to her prayer the telephone rang fen sprang on it buona notte hi said a soft voice is that fen whos that she squeaked her heart hammering its dino dino ferranti fen sat down suddenly on the bed hello hello he said when she couldnt speak fen yes she stammered oh how blissful to hear you i sure missed you baby did you get my telegram oh yes it was so sweet of you how did you know ive had my spies out how are you getting on not great i havent won a thing dont worry its a helluva course has rupert been leaping on you on the contrary theyre all treating me as if i was a typhoid carrier this is a godawful line said dino where are you in rome rome she knew she should be cool but she couldnt keep the squeak of delight out of her voice just dropped by to look at a horse im flying out tomorrow i guess its late but you wouldnt like to come out would you oh yes please ill pick you up in half an hour shed never washed her hair or bathed so quickly thank god she hadnt worn her new pink dress and pink shoes yet shed been saving them for a special occasion everything in excess she told her radiant reflection as she sprayed dutyfree perfume bought on the boat everywhere in her shoes behind her knees and ears and on her bush she hoped dino wouldnt go off her because shed cut her hair she wished she had time to paint her toenails she decided not to take the lift in case she ran into malise instead crept down the huge staircase clinging onto the banisters for support her knees kept giving way in two minutes shed see dino blast there were rupert and driffield in the lobby apparently examining some expensive jerseys in a glass case she shot back upstairs peering through the banisters hell they were still there shed just have to brazen it out why shouldnt she go and have a drink with dino she reached the bottom of the stairs and was just tiptoeing across the marble floor to the front door when rupert and driffield turned around both doubled up with laughter whats the matter asked fen walking past them her nose in the air april fool said rupert ignoring them fen walked on catching up rupert tapped her on the shoulder april fool i dont know what youre talking about i sure missed you kid this is dino ferranti fen looked at him bewildered is he here already where is he rupert looked down at her his eyes narrowed to slits that mocking cruel smile on his beautiful face in america as far as i know hes not said fen patiently hes in rome ive just talked to him on the telephone and hes come to look at a horse and all the british team are treating you as if you were a typhoid carrier the color drained from fens face it was you she whispered sure was dont you think ive picked up quite a good american accent from my wife fen looked at him with contempt you bastard how could you rupert shrugged new girls tease he ruffled her hair come on ill buy you a drink you bloody wont and bursting into tears she ran back upstairs as she panted sobbing up to the second floor rupert came out of the lift come on it was a joke not to me it wasnt she fled down the passage but as she scrabbled desperately in her bag for her key rupert caught up with her angel im sorry i didnt realize it would upset you that much go away she sobbed i hate you shush shush he said taking her in her arms youll wake up griselda from her ugly sleep stop it she said hammering her fists against his chest as tears spilled down her cheeks but he was far too strong for her next moment he was kissing her quivering mouth for a second she clenched her teeth together then suddenly aware of his warmth and vitality she melted and began to kiss him back her hands against her will crept up over the powerful shoulders her fingers entwining in the sleek thick hair what the hell are you two doing said a voice fen nearly went through the ceiling rupert didnt move what does it look as though were doing snapped rupert he stopped kissing fen but still shielded her in his arms look malise this is entirely my fault not fens i enticed her out as a practical joke pretending to be someone else then i followed her upstairs and er forced my attentions on her she didnt appear to be putting up much resistance said malise coldly thats my irresistible charm said rupert releasing fen he opened her door and gave her her bag which had fallen on the carpet go to bed darling ill sort this out malise in a dinner jacket had been to the theater rupert and he glared at each other well said rupert softly what are you going to do about it nothing this time said malise but you can thank your lucky stars albeit interpreted by patric walker that i caught you outside the bedroom if this happens again ill leave you out of the team for the rest of the year rupert looked unrepentant shes so adorable its almost worth it he said billy whod forgotten to declare for the following day and had just returned from the show offices was absolutely livid when he heard what had happened you rotten sod he shouted at rupert didnt you see the way her little face lit up when the cable arrived shes obviously mad about him how could you do such a fucking awful thing to her you dont understand anything about peoples feelings youre like a bloody boy scout in reverse you have to do a bad deed every day and he walked into his bedroom slamming the door immediately he dialed fens number if thats rupert you can bugger off it isnt are you okay perfectly said fen in a choked voice do you want a shoulder to cry on and get into more trouble with malise no thank you very much said fen with a stifled sob and hung up by morning misery had hardened into cold rage against rupert how could she have betrayed jake and let herself kiss him back like that and even worse have enjoyed it she was a nymphomaniac virgin she went out to work the horses bootfaced with dark glasses covering her swollen eyes malise came down to watch her asking her to come and have a cup of coffee with him afterwards perhaps hell even send me home she thought miserably but malise merely wanted to tell her that she hadnt been picked for the nations cup ivor braine had pulled a back muscle so the team would be rupert billy driffield and griselda hanging her head fen reminded malise of a snowdrop im sorry ive been so hopeless you havent you won that class the first day you dont want to send me back because youve made a ghastly mistake you have the selfconfidence of a snail said malise you obviously dont rate me as a chef dequipe if you assume id select someone who was no good fen sprinkled chocolate on her cappuccino wherefore rejoice she said moodily what conquests brings she home oh you will look youre a very very good rider better dare i say it even than jake when he jumped that first earthshattering double clear on sailor in madrid but its all strange macaulays strange you havent got jake to mastermind your every move griseldas bitching and rupert and everyone else are letching fen flushed and bit her lip rupert really wouldnt do for you he said i realize hes attractive but helens had so much of that to put up with and you know how jake detests him i didnt want it wasnt like that stammered fen i dont want excuses said malise rupert accepts full responsibility but that still doesnt alter the fact that you shouldnt have been out of your room in a party dress an hour after youd been sent to bed now dyou want to come and have a look at the sistine chapel there were two big classes that afternoon the first a knockout competition the second a puissance sponsored by one of italys leading car manufacturers macaulays in a foul mood sarah told fen when she got to the showground hes just sulking in his box hes fed up with not winning said fen im going to jump him in the puissance sarah looked horrified are you sure thats wise jakes never jumped him in a puissance and highjumping really isnt his forte the grounds absolutely rock hard i dont care said fen get him ready the knockout competition before the puissance consisted of two ushaped courses each of nine jumps lying side by side the riders raced up the outside of the us then around the top and came side by side down the inside of the us riders going around the righthand u had to wear a primrose yellow sash to distinguish them twentyfour riders started fen had a walkover in the first round apart from that she had a tough draw which included guy de la tour ludwig and rupert in the other draw was piero fratinelli son of the car firm and darling of the crowd her first battle was against griselda whom she had great delight in beating by a couple of lengths this was just desdemonas sort of class she was nippy lithe as a cat her father hadnt won the cesarewitch for nothing count guy whom she rode against next had had rather too many glasses of wine at lunchtime and carelessly had the first fence down so fen was able to conserve desdemonas energy and coast to an easy clear ludwig put out rupert piero fratinelli sadly put out billy but fen had no time to feel sorry before she had donned the yellow sash and was back in the ring competing against ludwig hes taken one prize off us this week and hes not going to do it again fen said to desdemona the handsome ludwig was already in the ring exchanging badinage with the rest of the german team who already knocked out were sitting in the riders stand he turned giving fen a dazzling but slightly patronizing smile ah mees fenella i vill really haf to try you look very nice in zat yellow sash yes muttered fen and im jolly well going to wear it again in the final ludwig got away a fraction after fen who streaked ahead nibbling at desdemonas ears racing her like a gymkhana pony rocketing over the jumps without any regard for safety on the uturn her hat flew off oh christ thought billy in anguish i hope she doesnt fall on her head ludwig on his big striding horse was gaining on her neck and neck they came down the center go on des screamed fen desdemona saw the collecting ring her blood was up flattening her pink ears in fury she edged past the post a nose ahead of ludwig photo feenish chorused the german team from the stands its ours said rupert grinning and making a vsign at them piero beat wishbone to the delight of the crowd the stadium was like a cauldron fen kept the primrose yellow sash and the right side she had to wait riding desdemona around and around while piero got his breath back number thirtyone said the collecting ring steward good luck said rupert handing her her hat at least we know youre not swollenheaded ignoring him fen rode into the ring where piero was sitting on the huge dark bay thoroughbred dante who had been purchased for millions of lira and who was hardly sweating how ever much she polished desdemonas coat shed never got her that shiny thought fen wistfully but the little mare stepped out proudly ears pricked and flickering at the cheers david and goliath thought billy as piero looked down at fen and smiled as he took off his hat to the judges fen bowed beside him then with a supremely latin gesture piero picked up fens hand and kissed it bella bella bella roared the crowd shes gone scarlet bless her said driffield fondly billy looked at him in amazement christ even driff was smitten piero and fen lined up desdemona snatching at her bit and casting disapproving glances at dante dont you dare cheat now the red flag dropped they were off come on angel cried fen as they threw themselves over the first three fences reaching the bend she saw a huge black shape already swinging around he was ahead of her go on des screamed fen bucketing over the fences like a runaway ferrari the crowd were going berserk piero piero piero the cry rose to a tremendous roar piero ahead by a fence looked round to make sure of his lead fen picked up her whip and gave desdemona a jockeys swipe down her steaming flank outraged the mare shot into overdrive at the same time the dark bay dante caught a pole with his off hind as it fell fen drew level she was over and clear shed made it desdemona livid at being whacked went into a succession of outraged bucks which nearly unseated fen im sorry angel she said pulling her up i neednt have done it but i darent risk it you are a total star she hoped the crowd werent going to lynch her for beating their hero but malises face told her everything youve broken your duck brilliantly ridden terrific said billy hugging her she went like a dream not bad for a beginner said rupert are we friends again no said fen and stalked off to warm macaulay up for the puissance that evening when she got back to the hotel fen rang jake i suppose youve won a class at last he said sourly or you wouldnt be ringing correct said fen i made such a cockup of things earlier in the week i didnt dare desdemona won the knockout i beat ludwig then piero in the final jake grunted hows macaulay wonderful actually ive got good news and bad news about him for christs sake hes all right isnt he well the bad news is i entered him in the puissance you what even at a thousand miles away she quailed but the good news is he won for two minutes jake called her every name under the sun then he asked how high did he jump fen giggled seven foot two easypeasy he could have gone higher and oh jake he was so delighted to be in the money again you know how he adores winning he bucked after every jump and insisted on doing two laps of honor and ate the presidents carnation but hes really well she added hastily i hosed down his legs myself and put on cooling liniment and ill walk him round in an hour or two but it really bucked him up how much have you won well i havent worked it out yet you know my maths about i should think but the best news is i won a little car as well so ill be able to whizz you around all over the place when you come out of hospital how are you anyway jake didnt want to talk about himself but she could tell by the sound of his voice how thrilled he was there was a drinks party at the british embassy that night and for once the team werent under malises everwatchful eye a complimentary ticket from the minister of the arts to hear placido domingo as otello at the teatro dellopera had been too much for him but hed had tough words with the team beforehand this is the first nations cup in the series if we win itll be a colossal boost to morale so theres to be no heavy drinking and i want everyone in their rooms by midnight youll be the only one completely sober he added to billy so im relying on you to look after fen and see shes in her own bed and not ruperts by eleven oclock billy shook his head if you honestly think rupertll take any notice of me rupert arrived at the party in a new suit pale blue and made for him by one of italys leading couturiers who normally only designed clothes for women but who had succumbed because he rightly felt rupert would be such a good advertisement for his product anyone else would have looked a raving poofter thought billy particularly wearing an amethystcolored shirt and tie but such was ruperts masculinity and the enhanced blueness of his eyes and the lean broadshouldered length of his body that the result was sensational all the girls at the party were certainly falling over themselves to offer him smoked salmon and asparagus rolls and fill up his glass with champagne theyre all convinced im an american tennis player he said fighting his way through the crowd to billy ive already been complimented three times on my back hand and my serve the only thing i want to serve here he said lowering his voice is fenella maxwell oh for christs sake snapped billy she wants it said rupert softly she was like a mare in season last night besides ive a score to settle with hopalong chastity poor sods in hospital with a smashed leg isnt that enough for you william hes tried to kill me twice once with a knife once with macaulay i intend to get my own back he glanced across the room to where fen was talking to the italian minister of the arts who was about three times her age she looked pale and tired look at her being letched over by that disgusting wop ill just make her jealous by chatting up those two girls over there and ive got her on a plate your conceit is unending christ i wish i could have a drink those two look as though they might have some dope at home come on the girls were certainly very pretty one blond one redheaded you must be tennis players giggled the redhead you look so incredibly healthy no said rupert unsmiling what do you do then i ride horses said rupert then after a pause extremely successfully the conversation moved on to marriage billy is separated and gloriously available said rupert i am married and ditto doesnt your wife mind no does she work for a living no nor does she smoke drink or fuck the girls laughed uproariously billy turned away outside it was dusk a stone nymph in an offtheshoulder dress reclined in the long grass set against a blackening yew tree fireflies flickered round a couple of orange trees in tubs water from a fountain tumbled down graygreen steps between banks of pale lilac geraniums i cant bear it he thought miserably and toyed with the idea of asking fen to come and have dinner with him alone she didnt look very happy particularly now the blonde was obviously getting off with rupert she and her friend were secretaries at the embassy the blonde was saying they loved the life in rome her redhead friend joined billy by the window im sorry about your marriage she said im separated myself no one who hasnt been through it knows how awful it is billy mistook the brimming tears of selfpity in her eyes for pity of his own plight when did you split up he asked six months ago she said and she was off fifteen minutes later they were interrupted by driffield looking like a thundercloud crippled lame he said in disgust horse cant put his foot down vets just had a look thinks its an abscess he grabbed a glass of champagne from a passing tray wheres malise gone to the opera bloody fairy my god said griselda joining them that means fen will have to jump thats all we need she jumped bloody well this afternoon said driffield id better go and tell her said billy but glancing across the room he saw shed disappeared he tried the other rooms fighting his way through the yelling crowd then he tried the garden hearing laughter from behind a rosebush fuck off said a voice as he peered around two elegant young men were locked in each others arms fens coat wasnt in the cloakroom yes said the attendant a girl in a pink dress and pink shoes had just left with the minister of the arts he assumed she was his daughter she isnt said billy bleakly lucky chap said the attendant billy returned to rupert and told him what had happened rupert whod already drunk a bottle and a half of champagne shrugged his shoulders oh well she wont come to any harm with him he looked past it anyway these ere he jerked his head in the direction of the two secretaries look very accommodating well all have dinner then go back to their place i dont want to protested billy i must find fen shell go back to the hotel early said rupert she heard malises pep talk she was as contrite as anything this morning at dinner the girls got sillier and sillier and billys despair deeper back at their flat he went to the bathroom to have a pee the spilt talcum powder the chaos of makeup the tights and pants dripping over the bath the trailing plant gasping for water and the halfdrunk gin and tonic reminded him poignantly of janey he longed to go back to the hotel the redhead was pretty but it was obvious she would much rather be in bed with rupert your friends a one isnt he on the walls of her room were posters of robert redford and sylvester stallone the bed was very narrow i dont usually do this on the first night she said slipping out of her pale yellow dress with a slither of silk her body wasnt as good stripped her breasts drooped like halffilled beanbags im awfully sorry billy said later looking down at his flaccid lifeless cock dont you find me attractive said the girl petulantly its because youre so beautiful youve completely overwhelmed me lied billy and ive got a big class tomorrow which never helps with his hands and his tongue he had given her pleasure but rejected by her husband she needed confirmation that men still found her irresistible billy could feel her being frightfully understanding but he could imagine the whispering round the embassy tomorrow my dear he couldnt get it up at all no wonder his wife walked out by a quarter to twelve rupert was ready to go home too wed love tickets for tomorrow said the blonde as they left you will ring wont you i nearly couldnt perform said rupert in the taxi she just lay back stark naked on the bed and said come on campbellblack lets see if youre as good as they all say you are must be hell to be impotent i hope to god fens back said billy but to his horror her key number eightyeight was still hanging at the reception desk jesus said rupert theres malise getting out of a cab go and tell him about driffield ill get the key and whizz up and wait in her room you join me when the coasts clear good opera billy asked malise magical said malise i cried nonstop through the last act he didnt even seem to notice that the hall clock said halfpast twelve first editions unfit said billy vet says its an abscess hell said malise fenll have to jump does she know we didnt tell her said billy in case we raised her hopes and you wanted driff to jump anaconda malise shook his head macaulays the better bet you saw fen safely into bed did you billy nodded blushing slightly must be asleep by now good man ill tell her in the morning with a growing sense of outrage billy and rupert sat in fens room rupert drinking weak brandies from fens untouched dutyfree bottle billy drinking one disgusting cup of black coffee from the sachets after another at threethirty they heard a commotion outside jai perdu mon clef key you know what st peter the one with the kissed foot had in abundance said a shrill voice so if youd be so very kind as to let me into my room in a flash rupert was at the door where he found fen and a sleepylooking maid in a dressing gown grazie he said to the maid and pulled fen inside what the bloody hell have you got to say for yourself fens hair was tousled her brown skin flushed her eyes glittered redirised and out of focus she was wearing an exquisite gray silk shirt which just covered her groin and carrying her pink dress she gave a low bow buona notte senors or should it be buon giorno i forget i sheem hic to have got myself into the wrong room she backed towards the door come here hissed rupert where the hell have you been do you really want to know ive been having fun when in rome get done by the romans she opened the door into the passage swinging on the handle rupert caught her by the scruff of the neck frogmarched her back into the room and sat her down on the bed then locking the door he pocketed the key now come on out with it fen looked at them owlishly ive been out with the minister of the arts such charm and such finesse he said i was a work of art myself and he bought me thish lovely shirt from pucci she stood up pirouetted round and collapsed onto the bed again and i regret to tell you i lost my virginity and its no point going to look for it at the loshed property offish its gone for good one should be in the hands of an eckshpert the first time dont you think i jumped seven foot two this afternoon so its but a tiny leap into your ancient fourposter mr minister i said billy felt a great sadness you little slut said

most immoral man ive ever met there was banging on the nextdoor wall someone shouted in german oh shut up said fen banging back again her eyes lit on the brandy i want another drink billy got to his feet youve had enough he said flatly come on get to bed ill help you undress fen swayed away from him no no i cant be undressed twice in an evening then she swayed back towards him darling willyum dont look so sad true love will suddenly come to you as it hash to me she stood on tiptoe trying to kiss him but the effort was too much for her she collapsed back on the bed and passed out its not funny said rupert i know it isnt said billy what the hell are you doing said rupert as billy started unbuttoning the shirt shame if she puked over her pucci said billy lovely body said rupert reminds me of saville minor i suppose we cant take advantage no we cant said billy tucking her into bed through nightmares of pain and torture was someone acupuncturing her brain with red hot pokers fen could hear bells they must be ambulance bells taking her to hospital to die but it was the telephone she reached out dropped it and picked it up morning fen sorry to wake you said a brisk voice have you had a good night yes she croaked congratulations anyway on your first cap driffields out youll be jumping today i what stammered fen in horror makes you speechless does it malise laughed see you down at the stables in about an hour then we can put macaulay over a few practice fences fen put the telephone down and groaned she got up rushed to the loo and was sick why doesnt someone turn down those bloody bells she croaked they cant be christians to make a din like that her breeches which shed taken to the launderette the previous day were still hanging over the balcony she winced with pain as she opened the shutters the sunlight hit her like a boxing glove she staggered back to the bed and picking up the telephone dialed billys number billy its fen i think get me an ambulance he laughed is it that bad ive never known pain like it ill be with you in a couple of minutes he found her white and shuddering here lies one whose name is writ in krug she moaned take me to the nearest pharmacy and tell me the italian for alkaseltzer ive got to jump billy more likely to jump over that balcony drink this its disgusting but it should help he handed her some fernet branca in a toothmug ugh it is disgusting im going to throw up no youre not keep your head up take deep breaths do you think theres any hope of the arena party going on strike said fen billy looked at the bruises on her thighs wondering if they were the result of amorous pinches from the minister of arts fen seemed to read his thoughts and blushed i got them falling off macaulay she was not helped by a sudden heatwave hitting rome as she tottered the course beside billy three hours later the temperature was in the nineties the sun seemed to be beating down only on her head there was no shade the colored poles danced before her eyes where did you go last night fen said griselda bullyingly as they examined a vast wall i dont remember the name but i had shellfish said fen faintly hum said griselda in disbelief this course is designed to make riders think every inch of the way said malise as they examined the huge water jump floating with water lilies known as the bidet its going to take very accurate jumping the stiles only four and a half strides before the combination macaulayll probably do it in four fen are you feeling all right fine said fen clinging onto the wing of the fence its just the heat poor kid suffers from nerves as badly as jake thought malise looking at her green face eight teams came out for the nations cup fen after the previous days triumph got a rousing cheer as she rode in the parade flanked by rupert and billy the playing of each national anthem seemed to go on forever its you not our gracious queen that needs saving today said rupert out of the corner of his mouth great britains fortunes were varied rupert jumped an effortless clear which brought more rousing cheers even from the most partisan crowd in europe waiting pouring with sweat teeth chattering wondering whether to be sick again fen felt too ill even to be pleased that griselda had nearly fallen off at the bidet and had notched up twelve faults she came out furiously tugging mr punchs head from side to side britain was in third place when fen went in go for a steady clear said malise id like to drop griseldas round fen felt like a christian after the roman emperor had made that terrible thumbsdown sign of death alone in the ring under those towering stands which had just become a sea of faces she could feel the lions stealthily padding towards her macaulay who always felt a great responsibility for the rider on his back understood that fen needed help watching his earnest white face appearing over each jump billy realized he was taking fen around he was about to take five strides after the stile then changed to four bouncing easily over the combination but causing fen to lose a stirrup slowing fractionally so she could find it again he rounded the corner for a minute fen looked perplexed then she turned him sharp right towards the huge yellow wall a million times afterwards she relived that moment she seemed to hear a shout from the collecting ring but it was too late gathering macaulay together she cleared the wall then looked around in bewilderment for the next jump in front a triple was facing backwards with a red flag on the left excited officials were waving their arms at her the crowd gave a groan of sympathy and suddenly it dawned on fen shed taken the wrong course head hanging fighting back the tears whitefaced she cantered out of the ring fucking imbecile said rupert youve ruined our chances said grisel her mouth full of hot dog fen slid off macaulay loosening his girths giving him his lemon sherbets whispering im sorry im sorry over and over again bad luck said sarah you were going so well malise came up i hope that wont happen in the second round he said bleakly i must not cry i must not cry said fen and fled to the loo where she was sick for the fifteenth time that day on her return she found everyone more cheerful particularly mr block billys sponsor whod flown out to watch the nations cup billy and bugle had gone clear bouncing over the fences like a jackinthebox at the end of the first leg the germans were in the lead the italians second and the english and the swiss tying for third place fen couldnt face the riders stand she sat on an upturned bucket under the thick canopy of an umbrella pine with her head in her hands macaulay led by sarah came up and nuzzled her poor old boy said fen listlessly its bloody hot macaulay looked longingly as an icecream seller came by oh get him one fen told sarah he deserves it at that moment rupert came up keeping his distance because macaulay promptly rolled his eyes and stamped his foot threateningly i hope youll know better in future than to get plastered and seduced by geriatric wops said rupert viciously already the sun was beginning to slant sideways through the pines throwing treacherous shadows across the fences particularly the parallel on his mettle rupert jumped just as brilliantly in the second round he was unlucky to hit the second pole of the parallel and notch up four faults he came out in a furious temper horse was going superbly but he simply couldnt see what he was jumping at the parallel im going to object nor did the germans or the italians fare any better the unaccustomed hot weather and the punishing course were tiring them all out griselda finished her second hot dog and rode off into the ring how the hell can she stuff herself like that before a class said fen her nerve ends are so coated with fat they dont function properly said sarah oh whizzo shes fallen in the bidet look at her covered in water lilies youre being very unpatriotic reproved billy she is on our side he put a hand on fens forehead are you feeling any better not after that frightful cockup he shrugged happen to anyone having fallen off griselda went on to notch up a further four faults just get around this time thats all that matters said malise as fen went in she had never felt so ill in her life keep the white flag on your left keep the white flag on your left she said to herself over and over again somehow she got over the first seven fences including the bogey parallel but as she approached the combination a child at the edge of the crowd let go of her gas balloon and with bellows of misery watched it float out like a spermatozoa just in front of macaulay for a second he glanced at it confused put in a short stride found himself under the fence and took a colossal cat jump which nearly unseated fen losing her reins but clutching onto his mane for grim death she managed to stay on as he cleared the second element but her foot went straight through the iron his last huge leap over the final element completely unseated her and she went crashing to the ground but with her foot trapped was dragged bumping horribly for several yards before macaulay realizing what had happened jammed on his brakes two officials ran up and disconnected her blood was pouring from her nose onto her white shirt tie and breeches staggering to her feet she looked dazedly round for macaulay i must get back on got to finish there he was looking apologetic and worried his white face seemed to come towards her and go away stumbling over to him she tried to clamber on but as he was it was like climbing the matterhorn give me a leg up she screamed to the steward ill run out of time the stewards in broken english told her she mustnt jump and looked desperately around for the firstaid man just as he came running on she somehow managed to get her foot in the stirrup and heaved herself up blood still streaming from her nose heedless to the cries to stop she turned to the last row of jumps get her out of the ring said billy as white as his shirt shell kill herself the crowds were screaming in horror fen had lost so much blood it seemed that she was dressed all in red somehow she cleared the next two fences she looked around bewildered and swaying there was only the oxer left fortunately macaulay took charge he could see the collecting ring and he wanted to get back there as soon as possible trotting briskly around the oxer with fen clinging round his neck he carried her carefully out of the ring malise billy and rupert rushed forward its only a nosebleed muttered fen into macaulays bloodsoaked mane you were right about there only being four and a half strides between the stile and the combination as they lifted her off she fainted get an ambulance said billy in anguish we must get her to hospital im going with her dont be so fucking silly said rupert and malise in unison youve still got to jump they decided to keep fen in hospital overnight after theyd cleaned her up it was found she was suffering only from a severe nosebleed and slight concussion later when billy turned up to visit her he found her in a clean white nightgown slumped in bed redeyed with her swollen face turned to the wall fen its me billy is macaulay all right blooming i saw he got his five lemon sherbets ive brought you these he held a bunch of yellow roses in front of her face thanks she hunched up her shoulders pulling the sheet up over her eyes billy put the roses in the washbasin and sat down on the bed how are you feeling she looked round her eyes swollen with crying her lips puffy and bruised where shed hit the ground her face covered in bruises terrible billy smiled you look as though youve just done ten rounds with henry cooper its very kind of you to come and see me but i want to be on my own just wanted to see if you were all right perfectly she snapped billy got to his feet as he reached the door she gave a strangled sob billy sat down again and took her in his arms im so ashamed she wailed burying her face in his shoulder such an awful thing to do but i was so fed up with being chaperoned and everyone treating me like a baby in fact a baby would have behaved with more responsibility getting eliminated twice in a nations cup ive let you all down macaulay jake malise all the team great britain fen billy stroked her hair can i tell you something no i want to talk i lied to you last night i was just boasting because i was drunk and fed up umberto thats the minister of the arts was awfully sweet but his boyfriend died two months ago and he misses him terribly all he wanted to do was to talk about him he did the talking i was listening and you tend to drink a lot when youre listening he didnt lay a finger on me except for kissing my hand but when i got back rupert was so bloody censorious just assuming id been behaving like a whore after all hed been up to and i was jealous of you chatting up that beastly redhead i just lost my temper but i promise i didnt sleep with him for a minute billy couldnt speak for relief so i dont want malise calling umberto out or anything hes hardly likely to after umberto gave him a ticket to hear placido domingo said billy dont make jokes sobbed fen its not funny so youre still intacta fen nodded dolefully not much else to boast about with cockups in every other direction except from umberto oh shut up sniffed fen suddenly she realized he was still wearing boots and breeches spattered with her blood hed taken off his white tie and exchanged his red coat for a darkblue jersey with a hole in the elbow but hed forgotten to take off his spurs you came straight from the show you shouldnt have bothered im sorry about your breeches fenella said billy gently if youd keep your trap shut for one second ive got something for you he put his hand in his pocket then dropped a red rosette and a little silver model of the shewolf suckling romulus and remus wwhats this we won but how could we griselda was on twelve and i was eliminated billy grinned the germans went to pieces and i jumped another clear fen opened her mouth and shut it again then she flung her arms round his neck but thats wonderful and with mr block watching oh im so so pleased malise is going round like the cheshire cat thats just wolfed the canary fen picked up the rosette is he still livid with me on the contrary he now thinks you were very brave to jump at all rupert told him youd swallowed a bad oyster last night and soldiered on because there wasnt anyone else to jump rupert did said fen incredulously that was extraordinarily kind of him billy laughed rupert loves winning so now malise thinks youve been very plucky i havent muttered fen ive been an idiot she looked at the rosette again it matched the spattered blood i had no part in getting this i dont deserve it you deserved the one at the beginning of the week which ludwig got so this one makes up for it but the tears were starting again angel please dont cry he pulled her into his arms again letting her tears drench his shirt he was so warm so comforting and rocklike she couldnt bear him to go a nun came in saying time was up and that fen ought to rest billy looked up duo momenti grazie he turned back to fen ill come and collect you tomorrow morning could you bring me some clothes to wear preferably a yashmak and tomorrow night ill take you out to dinner and treat you like a grownup it was a very pale subdued fen that came out of hospital next morning billy brought her some clothes but what hed thought in his haste was a dress turned out to be a cotton nightgown with the pink panther on the front her lips and nose were still swollen and blackened dont look at me im so ugly the nuns bundled her bloodstained clothes into a carrier bag i hope we dont get arrested said fen im afraid the taxis are on strike said billy putting his arm through hers so well have to bus back to the villa borghese ouch said fen as a passing italian pinched her bottom the bus came crashing along fighting for survival in the surging thrusting jam of cars its illegal to hoot in rome said fen bad luck for owls said billy as they fought and pummeled their way into the bus for at least ten seconds they were separated then billy fought his way back to her you okay i need a pencil sharpener for my elbows and ive been goosed by six men you mean geesed the bus doors closed shooting another ten people into the body of the bus and ramming fen against billy she arched away from him in embarrassment but it was no good the crowd pushed her forward again and she lost hold of the bus strap cannoning into his arms which closed round her im going to complain to sardines lib she mumbled in embarrassment im not said billy relax looking up fen saw the tenderness in his eyes and looked away quickly but once again there was something so comforting and solid about him that she let herself relax for the rest of the ride praying he couldnt feel her heart hammering he loves janey she told herself furiously hes just being kind the rest of the day seemed to pass in a dream everyone except griselda was incredibly nice to her malise let her jump desdemona in a small class to get her nerve back and was highly delighted when she came fourth with a sense of unreality she sat in the riders stand beside mr block to watch the grand prix which ended up with a jumpoff between piero rupert ludwig wishbone billy and griselda billy galvanized by the previous days double clear seemed to have got all his old fire and confidence back riding as if hed got a spare neck in his pocket he knocked three seconds off everyones time rupert was second why the hell did i bring you back when all you do is beat me grumbled rupert as they rode into the ring back at the stables everyone was beginning to pack up griselda watched georgie working and grumbled ive got a bloody trek home being misdirected by that stupid maxwell child lets hope malise has learnt his lesson and leaves her out of the team billy who was hosing down bugles legs looked up angrily shes already been selected for paris and lucerne oh christ dont say ive got to put up with her for the rest of the month i must get malise to make other traveling arrangements for her rupert who was feeding popcorn to snakepit looked across at billy and raised his eyebrows billy nodded he already has said rupert ive sold a couple of horses this week so were taking her back what about sarah said griselda in tones of outrage very pretty said rupert she can have my bed in the lorry any time as long as im allowed to share it with her griselda looked absolutely furious the sneaky little thing actually making other arrangements without telling me whos going to share the petrol and pay for the tolls on the autostrada trust her to pull a fast one without telling me she doesnt know shes coming with us yet said billy sweetly but knowing how much you and georgie like the lorry to yourselves i know she wouldnt like to cramp your style well on your heads be it if she misroutes you into romania said griselda crossly billy said goodbye to mr block who was flying back to london well done lad he said pumping billys hand im highly delighted with the way things have gone were on our way then billy found malise look i know i ought to foot the bill for dinner tonight and im very happy to and id really like to be with you all but i thought id take fen somewhere quiet he blushed i think she needs cheering up because he knew she was ashamed of her battered face billy took fen to a little dark cave of a restaurant where they sat in an alcove away from everyone else she was still feeling fragile so he ordered her a plain rice risotto with a knob of butter and parmesan and fed her spoonfuls as though she was a child im so proud of you she said for the hundredth time but this isnt much of a celebration for you with me off my food and both of us drinking coke billy put his hand over hers and it felt so right he left it there afterwards they wandered through the cobbled streets of rome past shadowy ruins and floodlit fountains until they found a secluded stone bench to sit on there billy kissed her very very gently on her poor sore mouth im so glad you didnt go to bed with that wop the other night he ran his hand down her cheek it was such a relief not to have to duck her head out of the way so he shouldnt feel her spots oh billy ive had a crush on you since i was thirteen on me he said amazed yes millions of girls have as well but youre too modest or too nice to realize it its the general consensus of opinion that ruperts for flings but youre the one they want to marry not that im proposing or anything she added blushing furiously billy kissed her again she was not quite sure what one did with ones tongue so she copied him youre so sweet he murmured but im too old and battered and bitter for you you dont need thirdhand goods rubbish protested fen what about antiques theyre thirdand fourthand fifthhand and theyre infinitely more precious than anything new they walked back to the hotel through the warm scented night fens espadrilles crunching on the gravel as he opened her bedroom door for her he said ill knock on your door in twenty minutes when the coasts clear frantically fen bathed and cleaned her teeth and sprayed on perfume despite the warmth of the night she couldnt stop shaking if only she had bigger boobs janey was so gloriously top heavy she looked at lester the teddy bear and turned his face to the wall i dont want you to be corrupted overwhelmed with shyness conscious of her swollen face she turned off the lights before she let billy into the room do you think well ever find the bed he said as he drew her frantically trembling towards him hey hey theres no need to be frightened thats what they always say about adders look i know im not as sophisticated or as beautiful or as witty or as clever or as sexy as janey anyone would be a letdown after her hush he said stroking the nape of her neck whos making comparisons i am because everyone you go to bed with must remind you of her and it must hurt billy found the bed and pulled fen down beside him its certainly not hurting at the moment youre the one it might hurt ive ridden for so long i dont think ive got a hymen anymore ive never been able to find it her little hands were tentatively moving over his chest still scared he whispered then when she didnt answer he kissed her upper lip ill take things very very slowly weve got all night he was thinking so much about not rushing her or scaring her that he hardly worried about his own performance but he felt an amazing happiness when her hands traveled cautiously down his stomach and she said oh feel isnt it lovely and so strong like the leaning tower of pisa is it nice if i run my fingers round the rim bliss mumbled billy and does that hurt if you stroke them gently like that its heaven she was so excited that neither of them ever discovered whether she had a hymen or not twined round him like a monkey riding him so lightly she exhorted him to please go on go on in the end he forgot to be gentle driving into her with all his strength oh it was magic magic she whispered afterwards are you sure are you really sure didnt hurt at all she said snuggling into his arms look said billy the british flag is creaking up the pole suddenly she heard him singing slightly shakily god save our gracious queen long live our noble queen until there was furious banging on the wall fen gave an ecstatic sigh billys singing again she thought to billy the following weeks came as a revelation while janey had exuded sex appeal he always had the feeling that although she enjoyed sex it was more for her own gratification and her own ego he was never irresistible to her with fen he felt he held the key to paradise she quivered with excitement whenever he touched her she wanted to touch him all the time she adored everything about him and everything he did to her was perfect she was the most unselfish person hed ever been to bed with always thinking of his pleasure before her own massaging his back when he was tired happy to stroke and caress him for hours they talked horses endlessly but unlike other riders she was prepared to spend hours discussing how his horses might be improved not permanently waiting to engineer the conversation on to her own having stabled macaulay and desdemona at fontainebleau they stayed an extra day there wandering through the forest and enjoying a magnificent french dinner in the evening to make up for not being able to eat anything except risotto in rome then they flew home to take laurel and hardy and a couple of billys new horses bought by mr block to windsor then on to paris barcelona and finally lucerne where at each place the british riders were invincible bugle was jumping brilliantly so were desdemona and macaulay it was also perfectly apparent to the rest of the team what was going on between fen and billy you pipped me to the post said rupert ruefully but he couldnt help being glad to see billy so happy malise turning a blind eye was delighted too he was very fond of billy and had hated to see him so down and lacking in confidence he was also thrilled by the success of the team billy and fen were obviously madly in love they were discreet in public but you only had to see the way he carried her cases for her and she turned to him for advice and how they drifted together and always seemed to be echoing each others thoughts and laughing at private jokes fen had cheered up the team too humpty had replaced griselda for lucerne and he and ivor and driffield were all mad about fen she was their team mascot and as a team they had never been more united they had not lost a nations cup this year fen lay in a bubble bath a champagne cork ricocheted off the steaming walls of the bathroom in their hotel at lucerne to your first grand prix said billy filling up a toothmug and handing it to her i cant drink the whole bottle protested fen as billy put down the loo seat and sat on it watching her whats the matter he said arent you glad youve beaten everyone it feels like the end of the holidays he came and knelt down beside her soaping her breasts and kissing her damp neck sweetheart its only the beginning we may be going home but ill be seeing you at crittleden next week and then at the royal and the royal international fen looked down the soap was beginning to disperse the bubbles i know but it wont be the same itll be even nicer i promise come on wed better buck up malise wants to leave to go out to dinner in twenty minutes she didnt tell him that that afternoon a telegram had arrived at the hotel for him from janey congratulating him on yet another double clear in the nations cup rupert had torn it up before billy saw it last thing he needs at the moment and dont you go telling him either hed said to fen she hadnt said anything but it terrified her throughout the past month fen and billy had avoided talking about janey she felt like a broken ankle that didnt hurt if you didnt walk on it as well as her grand prix money fen as leading lady rider of the show had won a fulllength fur coat she disapproved passionately of fur in principle but when billy had dried her after her bath she couldnt resist putting it on as a dressing gown feeling the silk lining caressing her hot naked body billy stopped in the middle of knotting his tie and came towards her god thats sexy just looking at you gives me a hardon he took her face between his hands she was so beautiful all the bruising and swelling had gone you dont realize what youve done to me he said given me back my faith in life i never believed i could wake up in the morning again with such a ridiculous sense of excitement fen parted the fur coat so she could feel his cock nudging against her belly button she laid her head against his chest im not saying this to make you feel old but ive never had a real father my own father died when i was eight but he divorced mummy long before that and colonel carter was a twerp and although jakes been wonderful hes not a cuddler too austere apart from dogs and horses and guinea pigs and hamsters youre not only the first father but the first thing ive ever been able to love looking down billy realized he must never never let her be hurt i know im carrycot snatching but i cant help it he muttered into her hair anxious to get back to tabitha rupert flew home to penscombe after the lucerne grand prix over a year old now tab could walk several steps but usually crawled forward with a curious sideways gait like a crab with one leg sticking out she was wearing blue pajamas the top had fallen off one shoulder she was so enchanted when he walked through the door she could hardly get a word out my darling angel said rupert extracting her from a swarm of excitedly barking dogs and holding her above his head until she crowed with laughter she was so pink and blond and beautiful daddys brought you lots and lots of presents the best present for tab was obviously seeing her father again she snuggled up to him like a kitten helen came into the hall warily holding marcus by the hand hello darling she said kissing him had a good trip great we won the nations cup and billys really back on form christ hes jumping well im so glad not back on the booze is he no no hes utterly bombed on perrier and love love said helen surprised little fenella maxwell best thing that ever happened to him but shes not eighteen yet just a child sos he she mothers him like an old mare theyre really sweet together and at last hes got someone who can talk to him about horses unlike me thought helen bitterly im having lunch with janey tomorrow she said after the four hundredmile drive from lucerne billy and fen stayed near the coast and took a lunchtime ferry the next day the grooms had lunch billy booked a berth for three hours and took fen to bed dreading the separation ahead as much as she was they reached gloucestershire about sunset it was one of those magical evenings when they had both the lorry windows open and the air was heavy with the scent of elderflowers and wild roses fen sat glued against billy hand on his thigh any pretense that they werent having an affair abandoned it was only ten miles to penscombe now once there she would borrow one of ruperts trailers and drive macaulay and desdemona on to the mill house arriving about midnight tracey was fast asleep on one of the bunk beds sarah was emptying out the fridge billy and ruperts horses were beginning to stamp and whinney as they recognized the familiar scents of home will you do me a great favor said billy staring fixedly at the road ahead she could feel how tense he was of course will you stay the night with me at the cottage then ill drive you back in the morning fen was almost speechless with happiness billy needed her he really needed her she reached up and kissed his cheek i was wondering how on earth i was going to drag myself away from you this evening i rang mrs bodkin from lucerne and told her to clean the place up and make the bed im a big boy now i cant go on living with helen and rupert forever and anyway he looked at his watch i havent fucked you for at least seven hours will you mind a few of janeys things lying around not if you dont said fen she rang tory from ruperts tackroom ive got as far as ruperts im utterly jiggered helens asked me to stay the night do you mind awfully billy or someone will drive me back in the morning ill be punished for lies like that she said to herself as she put down the receiver it was dusk by the time theyd settled the horses all that was left of the day was a saffron glow on the horizon billy who knew the path along the edge of the woods led the way holding her hand with mavis racing in front chasing rabbits he longed to kiss her but both were conscious of not having cleaned their teeth since morning the night was so warm they could smell the honeysuckle and syringa a hundred yards away what an adorable place said fen in ecstasy gosh youre lucky to live here in the gateway billy put his arms round her holding her like a balloon that might float away at any moment its all right she said softly im here to look after you as he opened the front door mavis shot ahead squeaking with excitement he turned on the light and went into the kitchen dumping the cases fen followed him it looks lovely she said mrs bs been working fantastically hard said billy christ i wish we could have a drink ill make some coffee said fen picking up the kettle are you hungry she shook her head then lets go to bed i need to lay you and the ghost fen went into the hall behind the door opposite she could hear excited squeaking and scrabbling mavis must have shut herself in she opened the door and switched on the light then gave a gasp of horror in front of the fire thin beautiful and menacing in a black sleeveless tshirt and the tightest black leather trousers stood janey hello fen she said with a twisted smile its been amazingly kind of you to look after billy in my absence but id like him back now fen gave a sob and turned on her heel bumping into billy as he came out of the kitchen you look as though youve seen a ghost no ive seen a real live person go into the drawing room and see as she fled down the garden path she heard billy calling her to come back but she kept on running along the woodland path once she stumbled and fell over cutting her hands but not even feeling the pain she didnt stop until she reached ruperts front door it was open the dogs surged forward barking rupert came out of the kitchen a large whisky in one hand a letter in the other hello duck had a tiff then he saw her dirty grazed hands and her stricken face angel whats the matter its jjaney she was waiting for us at the cottage fucking hell how did she get in he led fen into the kitchen and poured her a large drink i dont want anything her face crumpled oh sweetheart im sorry he wont take her back he will i know he will he only had me as a stopgap rubbish ive never seen him happier i cant bear it i simply cant bear it helen whod been tucking the children up heard the commotion and came downstairs walking into the kitchen she found a blond in ruperts arms oh i do beg your pardon she said with heavy sarcasm i didnt mean to interrupt dont be stupid its fen that bitch janeys come back fen turned to helen im so sorry to bother you she sobbed but i didnt know where else to go the telephone rang still with one arm round fen rupert picked it up yes shes here well not brilliant what the fucks going on good see you hes coming over he said replacing the receiver now dry your eyes and have that drink billy was over in ten minutes rupert left them alone fen looked up her eyes spilling over with tears oh billy darling fen he drew her towards him i never dreamed in a million years shed come back you must talk it over with her shes still your wife i dont know if i want her back im so much better without her theres something you should know janey sent you two telegrams one in paris and one in lucerne rupert tore them up billy digested this then he said bitterly that was only when i started winning again janey likes hitching her wagon to a star whether shell be so amused by a star on the wagon i doubt his hold tightened on her ill go back and have it out with her will you stay here rupertll look after you and ill come and see you in the morning i just want you to know youre the sweetest thing ive ever been lucky enough to meet in my life meanwhile rupert had gone onto the terrace and had found helen watching the stars come out the faint reflection of the halfmoon mingling with the water lilies strewn across the lake how the hell did janey know billy was coming home tonight well i may have told her i dont think i did i had lunch with her yesterday she was wearing billys old harrovian tie i certainly told her billy was real happy with fen rupert turned on her in fury you did what well she was so worried she said it was so much on her conscience billy being on his own and drinking and doing so badly she knew bloody well he was doing well she sent him telegrams then she looked really sad and said she did hope some day hed find someone nice so i told her about fen she was fishing you stupid bitch rupert please dont talk to me like that youve only done billy the worst turn ever hed just struggled out of the quicksand now youve pushed him back again at that moment billy came out on the terrace will you look after her you should be doing that snapped rupert and kicking out that slut rupert stayed up half the night talking to fen who was almost crazy with grief im sorry to be so boring but i love him so so much i saw her i know she wants to come back and shes so winning and billys too straight not to let her its funny i wanted to fall in love so badly but i never dreamed it would hurt so much lifes not like the pulleinthompson novels is it they always have happy endings helen couldnt sleep why did rupert always have more time for other people fen billy tab than he did for her on the other hand she knew she was being punished dear god she prayed what have i done i told janey about fen not because i wanted to reassure her but because i wanted to put her down next day the rain came stripping off the last pastel frivolity of the blossom segregating the fluffy white heads of the dandelion clocks bowing down the cow parsley muffling the cuckoo and turning every showground into a quagmire to fen it seemed she was permanently soaked to the skin always cold shivering with misery particularly at night without billy to love and warm her lester the teddy bear was reinstated and soaked with tears like her pillow as night after night she cried herself to sleep by day work was the only anodyne she begged malise to excuse her from the huge nineday show at aachen on the grounds that billy would be in the team probably with janey in tow instead malise left billy out giving him a few weeks sabbatical to sort out his marriage billy after all had turned professional and was no longer eligible for los angeles and malise was determined to get his olympic squad into shape in plenty of time on present form fen rupert and ivor braine were certain to be part of the team the fourth place he still hoped to keep open for jake provided his leg mended in time fen tried to hide her heartbreak from jake when she visited him in hospital on her return from lucerne look what we won she said brightly tossing a carrier bag full of rosettes onto the white counterpane jake took one look at her face who is it that bastard campbellblack i said it would happen ill bloody kill malise when i see him fen went over to the window fighting back the tears it wasnt rupert at all it was billy billy for a moment jake was dumbfounded what happened youre not no nothing like that janey came back christ i suppose the bitch found out he was going well and didnt want to miss out something like that jake loved fen but so angry was he with billy and janey and so horrified to see fens haggard face that he took it out on her he hated himself he wished he had words to comfort her but he just wanted to hit out at a world that seemed so manifestly unfair to both of them fen let him rage until hed run out of reproof and expletives then collapsed sobbing on the bed i couldnt help it jake i didnt mean to fall in love jake patted her shoulder sorry i came on so strong i just hate you being hurt should never have let you go havent you ever been in love or hurt by a woman never by a woman not since his mother had committed suicide anyway not even tory tory couldnt hurt a fly button gradually the rosette board filled up the kitchen as one show followed another aachen calgary wolfsburg funnily enough it was rupert who saved her in those first weeks in the evenings abroad he wouldnt let her slink back to the lorry to cry her eyes out but dragged her out to dinner with the team in his mind she was part of billy and therefore to be protected cherished and occasionally bullied he had never really had a woman friend before women in his book were to be pursued screwed and discarded repeatedly he was on the brink of taking her to bed because he wanted to and he thought it might blot out the pain then some rare altruism stopped him fen was confused accustomed to hate rupert she now discovered in him an unexpected gentleness particularly in the way he talked about tabitha billy tackled rupert the moment he came back to england hows fen was his first question i took her out to dinner last night with the team no by myself what the bloody hell for she needed cheering up what form did the cheering up take horizontal she wanted to talk shes still mad about you oh god said billy trying not to feel pleased but the only way out of this stupid impasse is for her to find someone else billy was appalled how much the thought upset him but he said you may be right damn sure im right particularly if you persist in this bloodyfool belief that janeys the best thing for you billy wasnt sure the night hed got back to the cottage and found janey there they had screwed all night blotting out all feelings of guilt and remorse next day hed insisted on driving fen white silent stunned back to the mill house feeling her almost disintegrating in his arms as he said goodbye to her saying hed always adore her which was a different word than love when he got back janeyd been through his wallet and found fens photo and was in hysterics billy tried to reason with her i never looked at another woman the entire time we were married then you file for divorce i was trying to get over you why didnt you come round and murder kev im not like that i missed the only time i took a slug at him was she better in bed than me she was different said billy tactfully did you screw her in our bed billy shook his head but you were coming back to look youd have thought i was a frightful drip if i hadnt billy had changed thought janey the drink blotches the red face the sour whisky breath had gone he was brown lean well muscled tougher more irritable but infinitely more attractive you mustnt see her anymore said janey pouring herself another glass of vodka hardly graced by tonic how can i not see her were in the same team if i worked in an office or was an engineer or an architect i could try and find another job in another part of the country but show jumpings the only thing i can do i was totally impotent after you left me she picked me up from the gutter she gave me back my confidence my nerve my sexuality ive won in the last month what dyou want me to do ask her to move in im just trying to say it isnt as simple as that you cant just waltz out of my life for nearly a year and expect things to be exactly the same ive finished my book said janey and ive been offered for the serial rights and my publisher has commissioned another book so you wont have to struggle quite so hard darling shes not listening thought billy in despair she never listens except when shes on to a good story hysterical scenes followed janey steamed open letters counted the kleenexperhaps shes used oneexamined the hairs in the bath thats thicker and curlier than mine thats pubic hair for christs sake said billy janeys attitude was totally irrational on endless occasions she had deceived him betrayed him made a fool of him but it was part of her abyss of insecurity that she simply couldnt believe that he wasnt sloping off to see fen when he got the chance nor was it just her insane jealousy of fen she was paranoid about the rest of the world what did billys mother helen rupert malise think about her behavior janey liked a place in the sun and a lot of spade work would be required to win back these peoples approval everyone was laying bets that the reconciliation wouldnt last fen didnt see billy again until the crittleden meeting at the end of july rupert had warned her that janey was coming so in order to upset herself as little as possible fen arrived only just in time to walk the course for the big event the crittleden gold cup worth to the winner she found the showground in an uproar always with an eye to publicity steve sullivan who owned crittleden had introduced a new fence which all the riders considered unjumpable called the moat it consisted of two grassy banks the horses were expected to clamber up the first bank along the top and halfway down the other side where they were expected to pop across a ditch three foot deep on to the second bank which they again had to scale ride along the top and down the other side here they had to jump a small threefoot rail a couple of strides away worried that all the show jumpers might load their horses up into their lorries and drive ten miles down the road to pripley green where there was another big show taking place steve sullivan had only put up details of the gold cup course an hour before the competition when the riders saw the moat was included all hell broke loose im not jumping that said rupert nor am i said billy if they jump the moat theyll bank the other fences said ivor braine remember the bank at lucerne said humpty they had an oxer immediately afterwards all the horses treated the oxer like a bank and fell through one of the dutch horses had to be shot im not risking saddleback sam that ditch is three foot deep said billy if a horse falls in itll put him off jumping water for life its a very gentle slope down protested steve sullivan its not slippery theyll jump it easily wont they wishbone he added appealing to the irishman sure i cant see the thing giving much trouble said wishbone there said steve i took my old mare across it the other night she jumped it without turning a hair shes due to be turned into cat food at any minute snapped rupert doesnt matter if she breaks a leg these are topclass horses im not risking for a bloody moat he went off and complained to malise who came and examined the course seems perfectly jumpable to me an acceptable hunting fence these arent hunters said rupert billy conferred with mr block i havent spent eight months getting bugle right to have him smash himself up in one afternoon dyou mind if i pull him out do what you think best lad said mr block dont like the look of it myself first hossll be all right but once the turf gets cut up itll be like a greased slide in the playground steve sullivans sponsors fuma the tobacco giants however had put a lot of money into the competition and wanted a contest the telephones were jangling in the main stand steve suggested putting up a big wall which the riders could jump instead as an alternative to the moat not a fair contest said rupert walls arent the same as banks handing it on a plate to a little horse said humpty little horses only need two strides between the bottom of the bank and the rail count guy declared the moat vraiment dangereuse ludwig agreed it ees your eenglish obsession with class haffing a moat steve where is zee castle zee elephant and zee vildlife safari park steve sullivan was sweating hed never faced a mutiny before the riders were all standing grimly on the bank hands on their hips fen meanwhile had been quietly walking the rest of the course it was a matt still day overcast but muggy the grass very green from the recent storms midges danced in front of her eyes finally she reached the moat and stood banging her whip against her boots looking at them in disapproval hat pulled down over her nose all those grown men including griselda making such a fuss she thought it was a tabby cats indignation meeting rupert walked up and kissed her hi angel youve arrived just in time to join the picket line were going to give steve his comeuppance at that moment a television minion wearing a white peaked cap and tight pink trousers rushed up boys boys we simply must get started he cried leaping to avoid a large pile of mud motor racings finished and so has the ladies singles and theyre coming over to us at any minute go back to your toadstool you big fairy said rupert but a very rich fairy you butch thing giggled the minion are you going to jump thats what we need to know the riders went into a huddle fen stood slightly apart she had caught sight of billy for a second they gazed at each other he noticed how thin shed got her breeches far too large her tshirt falling almost straight down from collarbone to waist fen moved quickly away stumbling into a fence sending the wing flying as she picked herself up she heard rupert say to the bbc man okay youre on well all jump fen fled back to the collecting ring under the oak trees where she found desdemona being walked round by sarah whats happening she asked bloody storm in a challenge cup said fen were all going to jump but from the nasty gleam in ruperts eye i know hes up to something youd better ring jake no hes bound to tell me not to jump the crowd seethed with rumor and counterrumor they had seen the riders gathered round the moat this was about the most testing competition of the year many of them had traveled miles to watch it the arena nearly boiled over with excitement and a huge cheer went up as rupert the first rider came in theatrically with much flourishing he took off his hat to the judges and cantered the foaming plunging sweating snakepit around and around waiting for the bell which was waiting for the goahead from the television cameras he was off bucketing over the emerald green grass jumping superbly clearing every fence until he came to the moat hell show them how to do it said colonel roxborough i think not said malise bleakly the entire riders stand rose to their feet holding their breaths as rupert cantered up to the huge bank then at the last moment practically pulled snakepits teeth out and cantered around it ignoring the shouts of wrong way and cantering slowly out of the ring there were thirtyfive horses entered for the class the next twenty riders deliberately missed out the moat or retired before they reached it for the first few rounds the crowd scratched their heads in bewilderment then as they realized they were witnessing a strike the deliberate sabotaging of a class the bewilderment turned to rage and they started to catcall boo and slowhand clap in the chairmans box with its red carpet and sanderson wallpaper steve sullivan was having a seizure bastards bastards all led by the nose by that fucker campbellblack malise watched the spectacle with the utmost distaste behaving like a bunch of dockers and carworkers said colonel roxborough apoplectically slowly eating his way through a bunch of grapes in a nearby lalique bowl most jump jockeys would like bechers out of the national they dont go on strike cant you put the screws on billy mr block pleaded steve i troost billys joodgement when it comes to hosses said mr block therell be another class next week malise went down to the collecting ring billy having followed the other riders example had just come out of the ring to loud booing from the crowd he avoided malises eye only driffield ivor and fen of the british riders were left to jump youre making complete idiots of the judges and the crowd said malise furiously to the british squad if you dont like the course dont jump it but dont resort to these gutter tactics dyou want to kill the sport stone dead with at stake driffield was sorely tempted but then count guy and ludwig both went in and retired and who was he to argue with the experts dudley diplock was in despair in the bbc commentary box telephones were ringing on all sides cant we go back to tennis he pleaded into one receiver or motor racing or cricket there must be a county match somewhere another telephone rang you sit tight dudders said the sports editor its a bloody good story the news desk have been on to say be sure to interview campbellblack afterwards he seems to be the ringleader driffield retired your turn now darling said rupert to fen jump as far as the bank dont worry about the crowd only italians throw bottles and then retire the bsja cant suspend all of us jake lay in his hospital bed waiting for a telephone call he had checked with the switchboard five times the telephonist was a friend of his they had given him a direct line but no call had come through he was livid with fen perhaps shed seen billy hed caught a glimpse of him walking the course and been too distracted to ring and now she was obviously going to join the strike organized by rupert the moat looked very dangerous hed be furious if she did jump furious if she didnt he got the lucozade bottle off the bedside cupboard and poured himself a large whisky into a paper cup the nurses gathered round the bed weve just heard on the radio that theyre all on strike poor old dudley said jake and couldnt help laughing even though matron had just walked into the room well this is simply the blackest most extraordinary day in show jumping said dudley desperately and here comes little fiona i mean fenella maxwell on esmeralda i mean desdemona a really super little mare whos been jumping brilliantly all summer i wonder if shes going to strike like the other riders the crowd were in an uproar booing yelling screaming jump jump jump they yelled stamping their feet in the stands and slowhand clapping all this must be upsetting to any horse particularly a young horse like esmeralda now whats fiona going to do said dudley fen raised her whip to the judge then took one look at the mass of jeering yelling faces the next minute a beer can landed at desdemonas feet if youd stop making this ghastly din she screamed at the faces id like to try and jump this course only a handful of spectators heard her the rest thought she was hurling abuse and stepped up the catcalling another beer can landed at desdemonas feet fen turned shaking her fist is she going to be all right said billy in anguish im sure shes tough enough to cope said janey shooting him a furious glance fen could hardly hear the bell fueled by rage stroking desdemonas neck she set off over the wall over the oxer over the parallels over the rustic poles over the road jump just avoiding two more beer cans then over the gate she rounded the corner away from the collecting ring riding towards the moat but instead of circling it like the other riders she dug her heels in desdemona bounded up the grassy hillock the first thing the riders saw were her roan ears then her face and her forelegs arriving on the top bloody hell snarled rupert traitor thundered griselda blackleg said driffield scab said humpty shell get the said driffield in anguish shes not over yet said billy stupid exhibitionist said janey serve her right if she kills herself as fen reached the top the crowd went silent as if a radio had suddenly been switched off as the little mare trotted along the top picked her way fastidiously down the other side and paused above the water fen allowed her to have a good look constitutes a stop said griselda didnt take a step back said billy as desdemona bounded gaily across to the other bank slightly unseating fen who had to cling onto her mane as she scrambled up and over the other bank by some miracle she came down the other side collected and popped easily over the rail for a second the crowd were totally silent then they let out a huge heartwarming cheer bloody marvelous said billy oh well done pet rupert and janey turned on him in unison whose side are you on the side of guts and great horsemanship said billy sulkily you little beauty whispered steve sullivan the colonel ate the last black grape pips and all that girl will go to los angeles or ill have something to say about it i agree said malise seuper absolutely seuper shouted dudley from the commentary box oh well done felicity brilliantly ridden jake suddenly found he was clinging onto matrons hand as with a huge roar that grew to a crescendo the crowd cheered desdemona home in a businesslike manner she cleared the rest of the jumps what a fuss about nothing she seemed to be saying and cantered out of the ring with a buck and a whisk of her tail jake turned to matron grinning from ear to ear christ did you see that have a drink you know youre not allowed alcohol in hospital mr lovell to hell with that said jake reaching for another paper cup with a shaking hand and pouring the remains of the whisky into it oh well cheers said matron tapping her cup against his no one speak to her ordered rupert send her to coventry said janey as fen came out a crowd noticeably short of other riders swarmed round her desdemona disappeared under a deluge of patting hands sarah fought her way towards them oh des oh fen oh well done i was so scared she wiped away the tears no one will ever speak to us again fen looked up at the riders stand and saw the rows of stormy faces looking down at her picket line looks fairly grim said fen flippantly coventry here we come but her heart sank bloody hell said billy getting to his feet dont be so petty sit down thundered rupert dont you dare speak to her squealed janey furiously ignoring the cries of protest billy walked down the stone steps vaulted over the collecting ring rail and fought his way to fens side well done beauty showed us all up fen started turned pale gazing down at his dear familiar face with the turneddown smiling eyes and the sun catching the graying hair never had the temptation been so strong to jump off desdemona and collapse into his arms oh billy she croaked i miss you he didnt have time to answer dudley diplock came rushing up brandishing a microphone the crowd separated to let him pass deferring to television then gathering behind him waving at the cameras trying to get in shot journalists crowded around good on you fen another huge cheer came from the ring fen swung round in the saddle wishbone had jumped the bank but had the stile down fen was still in the lead ivor was about to go in if you can jump it fen he said adoringly reckon i can have a go after that the rest of the riders jumped the moat without mishap hans schmidt jumped clear on his new horse papa haydn and in the jumpoff was a tenth of a second faster than fen but although he got the and the cup he removed the oakleaf wreath of victory from papa haydn and put it round desdemonas neck the crowd roared their approval i take zee money he said kissing fen but you take zee laurels she was cheered around two laps of honor dudley collared her again what made you jump it despite the other riders fen grinned i dont like a lot of men telling me what to do i think they behaved like a load of drips fighting talk said dudley youre not worried youve made yourself very unpopular fen shrugged they could have jumped it if theyd wanted to jake told you to have a go did he i didnt ring him confessed fen i was terrified hed tell me not to sorry jake she said into the camera im sure you all know said dudley that fionas brotherinlaw world champion jake lovell is in hospital recovering from a nasty broken arm leg said fen gently leg and we all wish you better jake and hope to see you back soon this must be the best possible pickmeup that deserves another drink said matron we seem to have exhausted your whisky mr lovell i think ive got a drop of brandy in my office janey had been drinking all day and when she and billy got back to the lorry she headed straight for the vodka bottle why the hell did you insist on rushing up and congratulating her in front of all the press and television cameras she asked what will people think said billy trying to make a joke theyll think youre still having it off with her they will if you go on yelling like this i suppose you were making a date with her in that brief poignant moment i was not or saying how much you missed her i merely told her she jumped well she deserved it i hate packs ganging up because they havent got enough guts to savage someone on their own i did it many years ago to jake and ive been bitterly ashamed of it ever since and im not going to do it again i suppose you fancied her like mad when you saw her he looked at her face red shouting and featureless with rage oh for christs sake he snapped you buggered off for nearly a year i knew it wouldnt be long before you threw that in my face again im not said billy wearily but if i can forget about kev why cant you forget about fen i left kev because it was over because i was bored with him you were in full flood with fen how do i know its over that you dont lie beside me at night hankering for her boys body billy filled up the kettle from the tap and turned on the gas he was so slow lighting a match that he nearly blew his eyelashes off even the gas ring was against him he was tired he was hungry he longed for a drink he was depressed by the knowledge that bugle could have jumped the moat and hed have been fifteen grand richer none of this would matter if janey would meet him one tenth of the way how do i know its all over between you and fen she burst into noisy sobs billy went over and hugged her youll have to trust me its you i love always have loved i shacked up with fen because i was dying of loneliness and you wont help either of us by regurgitating her memory every five minutes i know sobbed janey i dont know why you put up with me a new syndrome which billy imagined janeyd picked up from kev was the mood of sweetness and light followed by heavy drinking followed by the hurling of abuse and china followed by flagellating herself into a frenzy of selfabasement billy found it exhausting hed had a shattering year he sometimes wondered if his shoulders were broad enough to carry both their problems holding her heaving tearful fullblown body breathing in the vodka fumes billy looked out of the window at the crittleden oaks tall against a drained blue sky and was suddenly overwhelmed with longing for fen for her merriness innocence and kindness shed looked so adorable flushed and defiant with her wary greenyblue kitten eyes waiting for the other riders to turn on her the whistling of the kettle made them both jump how many miles to coventry sighed fen threescore miles and ten will i get there by candlelight yes but dont come back again it was the last night of the threeday east yorkshire show fen lay in bed with lester the teddy bear slumped beside her listening to the rain irritably drumming on the roof of the lorry sleep had evaded her again and even the new dick francis had failed to distract her she put it down and reached for her diary with the tattered photograph of billy tucked in between september and october he was laughing his eyes screwed up against the lucerne sun next week was wembley it had been a desperate six weeks for fen after crittleden as good as their word the british riders had sent her to coventry at every show she attended people whod been her friends cut her dead or deliberately turned their backs she knew rupert was behind it hed gone out of his way to be kind to her after shed split up with billy and shed defied him publicly and humiliatingly which had been a terrible blow to his ego as the majority of riders were either frightened of rupert or jealous of fens meteoric rise they were only too happy to follow his lead things were not all campbellblack however jakes leg was mending at last he was expected to be out of hospital soon after wembley and riding again by the spring and if the crittleden victory had enraged the riders it had enchanted the public news of the victimization had reached the press who were all on fens side overnight the telephone started ringing with newspapers magazines and television companies clamoring for interviews invitations flooded in for her to speak at dinners open supermarkets address pony clubs donate various items of her clothing to raise money at charity auctions everywhere she was mobbed by autograph hunters her post was full of fan mail from admiring men and little girls who wanted signed photographs or help with their ponies for a public hungry for new idols fen fitted the bill perfectly with her slender androgynous figure with its suggestion of anorexia jagged cabinboy hair and gamin wistful extraordinarily photogenic face she was a true child of her time just as the public was drawn to jake because he was mysteriously enigmatic they loved fen because she couldnt hide her feelings she was either furious or suicidal or ecstatic and her naturally friendly nature endeared her to everyone fen was flattered by the fame and adulation but all her energies were centered on the horses all she cared about was billy the horses were going superbly except for hardy who was growing more ungovernable he was too strong and fly and ever since hed run away with her at the royal and lancaster early in the month jumping right over two rows of girl guides sitting quietly by the ringside fen had been frightened of him and he knew it if he got any worse hed be a serious danger to jake when he started riding again the horses occupied her more than full time and it was only on the endless drives or when she fell into bed usually long after midnight that she allowed herself to think of billy rumors filtered through on the groom grapevine that all was not well in the lloydfoxe household tracey told dizzy who told sarah who told fen of endless rows into the night of janey opening billys suitcase on the motorway and throwing all his clothes out of the window because she thought he was driving too fast of janey storming out of a bsja party because she heard fen was coming of billy looking white and strained and uncharacteristically snapping at the grooms so fen lived on the crumbs of hope she knew billy would make every effort to save his marriage but she couldnt help counting the days to wembley in october when they would all be under the same roof for a week the following evening a very tired billy arrived home from the lisbon show it was the first show to which janey had not accompanied him since they got back together she had stayed at home to write a piece on international polo players at first billy found it a relief to be away from the rows and hysterics but it was not long before the old demons started nagging him he had forgiven janey totally for going off with kev but he couldnt stop the sick churning fear which overtook him when he rang home and she wasnt there he hated the idea of her being closeted with handsome polo players he remembered how shed first interviewed him he could hear her now in the last chukka how amazing you are brilliant and what amazing right arm muscles let me feel them you have to be so brave to play polo he and rupert had reached penscombe as a great red september sun was falling into the beech wood the trees had hardly started to turn but there was already a ring of lemonyellow leaves round the mulberry tree in the center of the yard and a wet leaf smell of autumn in the air having supervised the unloading and settlingdown of his horses billy decided to walk the halfmile home through the dusk he needed a few minutes to prepare himself for janey what sort of mood would she be in would she have missed him would she have ransacked his drawers frenziedly searching for evidence he dreaded wembley because fens presence would trigger off more abuse dew was already whitening the grass the blue smoke from a hundred bonfires was blending with the damp vapors rising from the stream at the bottom of the valley a blackbird was scolding as he approached the cottage the golden dahlias in the front garden were already losing their color in the fading light the sick feeling of menace overwhelmed him once more there were no lights on in the cottage oh god where was she she knew he was coming home this evening he broke into a run slipping on the wet leaves and the mud he banged the gate noisily behind him that should give the polo player a chance to leap for his breeches he mustnt think that next moment mavis hurtled down the path greeting him in ecstasy the front door was open janey must have gone out in a hurry despairingly he dropped his case on the yellow flagstones in the hall so he had two hands free to stroke maviss joyful wriggling body billy darling is that you called janey overwhelmed with relief he could only croak out yes im in the drawing room he found her sitting at her typewriter wearing only his sleeveless husky and a pair of scarlet pants i thought you werent here he muttered she got to her feet and ran to him oh darling im sorry the piece was going so well i couldnt be bothered to put the light on youll ruin your eyes said billy sorry to interrupt why dont you keep on working course not now youre back how dyou get on billy unzipped the holdall produced a handful of rosettes and chucked them down on the table brilliant said janey sorting them out two firsts three seconds a third a fourth and two fifths the first was the grand prix and theres lots of loot a lovely kitchen clock and a television set and a very obscene china bull with a huge cock i left it at ruperts ill bring it down in the morning watching her poring over the rosettes her breasts falling forward strands of bush escaping from the red satin pants billy felt his own cock rising and wished he didnt always want her so much sex had not been brilliant lately because janey had so often fallen asleep drunk but if they could avoid a row before they went to bed he might get to screw her tonight janey looked up misconstruing the expression on his face sorry i look so awful but i took mavis for a walk in the woods at lunchtime and my trousers got drenched so i took them off and couldnt be bothered to find any more you look lovely ive been a good little wife janey went on theres a casserole bubbling in the oven ive ironed all your shirts not very brilliantly im afraid some of the collars curl worse than maviss tail and ive got your dinner jacket back from the cleaners billy was pleased she was in high spirits then he felt a lurch of fear the last time hed seen her in this manic mood floatingonair that innerdirected radiance that had nothing to do with him coming home was when she was starting her affair with kev he desperately wanted a huge drink to blot out the terrors janey read his thoughts lets have a drink he followed her into the kitchen which looked amazingly tidy janey got down two glasses and instead of reaching for the vodka for herself got a carton of orange juice out of the fridge filling the glasses she handed one to him arent you drinking vodka nope ive got something to celebrate youve sold the book in america nope im coming off the booze for a few months she chinked her glass against his there was no mistaking the sparkle in her eyes billy couldnt bear to look at her anymore he went to the dresser and started flipping through his pile of mail seven and a half months in fact said janey what thats the time im giving up booze for whatever for said billy wearily im going to have a baby billy dropped the pile of letters your baby said she softly our baby how dyou know he muttered there had been so many false alarms james benson confirmed it today is he sure absolutely billy turned incredulously then she ran to him flinging her arms round him burying her face in his shoulder oh christ he said how wonderful oh christ how wonderful where can i hug you that i wont hurt it anywhere you like its only six weeks old why didnt you tell me you were going to benson i didnt want you to get too excited i told myself if i could manage to keep my trap shut until id had the test itd be all right its like you not drinking until all the bills are paid off they are now lisbon wiped out the lot oh angel im so happy are you sure she said in an uncertain voice you dont ffeel she stumbled over the word ive done it to trap you into staying with me she took his face in her hands and found it was wet with tears i was so miserable about the low sperm count he muttered i felt such a shit not being able to give you a baby oh darling im so happy its the best news ive ever had can we ring my mother and tell her shell be beside herself dyou think asked janey doubtfully she hasnt paid the subscription to my fan club for a long time course she will oh and i told helen said janey she rang this afternoon and i was so excited i had to tell someone was she pleased ish you know helen she said itll be a real positive experience for you janey after all youre still just at prime childbearing age the silly cow billy grinned i still cant take it in god its wonderful the telephone went billy leapt on it hi guess what oh you know he said sounding a little deflated helen must have told you isnt it i havent come down to earth yet rupert is terribly pleased said billy as he put down the receiver he wanted to bring a magnum of krug over but i said itd be wasted on us so he suggested some extra strong grass that guy had sold him janey giggled no thats all behind us were responsible parentstobe now lets go and have a fuck instead fen and sarah arrived at wembley just before midnight on sunday fen was utterly shattered she hadnt eaten or slept properly for weeks jake could only help so much as though by remote control shed had a bad fall from hardy and her back still ached the very thought of jumping the four horses all week in big classes that went on late into the evening filled her with exhaustion next morning on her way to declare she looked through the red curtains and saw billy walking the course for a novice class he was wearing old green cords and a tweed coat and laughing at some crack of ruperts he looked so happy and carefree and so much younger her heart twisted with longing im not cured she thought in panic in the secretarys tent she found humpty and griselda who both turned their backs on her oh god how long was this stupid pantomine going on early in the evening when she was least expecting it she bumped into billy he was very friendly but shifty somehow not meeting her eyes and firing questions about jake and the yard asking after laurel twice and congratulating her in a hearty most unbillyish way he seemed almost in a hurry to get away from her which left her far more uneasy and depressed than the other riders shunning her she wandered down to the stables macaulays top door was shut to stop his adoring public feeding him and tugging souvenir hairs out of his mane she slid into the box and shut the doors quickly behind her macaulay whickered with pleasure but didnt get up so she sat down on the straw beside him stroking his mane still crinkly from the afternoon plaits there were two classes that evening a fancy dress pair relay and then the sunday times cup worth she hadnt entered the relay because she was scared no one would want to be her partner outside she heard shrieks of laughter standing up she peered through the crack in the box and saw billy and rupert teetering past wearing fishnet stockings threeinch heels and coats and skirts with coconuts heaving in their twinsets rupert immaculate in a blond wig was mrs thatcher billy wearing a mop on his head was shirley williams then they were gone and next door she could hear sarah getting hardy ready for the sunday times cup fen sighed and sat down beside macaulay again she was just nodding off when she heard hoofs clattering outside and an excited voice saying guess what gossip gossip gossip it was dizzy what said sarah coming to the door wheres fen asked dizzy in the lorry i think i havent seen her for some time come on out with it janey lloydfoxe is pregnant fens hand tightened convulsively on macaulays mane jesus said sarah when did you find out well count guy billy rupert and driff were all declaring and count guy was ribbing billy saying hed heard some très interessant rumors and billy went all scarlet and pleased and admitted janey was having a baby count guy was tickled pink of course he didnt like billy being separated from janey in case he started running after lavinia again anyway they were busy congratulating each other when bloody driffield said whos the father kevin coley the next minute billy let him have one on the jaw wham sending driff flying across the tent then billy jumped on driff with his hands round driffs neck howling take it back you effing bastard and other pleasantries golly said sarah rupert and count guy dragged billy off and driffield said hed get billy suspended no you wont said rupert theres nothing in the bsja rules about eliminating a competitor before an event only during both grooms started to giggle anyway dizzy went on malise made driffield apologize driff said it was only a joke and billy rupert and guy turned on their booted heels and stalked out undeclared and had to come back five minutes later when driffield had gone so it looks as though driff not your poor boss is going to be the next candidate for coventry christ said sarah fenll go bananas when she hears he must be mad about janey to punch driff im glad someone has at last hes such a poisonous little toad i thought billy couldnt have kids said dizzy do you think it is kevs like a sleepwalker fen came out of macaulays box fen gasped dizzy backing into the patiently waiting arcturus we didnt realize you were there obviously not said fen or you wouldnt keep ruperts horse hanging round in the cold all you bloody well do all day is gossip not even bothering to close macaulays door she walked unsteadily away from them billys going to have a baby she muttered over and over again through trembling lips she had no idea where she went but she ended up in the lorry locking the door behind her a few minutes later she heard pounding on the door fen its sarah theyre walking the course i dont care sobbed fen leave me alone please im sorry about your overhearing everything but hardys all ready and i know you wanted to jump him in this class go away for christs sake let me in i want to look after you fen didnt answer she lay on her bed sobbing convulsively shuddering like a palsied dog she couldnt cope anymore there was no future nothing nothing the light had gone out at the end of the tunnel both ends were blocked up there was no hope oh billy oh billy she groaned then she heard someone fiddling with the door handle then voices then more fiddling and the door was forced open and the inside of the living area was flooded with light go away fen screamed i cant take it i simply cant take it then she saw a mans figure framed in the doorway billy she croaked in an insane moment of hope oh billy afraid not sweetheart drawled a voice youll just have to put up with second best it was dino ferranti fen slumped back on the bed leave me fucking alone you cant fuck alone its a physical impossibility said dino sitting down on the bed and drawing her close to him there honey hush hush he stroked her hair damp with tears feeling her drenched shirt and jersey against him horrified by the fragility of her body i love him so much i dont know what to do hush dont try to talk gradually he managed to calm her what am i to do she repeated shakily dino pulled off a piece of paper towel dried her eyes and held out another piece for her to blow her nose with there are still twelve riders to jump before you youre gonna get dressed and jump that course i am bloody not sure you are just figure if this had happened in la you couldnt just not jump every rounds a dress rehearsal for that day right los angeles is ten months away snapped fen im having difficulty getting through the next five minutes she was shivering violently now dino poured her a glass of brandy have a slug of this i dont want it yes you do open your mouth he almost forced it down her throat bastard said fen but she drank it now get out of those clothes like a father he removed her shirt and tie which were streaked with lipstick and mascara thats my lucky shirt and tie moaned fen covering her breasts with her arms havent brought you much luck today said dino try another combination he held out a clean shirt for her i am not going to jump said fen mutinously not on hardy hes a nightmare and i havent walked the course youve got time to watch the last three rounds said dino come on put your jacket on and borrow my shades i hate you said fen i truly truly hate you for a moment as he stood behind her while she checked her appearance in the mirror she was struck by the contrast between her waiflike figure white face and swollen eyes and dino brown as peanut butter ridiculously elegant in a black silk shirt and pale gray suit hed streaked his hair pale gray since shed last seen him talk about beauty and the beast she said news of janeys pregnancy and billy punching driffield had spread rapidly around the showground fen came out of the lorry to find the place swarming with reporters dino dispatched them ruthlessly no fen couldnt speak to anyone nor could she sign autographs with his arms round her he forced a gangway through the crowd whos that with her asked the man from the express face is familiar think hes an actor said the girl from the mirror by some miracle they had time to watch a couple of rounds watch the wall warned sarah theres been a lot of mistakes there and the combinations on a funny stride people have been taking three strides then changing their minds and asking the horses off too early then hitting the third element i suppose you know all about it snapped fen at sarah im awfully sorry fen said sarah in an undertone im so glad you made it i wouldnt have said fen casting a venomous glance at dino if mussolini here hadnt come jackbooting round why cant i go into a decline in peace mary jo wilson the number one american girl rider auburnhaired and extremely attractive was in the ring she took a brick out of the wall and had a pole down at the second element then crashed through the third the crowd gave a groan of sympathy what did i tell you said dino hi mary jo he shouted as she came out of the ring dino her face lit up i didnt know you were in europe how many clears fen asked sarah only four dino removed his dark glasses from a protesting fen but my eyes are still red just fantasize youre a white rat she rode through the cherry red curtains into the brilliantly lit arena and here comes fenella maxwell said dudley diplock in ecstasy hot from her brilliant second in the crittleden gold cup on hardy the crowd whod been bitterly disappointed when fen hadnt appeared at her appointed place in the class and had assumed shed scratched gave a cheer of delighted surprise bloody unfair grumbled griselda why should they waive the rules for her because shes a star said billy shes the one theyve come to see it is the mark of a great athlete that the mind can transcend adversity and somehow heighten the performance after two shaky jumps which had her fans gasping and nearly stripped the paint off the poles fen clicked into automatic pilot hardy given his head and showing his true quality went clear the crowd went berserk their idol hadnt failed them crittleden wasnt just a flash in the pan thank god i didnt walk the course said fen as she came out id have been so terrified id never have crossed the starting line you made a cockup at the first two fences said dino dont come on like jake said fen icily im going back to the lorry no youre not said dino catching her by the scruff of her neck youve got to jump off he took her up into the riders stand to watch the first rounds from all sides people hailed him where are zee horses asked hans schmidt arriving the day after tomorrow i might jump manny in the victor ludorum at that moment billys number was called behind fen and dino janey lloydfoxe was holding court looking ravishing in a red wool laura ashley smock youd think she was eight months pregnant muttered fen savagely janey was talking to doreen hamilton speaking more slowly than usual so that fen could hear every word yes billy is absolutely over the moon the night i told him he couldnt sleep for excitement its going to be a terrific incentive to his career he says hes jumping for two now hes treating me like glass wont even let me pick up a duster never been her forte anyway said fen to herself her knuckles white where she clutched her whip whens it due asked doreen june billyll be at the royal and the international but he says hell probably cancel both the jumpoff course was a blur before fens eyes oh here comes my darling said janey as billy the first to jump off cantered into the arena a huge grin spread across his face dont you think prospective fatherhood suits him dino put a hand on fens knee ignore her he said shes only trying to wind you up bugle put in an incredibly fast time janey went into noisy ecstasy never seen him ride before said dino hes bloody good no ones going to be able to cruise after that he was right both ludwig and wishbone clocked up slower times in came rupert to the usual ecstatic schoolgirl screams the whole of the pony club stand hopeful of losing their virginity in such a glorious cause rose to their feet to cheer extraordinary that someone so goodlooking should be such a bastard said dino like a blackbird singing the most exquisite song and dumping on you at the same time jesus look at that acceleration he ought to have starting gates as snakepit stampeded the course the jumps hardly seemed to exist he skimmed them effortlessly like a pebble flicked in ducks and drakes hes improved a whole lot since the world championships said dino as rupert thundered home two seconds faster than billy pow you cant help admiring him i can only too easily said fen joyously raking his hand down snakepits steel gray plaits rupert shot out through the red curtains sending hardy flying why dont you look where youre going clumsy oaf snarled fen because i dont like whats in my way snapped rupert and if svengali lovell can tell you how to beat that time im a dutchman unfair to dutchmen fen shouted back over her shoulder some of them are rather nice remember if youre going too fast accelerate dino called after her suddenly fen remembered rupert in rome sneering at her disastrous performances in the nations cup saying that women always crack under pressure to hell with rupert she said to herself to hell with janey lloydfoxe and her beastly baby if im going to commit suicide this is as good a way as any having bowed briefly to the princess in the royal box she turned hardy round and thundered through the start at a gallop hardy who was used to being checked all the time and fighting for his head was puzzled for a minute then rose to the challenge over the first fence she was up on ruperts time throwing herself over her hands nearly touching hardys noseband over the parallel bars and with an amazing flying change she jumped the gate almost sideways god thought dino suddenly terrified shes taking me literally scorching over the upright bucketing over the walls fen was already looking ahead to the combination she was coming in too fast she was going to crash she knew a terrifying moment of fear then hardy took over and executed a trio of perfect jumps and hurtled fen through the finish from the earsptitting cheers of the crowd who had risen to their feet she knew she had beaten ruperts time the problem now was stopping at the side of the arena a bank of blue hydrangeas came to meet them hardy skidded to the right sliding along on his back legs for five seconds before coming to a halt fen sauntered out of the ring pleased that for once even dino seemed shaken out of his customary cool the next moment ludwig clapped his hand on her back brilliant i haf never seen a round like zat count guy followed suit and suddenly all the british riders except rupert and griselda were shaking her hand and hugging her she was home from coventry at last was it all worth it wondered fen as she accepted her red rosette from the princess with the huge silver cup sparkling even more dazzlingly as it reflected the lights was it worth the lack of sleep the setbacks the heartbreaks for this moment of glory she admired the princesss perfect ankles in fleshcolored tights as she walked back to the royal box then there was a terrific roll of drums which nearly sent snakepit and rupert into orbit leaving a gap between fen and billy who was third turning fen looked him straight in the eye with a supreme effort far greater than winning the cup she managed to smile im so pleased about your baby she said then before he had time to answer the arena was plunged in darkness and fen and the dappled gray hardy were illuminated by the spotlight she was aware that no one was leaving there was no crashing of seats or banging of exit doors or feet running down the concrete steps just a long silence followed by the most almighty cheering and as the band struck up i want some red roses for a blue lady everyone started singing and clapping in time then the other riders filed out and she was alone and spotlit in the ring sending hardy into his wonderful effortless long striding gallop and the crowd cheered so loudly that she went round again billy may not love me she thought but they do why cant i go on riding around this ring for the rest of my life dudley captured her in the collecting ring brandishing his microphone like a furry black iced lolly seuper absolutely seuper you sorted out the girls from the boys today he roared with laughter hed had too many in the whisky tent and harvey went seuperly you must be pleased he did and i am must be a cert for la now you cant look beyond tomorrow with horses said fen must be difficult to choose between him and esmeralda fen looked broodingly at dudley for a second shes called desdemona and hes called hardy and why dont you remove your silly hat when youre talking to a lady dudley although knowing you you probably think im a gentleman oh christ she thought i shouldnt have said that out of the corner of her eye beyond the shetland ponies and the famous exracehorses who were lining up for the personality parade she could see a pack of reporters hovering well done fen wizard round lets have a jar later in the week bellowed a voice and there leering above her almost sending dudley flying was monica carlton bowling past with her welsh cobs one door shuts another door opens said fen giving monica a weak smile dudley was flapping around saying good night to the viewers and reminding them to switch on tomorrow for the puissance fen tried to dive behind a costers van but the reporters were old hands next moment theyd ringed her like a lasso blocking her escape on all sides what dyou think about billy lloydfoxes wife having a baby im very pleased for him nothing else to say if it grows up like billy itll be a wonderful child but not like janey i didnt say that fen looked desperately round for help i hardly know janey you were very fond of billy werent you its difficult not to be said fen bursting into tears he hasnt an enemy in the world all she could see was their avid searching eyes and their frantically scribbling pens why cant you leave me alone she sobbed a shadow fell across the notebooks pack it in said dino coldly and taking the couple nearest fen by their coat collars he yanked them out of the way bugger off and fuse your own typewriters with your lousy copy you heard what the lady said leave her alone back in the lorry dino peered unenthusiastically into the fridge one black avocado half a can of beans a pork pie that ought to be on superannuation you have two choices he said to fen you can cry yourself to sleep right or come out to dinner with me im starving im not hungry and i ought to ring jake sarah called him he said what the hell were you doing risking hardys neck then exhausting him showing off in that double lap of honor fen pulled a face and thats all the bloody praise i get dino took her to an italian restaurant off high street kensington which stayed open late outside fen could see dusty yellowing plane trees fretted by raindrops and lovers under pulleddown umbrellas hurrying to catch the last tube imprisoned in wembley with its heat airlessness and tensions shed forgotten an outside world existed at the nextdoor table a couple were holding hands taking in the merry din the bottles of chianti the photographs of the colosseum on the wall the solicitous waiters fen was reminded of the night in rome with billy when her face was all bruised and hed fed her risotto with a spoon she wanted him so badly it took her breath away what are you thinking about demanded dino that i ought to be in the intensive care unit not wasting your money it is my money said dino grabbing the menus ill order for you grapefruit bolognesell do me fine said fen emptying half a glass of wine in one gulp how come you speak italian so well she said when hed finished ordering because i am italian i guess youre american only by adoption im just a simple lousy latin lover at heart why have you streaked your hair gray well hearing you were heavily into older guys like billy i figured i stood more of a chance if i looked more mature besides he grinned i thought it suited me it does admitted fen you look too bloody glamorous for words but its too early to make jokes about my broken heart dino put a suntanned beautifully manicured hand over hers how come you didnt acknowledge my telegram i wasnt sure it was from you it said it was didnt it you dont know the terrible thing rupert did to me in rome just for a second his hand tightened painfully on hers no not that said fen id been packed off to bed ludicrously early and was sitting there dying of boredom when rupert rang up pretending to be you and asked me out to dinner did you go did i ive never got bathed washed my hair and dressed quicker in my life then i found rupert and driffield killing themselves at the bottom of the stairs dino looked halfsmug halfsympathetic that was a lousy trick were you disappointed shattered after that i thought the telegram was probably one of ruperts vile little practical jokes too so i never wrote and thanked you if you had id have been over much sooner and i might never have got involved with billy dyou think ill ever get over him she added dolefully sure you will just stick around the waiter arrived with their first course half a dozen mediterranean prawns each and a huge bowl of mayonnaise strongly flavored with garlic dino ordered another bottle and started stripping the prawns with incredible dexterity then dipping them in the mayonnaise and passing them to fen mm they actually are delicious do you undress women as expertly far more expertly and i dont pull their heads and legs off either fen paused for a minute thinking how amazingly attractive he was if you liked that sort of thing she told herself hastily did you ever get helen campbellblack into bed dino grinned we had lunch several times but she never had more than one course and left half of that because she was always wanting to rush me off to some art gallery i said honey i am not into culture im only into sex you didnt manage to divert her into some large double bed he shook his head she was running scared the whole time whenever i put my hand on her back to guide her across the road she shot into the oncoming traffic if you try anything further a burglar alarm goes off in ruperts lorry no in her head shes so beautiful you want to gaze and gaze but i guess shes like a ming vase beautiful but empty goodness ive eaten all those prawns said fen good girl dino ran his hand down the inside of her arm caressing her gently almost abstractedly as if she were a dog funny i fancy you i always have fen jumped away you mustnt say things like that im not ready for propositions wasnt a proposition just a statement of fact even though im not as beautiful as helen dino looked at her meditatively you could gain some weight he said but youll do fen noticed he was beginning to squint slightly he must be desperately jetlagged hows manny awesome much better than me hes grown so much and filled out he was winning a lot earlier in the year then my daddy had a cardiac arrest in july hes better now but i was off the circuit for some weeks why have you suddenly come over here at the end of the season to work with this guy whom i reckon is the best coach in the world im going to stable the horses at his barn for a few months take in a few shows in europe then have a stab at the world cup in april then back to the states for the run up to the olympics i guess i want a gold as much as you do who is this coach do i know him no one knows him very well hes kind of unapproachable dino smiled confidingly actually i fancy one of his female jockeys i figured if i was living there with permanent access i might stand a better chance fen slumped in her chair utterly deflated she looked down at the tiny lamb cutlets that had just arrived and removed the blackened sprig of rosemary that lay across them she was utterly heartbroken over billy but no girl likes an attractive reboundee whipped from under her nose before shes even had a moment to try and rebound onto him it would have been useful to have dino in england if anyone asked her to bring a man to a party or to some official dinner moodily she poured too much salt onto the side of her plate watching it turn green in the mint sauce no i dont want any more to drink she said sulkily ive got a class at nine tomorrow dino took no notice and filled up her glass did you meet this girl on the circuit she asked last year at the world championship fen glanced up suddenly and was amazed to see he was laughing jesus youre thick maxwell you may win trophies at shows but youve got the perception of a blindworm i dont understand stammered fen dino took her hand again turning it over gently tracing the heart line with his thumb i saw jake this afternoon he figures youve done a fantastic job but it might help to have another guy around the barn to jump some of the horses in return hes going to help me with manny when he comes out of the hospital fen suddenly felt near to tears again so he thinks i cant cope on the contrary he thinks youre too good to waste he wants a gold for you too hes only helping me because he knows theres no way i can beat you fen sat on jakes hospital bed a fortnight later it is absolutely infuriating she grumbled but the entire household tory the children the grooms the horses even wolf are madly in love with dino ferranti its a good thing youre coming home next week to restore normality before they all defect to america with him she got up and wandered restlessly around the room looking at the inside of the hundreds of getwell cards eating grapes trying not to be upset by jakes hisses of pain as with contorted sweating face and gritted teeth he battled on endlessly bending and stretching to strengthen the muscles of both broken and wasted legs she couldnt help noticing how fragile and lacking in muscle they looked and wondered if he would ever ride again let alone make the big time the physiotherapist warned you not to overdo it she said reprovingly physiotherapists arent interested in medals said jake pushing his drenched fringe out of his eyes torys planning a surprise thanksgiving dinner for dino so he wont feel homesick fen went on sarah is actually putting on makeup first thing in the morning for the first time in history any minute desdemona will start curling her pink eyelashes i cant think why he has to be so bloody charming all the time goodness youve got a card from the princess you are a star are you looking forward to coming home next week of course panted jake leaning back for a second against the bedhead were all longing to have you said fen neither statement was strictly true jake having dreamed of nothing but getting out of hospital for five months was now thrown into a blind panic at the thought of facing the outside world learning to walk again was really taking it out of him crashing over all the time dragging himself up again black with despair that neither of his legs would ever be strong enough to support him and terror whether hed ever have the guts to get on a horse again night after night he dreamed of tumbling poles and colossal horses crashing from great heights onto his legs splintering them to spillikins and woke up sobbing and screaming until the night nurse arrived to calm him down after his early animosity he felt an almost slavish gratitude to the nurses and the matron who had all taken such a personal pride in getting him right when they werent too busy on the wards particularly at night they would spend hours talking to him and he found himself unbending as he never did at home or with the other riders there was one blond nurse for whom he had a special fondness sister wutherspoon who brought him fresh eggs from the country and always popped in to show herself off radiant and scented before she went out on dates jake suppressed a faint suspicion that she might return his interest desirable nurses were not attracted to badtempered cripples like himself finally he didnt feel up to facing the whole slog of running the yard driving miles to shows raking the country for new horses he longed for the children but didnt know if he could cope with the decibel level of their shrill demands or with the doglike devotion of good shinyfaced tory heaving her elevenstone bulk round the mill house as she waited on everyone all he wanted to do was to spend two months soaking up the sun on some hawaiian beach with sister wutherspoon in a grass skirt ministering to his every need grass skirts would be no good in warwickshire macaulay would eat them he was glad dino was going to be there to shoulder some of the responsibility fen on the other hand was in a muddle having run the yard virtually singlehanded for five months she was close to collapse but she had been buoyed up by her hopes of billy coming sweet and by the feeling that she was being indispensable and splendid now dino had moved in and taken over at least half of the reins everyone seemed happier and she couldnt help being jealous she felt shed been demoted from head girl to the upper fourth and when jake came home shed be back in the kindergarten she was irritated by the way everyone deferred to dino she couldnt fault him as a worker despite the very late hours he kept he got up at six like everyone else and spent at least seven or eight hours in the saddle working not only his own horses but all of jakes novices he had strange ideas about feeding his horses arriving with a trunk full of vitamins and additives but he was out of bed in a flash if there was any trouble with a sick horse in the night and despite his languid playboy image he was amazingly domesticated fen nearly fainted one evening when she came home from an interview in birmingham with atv to find him ironing his shirts what are you doing she asked in amazement tory can do those why the hell should she shes exhausted fen watched the expert way he slid the iron along the folds of the blue silk sleeve into the cuff where dyou learn to do that at college all the money went on the horses i couldnt afford to send shirts to the laundry i hate crumpled shirts so i figured i better learn to iron youll make a wonderful wife someday said fen at that moment darklis appeared in a pink nightgown looking disapproving lo fen we saw you on the telly are you coming dino you promised to read green eggs and ham dinos going to take me to disneyland she added to fen come on dino ill be up when ive finished this lot he said refusing to be bullied in the hall fen met tory wearing a dressing gown pink from a hot bath ive just left diana ferranti slaving over a hot iron said fen isnt he marvelous sighed tory i had a blinding headache and he just took over hes cooking supper too gosh it smells good so nice to have a man who can tell the difference between rosemary and basil jakey wouldnt notice if you gave him dog biscuits im beginning to think dinos more interested in basils than rosemarys anyway said fen pointedly she went out to the yard to check the horses it was a very cold starry night an early frost had lurexed the cobbles in the yard and starched the golden willow spears which rustled underfoot and already clogged the stable gutters as she adjusted a rug here and checked a water bowl or bandage there fen brooded on dinos deficiencies in some painful way he reminded her of billy but while billy was like a dog loving dependent enthusiastic dino was feline cool and detached he was far tougher and more critical than billy he saw fens faults only too clearly but whereas jake would bite her head off dino tended to mob her up only last week he had caught her shouting at sarah for giving hardy who was supposed to be on a diet the wrong feed when he told her to pack it in she started shouting back at him whereupon he calmly bundled her into a loose box and shut both doors on her until she cooled down how can i have any authority with the grooms if you take the piss out of me all the time she complained furiously afterwards they have to humor and nurse you before big classes so bloody well treat them properly at home most irritating of all despite saying how much he fancied her during dinner after the sunday times cup he hadnt lifted a long suntanned finger in her direction since he arrived at the mill house perhaps living in such close proximity had put him off not that she cared a scrap she was still hopelessly hooked on billy but she was irked that girls with soft caressing american accents always seemed to be ringing dino up and twice since hed been living there hed disappeared off in his car after work and not returned until dawn was breaking occasionally fen cried herself to sleep and wondered if dino who occupied the blue room at the end of the passage ever heard her as he tiptoed past to bed all in all for a man who was supposed to be staying in england because of her he was behaving in an odd way standing in desdemonas box ruffling her coat which had thickened from being turned out during the day she gave her the last glacier mint looking out of the halfdoor she saw a small pale sliver of new moon curling itself round the weather cock turning the fiftypence piece in her pocket she sighed realizing there was no point wasting a wish on billy anymore please moon she said give me a gold a week later jake came home it was a perfect october afternoon with all the trees silhouetted against a rainheavy navy blue sky turning color there was not a speck of dust anywhere in the yard or an inch of tack unpolished only dinos horses and four of the novices who were still going to shows were in their boxes the rest of the horses were out in the different fields which checkered the hill behind the stables but they sensed something was up they had been restless all day snapping and shrieking at each other not settling down to serious grazing but hanging round the gates only now just before jake was due had they all galloped off out of sight to talk to macaulay africa and africas foal who were grazing in the top field darklis and isa werent back from school yet although a huge banner saying welcome home daddy which theyd painted with sarah and dinos help hung from the two largest willows across the gateway above the murmur of the millstream fen heard the sound of a car on the bridge sarah darted forward to remove a couple of willow leaves which had floated down into the yard then wolf whod also been jumpy all day gave an excited bark as the car drove into the yard he leapt forward scrabbling hysterically at the paint with his paws welcome home cried fen running forward steady boy she caught wolfs collar before opening the car door you dont want to send your master flying but when he realized it truly was jake wolf remained motionless for several seconds as though hed been stunned then he put back his head and let out a series of spinechilling howls jake noticed tears were coursing down the lurchers rough brindled cheeks come on boy said jake gently as the dog crept forward laying his head on his masters knee tail rammed between his thin trembling legs as though he couldnt believe such a miracle no one spoke as jake stroked wolfs head over and over again smoothing away the tears then as he struggled out of the car dino went forward to give him a hand hi he said its so good to have you home even the suns come out to welcome you jake nodded face impassive not trusting himself to speak come inside and rest darling said tory i want to see the horses you must take it slowly she pleaded todays been such a strain pass me my crutches snapped jake here they are said fen as he stumbled painfully across the cobbles slipping and once falling to his knees fen was about to rush to help him dont said dino sharply grabbing her arm he tried not to show how shocked he was by jakes appearance in the sunlight gray with exhaustion desperately thin hed had to make two extra holes in his belt to keep his trousers up oh god said fen as he stumbled again hes got to do it on his own said dino after what seemed an eternity he reached the gate leaning on it gasping to recover his breath laboriously he managed to open it and stagger inside leaning back against it for support the field sloped up to the skyline dotted only by a few orange beeches and lemon yellow ashes not a horse in sight jake put his hand to his mouth and whistled there was a long pause he was about to whistle again when suddenly over the brow of the hill they came black dark brown chestnut bay gray roan some of them jumped over fences from nearby fields thundering down the hill manes and tails flying it was like the last furlong of the derby as they hurtled towards jake hardy came from the back elbowing nipping shoving the others out of the way squealing jealously already plump from their rest they had never moved faster in the height of their fitness as they stampeded the gate theyll kill him whispered sarah theyre going to crush him to death cried tory in anguish get him out of there urged fen oh dino do something but miraculously about ten feet away they jammed on their brakes and although the ones behind cannoned unceremoniously into the leaders they all slithered to a halt not even touching the tips of jakes shoes they stood there gazing at him goofily then with a thunder of whickering they edged forward and with the utmost gentleness started to nudge and nuzzle his face his hands and his coat occasionally getting jealous flattening their ears at each other and giving each other a nip or a squeal hardy true to his character stropped jake all over with his tongue then gave him a sharp nip on the sleeve of his coat just to show he was still boss ive never seen anything like that before said dino looking down and seeing tears pouring down fens cheeks finding her hand in his he gave it a gentle squeeze fen looked down started blushed scarlet and snatched her hand away to wipe her eyes someones missing said sarah its the big fellow said dino next minute they saw macaulay standing on the crest of the hill like bambis father jake gave another whistle and the next moment macaulay came crashing down the hill like an outofcontrol steamroller so fast that all the other horses parted in selfpreservation to let him through when he reached jake he chased all the others away with enraged squeals instantly returning to press his great white whiskery face against jakes jake put his arm round macaulays neck clinging on for support his shoulders shaking dyou think hes okay said fen in dismay leave him said dino hes best alone with the horses having dreaded jakes return fen found it easier than shed expected because he and dino got on so surprisingly well dino was unruffled by jakes black moods and biting sarcasm and didnt take them personally the guys in a lot of pain he told fen got to get his act together he needs to jackboot around a bit to regain his selfrespect together they worked on the horses and on hardy and manny in particular with jake giving orders stumbling around the yard first on two crutches then one and by the end of november with a walking stick he also plugged relentlessly away at the exercises mr buchannan was delighted with his progress and said with any luck hed be riding by february at night after supper instead of collapsing in front of the television jake and dino would talk over a bottle of wine until they dropped dino asked most of the questions but while jake gave dino the benefit of all his gypsy secrets and remedies dino was able to counter with information on the latest medical and dietary breakthroughs in the states soon all jakes horses were taking extra vitamins they all rattle as they go past said fen crossly dino also encouraged jake into a new regime to get him back into peak condition fen was staggered to see jake who seldom managed more than a cup of the blackest sweetest coffee for breakfast actually sitting down to slices of apple dried apricot prunes and sticks of carrot followed by one of dinos multivitamin cocktails all the same dinos just picking jakes brains said fen indignantly as she dried up one evening you wait till america gets the team gold and dino the individual then youll be sorry dont be mean fen said tory gently dinos doing it for jakeys sake as well he looks so much better and it does him so much good to feel needed fen was also finding jakes criticism very hard to take after all shed made more money during the last year than he ever had and she was fed up with dino sticking up for tory she was only drying up tonight because dinod torn another strip off her for treating tory like a slave you all just leave her with the dishes why the hell doesnt jake buy her a dishwasher but shes quite happy protested fen you talk as though she was some retarded kid in a mental institution dino had been particularly touched by torys surprise thanksgiving dinner where did you get this pumpkin pie recipe he said amazed its better than they make at home tory went pink i rang up helen campbellblack she stammered fen and jake looked at her incredulously she must adore dino to seek advice from the enemy camp the only thing that cheered fen up during those weeks was her own increasing success she had two good wins at home shows all the papers regarded her as a cert for la her fan mail grew bigger she was expected to have instant opinions as magazines called daily asking her for her views on men clothes slimming food hardly a day passed without some journalist coming down to warwickshire to interview her you couldnt walk past a magazine rack without seeing her face peering out fen was not conceited by nature but she couldnt help brooding on the admiration of the outside world compared with the distinct lack of reverence with which she was treated at home jake and dino believed there was a job to be done and she was there to get on with it one afternoon in late november fen and sarah had been hacking out getting desdemona and macaulay fit for olympia as they rode into the yard they found dino whod just had a strenuous session in the indoor school cooling off manny in the yard next minute tory came out of the kitchen door her hands covered with flour oh dino someone named mary jo rang shes staying at the dorchester can you ring her sure ill do it now he handed the horse to louise his groom and walked into the house lucky mary jo sighed sarah whos she asked tory she asked after jakes leg and sounded awfully nice mary jo wilson i should think said fen sliding off desdemona the american girl wonder lots of red hair tucked into a bun and perfectly tied stocks with diamond tiepins and a white carnation in her buttonhole too bloody poncy for words if you ask me im sure she rides sidesaddle in bed but jolly attractive in a helen campbellblack sort of way said sarah not without malice dino obviously likes redheads well she sounded sweet repeated tory without any malice at all dino came back into the yard sorry its short notice he said to tory but i wont be in for dinner tonight shall i keep something hot for you said tory im sure mary jos doing that already snapped fen then immediately wished she hadnt dino shot her a sour look itll make a nice change he said evenly and went off to supervise mannys feed why are you so foul to him fen said tory reproachfully because hes so bloody swollenheaded his heads not the only thing thatll be swollen when he sees mary jo said sarah with a giggle dont be disgusting snapped fen she felt impossibly badtempered particularly when dino came back in time for breakfast the next morning spent all day yawning and was so untogether hardy had him off three times a week later dino boxed up his horses and took them off to a show in vienna where there was a world cup qualifier fen was so certain hed taken mary jo that she rang up the dorchester to be told that miss wilson had checked out the morning dino had left and wasnt expected back until december twelfth the day dino was due home fen spent the next few days imagining dino waltzing around and around a viennese ballroom to the blue danube with mary jo in his arms dino returned as expected on the twelfth after a very successful show manny had obviously improved dramatically under jakes tuition he had qualified for the world cup won a big class on the third night and come second in the grand prix jake was delighted thats what he gets a kick out of thought fen he really likes improving horses at home better than jumping them at shows dino brought toys for the children silk scarves for the grooms a beautiful black sloppy sweater for tory which covered all her bulges and a new bit which they were all raving about on the continent for jake but nothing apparently for fen thats because i was so horrible before he left she thought miserably escaping to the yard it was a very cold night the water trough was already frozen and a thin sheet of ice lay over the cobblestones in the tackroom she found a drooping louise hanging up dinos tack which shed been cleaning on the drive home you must be knackered poor thing louise nodded sure but it was a great show you always feel less bushed when you win fiddling with the striped handle of a body brush fen casually asked how did mary jo do not bad said louise as though it was the most natural thing in the world for mary jo to have been with them shes having problems with melchior he keeps kicking out fences but balthazar jumped real super and qualified for the world cup shes worried she wont make the team for la particularly as dino must be a dead cert now but the competitions so hot and shes twentysix already and by the next games shell probably be tied up with babies pity she cant come down here for a week or two and work with jake not that the american coaches arent great but jake does have the edge with difficult horses i cant think why he doesnt apply for the job as american chef dequipe snapped fen and chucking down the body brush she stalked out into the bitterly cold night wandering around in jersey and jeans oblivious of time and temperature torys voice brought her back to reality in the kitchen she found dino changed into a gray cashmere jersey and gray cords drinking a large whisky and soda and telling tory about vienna rosettes and photographs were spread out all over the pine table its so beautiful we went to one cemetery where all the great musicians are buried mozart brahms beethoven haydn the most moving thing of all was schuberts grave look he handed the photo to tory on the headstone theyve carved a picture of him arriving in heaven and an angel putting a laurel wreath on his head because no one recognized his genius on earth unlike you said fen acidly everyone appreciates you dino not everyone dinos face was expressionless but he quickly gathered up the photographs lovey you look frozen said tory have a hot bath im just off with isa to see darkliss play dinners in the oven goulash and baked potatoes and theres an apple pie in the larder if you want it jake was away in ireland for two days to look at some horses it had been regarded as a great step forward that he felt well enough to go fen however couldnt face dinner alone with dino and louise thanks she walked through the kitchen im not hungry at the moment wish darklis tons of luck in her bedroom she slumped on her bed fighting tiredness and misery she drew the blue and white gingham curtains the tops were still off the shampoo and conditioner shed used to wash her hair for dinos return the wet towel was still on the bed the hair dryer plugged in despite switching on the fire she couldnt stop shivering and decided to have a bath shed just stripped off when there was a knock on the door who is it she grabbed the wet towel me dino came into the room shutting the door behind him fen turned away towards the mirror im about to have a bath ive fixed you a drink he put a large vodka and tonic down on the dressing table there was a pause as he picked up the mrs tiggywinkle with a teazel face a mob cap and a pink dress which stood beside all the china horses on the bookshelf thats kind of neat jake made it for me years ago she sat on the dressingtable stool thin bare shoulders rising out of the dark red towel slanting eyes suspicious dino noticed the pluggedin hair dryer going out she shook her head my hair was dirty the room was warming up now why couldnt her teeth stop chattering ive got a present for you said dino easing a black square box out of his hip pocket and opening it fen gasped as he took out a gold chain with an f exquisitely set in pearls and emeralds on the end he hung it around her neck fumbling over the clasp with hands that were not quite steady well he said looking up at his reflection she noticed his suntan was fading and the siamesecat eyes were squinting slightly as they always did when he was very tired its lovely she whispered fingering the f its the loveliest thing anyones ever ever given me ill never take it off thank you so much i thought her voice shook youd deliberately forgotten me because id been such a bitch she stood up to turn round but dino gripped her bare arms dropping a slow infinitely measured kiss on her left collarbone suddenly her stomach started to curl and a pulse to beat insistently between her legs how could i forget you he said ruefully i never think of anyone else he was nuzzling at the side of her neck now softly kissing the lobes of her ears and quite frankly if i dont unzip my fly and climb inside you soon im going to end up in the funny farm truly youre not just being kind kind christ ive backed off enough he turned her around she gazed up at him troubled trembling im not sure dino ive been so hurt ive only got a little bit of heart left ive got more than enough heart for both of us i wont hurt you sweetheart im going to make you better slowly he drew back her clenched arms which were holding the towel up and put her hands round his neck beneath her fingers she could feel the power of his shoulder muscles go on kiss me he whispered as she tentatively put her lips up he kissed her back so gently she thought shed faint with joy first her top lip then the bottom then sliding his tongue between her teeth one hand was cupping her left breast now moving slowly and lovingly the harbinger of pleasure darling little fen tell me what turns you on you do she moaned oh please go on but as he pulled her down on the bed and began to kiss her in earnest sliding his hand over her body she caught a glimpse of billys photograph beside the bed then she thought about janey and then about mary jo wilson who last night had been lying beside dino submitting no doubt ecstatically to the same expert caresses she couldnt stand it this time she wanted a man who was all hers one whom she didnt have to share violently she pulled away from him hey whats the matter you are youre so bloody promiscuous smarming all over me one minute then rushing up to london at the drop of a telephone receiver to push off to vienna with mary jo guess whos coming for dino you bet your sweet life mary jo is for a second dinos hand clenched on her shoulder then he looked around the room at the posters of snoopy and the china horses and lester the teddy bear and the pajama case in the shape of a camel and then at the tattered photograph of billy lloydfoxe in the leather case youre still a kid arent you he said bitterly i guess youre just about adult enough to sleep with an old teddy bear like billy lloydfoxe bastard hissed fen and the next moment shed slapped dinos face very hard just shut up about billy dino shrugged and you resort to blows like a kid unfortunately i happen to be a grownup boy i had my twentyfirst birthday five years ago and ive got the appetites of a normal guy if you think im going to remain celibate while you keep putting another battery in the stupid torch youre carrying for billy youve got another think coming its not a stupid flashlight screamed fen youre just like rupert and jake none of you understand the meaning of the word love all i can promise said dino is that i want you more than any girl ive ever met but im a hedonist not a medieval knight keeping myself pure for some unobtainable lady love nor do i like sleeping alone the central heating in this house leaves a lot to be desired so if you wont put out im going to find my entertainment someplace else and with that he left her the next minute she heard his car door bang and the crunch of wheels on the gravel bursting into tears she threw herself down on the already sodden bed the next few days were awful fen and dino hardly exchanged a word fen got up before dawn dino changed his routine got up after lunch and spent his evenings working the horses in the indoor school it seemed impossible in such a small house that they could avoid meeting dino was polite but unsmiling he no longer mobbed her up on friday morning fen dino louise and sarah were due to get up at am for a fourthirty departure for a show in amsterdam on the thursday before that the sunday express sent a photographer and a reporter down to the mill house to interview fen in the evening she had to go to a dinner at the savoy where she was being nominated for one of the sporting personality of the year awards the organizers were sending a car for her which at the end of the evening would whizz her back to warwickshire to catch three hours sleep before leaving for amsterdam the sunday express reporter was a charming middleaged roué who thought fen was gorgeous and buttered her up to mountainous heights in the hope of possible indiscretions after lunch cooked by tory the photographer took pictures of desdemona and macaulay from flattering angles as they were still a bit podgy from their six weeks rest later photographing the yard and the house and the kitchen with tory cooking at the aga and fen pretending to fill in entry forms against a background of rosettes im thinking of getting a secretary to cope with all my fan mail said fen whod had three glasses of wine at lunch im not surprised said the express reporter every little girl in england dreams of being like you i hope to christ they dont behave like her said a voice and dino wandered in unshaven yawning bloodshoteyed and poured himself a large whisky is that your breakfast snapped fen no the first one was my breakfast said dino hi he added to the reporter and wandered off in the direction of the stables thats dino ferranti isnt it asked the reporter refilling fens glass goodlooking bloke despite the stubble more like a rock star he your latest hardly snapped fen hes working with jake honestly if i were cast away on a desert island id rather be propositioned by a gorilla youd be wasting your time said dino coming back into the room gorillas are mostly gay anyone seen this weeks horse and hound and dont bloody eavesdrop said fen lets go into the sitting room well be more private it was already dark when she waved them goodbye outside the lorry was waiting already filled with petrol water and human and equine supplies shed better step on it the car was picking her up at fivethirty sitting at the kitchen table she found dino tory and sarah checking the list of what they were taking to amsterdam fen looked at her message pad atv womans own and malise gordon had rung picking up the telephone she suddenly noticed black fur all over her pale pink angora jersey which was drying on a towel on the edge of the aga bloody hell she said dropping the receiver back on its cradle tory looked up alarmed whats the matter my pink jersey ive got to take it tomorrow and you cant even keep the bloody cats off it dino looked up from a pile of horses health papers pack it in he said softly torys cooked lunch for your press admirer which you havent even had the manners to thank her for shes done all our ironing for tomorrow and seen everythings back from the cleaners as well as providing enough food for us for a month she doesnt actually have the time to police your pale pink sweater he really spat out the ps against marauding tomcats fen lost her temper i ran this bloody yard singlehanded for five months and now i dont get any proper backup she screamed and stormed out of the kitchen ten minutes later she was back with dripping hair whos been using my hair dryer i did said tory apologetically on darklis well youve fused it how am i expected to dry my hair why dont you go stick your head in the oven said dino and preferably dont light the gas youre getting much too big for your boots we all know youre englands answer to show jumping and the role model for the entire schoolgirl population and were fed up with it you know perfectly well you wouldnt speak to tory like this if jake was here were here screamed fen were here if takes the subjunctive and she stormed out of the room again oh dear said tory in distress gazing at the last orange rays of sunset oh dear oh dear fen was in such a rage that she went off to london without saying goodbye to anyone she wore a black backless taffeta dress shed bought in paris the previous summer and never worn with highheeled black shoes black stockings and dinos necklace at her throat as she walked into the predinner drinks party which was chocabloc with every sporting celebrity commentator and journalist you could imagine a few heads turned in her direction she drifted over to dudley diplock propped up against the fireplace who was already threeparts cut and gave the room the benefit of her back view the dress was so low it almost gave her a cleavage at the back when she turned around five minutes later everyone was gaping at her it was one of those evenings when her looks really worked perhaps because she was giving off such wanton promise or because she longed to forget dino and everything at home what does f stand for asked a famous tennis player fuckable said fen sweetly and its spelt out in emeralds and pearls you can say that again said the tennis player as everyone laughed soon the journalists were hovering round her they kept asking her about billy and dino but she cracked back that she was married to her career and had no intention of getting a divorce she had a good deal to drink and had some difficulty negotiating even the short walk into the dining room she found herself sitting between a famous footballer with permed blond hair and a fake suntan named garry and an olympic shotputter whose arm muscles bulged through his dinner jacket whose stomach folded over the table and who lifted fen above his head to loud cheers when she complained she couldnt see the princess the first course because most people were in some sort of training was parma ham and melon which garry the footballer thought too outré for words you got a boyfriend he asked fen nope fort as much riding an orse is a substitute for sex what an original thing to say said fen politely molding her uneaten roll into pellets and chucking them at dudley stands to reason funny thing most of them look like orses but you dont youre talking garbage said the shotputter why dont you come home with me said garry the footballer wifes staying with her mother id give you more fun than an orse you reckon said fen suddenly all the flashbulbs exploded as the photographers clustered round a late arrival a tall dark very broadshouldered man wearing a dirty bomber jacket a dark blue shirt no tie jeans and sneakers he was extremely goodlooking in a brutal suntanned heavyeyelidded way and appeared not remotely embarrassed to be the only man in the room not wearing a dinner jacket the plane from rome was late he hadnt had time to change at the sight of him the convoy of waitresses rushing in like some musical comedy act nearly dropped the massive oblong silver plates of beef they were bearing aloft one comely brunette was so excited she gave the shotputter five slices of beef as she gazed entranced others dived for the kitchen and within seconds six plates of parma ham and melon were pressed on the new arrival from all sides followed by several very large glasses of bacardi and soda which he lined up in a row in front of him laughing all the while showing beautiful big white teeth with several gold fillings in the mat of black chest hair hung a gold st christopher medal whos that said the shotputter enrico mancini said fen the fastest driver on earth certainly beaves like it said garry disapprovingly i dont like racing drivers fink theyre gods gift not much skill in driving around and around the same track hes coarser looking than rupert thought fen watching enrico mancini joking with a couple of television commentators but he behaves with the same certainty that he owns the earth he was forking up parma ham very fast now his eyes raking the room for crumpet or cronies lovely beef said fen i dont know how they cook it on such a large scale she took a big slug of red wine and looking across at enrico mancini found he was staring at her christ he was taking the skin off her face she looked hurriedly away then glanced back five seconds later he was still staring gazing with peculiar intensity through a pot of yellow chrysanthemums her beef had lost all its appeal she took another slug of wine putting her elbow on the table it slid off as though it was greased when she looked back again hed moved the flowers and was smiling at her lounging lazily in his chair then he blew her a kiss fen blushed then found herself smiling eat up your beef fenella said the footballer youll never get to los angeles that way no thanks im full said fen putting her knife and fork together shame to waste it said the weightlifter forking up the slices of beef dudley diplock swayed over to have a chat launching into a long story about colonel roxborough how wonderful said fen after five minutes when it was obvious some response was expected i said hed had a stroke said dudley oh dear im sorry i misheard you who did you say colonel roxborough but hes expected to pull through fen could see enrico mancini writing a note on the back of a place card i reckon youve got a good chance of getting the womans award tonight said dudley how dreadful for the family said fen who thought they were still on colonel roxboroughs stroke the award fen if you do well have a chat straight to camera immediately afterwards good luck thanks dudley said fen her glass seemed to be full again and someone had brought her a large brandy and the pretty brunette waitress with some disappointment fen thought was handing her a card on the back of enrico mancinis place card was written will you come out with me afterwards fen looked up enrico was still staring at her with that knowing speculative supremely confident smile he raised his eyebrows fen shook her head mouthing i cant black or white said the waitress white no sorry i mean black must go to the toilet said the footballer fen had broken off some frosted grapes and was putting them in her bag wrapped in a paper napkin for darklis and isa when she felt a warm hand traveling the length of her back lasciviously fingering her spine there is no such word as cant said a husky latin voice spinning around she saw enrico had taken the footballers seat he had eyes the color of black treacle and an incredibly sensual mouth shaped rather like a car tire i wonder if he changes it after three laps when it gets worn out with kissing thought fen with a giggle why dyou laugh he said softly i dont find you funny i dont find you funny either stammered fen im just nervous with good cause said enrico you wont escape i have wanted you for a very long time about an hour said fen looking at her watch no no i see you on television in may in rome with desdemona when you beat my friend piero fratinelli his father makes my car then later you fall off macaulay and got on again with the concussion i said i must meet this girl she is not only beautiful but brave i am more attracted by courage than beauty in a woman you and i will be magnificent in bed you saw me in rome said fen amazed of course that ees the only reason i come here tonight they told me youd be here shall we go we cant said fen his eyebrows were so black and his hair so thick and his face so strong and commanding oh heavens thought fen in panic how can i not go to bed with him why not well its a bit rude before the speeches and the awards i will give you my own personal award said enrico staring at her breasts much better than some stupid prize besides ive got to go straight back to warwickshire at eleven oclock im leaving for amsterdam at fourthirty enrico looked at his massive digital watch pressing knobs how many miles more than a hundred and twenty at night that takes me one hour and ten minutes no more we leave london at three that gives us four hours if we leave now not long but quite long enough for the first time which should be brief passionate exquisite and leave one hungry for the next fortunately there was a roll of drums and it was announced the awards would begin in two minutes fen staggered off to the loo she looked pretty abandoned her hair was all over the place overwhelmed by frantic excitement she tipped half a bottle of diorissimo over her body and wandered back to the table to find garry having a frightful row with enrico for stealing his seat fen collapsed into hers as the lights dimmed garry who was even more drunk than fen was removed complaining bitterly to a chorus of shushes enrico poured fen another glass of wine what does hedonistic mean she asked the shotputter havent a clue nor have i but i think im about to be it she hardly heard a word of the speeches as in the dim twilight of their corner she felt enricos hand running all over her back firm warm powerful hands with splayed flat fingers and pudgy balls to the thumbs now they were inching round underneath the front of her dress you mustnt i must he said leaning across her to stub out his cigar ouch squealed fen as he bit her shoulder now his free hand was moving downwards slipping into the cleavage of her buttocks she leapt away as the lights blazed on the princess to thunderous applause was presenting the award for the male personality of the year to yet another famous footballer who was saying he was absolutely over the moon definitely and holding up his prize like a football cup when the princess started reading out the female nominations enrico started kissing fen enjoying the frantic swordplay of tongue and saliva she could feel the stubble of his cheeks he had a zoolike unwashed smell he was just like a stallion unheeding she kissed him back his hand was between her legs now if the lights hadnt blazed on again she had a feeling he would have taken her there and then in that dark corner the huge cheers seemed to be getting louder someone was tapping her on the shoulder youve been nominated whispered the shotputter fuck off growled enrico fen wriggled away from him just as the spotlight found her come here said enrico next moment there was a burst of cheering and dudley diplock was crying well done fen go on youve won everyone seemed to be helping her through the tables as she frantically straightened and pulled down her dress and wiped away the mascara smudged under her eyes oh shes crying bless her said a fat woman shes only eighteen and so unspoilt fen fell up the stairs and was picked up by dudley hello again congratulations said the princess laughing fen clutched the trophy which was a model of a silver pen writing on a silver page finally the deafening cheers were silenced fen took the microphone grinning fatuously honestly i had no idea i cant tell you how knocked out i am thank you sports writers for this stunning award it was all due to the horses ive just got good ones and my brilliant brotherinlaw lake jovell no that wasnt right i mean luke jovell she opened her hands despairingly im sorry im a bit over the top its excitement and all your wonderful hospitality everyone laughed and cheered dudley collared her for an interview but all she could think about was being in bed with enrico she could see him at the table fingers drumming impatiently he was not a man who would be kept waiting very long as she left she tapped one of the bbc minions on the shoulder could you tell the car thats supposed to be taking me back to warwickshire that i wont be needing it right ho dearie should i ring home theyre expecting me back by one oclock no said enrico his flat was all white with shagpile carpet as thick as a hayfield huge white sofas and walls lined with mirrors everywhere there were photographs of enrico winning races or being photographed with presidents and kings this is small place he said adjusting the dimmer switches in rome i haf really nice apartment in the drawing room he took off her dress then her tights and her panties then he turned the spotlights on her so that she was reflected a hundred times in the mirrored walls as though taking part in some vast orgy she wished her face wasnt so pink and weathered rather like a toffee apple compared with her slender white body at first she covered her breasts and her bush with her hands but she was too drunk really to mind im awfully rusty she mumbled can we have a long warmup first enrico shook up a bottle of moët chandon then opened it spraying it all over fens body and into every crevice then he picked her up and carried her into the bedroom where on a huge oval bed he proceeded very slowly and thoroughly to lick every drop off until fen was a squirming ecstatic bundle of desire god she thought he had a cock like a salami a lot of junk is talked about the size of the male member having no importance in sex and when a man is as magnificently endowed as enrico as skillful in manipulation and of such unquestionable sex appeal and the girl in question is as well lubricated as one of enricos engines the result is bound to be ecstatic for fen it was the most glorious hour of her life talk about a one night stunned she muttered afterwards hazily she looked at the clock beside the bed red eyes flickering like hers my god its a quarter to three we must go she said leaping to her feet enrico put out a hand stay with me give amsterdam a miss i cant the lorrys loaded the tickets booked i must go enrico leaned over kissing her and running his hand down her body you are like little schoolboy no next time i bugger you not sure muttered fen wriggling away i must be home by four the motorways were deserted she was almost more turned on by his handling of his ferrari and the subdued dragon roar of its engine he didnt seem to be driving fast at all and it was only as he overtook other night flyers that she looked at the speedometer and realized they were traveling at more than mph they hardly spoke one big hand rested between her thighs how long would she be in amsterdam he asked and where was she staying he would be in new york when she got back but he would be back in london for the last day of the olympia show when he would come and watch her she was to leave some tickets at the box office he had her home by five past four it would have been four oclock if he hadnt spent five minutes parked on the bridge with the engine growling leisurely kissing her good night his tongue tickling her epiglottis appy treep my darling he said as he dropped her off at the front gate thank god jakes still away thought fen as she walked up the path high heels crunching on the frozen grass the owls were hooting and the dog star was just sinking into his kennel behind potts meadow all was activity in the yard she could see sarah and louise putting on bandages and tail guards changing rugs in the lorry tory was making a lastminute check she crept unnoticed into the kitchen and went slap into dino still wearing the same check shirt jeans and sweater hed had on when she left he plainly hadnt been to bed and was absolutely white with anger where the hell have you been i havent been to hell at all rather the reverse she realized she was still tight ive just been finding out what hedonism is and i do agree its much better than celibacy for a second she thought he was going to hit her why the fuck didnt you call all the kids tory and the grooms saw you winning the award they were so excited they had a bottle of champagne ready to welcome you when you got back not that you looked as though you needed it from the way you fell up the stairs then you just disappear dont even bother to cancel the car i did i told a bbc man probably pissed like you anyway he never passed on the message no one got any sleep or knew whether to load up the horses we were all worried stiff enrico thought fen dreamily was stiff but not worried the grandfather clock in the hall struck the quarter hour were leaving in fifteen minutes said dino ill be ready dont worry at that moment tory came in oh fen where have you been i got diverted said fen weaving joyfully towards the door highly diverted im sorry to have caused so much trouble never had her bed looked so inviting shed only had time for a lightning shower and a change when she heard the lorry revving up bloody hell dino was just doing that to wind her up sweeping everything on top of her dressing table and the contents of her washbasin into a holdall and throwing lester on top she fled downstairs it was not an appy treep fens hangover descended like a million thunderbolts just as they reached southampton the crossing was frightful and she spent the entire time commuting between the hold where she comforted a terrified hardy until the petrol fumes overcame her and the ladies loo her face as a result of enricos stubble was blotched like salami dino louise and sarah blisteringly unsympathetic went off to a huge lunch and didnt even buy her a brandy to steady her stomach as the lorry which seemed so pedestrian after enricos ferrari steadily ate up the miles she was overcome by the depression that goes with extreme tiredness it had all been a dream she should never have let enrico take her to bed on the first night she would never see him again it was eleven oclock when they reached amsterdam midnight before the horses were stabled and fed and they reached the hotel louise was sleeping in the lorry sarah fen and dino in the hotel dino pointedly carried sarahs suitcase but not fens the manager came out to welcome them in perfect english miss maxwell mr ferranti you must be very tired would you like something to eat we can make some sandwiches id sure appreciate a drink said dino stretching after the long drive well be down in a minute the porter took them upstairs he reached fens room first and threw open the door fen was knocked sideways by the most heavenly scent she could hardly get inside for the flowers roses gardenias stephanotis banks and banks of freesias and hyacinths it was like suddenly coming out of a freezing cold night into a heated conservatory how gorgeous she gasped my god said sarah someone must have denuded every flower shop in the low countries not interflora but entireflora haha who on earth are they from fen took a card out of the tiny envelope lying on the bed adorable fen you were magnificent i die till monday week all my love e i say said sarah snatching the card dont screamed fen trying to snatch it back and keep the silly grin off her face who the hells e asked sarah prince edward edgar lustgarten ethelred the unready edward fox enry higgins eamonn andrews go on who is he who is e im not going to tell you said fen my trap is shut dino appeared at the door if were going to catch the restaurant before it closeschrist fen has a new boyfriend giggled sarah his name begins with e stands for excessive extravagant and extremely silly snapped dino no it doesnt said fen putting a freesia behind her ear and waltzing round the room it stands for edonism throughout the show fen jumped atrociously her mind was simply not on the horses she couldnt eat she couldnt sleep at night as she inhaled the heavy scent of the flowers which brought back the powerful disturbing image of enrico no man had any right to be that attractive he had discovered erogenous zones she didnt know existed she kept looking at her watch surprised that only a minute had passed on saturday night he telephoned her from new york the manager brought the telephone to the table where she and dino and louise were having a very scratchy dinner attempting to celebrate dinos win in a big class that evening the line was awful i cannot wait to have you in my arms cara said enrico and proceeding to tell her all the unmentionable things he was going to do to her when they met again fen was surprised the telephone didnt turn blue fen in turn went redder and redder acutely aware of dino listening in stony silence fen got an earful from jake when she got home even though they arrived back after midnight he had her up at the crack of dawn the next morning insisting she jump a new and extremely difficult novice round the indoor school with her arms folded stirrups crossed and reins knotted she fell off four times and ended up on the floor screaming at jake youre not going to make a bloody fool of yourself at olympia he said i suppose tory and dino have been sneaking they didnt need to one of the olympic scouts was in amsterdam he said if jesus christ had ridden that donkey into jerusalem the way you were riding laurel and hardy all week he deserved to be crucified the end of term jollities of the olympia christmas show were lost on fen this year parties were held every night in lorries and on trade stands dino went to all of them each with a different girl and deliberately got drunk fen went to none because she wanted to look beautiful for enrico which was difficult with the long hours and the airlessness of olympia and because sleep when she finally got to bed again evaded her because of the din outside gossip circulated as usual rupert campbellblack had acquired a new wonder horse from america called rock star which was reputed to have cost him his marriage on the other hand was in trouble helen had managed to do her christmas shopping without visiting olympia once the lloydfoxes by contrast were blissfully happy janey had embarked on a book on postnatal depression called the blues of the birth jakes leg was mending but no one thought he would make los angeles fen was showing a dramatic loss of form and so was dino ferranti wishbone despite being in the whisky tint every day had been placed in every class the days crawled by not eating properly fen was appalled to see that she was getting spots again not knowing where she was staying enrico sent flowers to her care of the bsja tent and lots of giggling exdebs carried them down to fens lorry which now according to dino looked like a hearse at long last it was the final day of the show and enrico was due that evening what dyou think said fen teetering on one of the bunks in the lorry so she could see her bottom half in the mirror opposite she was trying on a new pair of white sharkskin breeches specially made for her brilliant said sarah who was cleaning hardys bridle ive never seen anything so sexy they make your legs go on forever but you must wear panties underneath no itll ruin the line itll ruin your reputation if they split fen bent down straining the breeches to the limit and extracted a riding coat from the tissue paper in the cardboard box now what dyou think of these together she said triumphantly when shed shrugged her way into it the coat was dark purple instead of the regulation black or midnight blue lined with rosepink silk tightly fitting and only just skirting the top of her hip bones it made the perfect foil for the white breeches sarah whistled youll never get away with that its a bum freezer colonel roxborough will have another stroke you wait said fen i bet it starts a trend everyonell be wearing them in a few months not if youve got a bum griseldas size said sarah but it does look sexy incredibly but you look more like a page in figaro than a show jumper and i dont think the bsja will like it as long as enrico does thats all that matters thought fen i still think you ought to wear panties said sarah what else did you get faintly embarrassed by such extravagance fen produced a pale blue flying suit with zips everywhere and a pair of matching pale blue leather boots gorgeous sighed sarah enviously you must have spent your entire years winnings goodness i must go and get hardy ready wheres dino said fen idly suddenly wanting confirmation that her new riding clothes werent over the top playing poker with ludwig rupert and billy i dont think he went to bed at all last night fen neednt have worried her new clothes caused an instant sensation setting every photographer snapping and all the riders wolf whistling except dino and grisel who both looked extremely disapproving playing buttons in the christmas pantomime was dinos only comment just as she was walking the course for the last class of the show in despair that he wasnt going to turn up enrico arrived and caused an even bigger sensation wearing a red shirt a black coat with a huge astrakhan collar and half an inch of stubble on his chin he was accompanied by a girl and a man the girl deeply tanned with her streaked blond hair scraped back into a bun was wearing huge gold hoop earrings and the sort of long squashy fur coat destined to put her straight onto the hit list of the animal rights movement the man also blond was wearing dark glasses a pale blue flying suit identical to fens and carrying a pale blue handbag hell thought fen that means i cant wear my flying suit tonight wed look like hers and hers enrico who had found the tickets fen had left for him at the box office was making a lot of noise settling in all the freshfaced pony club girls the horsey ladies and the fathers in their barbours with three whiskys under their belts were looking at him in amazement look theres enrico mancini said rupert whos that bird with him annafabiola caraccio said dino shes a friend of mary jos and with them is that fag designer ralphie walcott e for enrico thought dino that was it that explained the booming exhaust on the bridge he watched fen go crimson giving enrico a fleeting wave and mouthing that shed be over to see him as soon as shed jumped the first round damn damn damn damn thought dino his heart twisting with misery for once fen was glad she was drawn first even though shed hardly taken in the course when she walked it she managed to transmit her elation to a rather jaded hardy who went around without touching a fence to the noisy delight of the crowd hardly bothering to pat him fen threw her reins to the waiting sarah and ran off dino watching from the riders stand saw fen mounting the steps her spiky blond hair gleaming turning every head with those shiny tight white breeches he saw enrico get up and kiss both her hands and her lips and then because the people behind were complaining they couldnt see driffield jumping watched him sit down and pull fen onto his knee i though you werent coming said fen carissima purred enrico sounding rather like one of his own engines the traffic was terrible all those stupid peoples looking at the lights then we have to queue at the entrance ralphie ere ad his andbag searched ave we missed a lot that was a beautiful round you look so sexy in those trousers he ran his hand up her inner thighs till it came to rest on her crotch noticing disapproving glances from all around particularly from the royal box fen wriggled away were going to a party said enrico dont change just come like that can you leave now not really said fen feeling flustered ive got another round to jump and i might be in the jumpoff give it the miss said enrico putting his hand back onto her groin i cant really said fen thinking of the money shed spent that morning too much at stake dont be seely enrico said the beautiful girl haff some selfcontrol you wouldnt stop in the middle of a grand prix those trousers they turn me on so much complained enrico wishbone had just come in but no one sitting near fen and enrico was watching him at all crimson with embarrassment fen escaped back to the riders stand vroom vroom teased rupert you are flying high enricos got an even worse reputation than i have watch out he doesnt give you the big e dino having kicked manny with unaccustomed viciousness as they went into the ring jumped appallingly and knocked up such a cricket score that he didnt even qualify for the second round only sixteen riders went through fen going first went clear again instantly she went off to placate enrico she was appalled to find him creating yet another disturbance infuriating everyone by coming out in the middle of billys round you have finished no he demanded no im terribly sorry not yet i should be through in about threequarters of an hour but ive got to jump off and then change dont change a theeng i want you like that said enrico stopping to give her a lingering kiss for christs sake get a move on rico snapped ralphie who was still trapped in the row and being told from all sides to sit down you go on to the party said fen ill meet you there ees better said enrico give her the address ralphie are you sure its not smart and i can wear this asked fen si said enrico his hand on her crotch again come and come and come as you are in a turmoil fen went back to the collecting ring the second round over the arena party rushed on with brushes to smooth the tan the band played carols oh come all ye unfaithful sang rupert wheres dino said fen looking at the jumpoff course she suddenly felt nervous and uncertain needing his advice disappeared somewhere said sarah he seemed terribly choked about his round fen cantered hardy around the collecting ring trying to get him on his toes it was like sitting on a log for once he wasnt even fighting for his head as her number was called she saw dino go into the riders stand he was wearing a suit his hair wet from the shower he must be angry if he didnt even come and wish her good luck there was at stake going first her only answer was to put in such a fast clear shed frighten the others into making mistakes there was no doubt hardy was exhausted for once she had really to push him on for all her worth she cleared the first four fences without too much difficulty then pulled him too sharply into the triple unable to make it and to avoid crashing into the wing he ran out yanking him back she rode straight at the jump from three yards away and just cleared it only the combination was left but hardy was all to pieces now he took off too early at the first element and fen had to hurl herself forward in a supreme effort to keep her weight off him and not jab him in the mouth alas the effort was too much for her new breeches as she flew through the air she was aware of a dreadful ripping sound and the sharkskin split right down the back there was nothing she could do she was going too fast she had to jump the remaining two elements splitting the breeches further each time until her entire backside was exposed with no long coat to cover it as she whipped through the finishing line the entire riders stand stood up cheering the crowd was in an uproar half drunken guffaws half wails of embarrassment and sympathy the photographers had no such scruples and rushed forward an excited snapping leaping pack frantically tugging hardy to a standstill in front of a bank of pink chrysanthemums fen put her hands down to assess the damage and encountering so much bare flesh clapped her hands over her eyes leaving hardy to trot around the ring reins flapping next moment the coursebuilder was rushing towards her with a coat but dino was too quick for him vaulting over the hedge of red poinsettias in front of the riders stand he sprinted across the tan captured a somewhat bewildered hardy and tearing off his gray jacket put it around fen leading her sobbing out of the ring reporters converged on them from all sides great viewing said rupert who was about to jump and was laughing his head off now i know why that fence is called the combination nanny used to wear combs that split up the back like yours fuck off snapped dino pulling fen off hardy whom he left to sarah he hustled her through the crowd before she knew it she was back in the lorry bloody little fool he yelled slamming the door behind them why the hell didnt you wear panties fen looked at him aghast her eyes full of tears not even able to speak so he answered for her because you wanted to excite the hell out of your new boyfriend right well hes no bloody good for you i can tell you here and now how dyou know used to screw an old girlfriend of mine gave her crabs in fact just proving that latins are lousy lovers thats not funny sobbed fen im amazed he asked you out a second time he went on furiously fuck em and forget em thats his motto bloody mafia thug do you honestly think hes the way to get over billy couldnt even wait for you to finish your class could he he had to go to a party you bet he did and by the time you got there hed have picked up another bit of trash youre just jealous screamed fen because hes so attractive fighting to control his temper dino took a deep breath all im saying he said in a calmer voice is that the guy is bad mad stupid cruel and insensitive but if you insist on finding that out for yourself dont come whining to me when he ditches you now youd better get changed you must be fifth and youve got to collect your money i am not going back into that ring dont be such a drip go back in and laugh it off and that mobll eat out of your hand youve bared it now youve got to grin and then were going home im bloody not said fen im going to join enrico at that party then ive got a broadcast at the bbc first thing tomorrow morning ill make my own way home there was a bang on the door it was louise fen sarah says theyre waiting for you im not coming and you can get out she added to dino i want to change you need to change said dino brutally back into a decent human being you were a really sweet kid when i first met you i wonder whatever happened to her get out screamed fen out of my life as soon as hed gone she gave way to tears horrible man how dare he say those awful things she couldnt wait to reach enrico to be soothed by his admiration and distracted from her misery and humiliation by his lovemaking but what the hell could she wear her breeches were only fit for the bonfire she couldnt turn up in the same flying suit as ralphie she only had a pair of black jeans and a white shirt and she was far too drained to wear white rifling through sarahs drawer she unearthed a black tshirt itd have to do shed settle for looking pale interesting and understated enrico had liked her in black last time she knew she ought to have gone back into the arena she ought to ring jake and to check that hardy was all right but all she could think of was getting to that party before enrico whizzed on to another one she didnt believe dino she was sure he was jealous but hed sown a whole seed packet of doubts the repeated hammerings on the door distracted her party eye makeup only seemed to emphasize the tiredness of her eyes she now had three spots instead of two and makeup failed to disguise them obsessed that her breath might smell because shed eaten so little recently she cleaned her teeth until her gums bled then cheered herself up by making a dracula face in the mirror outside the lorry she went slap into a swarm of reporters who peppered her with questions about dino enrico and her breeches without dino it was almost impossible to throw them off and she was forced to run out of olympia into the homegoing crowd who all stared and pointed at her with so many christmas parties around it was impossible to find a taxi not knowing london well fen started to walk in the direction of eaton square which was the address ralphie had given her it was bitterly cold half an hour later frozen stiff her feet like blocks of ice in her highheeled shoes she reached knightsbridge and found a cab she hardly had time to cover her red nose and her three spots which had reappeared when the cab pulled up her heart sank when a spectacular but utterly stoned girl opened the door her bright pink hair matched her trousers her sequined waistcoat only just covered her nipples hi she said vaguely is enrico here the girl gave a silly laugh somewhere he is come in having repaired her face as best she could fen went into a big dimly lit room people with glazed expressions were having offcenter conversations everyone was very done up and glamorous fen recognized several wellknown actresses two women were necking in a corner a man in a ballet skirt and a tweed coat was asleep on the sofa there was no sign of enrico she found him in the next room in a corner with fabiola on his knee one hand inside her shirt the other halfway up her thigh he was talking to two other girls heart hammering fen walked over hello enrico fenella at least he tipped annafabiola off and came towards her for a minute she was wrapped in warm masculine reassurance as he held her to his chest but she could also smell stale sweat and there was garlic and whisky on his breath when he kissed her he let her go and led her back to annafabiola who smiled vacantly the two girls whod been vying for his attention looked at fen as though she was something the cat couldnt even bother to bring in she desperately needed a drink what happened to your breeches said enrico i wanted to ave you like that they split in the jumpoff said fen miserably in front of ten thousand people it was awful but enrico wasnt interested he was talking to ralphie whod just wandered over with his flying suit undone almost to his crotch so as to display a pink hairless chest in the end fen was forced to find her own drink when she came back enrico had undone all the buttons of annafabiolas shirt and was playing with her breasts isnt she lovely he said to fen wouldnt you like to play with her too with a sob fen turned away suddenly she wished she was going home in the lorry with dino and sarah home to reality and sanity she was exhausted sober desperately in need of comfort and bitterly aware that she was looking her worst and couldnt compete with any of the girls hanging around enrico she was amazed when he followed her taking her upstairs and opening and shutting several doors before he found an empty bedroom there was no lock on the door we cant said fen aghast someone might come in lets hope they will said enrico you are very sexy cara you need to be shared next moment he was undressed lying on his back his chest matted with black hairs like an ape his cock rising like some grotesque italian pepper grinder the smell of unwashed body assailed her as she knelt over him she suddenly remembered dinos warning about crabs when enrico seized her head forcing it down she nearly threw up go on little schoolboy you make love to me this time his hand was fingering her bum crack appalled she wished she could ram her tail between her legs like wolf it was all horrible with none of the ecstasy of the last time she longed to run away but she had nowhere to go there were no trains to warwickshire at this hour anyway she had to do the broadcast there was a bang on the door fen snatched the sheet round her it was ralphie and annafabiola come and join us said enrico holding out his arms leaping out of bed fen snatched up her clothes and fled past them she spent the night shivering on a tiny sofa in some maids room which actually had a lock on the door all she could think about was getting back to the mill house to tell dino what a fool shed been somehow she got herself together and to the bbc by ten oclock in the morning it was a childrens program she couldnt let them down she was met by a very embarrassed producer who said that as doctor seuss was in town theyd had to completely rejig the program and very sadly wouldnt be needing her after all of course shed be paid all expenses and her fee and she must come another time theyd be in touch fen knew perfectly well he was lying that hed seen the story and the photographs of her breeches splitting in all the morning papers and was terrified she might corrupt the young all the way home in the train fen died of shame as she huddled behind dark glasses coat collar turned up watching businessmen glued to and gloating over her photograph the headlines were predictable bottoms up said the sun cheeky fen said the mirror tory met her at warwick station looking very redeyed fen thought it was because shed been behaving so badly im sorry i didnt ring she stammered i meant to but i was so choked about my breeches splitting when did the others get back about three in the morning said tory starting up the land rover wolf in the back crept forwards wagging his tail and putting his rough face against fens cheek at least she had one friend for a mile or so they didnt speak it was a mean gray day the only color came from the last red beech leaves and the blond grasses edging the road was dino in an awful state mumbled fen there was a pause then tory said hes gone gone said fen where suddenly she felt as if shed jumped out of a plane and her parachute wasnt opening back to america but he cant have whispered fen he left this afternoon loaded up the horses and everything but whatever for said fen aghast he didnt say said tory bursting into tears did he did he leave any message for me only to say hed probably see you in los angeles nothing else he gave me a dishwasher sobbed tory it arrived half an hour after hed gone back in november that same year helen campbellblack sat in james bensons waiting room flipping through the houses for sale in country life and idly wondering how much penscombe was worth glancing at her gold watch she decided there wasnt really time before her appointment to rush to the john for yet another quick cleanup it seemed ludicrous after having two kids that she was still desperately embarrassed by anything down there she shifted slightly on the leather sofa the irritation was really awful and not helped by her worrying about it all the time outside the waiting room a group of starlings ravenous after a week of hard frosts were jostling each other around the bird table a thrush darted forward warily grabbing a crust that had fallen on the starched white grass and carrying it off to the safety of a nearby ash tree helen admired his speckled breast and bright eyes how odd that the bird and the complaint between her legs should have the same name what a beautiful woman thought the nurse as she showed helen into the consulting room if there was one patient likely to make dr benson flout the hippocratic oath it was she he always insisted on seeing helen on the last appointment before lunch so he could spend more time with her and although he was supposed to be a friend of the husbands he never referred to him in any other way than as that shit campbellblack this mornings examination did nothing to revise dr bensons opinion but as he ushered helen back to her chair his face was as bland as ever im afraid you havent got thrush he said its the clap i beg your pardon the clap gonorrhea for a second he thought she was going to faint what she gasped gonorrhea he said gently but i cant have i mean i havent i wouldnt sleep with anyone but her voice trailed off im sure not but whatever youve heard to the contrary it really isnt caught from lavatory seats so in fact she began when did you last have intercourse with rupert she tried to pull herself together trying to remember about a fortnight ago that was probably it although it could have lain dormant longer dont worry its easy to cure helen started to cry benson went to the cupboard and poured her a large gin and tonic even adding ice and lemon it was several minutes before she could bring herself to drink it as though she were terrified of contaminating the glass benson yearned to take her in his arms and comfort her but he could still hear his secretary typing outside and with four children at public school he could ill afford to jeopardize a brilliant career i cant believe it helen said in a choked voice i feel so polluted and where can rupert have got it from benson shrugged some passing scrubber on a trip abroad then seeing the anguish in her face you know far from home missing you needing to celebrate a victory wont have meant a thing to him hed better come and see me the moment he gets back hell have to be off sex for a bit too i cant believe it helen said again gazing into space shaking violently benson was surprised he only saw a reaction like this when he told parents their children had some fatal disease or had to break the news to a patient that they had cancer youll need a course of penicillin injections nothing to worry about he turned to his desk and im going to give you tranquilizers and some sleeping pills to tide you over the next few days cheer up it happens to the best people i feel so contaminated whispered helen how could rupert do it probably didnt know come on well organize the jabs and then ill buy you lunch no helen leapt up cringing away from him i couldnt force myself on anyone knowing this helen had to wait until late the following night to confront rupert although the entire household was aware something was up the grooms mrs bodkin charlene the nanny all knew that mrs cb had gone off to see handsome dr benson and had returned whitefaced had locked herself in her bedroom and had given way to hysterical sobbing didnt touch any lunch or dinner said charlene didnt even come and say good night to the children might be a hysterectomy might be cancer of the womb said mrs bodkin in excitement might be another baby said dizzy which means she cant walk out on his nibs for another nine months if it is im off im not looking after three children said charlene what dyou think itd be like working in public relations rupert got back from hamburg about nine oclock he realized something was up when helen didnt come down and say hello although far off were the days shed charged down the stairs to fling herself into his arms he dumped his case in the kitchen all dirty washing he said to charlene who had positioned herself at the kitchen table it being the best place to hear any excitement and was reading the daily mail and eating a yogurt look what i bought for tab said rupert proudly producing an exquisite german doll in national costume according to the instructions on the box she does almost everything except say oooh at the moment of orgasm beautiful said charlene what did you get marcus sweets said rupert blandly i must have left them in the lorry i suppose i better give them to him in the morning bastard charlene said to herself wheres helen in her room she all right not in carnival mood know what its about shes been a bit jumpy all week went to see dr benson yesterday and came back in a frightful state oh dear said rupert pouring himself a large whisky id better go and see her then his eye was caught by a recipe on the corkboard in helens writing entitled how to make prawns and kiwi fruit in pernodflavored mayonnaise getting out his fountain pen he wrote oh please dont charlene giggled so rupert proceeded to tell her how his new horse rock star had gone he really is world class if i cant get a gold with him i might as well retire when he went upstairs an hour and several whiskies later he found the bedroom door locked let me in go away screamed helen ill break the door down or shoot it out if youd prefer after a long pause she unlocked it christ you look as if a trains hit you hed never seen her so gray i went to james benson yesterday so i hear are we expecting quads dont you dare be flip she hissed ive got gonorrhea really drawled rupert his dark blue eyes suddenly taking on that opaque look you must be more careful who you leap into bed with in future stop it stop it screamed helen you know perfectly well i havent slept with anyone but you i dont know that at all said rupert coldly i see little enough of you and your extreme reluctance to come on any of my trips abroad would rather suggest the contrary you bastard yelled helen you caught it from one of your disgusting whores oh come on youve got absolutely no proof ive certainly got the clap i was treated for it in hamburg those german clinics are like sainsburys on a saturday morning but i caught it from you dont put that number on me ive never looked at another man since i married you what about dino ferranti said rupert softly hes been in england for six weeks rumor has it he spends most of his nights on away fixtures i havent been near dino or anyone else said helen you gave it me and you know it im leaving you and im taking the children you can take marcus yelled rupert but if you lay a finger on tab ill fight you in every court in this country this was the final straw maddened helen tried to lash out at him but rupert dodged back and only the ends of her long colorless nails caught his cheek the next moment the door opened it was marcus red hair ruffled eyes huge with terror pajama top falling off thtop thouting daddy please thtop thouting tabitha toddled in after him wearing only the top half of her pajamas nappy discarded daddy daddy she squealed in delight running towards him daddy home then seeing blood on his face daddy got a hurt poor daddys indeed got a hurt said rupert pulling a couple of tissues out of the box on helens dressing table to stem the bleeding then gathering tab up in his arms he walked out of the room im beginning to think you and badger are my only fans helen with a superhuman effort pulled herself together daddy has cut himself shaving she told marcus everyone loved everybody she went on she was absolutely fine anything to ward off an asthma attack but thin mucus was trickling from his nose a sure sign that one was on the way he was having difficulty in breathing oh god it was her fault for locking herself in her room and not coming to say good night he must have heard her crying relax marcus please soon she had laid him facedown across her lap tapping his frail ribs with cupped hands to force the mucus out of the bronchial tubes as the physiotherapist had taught her he had swallowed so much phlegm eventually he threw up all over her and the carpet by the time she had got him to bed and calmed him down read him a story and cleaned up the mess it was long after midnight the light was on in ruperts dressing room on the bed she found rupert fully dressed stretched out fast asleep with the sleeping tab in his arms photographs of rock star were scattered all over the bed and the floor in their blond beauty and their carefree abandonment they were so alike when helen tried to take tab back to her own bed the child went rigid in her sleep and clung on so helen left them back in her bedroom she wearily took a couple of sleeping pills and tried to think rationally about her marriage she was trapped trapped trapped she longed to leave rupert but where could she go certainly not home to her parents the tensions of those two months in florida last summer had put paid to that and how could she ever afford marcuss colossal medical bills in the states and if she walked out taking the children they would have to give up so much penscombe the valley the swimming pool the camp up in the woods the tennis court the horses the skiing the jetset existence the fleet of servants not to mention the library and the pictures which they would probably appreciate later all this for life in a onebedroom flat janey at least had a career and could support herself helen had nothing her novel to be honest was merely a series of jottings she poured everything out in her journal sometimes leaving it around in the hope that rupert might read it and realize how unhappy she was but he only read dick francis and horse and hound maybe he was as unhappy as she was and only bullying marcus to work off his frustrations yet she was only twentyseven was this emotional dead end really all there was to life admittedly there were times of comparative contentment when rupert was away which was after all eleven months of the year interspersed with periods of desperation like the present one when he humiliated her publicly by chasing other women and now giving her the clap she was only twentyseven she longed for love but having been married to rupert for six and a half years she felt she had become what he kept telling her she was boring prissy brittle and frigid he had so sapped her selfconfidence that she didnt think shed ever be able to hold another guy she knew she attracted people like malise dino and james benson but was sure they would all lose interest once they got her into bed zonked by sleeping pills helen didnt come down until eleven oclock the next day she found marcus guzzling german chocolates sweet papers everywhere where did you get those from she said furiously daddy bought them for me helen went storming into the tackroom youve given marcus candy youre always reproaching me for not giving him presents the one time i remember i get it in the neck you know the kids arent allowed candy except after lunch how can i raise them when you spend your time undermining my authority what authority producing a whining sickly little milksop thats because hes terrified of you the marriage limped on for a few more weeks helen continued to paint the house different colors spending a fortune on wallpaper and fabrics one day im going to wake up and find ive been completely reupholstered in laura ashley grumbled rupert as dr benson had predicted helen and rupert recovered from the clap rock star continued to sweep the board and provide a powerful new interest for rupert achieving almost a walkover at the olympia christmas show the following sunday the last before christmas janey and billy lay in bed reading the papers christ said janey have you seen this hell said billy dyou think its true im sure and checked for libel or they wouldnt risk it helens going to do her nut the campbellblacks were having roast beef for sunday lunch rupert was just carving second helpings when he was called away to the telephone helen cleared away the childrens plates helping them to apple pie and cream and then settled down with the sunday papers to wait until rupert came off the telephone she glanced at the one on the top of the pile it was an awful rag but you had to read it some starlet named samantha freebody was naming her loves on page six the little tramp helen read about the antics of several deviant vicars and lascivious witches then turned to page six and froze for there confronting her was a large picture of rupert lying on a beach in bathing trunks eyes narrowed against the sun glass in his hand palm trees in the background one of my most thrilling affairs samantha freebody had written was with international showjumping ace rupert campbellblack i was filming in portugal and he came out for five days as part of the british showjumping team we met at a party i was swept off my feet by his blond blueeyed good looks and his air of tremendous selfconfidence hed had a good win in the show ring that day and having met me was keen to keep on riding all night at first i resisted his advances i didnt want to appear cheap but a tide of champagne and euphoria swept us down to the beach and at two oclock in the morning we made passionate love under the stars until the warm waves washed over us for the rest of the five days we were inseparable loving each other all night by day i would go and watch him in the ring after five days we decided to end our idyll he had other shows to go on to i had to finish my movie he was married his wife expecting her second baby it was only fair to give him back to her but i really enjoyed the novelty of our naughty racy lovemaking can i get down said marcus for the second time may i said helen automatically getting up and lifting tab out of her high chair go and watch television darlings upstairs she locked herself in the loo and threw up and up and up rupert was waiting as she came out what on earths the matter you sound like jake lovell before a big class look at this croaked helen handing him the paper rupert skimmed through it without a flicker of expression load of rubbish dont believe a word of it the dates tally you were in portugal just before i had tab just ignore it said rupert that girls publicity mad i dont understand you screamed helen you go berserk if anyone criticizes the way you ride i ride for a living thats what matters i dont fuck for a living could have fooled me she obviously does i wonder how much she got said rupert picking up the paper again arent you even going to sue whats the point rupert shrugged if you leave mud to dry you can brush it off what did you do with the roast beef i want a second helping you can honestly eat having read that said helen appalled and how am i supposed to cope mothers sniggering at the playgroup mrs bodkin charlene and the grooms all talking their heads off im sure theyll enjoy it enormously how can i ever hold my head up in the village shop again ask them to deliver said rupert matters were not improved a week later when a leading columnist in the sunday times took samantha freebody to the cleaners for naming names how must rupert campbellblacks unfortunate wife and children feel the answer was much much worse everyone who hadnt seen the original piece rushed off to the library to read it a couple of days later janey rang up rupert to wish him a happy new year and for gods sake hide private eye she went on youve been nominated whites shit of the year thank god its now said rupert apart from buying rocky hasnt been the greatest of years in the evening rupert found helen in the drawing room writing letters he wished she wouldnt always wear her hair up these days like a confirmed spinster applying for a new husband he said helen gritted her teeth and didnt answer rupert crossed the room and kissed the nape of her white neck im sorry i gave you the clap and went to bed with samantha freebody i am totally in the wrong there is absolutely no excuse but the more you reject me and take no part in what i do the worse it becomes come on get up the sudden unexpected overture totally disarmed her there there he said drawing her against him its all right shall we have another try im going to cancel the next two shows and take you abroad charlie masters has offered us his house outside nairobi we can lie in the sun and ill give you the honeymoon you never had and i will heal me of my grievous wound quoted helen sadly grievous womb demanded rupert you been to see benson again helen shook her head smiling faintly thats better said rupert it seems an awfully long time since you smiled what about the children theyre not coming said rupert firmly nor are the dogs just you and me on our own and ill start off tonight by taking you out to dinner the doorbell rang it was janey billy had gone to some evening show in warwickshire and she was at a loose end come and have a drink said rupert helen and i are having a rapprochement about time said janey she was full of gossip and in high good humor evidently fenella maxwell had gone into a complete decline since dino ferranti had walked out fen didnt seem very good at holding men she added with satisfaction janey had lapsed in her resolution to give up drink while she was pregnant but at least she had cut down and was only drinking wine helen could hardly believe her ears half an hour later when she heard rupert saying to janey why dont you come out to dinner with us she went upstairs and sat on her bed in a rage for ten minutes then she steeled herself to be tolerant after all janey was on her own downstairs she found tabitha had invaded the drawing room reducing the place to chaos every ornament had been moved janeys handbag had been upended and a flotsam of bus tickets old telephone numbers pens defunct mascara wands and dirty combs lay scattered over the floor then she started screaming for sweets and for daddy to read her a story on being told daddy was going out the screaming redoubled picking her up under one arm rupert took her upstairs for charlene to sort out that child is more destructive than a jcb said janey reloading her bag dont ever worry that rupert will leave you for another woman no stepmother would take on that monster helen was appalled how pleased she was because janey was bitching about tab rupert hadnt bothered to book but as usual the best table in the restaurant was rustled up straightaway everyone was staring and nudging look whos just walked in it is isnt it hes even better in the flesh helen wished she had washed her hair where are you going for your second honeymoon asked janey kenya said helen some golfing friends of my parents have just gone there on safari theyre called dick and fanny can you imagine janey could always make rupert laugh thought helen with a stab of envy have you heard the latest samantha freebody story janey went on squeezing lemon on her smoked salmon whats the difference between samantha freebody and a kitkat what asked rupert you can only get four fingers in a kitkat rupert howled with laughter and helen although blushing furiously joined in billy bumped into her at the opening of some sports center last night janey went on he was going to cut her dead when she accosted him and said youve got a hole in your jersey and billy replied quick as a flash youve got a hole between your legs but the difference between us is i dont write about my hole all over the papers shes so publicity mad the old slag heap billy says shed turn up for the opening of an envelope somehow by bringing the whole awful business into the open janey was making things much better thought helen now she was attacking rupert youre a monster to helen you treat her appallingly i dont remember you treating billy all that well in the past said rupert coldly that was only once i just needed to prove that billy was really the only man for me im with him for keeps now janey was being real nice thought helen so upfront and supportive it was such a novelty to be talked about and defended and argued over that helen drank more than usual while they were having coffee she went to the loo all right they both said solicitously when she came back ruperts just suggested that billy and i fly out to join you in kenya for one of the weeks said janey but but i thought it was supposed to be a honeymoon stammered helen rupert didnt quite meet her eyes all honeymoons should be spent in duplicate said janey helen and ill come if you and billy promise not to talk about horses charlie masterss house a few miles outside nairobi was perfect open balconied it had papyrus walls leopard skins on the floor a vast sunken bath comfortable beds and a fleet of smiling african boys who could not only cook but didnt turn a hair at any outlandish english antics the garden lushly crowded with jacaranda flame trees and a sweetsmelling tangle of herbaceous plants also contained a tennis court and a swimming pool ringed with palm trees all around lay the bush and helen had the feeling that the house was only here by the courtesy of nature and that any minute the jungle might take over from the start the holiday was a disaster with billy and janey around she and rupert never had a moment to themselves billy and rupert tended to play tennis or swim all morning followed by a large lunch and lots of alcohol then sleep or sunbathing followed by more tennis and swimming followed by a large dinner more drinking and a trip round the nairobi nightclubs billy was drinking again not to excess but on holiday he reckoned he was justified in coming off the wagon helen exhausted and emotionally bankrupt wanted to sleep be cherished and made love to in the gentlest way and to talk through her and ruperts problems she tried to persuade rupert to dine alone with her but the others seemed always to come along too she was deeply embarrassed too by the way rupert and billy wandered round the garden with no clothes on their cocks wiggling like those rubber devils that hang from driving mirrors she was sure janey wore a bikini only because she was pregnant helen worried too about the children well mostly marcus and insisted on telephoning home every day from the local post office which was extremely timeconsuming and irritated the hell out of rupert finally being rupert as soon as he and billy hit kenya people discovered they were there and old friends started ringing up and inviting them to parties newspapers wanted to interview them kenyan television wanted to send down a crew the alacrity with which rupert welcomed every diversion made it obvious that he didnt want to get away from it all in the least after one long boozy lunch when rupert and billy had gone out on safari helen unbuttoned slightly to janey i simply dont know what to do our marriage is in smithereens rupert simply doesnt want to spend time with me i feel everything i do gets on his nerves janey poured herself another glass of wine want one helen shook her head oh all right just a small one they took their glasses out onto the terrace a shower of rain had rinsed the earth and a rainbow arced over the jacaranda trees i think youre too subservient said janey i mean billy was lovely but pretty casual before i took off with kev billy was always very caring said helen but he was always happy to booze with his chums rather than come home to me why dont you try making rupert jealous he was jolly broody over dino ferranti even talked to billy about having your telephone tapped helen looked amazed he had no cause there was nothing between dino and me except a few lunches ha said janey rupert is aware how fragile a thing possession is he cant imagine anyone having lunch with anyone elses wife without evil intent he thinks everyone is like himself but what can i do we cant go on like this dont shove off until youve found someone else if youre going to be virtually a single parent why not get paid for it if you left rupe you wouldnt be able to buy dresses like that or do up the house every two years its very cold outside the marital cage it was so oppressively hot that they returned to janey and billys bedroom sitting on the bed helen appeared to let off a huge fart crimson she jumped to her feet that wasnt me janey laughed youve sat on my vibrator helen took a slug of wine if your sex lifes so good she said why dyou need a vibrator oh theyre lovely sighed janey and they do jazz things up billys wonderful but not absolutely infallible outside the crickets were shrilling their permanent burglar alarm the frogs croaked in lazy lechery janey peered at her smooth brown face in the mirror god i look like a hag look at all these wrinkles you havent got any said helen and now youve given up smoking you wont get all those little lines around your mouth im bound to get them as punishment for all the men ive sucked off said janey ruefully helen turned away shocked what an appalling thing to say shed only sucked rupert off once and been so revolted shed never done it again she realized in despair how many lightyears sexually she was behind janey she must try and catch up blushing even further taking another huge gulp of wine and gazing at the eyeless african mask on the wall she asked do you do you really enjoy doing that to men janey shrugged well its an acquired taste whisky and dry martinis dont taste very nice the first time its all right if you swallow it fast i said to billy the other day its a pity one cant have it with tonic or better still with ice and lemon the trouble with sex is that all sorts of things are wildly exciting in fantasy but no good when they happen i get frightfully turned on by the thought of being buggered even whipped but when darling billy tried it i didnt like it at all that evening they all went to a party which continued in a state of rampage and carousal until eight oclock in the morning neither rupert nor billy felt like playing tennis the next morning so they lazed round the pool helen was wearing dark glasses a large hat to prevent her freckles spreading and a lime green bathing suit shes so thin now shes really better covered up thought janey critically every day janeyd start on another diet and abandon it by lunchtime when rupert opened a bottle and the smell of abduls cooking drifted out from the kitchen but her skin was turning as golden as a peach she was four months pregnant and billy liked her plump anyway helen having finished yesterdays guardian was reading crime and punishment with effort janey was reading vogue rupert was flipping through horse and hound for mentions of his name billy was reading through a pornographic novel skipping until he came to the sex bits jomo the african boy was steadily but unhurriedly sweeping up jacaranda petals and bird droppings morning glory spread in a sapphire haze over the tennis court wire vying with the sky in blueness have you ever tried that said billy handing the book to rupert once in solihull during the royal let me see said janey no you cant said billy or youd go back to bed for the rest of the morning and youve only got another week to get brown billy never finished histoire do said janey peeling a piece of loose skin off her heel he kept having to take me upstairs between pages rupert got up to pour himself a drink he was broadshouldered bronzed and rippling fit as any of his horses thought janey she lifted her thighs slightly off the lilo so the flesh fell downwards and they looked thinner bikinis are awfully stupid things said janey you look as though youd got one on when you take it off take it off then said billy idly not looking up from his book janey encountered a searching look from rupert all right she said and removed her bikini her breasts had a soft honeyed ripeness her round belly swelled like a fig and her bush was shaved leaving her as smooth as a pink snooker ball helen rigid with shock and envy couldnt take her eyes off her billy looked up and found rupert staring at janey with an erection like a steeple next moment billy found he had an erection like a steeple too christ its like a cathedral city round here he said rolling over and returning to his book without turning his head rupert said to helen take your bathing dress off too i cant i burn so easily use plenty of oil said janey her breasts moving as she handed helen the amber solaire im fine snapped helen take it off repeated rupert with a distinct edge to his voice no what would jomo think its all right for janey shes a guest id never be able to look abdul in the face again when i discussed desserts she turned back to crime and punishment and read a whole page without taking in a word abdul seemed to take an enormously long time clearing up ashtrays and taking orders for drinks i cant do it i cant thought helen in panic i cant take my clothes off in front of them and besides said an inner more truthful voice my boobs arent as good as janeys janey didnt bother to dress for a late lunch which started with salad niçoise a large piece of tuna fish fell on her left breast rupert removed it with a spoon everyone including abdul giggled immoderately except helen who was a tight knot of embarrassment inside realizing this billy tried to persuade janey to get dressed but the atmosphere was getting more and more highly charged im going to have a siesta said janey whod been exchanging lingering glances with rupert inside seeing her flushed face and bloodshot eyes she felt irritated at how awful she looked and wondered how she could have flirted so much with him the next minute billy had come up behind her catching her oiled breasts in his hands kissing the back of her neck slipping his hands between her legs which seemed even more oiled christ youre excited he said instantly they were on the bed not bothering to close the windows or the door helen went into her bedroom next door despite the oppressive heat she was trembling violently she could hear janeys cries and moans and hastily shut the window rupert came in redfaced and hardeyed god its hot in here why the hell have you shut the window opening it he paused for a few seconds listening to janey and billy a halfsmile on his face helen was desperate for him to make love to her gently and tenderly not because she really wanted it but because shed seen the intense predatory way hed suddenly started looking at janey shed die if he had an affair with her rupert i do love you why dont you show it then its so hard when youre always so angry with me oh for christs sake he walked out slamming the door he returned when it was dark and helen was changing for dinner grabbing her irritably helen shrank away ive just taken a bath and the mountleys are coming to dinner so the campbellblacks arent coming hurrah hurrah why the hell did you ask them then answered for her because theyve already asked us twice and you can drop literary names all evening professor mountley was in his fifties an american who taught english literature at nairobi university his english wife a little younger was a showjumping groupie she knows even more about my bloody horses than i do said rupert rupert mixed white ladies and they all sat on the terrace gazing at the green pigeons and the enormous stars and listening to the rustle of night creatures frogs bubbling like a cauldron the hysterical chatter of baboons and the water pump sound of approaching lion im beginning to understand why evacuee children were so frightened of cows in the war said janey nice to be here said professor mountley raising his glass to helen nice to be still here said janey im sure some leopard is going to gobble me up did you know warthogs lead exemplary married lives said mrs mountley no wonder there arent any in gloucestershire said rupert rupert and billy were drinking steadily janey only less so because it might be bad for the baby and because she didnt want to get too flushed after long lovemaking a sleep three alkaseltzers and a bath she was feeling wonderful she was wearing a frangipani flower in her hair and a white ruffled slightly transparent shirt through which could be glimpsed her rosily sunburnt breasts conscious of billys adoration the professors admiration and ruperts blatant lust she was getting thoroughly overexcited before dinner helen had gone in and offered her a choice of blue or lime green caftans being pregnant she said janey might find them more comfortable comfortable indeed janey had snorted to billy shapeless and ugly you mean if she wasnt aware of helens lack of malice shed have thought she was doing it on purpose billys been reading all about orgies today she said to professor mountley at dinner janey said helen furiously we call it group therapy in the states said the professor with a nervous laugh soon they were all discussing orgies i cant bear it thought helen i wanted a nice civilized evening discussing crime and punishment with the professor and all anyone can talk about is sex they were all philistines earlier in the week shed lent janey her precious copy of a hero of our time and janey had dropped it in the bath rupert was talking to janey in an undertone frantically she tried to lip read what they were saying billy sensing her distress patted her arm everythings under control the mountleys left around midnight when everyone was still sitting round the table the professor was very reluctant to go but mrs mountley had recently become a grandmother and felt things were definitely getting out of hand helen having seen them off stood on the balcony breathing in the heady smell of warm earth frangipani dust and burning charcoal beyond the garden she could see the gleaming eyes of waiting animals but the animals inside the house frightened her much more determined to break the spell she went back into the dining room dont know about you but im absolutely exhausted rupert looked up a long cigar clamped between his white teeth lets have another drink he said getting up and filling everyones glasses with brandy and then lets go to bed he paused together helen laughed nervously together sure why not janey got up her eyes glittering do we use your bedroom or ours id prefer a home fixture said rupert and besides our bed is bigger he strolled over to janey and began to kiss her frozen with horror helen watched him take her pink breast out of the white shirt and gently stroke it then he undid the zip of her trousers helen shot a panicstricken look at billy only to see him watching with fascinated pleasure janey ran laughing into the bedroom giving a view halloo billy followed her rupert turned to helen holding out his hand come on darling or youll miss the first act helen looked at him aghast we cant what about the servants i sent them home hours ago he grabbed her arm at the bedroom door she balked billy already undressed was sitting on the bed drinking brandy watching janey and wearing helens sun hat he was roaring with excited laughter and had a huge erection janey was standing in front of the mirror tossing her hair back spraying helens most expensive scent over her boobs and jiggling them so they caught the light helen turned to bolt but ruperts viselike grip on her arm tightened no you dont dont be a fucking spoilsport we might finally find out what turns you on shoving her towards the bed he turned the key and pocketed it turning to billy he added its harder than getting snakepit into the lorry billy took off the sun hat and turned to helen come on lovie itll be fun no ones going to eat you everyones going to eat her said rupert and pulling down helens panties and lifting her dress and her pink silk petticoat he kissed her bush as she wriggled frantically away his hand clamped down on her bottom across the room her eyes met janeys which were mocking and slightly contemptuous come and help me undress her rupert said to janey as he peeled off the black dress and the petticoat janey undid the pink bra lovely underwear she said did you get it at janet reger helen covered her pitifully small breasts with one hand clasping the other over her bush i cant i cant she pleaded to rupert in panic i truly cant dont be so bloody wet he hissed do you want to make me look a complete idiot here she is all yours he added and scooping her up dropped her on the bed between janey and billy the fastest trouserdropper in the business next minute he was on the bed beside janey from then on it was a heaving anthill of legs and arms helen lay beneath rupert her eyes glazed her hair coming down as responsive as a corpse aware that rupert was fondling janeys breasts at the same time janey determined to put on a virtuoso performance climbed on top of billy bucking like a bronco arching her back in pleasure writhing and wriggling against ruperts hands then they changed over and despite shutting her eyes helen knew billy was inside her he was much solider and heavier yet gentler than rupert im not hurting you am i angel he breathed in her ear running his hands over her body youre so beautiful please enjoy it helen didnt respond lying rigid with horror her teeth clenched eyes closed billy her dear dear friend how could he do this to her but billy was watching janey bucking on top of rupert god she looked wonderful he was so proud of her im coming cried rupert suddenly his face contorting so am i said janey screaming and threshing she might be faking thought billy but its a lovely performance and next moment hed shot into helen looking down he saw two tears welling out of her closed eyes and coursing down her cheeks dont cry angel please dont cry more tears welled oh christ he thought we shouldnt have forced her he rolled off gathering her against him rupert gave janey a long long kiss then eased out of her and said in an undertone see if you can get helen going move over janey said to billy pushing him to the left of the bed our turn now she trailed her fingertips up helens thighs helen gave a moan of terror shrinking away from janey eyes darting frantically for a way of escape but like bookends rupert and billy blocked her exit no no no she sobbed as janeys insistent fingers started burrowing inside her as she felt janeys breasts flopping on her stomach and janeys tongue on her breasts jesus billy muttered to himself ill be off again in a minute please dont be frightened helen whispered janey as she caressed and stroked were all having such a good time we want you to enjoy it too i cant go on forever thought janey five minutes later no wonder rupert complains shes frigid she needs twentyfour hours defrosting rupert bored with a spectator role crawled down the bed and entered the slippery warmth of janey from behind so he could watch helen she looked like a martyr at the stake putting his hand around he found that despite janeys ministrations she was as dry as a marathon runners throat shes useless he thought suddenly with rupert behind janey helen saw a way of escape shoving janey to the left she wriggled away from her and before any of them had realized it had jumped off the bed and stumbled across the room in ruperts pocket she found the key come here he snarled for once she was in luck in his excitement rupert hadnt locked the door properly crying hysterically she managed to slip out slam the door and turn the key just as he crashed against it she longed to run away into the night but on the terrace the moon had gone in and everywhere was as black as ink she heard the dry cough of a leopard and decided to settle for the third bedroom there were no sheets on the bed huddled under the counterpane gazing unseeingly at the bookcase she shuddered until dawn if her sleeping pills hadnt been in the bathroom cupboard which could only be reached by going through the bedroom she would have taken the lot any minute she expected an enraged rupert to appear and drag her back to the torture chamber but the others were enjoying themselves the grownup has gone to bed now said janey all hands on dick said rupert filling up the glasses playing games of their own they carried on till morning ringing home next day helen discovered that marcus was in bed with tonsillitis and a temperature of she was so riddled with guilt that she felt so relieved there was a really good excuse to fly straight home by herself in recent months the tonsillitis attacks had been getting closer together the antibiotics were having less effect and marcus was looking so waiflike that helen accepted james bensons recommendation that he should have his tonsils out at once theyre as big as billiard balls marcusll be much better shot of them it wont cure the asthma but all the illnesses hes having as a result of the infected tonsils are pulling him down theres a very good man at the motcliffe in oxford hell only be in hospital for four or five days can i go in with him i honestly dont recommend it youve been under a lot of strain recently privately benson thought hed never seen her look so wretched leave him with experts who see this operation fifty times a week youre saying im no good as a mother said helen beginning to shake no no said benson reassuringly im saying youre too good its certainly been a stressful year dyou think thats making his asthma worse benson shrugged probably children are like radars marcus must realize how unhappy ruperts making you thank god we didnt take the kids to kenya thought helen with a shudder rupert wouldnt want me to go in with him well dont by all means visit him during the day but go home and get a good nights sleep every night the night before marcus was due to have his tonsils out at the beginning of march helen and rupert went to a big ball in london to raise funds for the tory party it was the sort of invitation that rupert would normally have refused but surprisingly he was rather a fan of mrs thatcher the new prime minister and felt she needed every bit of help if the tories were to stay in power you wouldnt be able to afford to have marcuss tonsils out privately if the socialists brought in a wealth tax they went very grandly to the ball with several ministers and their wives helen found the evening a nightmare holloweyed thinner than ever her black ball dress had had to be taken in yet again she knew she was being a damper on the evening but all she could think about was marcus in his white hospital bed and the surgeons knife going into his little throat in the morning all around her every table seemed filled with ravishing chattering women flirting with bland smoothhaired men at the same table a bediamonded brunette with a roving eye whod already had a long amorous dance with rupert was surreptitiously holding hands with one tory minister and at the same time making animated conversation to his wife the whole worlds at it thought helen in despair there was rupert coming off the dance floor looking around for fresh talent goodness he was going up to amanda hamilton the muchadmired wife of the minister for foreign affairs now she was smiling up at him and he was taking her onto the floor she must be forty but very attractive in a determined sort of way driving her husband rollo on from success to success knowing everyone rigidly governed by the social calendar rupert had actually met amanda hamilton before at a party last june and had promptly asked her out to lunch no i cant she had replied in her shrill piercing voice next weeks ascot the week after then no thats tennis rupert was slightly taken aback until she explained that wimbledon went on for a fortnight and she had to be in her seat on the center court by two oclock every day after that she explained patiently there would be a trip to america with rollo then goodwood and then scotland now holding her in his arms in the twilight gloom as the band played this guys in love with you rupert admired her rounded magnoliawhite shoulders a side door suddenly opened to admit a couple to the dance floor and amanda hamiltons scotchmistsoft complexion was briefly illuminated she didnt duck her head for her unwrinkled untroubled beauty had no need of dimmer light how was wimbledon asked rupert very exciting hes spoilt that american who nearly won but my goodness he can play tennis i rather admire that kind of drive it seems odd that no one minds painters or musicians or actors having tantrums but tennis players who are after all kind of artists are expected to behave themselves hes rather like you in fact youve had a bad press recently havent you you noticed said rupert fighting with judges frolicking with starlets beating up your horses rupert shrugged dyou beat your wife too is that why she looks so miserable rupert glanced at helen who was still sitting frozen gazing into space what do you think he said she looks as though the dentist is filling her back teeth having forgotten to give her an injection rupert grinned i dont think its funny why are you consistently so foul to her when shes so beautiful shes given me up for lent dont blame her with you running after everything in skirts or trousers these days girls dont seem to wear skirts anymore you seem to have been taking a great interest in my career his hand was beginning to rotate very gently on her back it amazes me that someone with such dazzling qualities should be quite happy about presenting such an appalling image to the outside world i know what my friends think other people dont matter amanda hamilton shook her head so the pearl combs gleamed in her dark hair one day you might get bored with riding horses and want to try your hand at something more serious like taking you to paris rollo was saying the other day that one felt rather insulted if rupert cb hadnt been to bed with ones wife rupert tightened his grip his hand moving upwards until he encountered bare flesh id hate to insult rollo he said softly he could do you a lot of good have you ever thought of going into politics no youd be very good youve got the looks the force of personality the magnetism the wit rupert laughed but not the intellect my wife says im a dolt youve got common sense and ive heard youre a very good afterdinner speaker i speak much better during dinner and to one person preferably you when are you going to dine with me were off to gstaad tomorrow oh listen the musics stopped she clapped vaguely and turned towards her table rupert grabbed her arm wait itll start up again in a second no said amanda with gentle firmness weve danced quite long enough go back and look after your poor little wife you must both come and dine with us when rollo gets back from moscow next month no thank you ive got absolutely no desire to get better acquainted with your husband amanda smiled and patted his cheek think about politics as a career i mean it seriously rupert stared at her unsmilingly seriously he emphasized the word im only interested in getting a gold at the moment two days later jake lovell walked down the long corridors of the motcliffe hospital to say hello to the matron and in the hope of catching a glimpse of the angelic sister wutherspoon by some stupid freudian misreading of the diary or perhaps because he was so anxious to get the goahead to ride again he had arrived for his appointment with mr buchannan five hours early mr buchannan was operating said the secretary and couldnt possibly see him before four oclock the day had already been full of omens it had snowed heavily since lunchtime the previous day and he and tory had had to dig out the car that morning two magpies had crossed his path as he was leaving warwickshire an odd number of traffic lights had been green on his way through oxford hed taken fiftyone strides from the car park to the front door there were eleven people in the lift his horoscope said the aspects for venus were good and this was a makeorbreak day he hoped to hell it wasnt the latter hed had enough of breaks he vowed that if johnnie buchannan told him he could ride again hed make the olympic team the individual event on september eighth was exactly six months away the nurses on the ward greeted him like a longlost brother my we are walking well youll be beating seb coe in the eight hundred meters at this rate it was very warm in the hospital outside the snow was still falling thickly blurring the outlines of the trees laying a clean sheet over the lawn orange streetlights glowed out of the gathering whiteness feeling totally blanketed against reality jake asked after sister wutherspoon shes having two days leave said joan sister wutherspoons spotty fat friend but she was absolutely furious to miss you she left you her number in case you felt like ringing her at home she added excited at the prospect of matchmaking jake pocketed the number he had five hours to kill he might as well ask her out to lunch on the way to the telephone he passed by some of the private rooms and heard an unearthly animal screaming like a rabbit caught in a snare the screams increased growing more terrible anxious to disassociate himself jake walked on rounding the corner he was sent flying by what seemed like a huge bear jumping out of a room at him what the fuck he snapped then he realized it was a woman in a huge blond fur coat tears streaming down her face she looked half crazy with terror im sorry she stammered i dont know what to do marcus such terrible screaming something must have gone wrong jake realized it was helen campbellblack where is he he said over the screaming in there hes just had his tonsils out they said not to visit till later but i wanted to be here when he came back from the theater jake took her arm lets go and see him marcus was still screaming he was as pale as his pillow his white nightgown like a shroud was splattered with blood jake stroked the childs red hair gently hell go to sleep soon cant they give him something to stop the pain hell just have had a huge shot of morphine every time he swallows it must be like an axe on his head gradually the screams subsided into great wracking sobs until finally marcus fell into an uneasy whimpering sleep hell be okay now said jake straightening the sheet are you sure wwhy did he scream so much they have to wake them up immediately after the operation to make sure everythings all right we went through the same thing with darklis and isa they were both perfectly okay when they came around later darklis was as cheerful as anything eating ice cream and raspberry jelly by the evening when she woke up she asked when am i going to have my tonsils out helen looked at him stunned as though only halflistening to what he was saying wwhy its jake isnt it jake lovell she said slowly i didnt recognize you you werent exactly in a recognizing mood suddenly she jumped out of her skin at the sound of more screaming coming down the corridor dont worry he said soothingly its only another child coming back from the operating theater they all sound like that woken marcus started crying again helen rushed to his side oh please dont angel in a few seconds hed fallen back to sleep again they waited for quarter of an hour every noise seemed magnified a thousand times a car horn outside a nurse laughing in the passage even the snow piling up on the window ledge outside but marcus didnt wake jake looked at his watch come on ill buy you a drink i cant leave him yes you can ill have a word with my friend joanie if he makes a squeak theyll ring us at the pub and you can rush back outside the snow was still falling heavy flakes like goose feathers bowing down the privets in the hospital garden settling on the collar of helens fur coat forming points on the toes of her tan leather boots clogging up her eyelashes jake walked slowly it was treacherous underfoot he couldnt afford to fall over today of all days they had only got as far as the car park when she broke down again i cant go im sorry he led her to his land rover sitting her down on a noseband and a copy of riding magazine snow curtained all the windows all jake could do was say there there gently almost absentmindedly patting her shoulder gradually the first wild intensity died down subsiding into a succession of wrenching despairing sobs im so sorry she kept saying im such an idiot please please forgive me if we dont both want to die of hypothermia he said we ought to find that pub she suddenly realized that he was only wearing a barbour his shoes were soaked and his teeth chattering im so sorry she said again in a trembling voice i cant go to a pub looking like this he handed her her bag well powder your nose then in the pub jake found helen a seat by the fire and went off to order treble brandies looking in the bar mirror he could see her vacantly gazing into space twisting her fingers around and around christ he thought shes the one who ought to be in hospital he took the brandies back to the table holding one out to her it was a second before she took it im a trusty st bernard struggling through the snow to bring you sustenance he said she didnt answer come on itll really help he noticed how loose her expensive boots were around her legs and that her skirt which was held up only by a brown suede belt was on an extra notch she took a gulp made a face choked and then took another gulp she wished the taste didnt remind her so much of that last night in kenya wheres rupert gone skiing neednt have bothered plenty of snow here whens he coming back she shrugged her shoulders five days a week and youre left to cope with all this helen held out thin shaking hands to the fire i ought to go back she said restlessly no you ought not theyll ring if he wakes poor little guy hes been so ill she said he was so excited about coming into hospital all the gifts and everyone for a change bothering about him rather than tab except rupert of course he ought to be in a ward other childrend take his mind off his sore throat darklis and isa didnt want to come home people kept coming in stamping the snow off their feet on the other side of the fireplace a couple of undergraduates in college scarves were eking out scotch eggs and pints of beer helens hair glowed in the firelight it was the only bright thing about her suddenly there were tears trickling under her dark glasses again oh god she muttered in a choked voice dont worry i havent got a tissue one by one jake removed all the paper napkins on the nearby tables and handed them to her the waitress trying to keep the tables for people having lunch clicked her tongue disapprovingly as she replaced them do you want a menu sir she asked pointedly yes later but for the moment can you get us two more very large brandies he gave her a fiver adding keep the change the waitress looked at helen curiously must have been a death at the hospital she thought then she looked at jake he was familiar with his dark brooding eyes she was sure shed seen him in poldark or jamaica inn whos that by the fire she asked the other barmaid what was he in i think hes got a group no hes a show jumper i know hes the one that broke his leg dr millett was telling us they thought they was going to have to amputate but he put up a real fight and pulled through whats his name rupert lovett jack lovett jake lovell said the first barmaid picking up the soda syphon here you are mr lovell she said putting down the brandies on the table how much soda would you like can i have your autograph for my niece she loves horses jake scribbled his name on the back of her bill pad and turned back to helen he felt a certain academic interest in why she was in such a frightful state hed never admired her looks too thin breedy and rarefied and in his eyes she was always contaminated by being part of rupert but today he was drawn to her as he had been drawn to macaulay and to all other things terrorized by rupert being out of the circuit for nearly a year he was not au fait with the gossip hed read about samantha freebody of course but that was too long ago to have such a traumatic effect hes a beautiful child he said helen gave the ghost of a smile and hes extra bright hes starting to read and hes not four yet rupert got him on a horse yet hes allergic to horses lives in the wrong house doesnt he sure hes not allergic to his father rupert thinks hes a wimp she said bitterly cant wait for him to go to prep school wheres he going st augustines if rupert gets his way christ dont send him there said jake appalled what was rupert like at school asked helen same as he is now torquemada she looked up with a start of recognition have you always hated him for over twenty years he had an awful childhood said helen his mother didnt really love him a woman of taste said jake the waitress came up all smiles now are you ready to order and could i have your autograph for our managers daughter steak and kidney chips and cauliflower cheese said jake i dont want anything protested helen dont be silly and bring a bottle of red he added to the waitress you need food he said a minute later i used to try and go without it until dino ferranti converted me he always said that most depression is caused by tiredness and lack of food i liked dino said helen he was fun we all liked him said jake fen misses him like hell but shes too proud to admit it then lunch arrived and jake tucked in in the way that only really thin people do helen suddenly found she was hungry after all it was real steak and kidney and there was wine in the gravy jake nodded approvingly hows rocky rupert figures hes the best horse hes ever ridden paid enough for him hows macaulay jakes face softened he is something else after sailor died i vowed id never get so fond of a horse again but macaulay really gets to me if he could read hed go around on his own hes not really a worldclass horse but hes such a trier and hes got so much heart hes not overly fond of rupert jake grinned thats another thing weve got in common after a good start helen didnt manage to finish her lunch quite pink now from her thermal underwear she looked as though shed got a temperature i ought to go back ill ring and check he said when he came back shed disappeared he thought shed bolted until he saw her shopping basket with the copy of the brothers karamazov and the guardian when she returned he noticed shed toned down the flushed cheeks and tidied the rumpled hair he knew it wasnt for his benefit just the instincts of a woman who liked looking perfect all the time hes fine he said getting up out like a light still no one expects him to wake for several hours he filled up her glass you have been kind she said slowly it was as if she was noticing him as a person for the first time why are you here anyway jake told her she was stricken with remorse its such a crucial day for you im so sorry ive been so obsessed with my own problems i didnt even think of anyone else are you hoping to go to la jake touched wood yes if johnnie buchannan gives me the goahead today ive got just six months to get fit will you take macaulay id like to although potentially hardys a better horse hes been going well with fen but hes still very spooky and erratic christ if only i had a year looking at him helen suddenly saw coming alive that singleminded driving fanaticism which had to be there the fuel of olympic fire buchannan warned me i might never ride again i promised that if he mended me id bring him home a medal fighting talk huh he stopped suddenly flushing slightly hearing his own obsession wanting to disguise it helen looked at the black hair the thickly lashed dark eyes and the thin watchful face suddenly she winced and clutched her temples whats the matter i get this pain it seems to start as a headache then becomes toothache then often reappears as earache neuralgia said jake caused by tension he felt so sorry for her she reminded him of a vixen escaping from hounds lying in the bracken taking a brief panting respite to get her breath back in a minute shed be running again waiting terrified for the kill but rupert hadnt killed her hed totally destroyed her selfesteem as they came out of the pub it was still snowing shortening the visibility so they could see only the vague outlines of the towers of oxford beautiful city said helen softly home of lost causes and forsaken beliefs unpopular names and impossible loyalties pretty impossible to be loyal to rupert said jake dryly underfoot it was freezing so hard that he ought to have been more frightened of falling over but in vino he crossed the snow without a slide or a stumble helen was amazed that marcus recovered so quickly driving in on the fifth day to take him home she found him playing with the most exquisite model circus there were clowns little dogs with ruffs a ringmaster and even a ballerina in a pink tutu who slotted into a cantering horse with a pink plume all the nurses were gathered around playing with it how darling said helen in delight who gave you that dake did dake said helen puzzled dake with the sore leg its better now want to see dake who can he mean jake lovell said sister wutherspoon warmly he popped in last night on his way back to warwickshire and brought the circus with him marcus was a bit restless excited about going home sister tethers who was on duty had a very sick child to look after jake stayed playing with marcus for hours how very kind said helen how very very kind mr buchannan gave him the goahead on monday evening i still dont think hes come down to earth oh im so pleased said helen and he still remembered marcus want to see dake said marcus the winter seemed to go on and on but at last the snow melted aconites and snowdrops appeared and helen watched ruperts dogs trampling over her crocuses snapping off their fragile heads and found she minded less than on other years as she went for long solitary walks in the woods her thoughts strayed far too often to jake lovell over and over again she got out the road atlas and realized how far hed driven through the snow to give marcus the circus she remembered how unembarrassed hed been by her tears and how cold hed got sitting in the car just patting her shoulder as she watched the spring emerge with aching slowness she wondered how she could thank him for lunch and for the circus she didnt want to write in case some secretary opened the letter he might have told tory about lunch but if he hadnt it might make things awkward personal letters were so obvious when they arrived at a private house she remembered so many arriving for rupert over the years usually in gaudily colored envelopes sometimes with swak on the back and how shed longed to steam them open janey she knew would have had no such scruples chatting to janey in the kitchen one day and leafing through the latest issue of horse and hound with a shock of recognition she came across a picture of jake the caption underneath said he would be making his comeback at the crittleden easter meeting and how glad readers would be to see this brilliant but very private rider back on the circuit he had evidently recovered from one of the worst accidents in showjumping history and had learned to walk by sheer guts and determination the story went on to praise his staunch closeknit family and to explain that jake had not achieved the international fame of other british riders because before the world championship he preferred to jump in this country and get home to his family in the evening malise gordon was quoted as being absolutely delighted if all went as planned he hoped jake would be offering himself for selection for los angeles good that jake lovells back isnt it she said to janey i shouldnt imagine rupert thinks so janey took the magazine from helen ive always thought he was very attractive all that heathcliff gypsy passion kept under such perfect control hes much more selfconfident too i saw him interviewed on the box last night about his comeback and he actually managed to string a sentence together and instead of looking sulky and defensive he was rather cool and detached helen found her voice thickening as it did when she asked if she could cash a check at the village shop have you ever heard any gossip about other women no hes squeakyclean reputationwise you only have to look at tory to see he hasnt got very high standards i guess hes only interested in getting to the top said helen perhaps said janey thoughtfully but theres something irresistible about men who are impossibly hard to get which is not something one can say about your dear husband it was strange reflected helen that after that unspeakably dreadful last night in kenya she and janey could still be friends janey had an amazing ability to swan in not attempting to justify or apologize for appalling behavior which made it possible rupert however she could not forgive they both moved around the house not communicating like goldfish in a bowl the week before easter brought the first sunshine for days helen went around the house turning off lights that werent on because the rooms were suddenly so unexpectedly bright out in the fields she noticed little red buds on the wild roses and larks singing in the hazy drained blue sky thrashing their bodies like moths against nonexistent windows perhaps i could escape thought helen listening to the larks strange whistle perhaps i too am thrashing against a window that isnt really there next day the vicar came to tea to talk about raising money for the church spire afterwards rupert walked in from the stables to find helen and he praying together in the drawing room christ he said in horror and walked out again the vicar who had a white beard and stank like a polecat scrambled creaking to his feet i wish we could make some progress with your husband he said with a sigh i feel he is very troubled i dont think hed see it that way said helen hastily but thank you very much carrying the tea things into the kitchen she found rupert and tab eating an easter egg and reading dandy together flappy oyster said tab she shouldnt be eating easter eggs before easter sunday thought helen appalled but she didnt say anything rupert looked up has your friend from hollywood gone burying her face in the dishwasher as she stacked the cups and saucers helen said i thought i might come to crittleden on saturday the anniversary of your first show said rupert thats rather touching im having lunch with the godbolds said helen putting all the knives in the wrong way up so i can come on afterwards i also thought i might fly out to rome for a couple of days rupert looked slightly startled whatever you like he said for the first time in years helen felt excited and took ages planning what she was going to wear to crittleden despite the lack of sun april had been very dry so she wouldnt have to wear gum boots she settled for a pinstriped suit a white silk shirt and a charcoal gray tie and a gray trilby after a lightning lunch at the godbolds where she ate nothing she arrived at crittleden just as the riders were walking the course for the big class there was rupert fooling around with wishbone and billy and there was jake still limping quite badly walking beside fen he looked small and preoccupied and very pale neither of them were speaking fen was only an inch or two smaller than he was jake felt nausea creeping through his stomach as he made his way towards the collecting ring people nodded and waved and clapped him on the back but he hardly noticed them why the hell hadnt he chosen a smaller show to make his comeback a little girl rushed forward for his autograph later he snapped lack of sleep and food had made him dizzy everything seemed unreal for the past week hed hardly slept dozing off then waking up with the sensation of falling then lying awake jumping fences in his head seeing them growing higher and impossibly higher as the long hours crept towards dawn and cigarettes piled up in the ashtray the sky was getting grayer he began to shake are you all right said sarah dont worry youve been jumping super at home macll take care of you macaulay tried to knock jakes hat off to cheer him up and was sworn at for his pains when jake was mounted macaulay tried again just a little buck that in the old days would have made jake laugh but which today nearly put him on the floor and produced another torrent of abuse to further shatter jakes confidence rupert was crashing rock star over the practice fences putting him wrong so he hit his forelegs hard and would be certain to pick them up when he went into the ring god he was a beautiful horse in the flesh thought jake a chestnut stallion showing all the compressed power of his american breeding with curving muscles like coiled steel cables jake jumped a couple of fences then having been nearly sent flying by rupert retreated to the outer field desperately trying to get his nerves under control suddenly he passed helen campbellblack looking like a city gent ludicrously out of place in a pinstriped suit hi she said smiling and coming towards him jake nodded curtly and circling rode back to the arena fen was waiting for him youre on she said good luck good luck called voices on all sides in the old days he had usually been all right once he got into the ring the nervous tension a necessary preliminary to the class itself heightening awareness but that was when his body was fit and flexible not frozen with fear now he was like a child at his first gymkhana what if he really was jinxed sailor had died here last year he had smashed up his leg these things went in threes what had the fates in store for him today macaulay aware of his masters terror heard the bell and suddenly decided to take matters into his own big hoofs bucketing towards the first fence he cleared it easily somehow clinging onto his mane jake stayed in the saddle it was a very hit and miss business the crowd had their hearts in their mouths all the way round no one cheered for they didnt want in any way to distract macaulay but as he cleared the last triple with a flourish they broke into a roar that seemed to part the gray clouds and bring out the sun putting a sparkle on everything fen found herself hugging malise in the collecting ring he did it she gulped he really did it its going to be all right as jake rode towards the exit deadpan as ever the cheers mounted and all the people in the boxes came out onto the balconies to bellow their approval helen joined in the applause politely she felt absurdly deflated jake had hardly noticed her and then cut her dead great round said malise jake shook his head it was bloody terrible and you know it but at least i or rather macaulay got around everyone was congratulating him it amazed him they were so thrilled to see him back but he couldnt take the hero worship and the enthusiasm just yet he wanted to be alone with macaulay to thank him riding quietly out of the collecting ring he saw helen campbellblack aware that hed snubbed her earlier he rode towards her hello she looked up oh hi she said ultracasually there was a long pause he jumped well she stammered im so happy for you hows marcus said jake to the top of her trilby hes real fine so much better look ive been meaning to thank you for ages for lunch and for marcuss circus you were so kind driving all that way she was really gibbering now thats all right said jake after another long pause she looked up and they gazed at each other ive got your handkerchief too she said color mounting in her face and marcus plays with his circus the whole time he just adored you jake said nothing but went on staring down at her as macaulay sidled beneath him helen put up a trembling hand to stroke the horses black neck are you going to rome she asked desperate for something to say no are you yes dont go wwhat she looked at him in amazement i said dont go make some excuse whens rupert leaving lunchtime on monday week hes flying out right youll be home in the afternoon yes ill ring you there and he was gone helen was thrown into complete panic had she dreamed it could jake really have said that from that saturday at crittleden to the monday nine days later when rupert left for rome she went through every fluctuation of excitement worry terror and disbelief she was completely inattentive at committee meetings and at parties when the parties were boring she could think of nothing but jake yet when amanda hamilton invited them to dinner on the saturday and helen radiant in russet taffeta was chatted up by two rather glamorous tory mps she hardly missed him at all amanda had been particularly nice to her soliciting her aid to persuade rupert to go into politics perhaps if he did thought helen things would be different hed be in england most of the time and there wouldnt be any of those punishing threeoclockinthemorning departures and by using his brain he might have less of a chip about her apparent intellectual superiority rupert was highly relieved that helen wasnt coming to rome amanda hamilton was going to be out there for the rome tennis tournament staying with friends he was making no progress with amanda like a doityourself cupboard he told billy she was taking far longer to make than one would expect pathological about adverse press she even refused to lunch with him but she fascinated him more than any woman hed met for ages and he was determined to get her into bed before long when ruperts car refused to start on monday helen drove him to the airport as she drove slowly back to penscombe admiring the wild cherry blossom and the pale green spring leaves she reflected that it was a good thing shed be out when jake rang just to show she wasnt that keen walking into the house she buried her face in a huge bunch of white lilac which filled the entire hall with its scent marcus rushed out to meet her and show her the pictures of the fair hed painted at play school any messages she called out casually to charlene who was in the kitchen no oh i tell a lie mrs bacon rang about jumble no one else are you sure you didnt go out or into the garden ive been here all afternoon helen was totally thrown shed been so certain jake was going to crowd her that she had a tiger by the tail why the hell couldnt mrs bodkin throw away dead flowers she thought as she wandered restlessly round the drawing room moving ornaments even snapping at marcus she tried to read half an hour passed then malise rang hoping to catch rupert before he left janey rang for a gossip and the headmistress of marcuss play group rang about their summer bringandbuy helen was uncharacteristically terse with all of them then charlenes mother rang and gossiped to charlene for twenty minutes helen couldnt even accuse her of wasting money as it was an incoming call perhaps jake was in a call box trying to get through perhaps hed lost the number oh the nightmare of being exdirectory unsupervised by charlene the children swarmed into the drawing room the next moment tab had put jammy fingerprints all over the apricot silk curtains charlene screamed helen for gods sake get off the telephone charlene flounced in looking martyred its gran shes got cancer of the bowel oh god said helen mortified im so sorry the telephone rang helen sprang to it hello helen yes its jake sorry i couldnt ring before the class went on and on there was a pause mindlessly she watched tab stumping towards the table with the long pale blue cloth on which stood all helens favorite ornaments look i know its short notice but im coming your way tomorrow can we lunch i dont know tab leave that tablecloth alone alone i said shall i pick you up no it was almost a scream tab i said put it down you know the red elephant at willacombe yes ill see you there at one oclock okay hey wait but he had replaced the receiver leaping forward helen retrieved a rockingham dalmation from tabs predatory fingers i said dont touch picking up the child she was suddenly overwhelmed with happiness swinging her around and around covering her with kisses until she screamed with delight weeties said tabitha sensing weakness oh okay said helen if you really want all your teeth to fall out looking in the diary after a sleepless night helen saw to her horror that she was supposed to go to a fundraising lunch for the nspcc as vicepresident for the local area she was expected to play a leading part and make a rousing putyourhandin your pocket speech after lunch the president was very put out when helen rang and said she couldnt make it charlene had to go to an unexpected funeral she explained so she had to stay home and look after marcus and tab surely one of the grooms can do that i mean we are expecting you youre on the poster and youre such a draw theyre all looking forward to meeting you im sorry davina but i really cant leave them what about janey lloydfoxe shes away horrifying how easy she found it to lie honestly id never forgive myself if marcus had an asthma attack the president was not so easily defeated she rang back at halfpast eleven just as helen was having a bath charlene answered the telephone before helen could reach it hello mrs paigntonlacey mrs cbs in the bath give it to me dripping helen snatched the telephone dyou always have a bath in the middle of the morning who was that answering the telephone charlene id thought shed gone to a funeral shes just leaving hmm well ive sorted out your problems angela pitts nannys a stateregistered nurse and shes quite happy to bring angelas smalls over to you and look after your smalls thats very kind said helen realizing the bedroom door was still open and charlene was probably hovering but im afraid the answers no she kicked the door shut but thats absurd surely a stateregistered nurse is better at looking after marcus rather than his own mother snapped helen since were talking about cruelty to children i figure my first duty is towards my own kids i appreciate your help davina but please dont try and run my life and she hung up looking at herself in the bedroom mirror she was suddenly elated and amazed by her own defiance suddenly however panic assailed her what if davina rang again and got charlene after shed left or if marcus really had an asthma attack whimpering with terror she rang the red elephant could she leave a message for mr lovell after a long pause the manager said there was no one booked in the name of lovell although they had four mr smiths and five mr browns whod booked tables for lunch helen rang off perhaps he wasnt going to show up at all mrs campbellblack reflected charlene as she listened to helen singing im in the mood for love in the bath was behaving in a very odd way yesterday shed unloaded all badgers tins of dog food from the supermarket into the dishwasher and put a packet of tampax in the fridge even when she came out of the bath and found tabitha trying on lipsticks and dropping one on the pale gold carpet she didnt fly off the handle as she normally would and now she was walking into the kitchen in a new silver flying suit and shiny black boots with her hair trailing down her back in one long red plait you look fantastic said charlene in genuine amazement like an astronaut you ought to go to the moon shes over it already she thought to herself do you really like it asked helen shyly desperate for reassurance gorgeous makes you look so slim youll be wasted on the nspcc charlene added slyly and asphyxiate them too with all that expensive perfume she reflected mrs cb must have bathed in it marcus wandered in mummy pretty going out his face fell only to a lunch to make money to help kids who arent as lucky as you i must go i wont be late god will smite me down for such terrible lies she thought terror increased on the drive to the restaurant as she passed two nspcc stalwarts driving like mad in the other direction late for their one glass of sherry she glanced in the driving mirror hoping she wasnt getting too flushed she was so nervous shed been rushing to the loo all morning it would be terribly difficult to pee wearing this flying suit shed have to take the whole thing off there was the red elephant she couldnt see jakes land rover anywhere he was waiting in the bar threequarters the way through his second whisky for a minute she thought he was going to kiss her on the cheek then he settled for shaking hands dyou want a drink here or shall we go straight in all along the bar sat businessmen gawping finding her face vaguely familiar trying to identify her lets go straight in rupert could never enter a restaurant without turning the whole place upside down so helen was amazed that jake slid in so quietly they reached their table in a corner without anyone recognizing him there was a bunch of dark purple irises in a royal blue vase its not considered good form but would you rather sit with your back to the room jake asked helen nodded at her request for a glass of white wine jake ordered a bottle and another whisky for himself helen found herself quite unable to meet his eyes it had been so easy to talk before because it had been just a monologue with her pouring out all her woes now sitting opposite conversation was incredibly heavy going like chopping up raw swede with a blunt knife marcus was much better darklis and isa were well both of them felt it bad form to mention tory or rupert helen was reluctant to ask jake about his horses in case she betrayed her total ignorance jake felt the same about films plays and books the weather had been perfect so that lasted them only thirty seconds a kindly waiter arrived with the menus helen randomly chose whitebait which she hated and grilled lamb cutlets with zucchini she hadnt actually looked him in the face yet white wine didnt seem to jolly her up at all desperate for something to say she boasted shed met half the tory shadow cabinet at dinner on saturday then thought what a fatuous thing to have done jake was bound to be wildly left wing conversation didnt improve with the arrival of food there were long silences jake unsmiling said very little helen was beginning to rattle gloom swept over her she had no charm she was boring him as she bored rupert and obviously dino she looked down at the silver bodies of the whitebait in their coats of batter and could see their glassy little eyes staring at her suddenly jake leaned across took her knife and fork and put them together and beckoned the waiter could you take the plates away and bring our next course but theres no hurry anything wrong sir nothing we just werent as hungry as we thought helen gazed down at her hands which were frantically pleating the white tablecloth im sorry she mumbled what a dreadful waste jake stretched out his hand and very gently began to stroke her cheek for a second she shied away then gradually relaxed under his touch there he said softly there its all right pet im just as scared as you are are you she glanced up startled more so i should think i was so terrified youd say no i couldnt work up the courage to ring you until six oclock i hung round the phone box steeling myself and i figured you werent going to call and i thought youd probably cry off this morning so i booked in under the name of smith and went out first thing so you couldnt reach me and when i got cold feet and rang up to cancel and found you hadnt booked i got in a blind panic because i thought you werent coming they both found they were laughing then she told him about the hassle with davina and the nspcc what was your excuse i said i was going to look at a horse tory looked at me as though i was barking we havent got enough cash for a threelegged donkey at the moment and i left all that whitebait doesnt matter nice treat for the restaurant cats dyou mind if i smoke as the match flared she noticed the beautiful passionate mouth with the full lower lip and for the first time realized his eyes were not black but a very dark sludge green matching his shirt have you really got gypsy blood sure my father was pure romany i ran away back to the gypsies when i was six after my mother died i tried to find him and lived with the gypsies for three years before the social security people caught up with me and slapped me in the childrens home so youve really had no family life to speak of ive got one now and when i see what torys mother did to her i reckon i was well off what was it like living with the gypsies cold sometimes and always with the feeling of being moved on by the cops but i enjoyed it i learnt a lot they taught me to recognize a good horse and treat all nature as a medicine cupboard which reminds me he put his hand in his pocket and produced a bottle of graygreen liquid for you for neuralgia helen took it wonderingly you remembered what is it extract of henbane deadly poisonous neat crippen used it to murder his wife helen looked slightly alarmed but thats very diluted its a marvelous sedative and a painkiller try it but keep it in a safe place helen was so moved and touched she had to make a joke out of it dyou eat hedgehogs as well no he said coldly nor do i tie them on top of poles like your husband oh dear thought helen ive upset him then he said did you know hedgehogs prickles go all soft when theyre with kind people and suddenly smiled god hes attractive thought helen she felt as if she were on top of a snowy mountain perched on a sled with her hands and feet tied hurtling into the unknown with no way of stopping or steering do you tell fortunes he shrugged a little its really a con trick the hand betrays the calling if its rough or pampered or the nails are bitten you look more for the face behind the eyes the droop of the mouth helen held out her hand her engagement ring far too loose had fallen underside down for a second the huge sapphires and emeralds on her third finger caught the light then fell back into place jake examined the palm for a second it tells me a small dark stranger has entered your life you think so i know is he going to remain there thats up to you he ran his finger lightly along the heart line whatever you may think to the contrary youre extremely passionate neither of them made much headway with their second course but finding so much to talk about now they drank their way through a second bottle of wine were you really intending to ask me out at crittleden no i was far too preoccupied about riding again what changed your mind i suddenly wanted you like crazy helen blushed ever since you bought me lunch at the pub ive kept thinking about you i thought it was gratitude now im not sure jake undid one of the zips on her flying suit pretty does this lead anywhere only a pocket nice id like to live in your pocket looking down at his hand at her collarbone involuntarily helen bent her head and kissed it then went crimson i didnt mean to do that she said appalled i know you didnt i willed you to still they lingered oblivious of the yawning waiters looking at their watches ostentatiously relaying tables on either side of them seeing her slowly relax and those huge eyes losing their sadness jake couldnt tear himself away hed always thought her very overrated as a beauty now she seemed to blossom in front of him lovelier every second in the loo helen was amazed to see her own face she couldnt believe she hadnt turned into someone else it took hours to get her flying suit half off and have a pee she kept undoing the wrong zips she realized she must be very tight she was appalled looking at her watch to see it was a quarter to four she was glad that in her flat boots she was at least an inch shorter than jake as they walked to her car he put a hand on the back of her bare neck under her hair warm and reassuring it was nice walking beside someone the same size rupert always dwarfed her i must go back she said wistfully im dreadfully late as he opened her door he said drive a couple of miles down the road towards penscombe theres a little wood on the left wait for me there the wood was full of primroses and violets for a dreadful moment shed thought shed found the wrong copse or that he wasnt coming then at last he appeared over the hill stuck behind a trundling farm tractor carrying bales of hay taking both hands off the wheel he raised them in a gesture of despair he was out of the car in a second leading her into the wood beech husks crunching beneath their feet then as helen tripped over a bramble cable jake caught her drawing her behind a huge beech tree laying her against the trunk taking her face between his hands examining every freckle and eyelash and yellow fleck in her eyes even helen of troy couldnt have been as beautiful as you he whispered and kissed her very gently on the lips helen was very glad the beech tree was holding her up no one had ever melted her in this way she had no desire to fight him off just a longing that he would go on holding her forever but as they broke for breath some death wish prompted her to ask its not because im ruperts wife for a second his face was black with rage just like the time hed pulled a knife on rupert i dont want anything of ruperts he said through gritted teeth his hands biting into her arms until she winced get this absolutely straight rupert poisons everything he touches its a measure of what i feel for you that i still want you despite the fact youre his wife this time he kissed her really hard and she kissed him back halflonging that hed push her down and take her on the beech husks but he led her back to her car his face shuttered youre not cross she stammered ive had such a good time today living with rupert makes you skeptical i guess so you question everyones motives well dont question mine where youre concerned theyre quite straightforward i just cant stand that shit having anything to do with you he opened the door and as she got in leaned over to slot in her safety belt kissing her briefly on the forehead you know this is only the beginning is it helen was overwhelmed by a great happiness he nodded but we cant afford to rush things ive got too much to lose you mean tory and the children no he said slowly i mean you i dont want to panic you drive carefully ill ring you tomorrow afternoon it was a good thing there werent any traffic cops lurking as helen floated home she got lost twice and bought peace offerings of freesias for charlene and sweets for the children really she was going to the dogs in grand style she came through the door singing with happiness at five past five so sorry im late lunch went on and on and on everyone was rabbiting on about sponsored swims and bringandbuys what are you having for supper darlings beefburgers and french fries how yummy normally helen would have freaked out at junk food thought charlene putting the freesias in water and she certainly didnt get like that over a thimbleful of sherry and one glass of hock in the evening charlene went to a wine bar with dizzy who this time hadnt gone to rome promise promise promise you wont tell anyone i promise goodness said dizzy in awe a quarter of an hour later i wouldnt have thought the old thing had it in her are you sure well she certainly wasnt preventing cruelty to children mrs paigntonlacey dropped off the minutes for the last meeting on the way home two hours before mrs cb got back christ said dizzy well done her about time someone gave super bastard the run around i wonder who he is must be pretty special she came back floating above ground like the hovercraft she was never like that after lunching with dino ferranti helen sent charlene and the children out for a picnic the following afternoon so she could talk to jake without being overheard but gradually as the minutes ticked by she felt her happiness subsiding like a tire with a slow puncture three four five six struck the grandfather clock in the hall it was no longer afternoon the children came home tired and fractious and sensing her sadness and inattention played up even more helen looked at the chaos of toys lying around the nursery counting he loves me he loves me not as she put them away the last piece of lego was back in its box and came to he loves me not jake must have gone off her perhaps tory had kicked up a fuss when he got home and hed decided the whole thing wasnt worth the hassle the evening passed with agonizing slowness she couldnt settle to anything she was appalled how suicidal she felt she couldnt have got that hooked that quickly this is only the beginning hed told her a small dark stranger has entered your life how could he hurt her like this how could he reduce her to such ridiculous uncertainty and despair at midnight she took the dogs out for a last walk as if to mock her it was the most perfect evening with a gold almost full moon with a hazy halo of apricot pink along the edge of the wood the huge lawson cypresses rose like cathedral spires taking on an almost sculptured quality as she walked across gray shaven lawns past silent statues the last of the daffodils gave a flicker of light the reflection of the moon in the lake was rippled first by a wakeful carp now by badger drinking her shadow was tall and very black on the lawn it was so light she could see the blue and green stones in her engagement ring was there after all to be no small escape no respite from her marriage despairing she turned back glancing up at the golden litup windows of her bedroom she could see the rose and yellow silk curtains of the huge fourposter in which she would soon lie alone as she came into the house the telephone was ringing after midnight so it must be rupert he never had any sense of time steeling herself she picked up the receiver helen can you talk its jake she burst into tears it was a minute before he could get a word in hush im sorry pet please dont cry it breaks me up i couldnt ring before hardy cast himself this afternoon had the most frightful colic the vets been here since two oclock hes just finished operating hed swallowed a nail and we thought wed lost him oh god thats awful is he going to be okay hes still out like a light but the vet reckons hell pull through im so sorry you must have been frantic i couldnt get to a telephone its in the tackroom and the vet and fen were in hardys box next door the whole time look i cant talk long the vets still here but i must see you tomorrow if only for five minutes itll be hard for you to get away if hes still sick ill come over your way that would help and pet please dont cry anymore they met the next day literally for a quarter of an hour jake looked desperately tired he hadnt been to bed hardy was very shaky on his legs he said but well enough to bite the vet that morning so it looked as if he would pull through watching his face as he talked about the horse helen felt deeply ashamed he really loves him she thought as rupert was incapable of loving a horse in fact anything last night he must have suffered just as much as she had waiting for him to ring and shed greeted him with hysterics they walked through the beech woods breathing in the wild garlic wolf bounding ahead and jake picking up the bluebells the dog had knocked over so helen could take them home for a few more days of life they sat on a fallen log helen hung her head clutching the bluebells shed put her hair up today jake slowly took out every hairpin so it cascaded down her back in a shining red mass dont put it up anymore it reminds me of what you were like before i started tohe pausedto know you then he said more briskly look weve got to get one thing straight youve been married to a show jumper for quite long enough to know that things happen with horses that its impossible even to say ill turn up or telephone at a particular time with a hundred percent certainty i know she said in a trembling voice but ive got so little selfconfidence i know that he said putting his hand under her chin and forcing it upwards and i want to give some back to you but only if you give me a chance and realize from the start that if i ever dont ring you or dont turn up its because i cant even though i was demented with worry over hardy last night a hundred times i nearly risked it and picked up the phone which would have been madness because any minute tory could have picked it up in the kitchen its difficult enough for us to find time to see each other without complicating things all right end of lecture im not going to kiss you because i must have smoked a hundred cigarettes in the last twentyfour hours and i dont want to put you off even before weve got started you couldnt truly you couldnt she threw herself into his arms half crying half laughing he held her for a long time not speaking just stroking her hair then he said im off to the bath and wells tomorrow for three days why dont you drive over we could have dinner that would be just lovely or i could book a room in one of the nearby hotels he felt her stiffen i dont know how could she explain that he was so desperately important to her that she couldnt bear him to go off her so soon she knew he would once he realized how hopeless she was in bed why not i dont know you well enough he laughed theres no more satisfying way of getting to know someone better he rang the next day to tell her the name of the hotel and what time he thought hed get there he didnt mean to bully her but he felt privately it was vital to bed her as soon as possible not just because he wanted her like hell but because he felt hed never make any real progress in restoring her selfconfidence until he got to grips with her particular hangups on several occasions hed heard gossip that she was frigid he didnt believe it frigid was a gross oversimplification a term often used scornfully by men about women who no longer loved them physically he believed helen had been very badly frightened but was not frigid he wished he could spend hours in her box talking to her soothing her making her feel secure but he had so little time if he was going to be picked for los angeles he couldnt let up for a second and so he insisted on her meeting him that night at the hotel helen sat alone in her bedroom at dusk there was no wind outside sheep were calling to lambs baby house martins under the eaves were squeaking peremptorily for their parents to catch insects more quickly the white cherries shone luminous in the halflight the rank peasant smell of wild garlic in the wood threatened to extinguish the sweet delicate scent of the pink clematis which swarmed round the bedroom window her pink track shoes were yellow with buttercup pollen from wandering aimlessly through the fields all afternoon blowing dandelion clocks this time tomorrow she thought ill be in bed with jake she had never been so frightened in her life she wished she could pray but how could she ask god to help her be better in bed with someone who wasnt her husband she still hadnt planned her alibi for tomorrow night charlene was already going out so shed have to ask one of the grooms to babysit always before shed left a telephone number where she could be reached but she could hardly give them the number of the nirvana motel and how was she going to smuggle her suitcase out to the car shed have to send the children out for yet another picnic even worse shed been sitting on her bed trimming her bush with nail scissors when charlene had walked in with some ironed clothes and helen had hastily to pretend she was cutting her toenails anyway what was the point of trimming her bush when the thing it covered was the trouble over and over again ruperts words came back to haunt her youre just like a bloody frozen chicken every time i put my hand in there i expect to pull out the giblets and she was so thin now it would be like going to bed with an oxfam ad she had a blinding headache so she took some of jakes medicine gradually the pain eased and she felt calmer maybe if he could cure her head he could melt the ice of her frigidity as well but it was as if some malignant fate were at work just as she was leaving penscombe the following day she discovered shed got her period shed been so preoccupied shed completely forgotten she was due she glanced at her watch it was too late to ring jake at the show she could ring the nirvana motel and leave a message saying she couldnt make it but that left her with the appalling prospect of not seeing him shed have to go perhaps have a quick drink he wouldnt want her in this state and then come home it was so hot she wore only a yellow sleeveless dress yellow sandals and a white silk scarf to keep her hair from tangling as she drove very fast to meet him she was so wracked with stomach cramps she hardly noticed the beautifully green bosky evening or the cow parsley frothing along the verges or the smell of wild garlic stronger than ever like some rampant dionysian presence pursuing her waiting for jake she sat trembling in the hotel foyer trying to make herself look as inconspicuous as possible pretending to read the evening paper the hall porter watched her idly you could always tell the first time they came here he thought they never stopped fiddling with their hair squirting on perfume glancing in their hand mirrors then fearfully up at the door suppose he didnt turn up supposing someone they knew walked in hed even seen wives sitting here waiting for their lovers when their husbands walked in with someone else he had another look at helen this one was a looker all right but shed go through the ceiling with nerves in a minute oh now shed dropped her bag all over the floor he moved forward to help as helen fell on her knees frantically scrabbling up bankers cards keys loose change lipsticks and stray lillets at that moment jake sauntered through the door his coat slung over his shoulder he looked suntanned and happy and not remotely embarrassed hello darling he said pulling her to her feet and kissing her on the cheek did the babysitter arrive ive had the most bloody day at the office and im afraid my father rang to say he wants to come and stay next week just like any other married couple thought helen in admiration and she had great difficulty not giggling when he signed them both in as mr and mrs driffield no well manage he said to the porter when he offered to carry their cases up to the fourth floor adding in an undertone as they got into the lift im buggered if ill tip him for nothing when he opened his case in the bedroom all it contained was a toothbrush toothpaste a bottle of gin and a large bottle of tonic i think that covers all eventualities he said as he fetched two glasses from the bathroom then seeing the expression of misery on her face he put them down on the dressing table and took her in his arms trying to still the desperate trembling pet please you look as if youre going to the electric chair helen burst into tears it was some seconds before she could speak and then he spoke for her youve got the curse how dyou know she said incredulously i knew you had it coming all week you were very edgy and the day before yesterday your breasts were swollen and you had huge circles under your eyes fen always says just before the curse is the only time she has decent boobs helen was amazed that he should be so observant smoothing her hair very gently behind her ears he removed her earrings now will you please stop crying we dont have to do a thing if you dont want to he poured half and half gin and tonic into the glasses and handed her one you got a pain she nodded well gins the best for that take a big slug of it come on lie down he said removing her yellow highheeled sandals just relax weve got hours he lay down beside her draining half his drink you dont have to stay helen stammered you might not want to if theres no sex for a second his face blackened what the fuck is that supposed to mean dyou honestly think i only want you for sex i dont know its all rupert wants somehow the words spilled out before she could stop them how many times he said wearily do i have to remind you im not rupert i know youre not she said in a trembling voice but it wouldnt make any difference if you were or if i didnt have a period im no good to you im hopeless at sex im frigid who said so rupert did he says im simply not interested in it not interested in him you mean despite the heat he could feel the gooseflesh on her arms she was still shuddering violently her teeth chattering he reached for her glass making her take a big gulp and then a second and a third come on now tell me all about it then it all came pouring out the humiliations the taunts ruperts always insisting on sex whenever he came home despite the endless infidelities then the clap and finally samantha freebody thats not all is it said jake what happened in kenya howd you know anything happened whispered helen second sight come on we cant afford to have any secrets he made her take another slug of gin i cant talk about it she whispered go on itll help i promise so she told him often crying so hard he couldnt hear the words about the foursome with billy and janey afterwards rupert made me feel as though id let him down paid him the ultimate insult by not joining in i couldnt im simply not made that way jake tipped her head back swept the sodden hair away from her forehead and dried the tears with his handkerchief she heaved a long sigh im so sorry to bore you jake held her tightly poor baby poor poor little baby you did end up in the wrong yard didnt you her yellow dress had no zip so jake was able to slide it off over her head before laying her back on the counterpane still got the pain a little ill bring you something for that next time the ginll start working soon beneath the coffeecolored silk petticoat he could feel her stomach muscles tightly knotted but gently as he stroked them with those magic hands that could calm the most frightened horse she began to relax she was so tired after nights of not sleeping that the singsong voice and the stroking hands and the gin were making her drowsy almost before she knew it he had slid off her petticoat and unhooked her bra then he was kissing her mouth and almost in spite of herself she was kissing him back gently at first then more and more fiercely and still his hand continued to stroke her belly youre so beautiful he murmured im so thin no youre perfect after torys bulk he found helens fragility incredibly erotic for once he felt like a great hunk of man allpowerful by comparison and she looked so unbelievably touching with her damp cheeks and wide yellow eyes smudged with mascara and her hair falling in a long red tangle over one shoulder as he kissed her again his hand slid downwards caressing all the time circling the pubic hair then sliding under the pants to find the clitoris stroking it with the utmost delicacy helen tensed and then relaxed shes not frigid he thought in triumph slowly slowly like a moth emerging from a chrysalis she seemed to yield to him then she gave a deep sigh of contentment after a minute she opened her eyes and smiled frigid eh he muttered into her hair that was so lovely she gasped wasnt it he grinned down at her looking absurdly pleased with himself but you havent had any sex at all she said suddenly distressed doesnt matter i can wait till next time itll be worth waiting for the unselfishness the insight the kindness put the seal on her love for him that was the most wonderful sex ive ever had she said for me too he said kissing the hollows of her throat three days later he had her for the first time in a meadow on the edge of bifield woods near the old gypsy encampment where his forefathers must often have taken his foremothers a heavy shower of rain had flattened the grass for them and dispersed the regiments of insects but it was still very hot their lovemaking was rapturous they fitted together perfectly and despite anything he might say to the contrary to helen jake experienced a feeling of pure triumph that this was ruperts wife lying beneath him and reduced to a quivering jelly of ecstasy once again he had succeeded where rupert had failed meanwhile in rome at almost the same time rupert campbellblack was experiencing an almost identical moment of triumph as he lay on top of amanda hamilton for the first time rock star had had a glorious double clear in the nations cup making up for fenella maxwells indifferent form and clinching the victory for great britain today amanda was actually missing the final of the mens doubles in order to play mixed singles with him fullbreasted narrowhipped longlegged her body was superb for a woman of forty only a slight creping on thighs and breastbone betrayed her age her string of pearls was still round her neck in out in out superbly in control rupert drove her towards orgasm suddenly her face contorted with concentration then she gave a cry of ecstasy at last my darling said rupert smiling tenderly ive suddenly worked it out said amanda it was your cousin charlie cameron who was married to rollos nieceinlaw antonia armitage before she was married to him she was antonia luard if it had been any other woman rupert would have hit her for the first four weeks helen and jake enjoyed an unnatural freedom rupert and fen were traveling abroad with the british team following the same route from rome fontainebleau paris to lucerne along which the previous year fen had cavorted so joyously with billy now fen did no cavorting she went to bed early listened with both ears to malises advice worked her horses diligently but still showed an alarming lack of form each day she grew more panicky that she wouldnt be selected for la and would never see dino again that was her sole ambition in england however jake was on sensational form macaulay blissful to have his master on his back again was jumping superbly hardy recovered from the operation and still erratic and cantankerous had some brilliant days wherever jake went he annihilated the competition but he was still nagged by the worry that the selectors had forgotten him because hed been off the circuit so long how much more would he have to achieve before they began to sit up and take notice almost but not entirely taking the edge off his anxiety was his obsession with helen traveling the british circuit he was away from home three or four nights a week sarah was abroad with fen hannah jakes new young groom had a convenient crush on one of the irish riders spending most nights sleeping under haycocks or in the back of the irish boys lorry helen with a volvo at her disposal whizzed up numerous motorways and spent as many nights as possible with jake stretched out in his lorry or on a duvet in the back of the volvo sometimes they went to hotels often despite jakes reluctance helen paid if she had the money why not from the moment she committed herself to jake she felt absolutely no guilt about being unfaithful to rupert or spending his money she did feel guilty about neglecting the children but she was so happy whenever she returned radiant and talkative and so loaded down with guilt presents even choc drops for badger that everyone flourished helen being an emotional tyro was blissfully unaware that everyone in the household knew someone was up and were having bets on who he was on the twentyeighth of may jake returned to the mill house having spent three days at the great cheshire show where he had won every big class by day and spent his nights making love to helen in three days time which was also the first day of the lucerne show the olympic committee would announce ten shortlisted riders from whom the final five would be selected in midjuly jake arrived home absolutely shattered his mended leg ached badly but that was probably due more to an excess of sex than to show jumping as he climbed out of the lorry the sun was setting tory ran out of the house to welcome him with her bulk and her round shining face she seemed after helens slenderness like a matrioska doll that has suddenly gone two sizes up he hoped her elation might be due to the news that hed been selected but it was purely because she was so thrilled to see him he was so tired he kept giving the wrong answers to her questions as he went into the kitchen the children surged forward in their pajamas to welcome him hugging and kissing him bombarding him with questions about the trip realizing he couldnt cope with the din tory sent them off to watch television jake poured himself a drink how did fen do in the nations cup tory had prayed he wouldnt ask she didnt want him upset so soon after hed got home they dropped both her rounds shit what happened she was in floods when she rang i dont think it was anything desdemona did wrong fen said it was her fault shell probably ring you after the grand prix jake dropped a couple of ice cubes in his whisky and went out into the yard watching the horses being put to bed macaulay having rolled and wolfed his dinner was already dragging up the straw preparing to lie down hardy was still restless it always took him a long time to settle back even into his own box as jake progressed down the line each horse came to the halfdoor to welcome him tonight for once they didnt cheer him up why hadnt he heard from malise he went into the tackroom supper called tory from the kitchen door wont be a minute jake called back next moment hed picked up the tackroom telephone as he waited for helen to answer he noticed the peeling paint on the door if charlene answered he would put the telephone down helen its jake darling it was worth the risk to hear the ecstasy in her voice where are you at home i cant talk i just want you to know i miss you like hell suddenly he saw tory appearing in the doorway ill call you tomorrow bye darling said tory i could have made that call for you think i left my wallet in humptys lorry i had a drink with him at lunchtime your wallets in the kitchen silly said tory you must be tired its so sweet youve got that photograph of me from the color supplement tucked inside it its an awful picture i look so fat dyou really miss me when youre away course i do the photograph in fact was part of a feature on showjumping wives that had just appeared in the sunday times color magazine on one side of the page were two photographs one of tory looking fat pink and eager nailing up rosettes in the kitchen the other of janey lloydfoxe managing to look absurdly sexy in a maternity smock the other side of the page was devoted entirely to a photograph of helen on the terrace at penscombe gazing wistfully down the valley looking unbelievably beautiful it was taken before she met jake and was the reason he had sloped up to the newsagent to scrounge another copy in the kitchen jake thanked god that hannah isa and darklis were having dinner with them the children allowed to stay because it was sunday tomorrow were arguing who was going to sit next to him you can both sit next to daddy said tory putting a long loaf of garlic bread on the table darklis had painted a picture at school which she showed proudly to jake its you and macaulay at los angeles daddy both he and macaulay were standing on the rostrum wearing gold medals with balloons coming out of their mouths saying god save the queen i think youre being a bit premature but thank you said jake as tory served out beef cooked in beer and the children both helped themselves to too much mashed potato and hannah brandished the rosettes theyd won this week which tomorrow would be nailed to the corkboard jake wondered if the last month with helen had been all a dream suddenly the telephone rang for a mad moment of panic he thought it might be helen ringing back it was malise calling from lucerne after two minutes tory put jakes dinner in the oven after ten minutes tory gave the rest of the beef out in second helpings knowing jake wouldnt want any more yes he said his back hunched over the telephone with a curious stillness yes i see okay yes were going to need another bottle said hannah i dont know if weve got one said tory what for to celebrate or to cheer ourselves up at last jake came off the telephone he looked like a thundercloud then he smiled and put his arms round tory fen was third in the grand prix oh thank goodness for that said tory there was a long pause they all waited and ive been shortlisted for la he wants me to fly out to lucerne with hardy and macaulay tomorrow tory woke up at four in the morning and reaching out for jake found the bed empty he was in the study cigarettes were piling up in the ashtray outside it was already light blackbirds were bustling importantly across the lawn like clerics in a cathedral close darling what are you doing i couldnt sleep too excited he shook his head ruefully too much to think about hed waited so long for that telephone call despairing that it would ever come now it had and he ought to be overjoyed but all he could think was that he wouldnt see helen for at least a fortnight the prospect appalled him by morning he had the whole thing in perspective and was quite matteroffact when he rang her helen sounded absolutely shattered and made no attempt to keep the disappointment out of her voice im thrilled for you darling but we wont be able to have that week in yorkshire i cant bear it ill only be away ten days but thats an eternity and then rupertll be back for the royal and the royal international can i see you this afternoon its a bit tricky he sounded detached as though he was already in lucerne ive got a hell of a lot to do were desperately shortstaffed anyway with fen and sarah abroad and all the papers to get in order being superstitious he hadnt brought anything up to date in case he wasnt selected ill ring you later he said jake didnt get a moment to ring until seven oclock everyone was in the yard or in the kitchen so in the end he was reduced to pretending he needed some cigarettes from the pub then the pub call box was out of order so he had to use the one in the high street to the fascination of all the locals helen was in a frightful state sweetheart ive been frantic i figured something must have happened im sorry ive been hellishly busy am i going to see you this evening i cant ill come over to you i havent had a night at home for days ive got a hell of a lot still to do were leaving first thing next moment he jumped out of his skin as a neighbor tapped on the window wanting to congratulate jake on being shortlisted what are you doing in a call box anyway he asked ours is out of order said jake come and use ours then ive nearly finished jake banged the door shut darling im sorry someone banged on the window look ill ring you as soon as i get to lucerne i can take a hint said helen in a tight voice youve only got time for your bloody horses dont be such a bitch i thought you were different sobbed helen but youre behaving just like rupert hardly surprising if you carry on like this but she slammed down the telephone the locals drinking outside the pub were highly diverted to see jake come out of the telephone box wander up the street away from his own car nearly get run over crossing the street then wander back into the telephone box again jake was very restless at dinner snapping at the children hardly eating anything you all right asked tory as she cleared away im sorry jake put an apologetic hand on her back its just nerves i guess and tiredness said tory throwing the remains of his ham and baked potatoes into the muck bucket youre jolly well going to bed early i will i promise but i met hugh massey in the street he says hes got a video of last years show at lucerne he promised to show it to me dont be long she said pretending to collect his car keys jake went upstairs darklis caught him in the bathroom why are you cleaning your teeth daddy because i got a bit of ham stuck lied jake in disgust darklis gazed at her face in the bathroom mirror i dont think anyone will marry me when i grow up ill marry you sweetheart said jake dropping a kiss on her head youve already got a woman said darklis gloomily ive got two thought jake wryly helen was waiting in the car park of the goat and boots three miles away she got into his car and they drove half a mile into the country and turned off the road helen fell into his arms im so sorry im desperately sorry please dont ever let me behave like that again i just couldnt bear the thought of your going away hush pet hush gradually he calmed her now he said im going to talk and youre going to listen weve got to face the fact that im going to be horrendously busy for the next two months for one thing we desperately need the cash fens been off form and she needs sorting out ive still got a long way to go with hardy ive got to kill myself to get a place in that team to be selfish if im not selected i dont want to reproach myself for the rest of my life for having blown it because i didnt work hard enough im not a natural like your husband ever since ive been in show jumping its been one hell of a struggle to keep going fen the children the grooms and most of all tory have had to make colossal sacrifices after that last fall ive crawled back from the gates of hell but only because they made it possible i owe it to them all to get to la and i want to go his voice softened and he put up his hand to stroke her cheek which was wet with tears until i met you i thought i wanted it more than anything else allow me three and a half months until the games are over there thats the longest speech ive ever made ill put up with anything said helen in a trembling voice i just thought youd gone off me jake laughed youre like macaulay desperate for reassurance thats the difference between us said helen slowly my marriage is absolute purgatory yours is perfectly okay were batting from different strengths there was a pause jake was too truthful to disagree with her shall i fly out to lucerne she asked with a sudden surge of hope no i dont want any distractions and with that she had to be content rupert rang the following evening he was halfway to lucerne rocky he said had won the grand prix on the saturday hows fen getting on asked helen disastrously i cant think why malise doesnt pack her off back to junior classes mind you hes really gone off his head now hes just sent for jake lovell jake lovell i said to him couldnt get a jump in a brothel lucerne was a show of mixed fortunes for jake macaulay who hadnt flown since jake brought him halfstarved back from the middle east four years before obviously thought he was being taken back to the stone quarries and completely freaked out on the flight sweating as though in the highest fever his huge body quivering with terror in the tiny crate his anguished eyes imploring jake not to desert him he reminded his master of nothing so much as helen it took all jakes skill and patience to stop him kicking the plane out arriving in lucerne macaulay was pathetically pleased to see such old friends as fen sarah and malise he was further comforted to see desdemona in situ and dragged jake halfway across the yard to check if it were really her touching her nose exchanging breaths macaulay was still rigid with disbelief only when desdemona reached up to rest her roan face against his still sweating neck protective and defensive did he begin to relax but he never really recovered his form all week bearing in mind that there would be a punishing flight to the olympics and macaulay was not all that sound in the wind and a cleanwinded horse was essential for the los angeles smog jake after long discussions with malise decided to pull him out of the contest he was heartbroken most of all he had wanted to win a medal on macaulay but his horses always came first and jake was not prepared to put the big fellow through the traumas of another plane journey hed already made plans to box him home which meant everything rested on the sleek but irritably twitching gray shoulders of hardy who was magnificent on his day but perfectly capable of carting jake or kicking every fence out if he so chose in lucerne after a sulky start he came second in two classes and jumped an exemplary clear in the first round of the nations cup in the second he put in a dirty stop at the water leaving jake sitting in the exquisite model lake with a stream of expletives on his lips and a bridle in his hand while hardy cavorted round the ring like tinkerbell refusing to be caught having learnt to duck out of his bridle hardy suddenly decided what fun it was and did exactly the same thing in a speed class the following day all this provided wonderful fuel for rupert who proceeded to put the boot in on every occasion although fen got very hot under the collar and snapped back at rupert jake refused to rise he got a quiet satisfaction from the thought of how much better hed been riding ruperts wife at home and a further laugh when the post arrived one morning and rupert actually handed him an envelope containing a passionate love letter from helen thank goodness shed had the foresight to type the envelope and post it in london finally hardy put a muzzle on all his critics by coming second to ludwig in the grand prix but all in all jake did not feel the weeks adventures had enhanced his olympic prospects after lucerne it was back to the royal in birmingham then out to aachen then more shows in england and finally crittleden at the end of july after which the team would be announced all this made jake very uptight and although he missed helen appallingly he had plenty to occupy his mind helen on the other hand had nothing she thought about jake obsessively it was as if he was the same television program permanently in front of her eyes his face haunted her dreams at night she tossed and turned longing for his hands on her body she had even convinced herself that jake would make a much better father for the children particularly marcus rupert had come home from lucerne and taken both children to the fair here he had insisted on riding on all the most frightening things tabitha adored every minute of it marcus was absolutely terrified and ended up being sick on the top of the big wheel soaking not only ruperts trousers but the couple immediately below them who took it in very bad part rupert returned home in a blazing temper with marcus white and shaking and tabitha in high glee telling everyone what had happened that evening marcus had his worst asthma attack ever as helen soothed him to sleep in the early hours of the morning she found under his pillow one of the little dogs with a ruff from the circus jake had given him want to see dake again murmured marcus slowly like dake very much oh so do i darling sighed helen a week later janey gave birth to a beautiful darkhaired boy who weighed seven pounds and happily looked exactly like billy they called him christopher william soon abbreviated to christy and both parents absolutely doted on him watching billy in his newfound role as an adoring father helen brooded all the more on ruperts lack of interest in marcus on the other hand she had reason to be grateful to little christy as a devoted godmother she was provided with the perfect alibi afternoon or evening she merely had to tell charlene she was popping along to see janey and the new baby then having dumped a bunch of flowers and a glossy magazine and cooed for two minutes she could rush off to see jake during the royal show she and jake were able to snatch an afternoon together leaving rupert safely competing in a couple of classes jake left birmingham and drove the eighty odd miles over to penscombe charlene had taken the children to a birthday party so they had the house to themselves jake was very jumpy he hated making love to helen on ruperts territory he thought of the mill house with its damp peeling paint torn wallpaper and messy homely rooms which had suffered eight years of wear and tear from children and animals then he looked at this ravishing house and the green valley and the tennis court and the swimming pool and the garden in its rosescented midsummer glory the blatant perfection of the whole thing depressed him and yet overwhelming all this was his desperate need to see helen again and again though he hated to admit the buzz of actually making love to her in ruperts huge fourposter he was amazed how passionate and totally uninhibited shed become i never thought id like it that way she said the only problem with soixanteneuf is that neither of you can tell the other how marvelous it is while youre doing it lets do it straight next time so you can said jake bighead said helen rolling onto her front lying on top of her jake slowly returned to earth kissing her freckled shoulders gently nibbling the lobes of her ears helen whod buried her face in the pillow said in a muffled voice jake i love you there was a long pause a horse whinnied from the valley a dog barked in the distance then jake said i love you too lying beside her smoking a cigarette not worrying about the smell of tobacco because rupert wasnt due back until the following day he said ive never said that to anyone in my life before not even to tory he shook his head why did you marry her then because she was rich and she bought me my first horse didnt you love her at all not in the way i love you as i said shes been a very good wife but were all inclined to take her for granted dino brought her out he really bothered with her and she adored him dino was also very fond of me said helen her face suddenly sulky jake sat up and looked down at her grinning i do believe youre jealous of tory then seeing the pain and misery in her eyes he pulled her into his arms clinging to him fiercely like a child begging for a bedtime story to ward off the terrors of darkness she said tell me about the gypsies he settled her into the crook of his arm well if a womans unfaithful to her lover he cuts off her ear or her nose or scars her cheeks so youd better be careful if your wifes unfaithful you tie her to a cartwheel and thrash her or shave her head golly said helen nervously how primitive then if you want to marry a girl you send her a spotted handkerchief if shes wearing it next time you meet her you know shes willing to marry you helen was amazed how much it hurt her to ask did you give one to tory yes it was very cheap red cotton all i could afford at the time she still keeps it in her jewel case but its terribly faded he looked at his watch christ i must go oh please not ive got a class at seven ive got to walk the course and itll take me an hour to get back in the rushhour traffic ill have to drive like hell as it is am i jeopardizing your career yes he said kissing her next minute the doorbell pealed and the dogs went into a frenzy of barking christ whos that helen snuggled up to him lie still it might go away the doorbell rang again the barking increased naked helen crept down the passage and hidden by the clematis which swarmed over the spare room window peered out a minute later she was back in her bedroom giggling jake was already getting dressed all i can see is a straw hat well youd better go and redirect it said jake wrapping herself in a big rustcolored towel helen went downstairs in the doorway she found two elderly women fanning themselves one was carrying a camera we thought for an awful moment you were out said the first who was wearing the straw hat i was in the bath said helen can i help you weve come to interview you for loving mother magazine miss taylor here the woman in the straw hat waved in the direction of the woman with the camera is going to take the pictures oh my goodness helen froze with horror she remembered theyd rung and made an appointment weeks ago and jake must have rung straightaway afterwards and shed forgotten to put it in the diary suddenly she could feel jakes sperm trickling down her legs and backed away hastily ramming her legs together hoping they couldnt smell all the sex and excitement youd better come in she said weakly you must forgive me i had a panic getting rupert off to a show this morning she lied usually im so punctilious about these things miss crabtree gave a jolly laugh oh the needs of the great man must take preference she stepped into the hall what a lovely home helens mind was racing how the hell was she going to smuggle jake out then she had a brainwave come onto the terrace the views so lovely would you like a drink miss crabtree consulted her watch well its only halfpast four wed love a cup of tea of course a cup of tea helen fled into the kitchen put the kettle on and rushed up the backstairs halfhysterical with laughter and terror she found jake dressed and trying to make his cigarette butt disappear down the loo have you got rid of them no theyve come to interview me about being a devoted wife and mother jake grinned theyd better come and interview me shut up ive got them safely on the terrace you steal out by the back door tugging on a dress and a pair of pants she flung her arms around his neck ring me this evening tearing downstairs she rang charlene she could hear tumultuous party noises in the background bring the children back at once someones come to photograph them i cant in the middle of tea and then theres the conjuror and tom and jerry well bring them back as soon as possible they were nearly out of earl gray and the only biscuits were shaped like animals and topped with different colored icing all the cups were in the dishwasher which wasnt turned on shed have to have a word with charlene things were getting awfully slack she was just drying the cups when miss crabtree wandered into the kitchen its rather hot out there so i thought id come and help you theyre so lovely and cool these old houses any moment thought helen in panic jake would come down the backstairs into the kitchen and where the hell had miss taylor gone how old are your children helen dragged her mind back um four and two what a lovely age theyll be back soon theyve gone to a party i thought we could talk in peace first i hope you dont mind miss taylors gone upstairs to find a toilet helen gave a whimper of horror oh dear i hope theres a clean towel up there she was just rushing out of one kitchen door when she heard steps on the backstairs why dont you go and sit in the drawing room she pleaded to miss crabtree its awfully cool in there ill bring the tea in it might help if you put some tea in the pot said miss crabtree with a jolly laugh not budging an inch tripping over action man and an ancient teddy bear placed on the stair to be taken up to the nursery jake fell into the kitchen to helens amazement he was carrying a bucket and a jcloth she gazed at him despairingly all right mrs cb he said putting on a strong cockney accent ive finished ive done all the upstairs winders even that little blighter on the top landing fort id swing to my death ohoh helen mouthed ineffectually oh how much is that jake scratched his head fifteen pounds he said theres a lot of winders helen got a fiver and a tenner out of the housekeeping pot here you are thank you so much miss crabtree whod taken matters into her own hands had made the tea would you like a cup she added to jake cleaning windows is an awfully thirsty business although her voice trailed off he didnt seem to have cleaned the downstairs windows at all no thanks said jake ill be off there are quite a few smears here said miss crabtree bossily only did the top two floors said jake i leave the bottom to mrs bodkin when do you want me again in a monfs time helen nodded not trusting herself to speak well cheerio then jake nodded to miss crabtree ill see you out mumbled helen quite helpless with laughter they collapsed outside the back door id no idea you were such a good actor she said as he shoved the money back into the pocket of her dress jake kissed her again ill ring you after the class is finished tonight in the kitchen miss crabtree was joined by miss taylor what a lovely house wheres our hostess saying goodbye to the window cleaner theyre awfully unclass conscious arent they the americans i mean shes just as charming to him as she is to us as the day of the last olympic trial at crittleden approached jake grew more and more nervous hardys off days were fewer and fen had had some good wins on desdemona but equally griselda hubbard had hit amazing form and two young shortlisted riders ralph naylor and fiona mcfadden had both jumped brilliantly under pressure at aachen and several newspapers were agitating for their inclusion in the team rupert and ivor braine had been so consistent all year so they were virtually certain of a place fen was terribly down because joanna battie had written a bitchy piece headlined fen resting on her laurel pointing out that she hadnt had a decent win on laurel since the previous year at wembley and that desdemona was too small for an olympic course knowing how desperate fen was to go jake felt almost more apprehensive for her than for himself rupert on the other hand was irritated because helen refused to make up her mind whether or not she was going to los angeles she used as an excuse the los angeles smog being bad for marcuss asthma but in reality she wanted to see if jake were selected if he wasnt shed stay behind rupert who was trying to persuade amanda hamilton to fly out for a few days wanted a decision one way or the other the course for the final trial was unnecessarily huge there were a number of very unhappy rounds before jake came in griselda was on twelve ivor eight fen had one stop because shed come in too fast and two elements of the combination down everyone was grumbling that the combination was unjumpable then jake rode in and proved them wrong by going clear thus encouraged rupert wishbone and ludwig went clear but in the final jumpoff jake really set hardy on fire on the long runup to the last fence to score the fastest time well done said fen desperately trying to be enthusiastic you must be picked after that jake shook his head he was horribly afraid it wouldnt be good enough they wanted dependability at the olympics the selectors locked themselves away the riders waited and waited for the promised announcement after an hour biting their nails jake and fen who were jumping at stoneleigh early the following morning decided to push off if they were selected theyd hear soon enough if they werent it didnt matter anyway the jams were terrible they seemed to get caught up in all the holiday traffic nobody talked very much after an hours delay on the m they decided to cut across country bored with tapes sarah turned on the lorry radio fen looked miserably out at the great rolling cornfields deepened to red gold by the rain when would she ever see dino again when would she ever be happy idly she listened to the eight oclock news mrs thatcher the prime minister would be spending a few days up at balmoral staying with the queen during the summer recess the russians had launched another satellite the unemployed had risen by as a result of school leavers the olympic showjumping committee tonight announced their team for los angeles said the announcer everyone stiffened fen grabbed sarahs hand crossing her fingers on the other oh please please god the five riders and their horses include rupert campbellblack and rock star griselda hubbard and mr punch sarah gave a groan ivor braine and john the announcer rustled his notes jake lovell and hardy and fenella maxwell and desdemona giving a whoop of joy jake nearly drove off the road the car behind them was trying to overtake and hooted furiously speechless sarah and fen hugged each other then sarah hugged jake then they all started shouting at the tops of their voices and bellowing california here we come jake drove to the next village where they found an offlicense and bought a bottle of wine have one on the house said the landlord putting another bottle in the carrier bag ive just heard it on the radio congratulations they pulled up on the edge of a field and drank the muscadet out of mugs allowing the horses to graze and watching the sun set heres to you said sarah im so proud of you both next moment fen had stumbled to her feet and was hugging desdemona jake saw that her shoulders were shaking he put an arm round her whats the matter nothing im just so happy theres no need to cry then im going to see dino again halflaughing halfcrying she rubbed away the tears streaking her face with grimy hands i expect hes got a million other girlfriends by now but at least ill get the chance to say im sorry missed him that much have you fen nodded theres never a moment when im not missing him but you wouldnt understand that never having been in love after the team announcement malise wrote to all the five riders confirming their selection they would be expected to jump together once more as a team at the dublin horse show the first week in august then rest their olympic horses until they flew them out to los angeles at the end of the month leaving rocky at home to rest rupert flew the rest of his grade a horses over to france for the deauville and dinard shows and was due home on monday night he had been deeply scathing of the rest of the olympic team a schoolgirl a cretin a riproaring dyke and a crippled gypsy ill have to carry the lot of them he told amanda hamilton nor was he particularly pleased when helen decided that she would be coming to los angeles after all helen sat on the terrace drinking white wine breathing in the nightscented stock and reading george herbert in the fading light who would have thought my shriveld heart could have recovered greenness who indeed she had never believed after kenya that she would ever be happy again that she would be totally wiped out by love for jake that the only person she wanted to be in the world was the second mrs lovell not that jake was showing any inclination to make her so she knew that he loved her except in her frequent moments of panic and with that until after los angeles she would have to be content as rupert was not due back from dinard until the next day and charlene and the children were away for the night jake said he might pop in but only might she mustnt expect him on the eve of departure for dublin he was frantically busy loading the lorry rupert taking the easy way was flying over and letting the grooms do the driving helen hadnt done anything except wash her hair and have a bath earlier shed learnt superstition from jake if she tarted herself up he wouldnt make it watching a halfmoon sailing like a moth up the drained blue sky she gave a cry of joy for there clearly visible moving along the top road towards penscombe above the honeycolored stone wall was jakes car rushing upstairs to the bedroom she cleaned her teeth splashed on cologne and tugging off her panties leapt into the bath holding up the skirt of the yellow dress shed worn the night hed first made love to her and which she knew he liked she hastily showered between her legs shivering with excitement as the hard jet of water flattened her bush and seeped into her vagina leaving two dusty footprints in the bath she leapt out and combed her hair since jake had told her he liked her just as much without makeup she felt secure enough not to bother with that all the time either stretching voluptuously she went to the window and then stiffened with horror for there as usual coming too fast along the road and only five minutes behind jake was ruperts blue porsche next minute she heard the crunch of wheels on the gravel and the dogs barking and tore downstairs opening the door she collapsed gibbering into jakes arms whats the matter ruperts just behind you ive seen him on the road what can we do nothing said jake his brain racing go and wash that scent off we have to brazen it out pretend i just dropped in better come out onto the terrace said helen its getting dark out there and he wont be able to see how much were blushing jake followed her out running his finger down her spine anyway if he finds out he finds out hes got to know sometime he said helen went very still turning around she looked straight into jakes eyes has he she whispered jake gazed back at her steadily no shiftiness in his eyes now yes he said you know he has to sooner or later itd just be easier after la helen moved towards him do you really mean that yes i think i always have i just havent said it he only had time to hold her briefly before there was a second crunch on the gravel and more barking i cant face him said helen in sudden panic ill sort him out just get me a drink scotch a quadruple and as soon as possible helen fled to the kitchen her bare feet making no sound on the carpet bang rupert slammed the front door behind him he was not in a good mood hed specially come back to spend the night in london with amanda and after two admittedly splendid hours shed pushed off to sussex saying she had to drive her daughter to some dance helen he shouted tab im home where the hell is everyone jake waited on the terrace helen rupert shouted again more irritably shes in the kitchen said jake whos that rupert came out onto the terrace then stopped in his tracks looking at jake with slit eyes his hair was bleached by the french sun and he was wearing a blue tshirt with i love la in red letters across the front inspiration suddenly came to jake beautiful place youve got here he said id only seen it from the road there are perfectly good gates at the bottom of the drive im sure you dont need me to show you the way to them said rupert coldly i dropped in said jake on the offchance you might be back i got a letter from malise this week i decided as weve both been selected and i want the team gold as much as you do wed stand a better chance if we buried the hatchet at least temporarily he held out his hand rupert for once at a loss for words looked down at the hand which was completely steady he thought of his own humiliation in the world championship he thought of fen defying him at the crittleden strike he thought of jake in the dormitory at st augustines a terrified little boy cringing away from the lighted matches now here he was waving white flags and offering peace initiatives the hand was still there briefly rupert took it all right i dont trust you a fucking inch gyppo but for the sake of the team gold well suspend hostilities till after the games then he added smiling ill smash the hell out of you wed better have a drink helen he yelled yes said helen faintly she was getting some ice said jake probably hovering to see if i was to be allowed a drink you were lucky to catch me i wasnt planning to come back tonight at all what dyou want scotch please at that moment helen came through the door clutching a tray with one already poured glass of whisky the whisky decanter a second empty glass and the ice bucket she looked at them both with terrified eyes like a rabbit caught in the headlights not knowing which way to bolt hi said rupert weve decided not to kill each other youve met helen before havent you as jake took his glass from helen to stop the frantic rattling he wondered for a second if rupert was speaking ironically then decided that such was his egotism and contempt for jake that he couldnt possibly envisage anything between him and helen all the same it was a good thing there was only helens glass halffull on the terrace wall jake took a huge gulp of whisky and nearly choked christ it was strong and thank god for that rupert poured two fingers into his own glass im giving up after dublin he said i want a stone off before the games i cant afford to lose it said jake how was dinard bloody good and rocky bloody good too i keep thinking hes going to jump off the top of the world im scared hes going to peak too early in a daze helen poured herself another glass of wine i cannot believe this she said to herself here are two men who i know detest each other beyond anything talking not just politely but with enjoyment not by a flicker of an eyelid did jake betray any nerves or the slightest interest in her but continued to discuss the team their weaknesses the strength of the opposition at the games and which riders they had to watch he asked ruperts advice about the la climate and possible breathing and fitness problems after dublin rupert explained he was flying rocky straight out to la to give them both time to get adjusted to the climate this would certainly give him the edge over the other british riders who wouldnt be leaving until a fortnight later if ruperts in la thought helen thatll give jake and me a safe fortnight she marveled at his quickwittedness she never dreamed he would use the excuse of coming to make peace she was overwhelmed with gratitude that he had averted a scene she wished she could remember his exact words before rupert arrived but shed been in such a panic when he said rupert would have to find out sometime did he mean that he was going to commit himself to her and leave tory or merely that by the law of misfortune rupert would rumble them sooner or later she felt sure he had meant the former watching his face dark intense growing more shadowed as the sun slipped behind the beeches yet suddenly illumined gold as a chink was found between the leaves helen could read only one emotion passionate interest in what rupert was saying bloody bloody horses she thought will i ever get away from them jake tried to leave after the second drink he was already slightly tight and on an empty stomach might easily make some false move he glanced at his watch and put his glass down i must go sorry to barge in on you like that goodbye and thanks he added casually to helen rupert went to the door with him a desire to show off overcoming natural antipathy he said like to see the yard okay said jake just for two minutes an hour later helen heard his car drive away and rupert came through the front door im starving shall i go and get a takeaway i want to be taken away thought helen in desolation she had been so happy when jake had turned up and now she had no idea when shed see him again particularly as he was going to dublin first thing in the morning she couldnt resist discussing him with rupert wasnt it amazing his coming here he was certainly impressed by the setup said rupert picking up his car keys said hed come to bury the hatchet bury it in my cranium more likely dont trust the bugger an inch suspect he came to have a gawp as much as anything to see if he could pick up a few tips asked me the way back to warwickshire hadnt a clue where he was i told him the sapperton way he was so pissed with any luck hell run into a wall do you want chinese or indian the following friday helen slumped in total despair at the breakfast table two hands gaining warmth from a cup of black coffee she had heard from jake only once since hed been in dublin and that was only a twominute call before someone interrupted him he said hed ring back and hadnt hed obviously got cold feet letter for you mrs cb said charlene handing her a bulky envelope postmarked dublin youd better watch out its not a letter bomb helen was about to tell her not to be nosy then she recognized jakes black spiky handwriting inside the envelope was folded a large dark blue silk spotted handkerchief thats lovely mrs cb said charlene navy goes with everything helen went white and upended the envelope there was nothing else inside the spotted handkerchief jake was telling her he wanted her for good she seemed absolutely dazed charlene told dizzy afterwards then helen jumped to her feet laughing im going to dublin she said i want to watch er my husband in the aga khan cup the aga khan cup a splendid trophy is presented to the winning side in the nations cup at the dublin horse show all dublin turns out to watch the event and every irish child whos ever ridden a horse dreams of being in the home team one day for the british it was their last chance to jump as a team before la all the riders were edgy which of the five would malise drop in the end it was griselda who pulled a groin muscle shafting some chambermaid said rupert but who would be perfectly recovered in time for la on the thursday night the british team had been to one of those legendary horseshow balls unchaperoned by malise who was unwisely dining at the british embassy and enjoying the release from tension after being selected they got impossibly drunk particularly jake and all ended up swimming naked in the liffey next day none of them was sufficiently recovered to work their horses jake who didnt go to bed at all spent the following morning trying to ring helen from the press office he had huge difficulty remembering and then dialing her number a strange bleating tone continually greeted him dragging wishbone to the telephone he asked is that the engaged or the outoforder signal over here sure said wishbone soothingly tis somewhere between the two christ yelled jake then clutched his head as it nearly exploded with pain half of him was desperate to talk to helen and find out how shed reacted to the blue spotted handkerchief hed sent off to her the other day when he was plastered the other half was demented with panic at what he might have triggered off none of the telephones seemed to work wishbone who was talking to a man in a loud check suit who seemed to know every horse in the show bought jake another drink drink is a terrible dirty ting he said happily but the only answer is to drink more of it jake looked at his watch and wondered if hed ever totter as far as the ring wed better go and walk the course he urged wishbone well be very late stop worrying said wishbone we havent got a course yet he jerked his head towards the man in the loud check suit who was busy buying yet another round hes the coursebuilder all in all the british put up a disgraceful performance a greenfaced tottering bunch they staggered shakily from fence to fence holding on to rather than checking the spreads wincing in the blinding sunshine to the intense glee of the merry irish crowd who had seen visiting teams sabotaged before ivor fell off at the first and third fences and then exceeded the time limit fen knocked every fence down rupert managed to get rocky round with only twenty faults his worst performance ever jake waiting to go in by the little white church was well aware as hardy plunged underneath him that the horse knew how fragile he felt for christs sake get round said malise who was looking extremely tightlipped or well be eliminated from the competition altogether suddenly jake looked up at the elite riders stand which is known in dublin as the pocket he felt his heart lurch for there smiling and radiant was helen she was wearing a white suit and her hair which shed been in too much of a hurry to wash was tied back by a blue silk spotted handkerchief his challenge had been taken up oh good helens come after all said malise sounding very pleased and beetling off to the pocket good luck he called over his shoulder to jake concentration thrown to the winds jake rode into the ring somehow he managed to take off his hat to the judges and start cantering when the bell went but that effort was too much for him hardy put in a terrific stop at the first fence and jake went sailing through the air the next moment hardy had wriggled out of his bridle and was cavorting joyously round the ring until hed exceeded the time limit jake just sat on the ground sobbing with helpless laughter when he finally limped out of the ring malise was looking like a thundercloud there is absolutely nothing to laugh about you dont think hell unselect us said fen in terror jake shook his head then winced but all he could say to himself joyfully over and over again was shes here and shes wearing the handkerchief the irish won the aga khan cup theres absolutely no point in talking to any of you said malise furiously but i want everyone grooms wives hangerson included to come to my room at nine oclock tomorrow if any of you dont show up youre out the only answer seemed to be to go on to another even more riotous ball where reaction inevitably set in the hair of the dog is doing absolutely nothing to cure my hangover fen grumbled to ivor as he trod on her toes round the dance floor really if rupert doesnt get his hand out of the back of that girls dress soon hell be tickling the soles of her feet the music came to an end im going to bed dont said ivor ill have no one to dance with go and talk to griselda said fen kissing him on the forehead she couldnt cope with the frenzied merriness nights like this made her longing for dino worse than ever she drifted rather unsteadily across the ballroom and out through one of the side doors looking for jake to say good night a couple of irishmen called out to her trying to persuade her to come and dance then decided not there was something about fens frozen face these days that kept men at a distance the way helens used to she wandered down a passage and into a dimly lit library which was empty except for one couple they were standing under a picture light talking in that intense still way of people who are totally absorbed in one another they were about the same height fens blood ran cold she must be seeing things the man was comforting the girl be patient please pet it was a crazy idea to come she said in a low voice i cant bear not being able to be with you all the time or to go to bed without you tonight the man was stroking her face now drawing her close to him sweetheart just let me get los angeles over and then well make plans i promise you really promise i promise you know i love you youve got the handkerchief he bent his head and kissed her fen gave a whimper and fled forgetting her coat she ran out of the building and through the streets desperate to escape to her hotel room helen and jake it couldnt be true that explained why hed been so different recently remote and unsociable one moment then wildly and uncharacteristically manic the next and terribly absentminded hed hardly have minded if shed fed desdemona caviar fen had always heroworshiped jake and regarded his marriage to tory as the one safe good constant she could cling on to and perhaps one day emulate now her whole world seemed to be crumbling what about tory what about isa and darklis and more to the point what the hell was rupert going to do when he found out nothing short of murder everyone albeit a little pale and shaking was on parade for malises meeting next morning no one was asked to sit down malise immaculate as usual in an olive green tweed coat and cavalry club tie glared at them as if they were a lot of schoolboys caught smoking behind the pavilion yesterdays blaze of temper had given way to a cold anger at least we can go to the games knowing we havent peaked yet he said i have never seen such an appalling demonstration you rode like a bunch of fairies i doubt if any of you had more than an hours sleep beforehand youve made complete idiots of the selection committee three days in the glasshouse muttered rupert and you can shut up snapped malise your round bearing in mind the horse you were riding was the worst of the lot they say a lousy dress rehearsal means a good first night but this is ridiculous then he smiled slightly and fen suddenly thought what a fantastically attractive man he was for his age now he said if you can find somewhere comfortable to park yourselves ill show you some clips from earlier olympics refusing a seat jake lounged against the door so he could look at helen who was sitting in one of the chairs with dizzy perched on the arm she was pale and heavyeyed with her red hair drawn off her face and tied at the nape of the neck by the blue spotted handkerchief to jake she had never looked more beautiful he felt simply flattened by love he could hardly concentrate on the clips of straining javelinthrowers and sprinters crashing through the tape and muddy threedayeventers and ann moore getting her silver malise switched off the video machine i dont think i need to tell you much else if you do get a medal particularly a gold it will be the greatest moment of you life make no mistake about that and if you dont get that medal because you were not quite good enough on the day or because your horse wasnt fit or because your nerves got to you thats all well and good but if you can look back afterwards and say i failed because i drank too much or didnt train or stayed up too late or didnt work my horse diligently enough youll regret it for the rest of your life he might be echoing jake helen said to herself he looked round at the five riders youre probably the oldest olympic squad weve ever fielded except for fen which means we can offer a wealth of experience but the heat may get to you it also means this may well be your last chance of a crack at the olympics he turned to the grooms and to helen and to griseldas rather mild father who was sharing the arm of a chair with ivors mother id like to say the same to the families and grooms and wives for the next month try to be totally unselfish you will find the riders tricky irascible and demanding as the competition gets nearer this may take the form of increasing detachment as they try to distance themselves this you must put up with they need to keep calm for in this way the horses will stay calm dont make unnecessary demands wives and families if theyre not coming to la shouldnt expect regular telephone calls times are cockeyed security will often make it difficult to get to a telephone malise looked over to jake im sorry torys not here he said with a smile but shes the one person i know who doesnt need to hear any of this shes always given you exemplary backup helen bit her lip she felt an agonizing stab of jealousy she must try not to hassle jake all right thats all said malise briskly except i want to come home with two golds having redeemed himself and his country by winning the grand prix on saturday night rupert flew rocky direct to los angeles the following day which would give them both nearly a month to get used to the climate a fortnight later he flew back to england on the excuse of having his olympic uniform fitted and sorting out business matters but in reality to see amanda hamilton he was meeting her at her house in kensington this he regarded as a major breakthrough and also that hed been able to drag her down from scotland in the middle of august when she should be making shooting lunches for rollo and entertaining his cabinet colleagues as he drove past pavements pastel with tourists and looked at the expanse of female leg and the briefness of skirts and shorts rupert reflected how strange it was that his sexual energies had become almost entirely concentrated on amanda the fact that she often didnt bother to dress up or wash her hair or put on makeup when she saw him only increased his interest as did the fact that she was always busy with her children or her committees or rollos career and had very little spare time for him hed had to fight every inch of the way used to girls who were only too available who were always bathed and scented and dolled up to the nth degree and quivering with anticipation rupert found her an amazing novelty they knew all the same people and were governed by the same rules she was also the first woman he couldnt bully the house in rutland gate was burglaralarmed up to the eyeballs amandas excuse to rollo had been great aunt augustas eightieth birthday party which had taken place at lunchtime amanda would spend the night in london and fly north next morning it was always a good idea she explained to rollo to pop in on the servants unexpectedly and keep them on their toes the servants a filipino couple whod left a member of the royal family because there had been too many riding boots to clean were very put out at mrs hamiltons arrival theyd planned to have a party in the basement that night but were slightly appeased when amanda told them to carry on and that she wouldnt be needing dinner after dining in barnes which was safe according to amanda because one never saw anyone one knew in the suburbs and which didnt take long because rupert wasnt drinking they crept into the house unnoticed downstairs the party was in full swing will rollo have me for breaking and entering said rupert removing his tie amanda didnt laugh you know he cant afford any scandal she said putting her diamond earrings in her jewel case is helen flying back to la with you next week yes said rupert i think she must have been to some marriage guidance counselor whos told her to take an interest in my career good said amanda feeling the earth of the plants by the window why do servants never understand about watering why good snapped rupert from inside his shirt you dont want a messy divorce at the moment youll go down much better with the party if you have a beautiful and adoring wife i go down brilliantly anyway said rupert leaping on her it does seem rather awful doing it in rollos bed not nearly as awful as not doing it afterwards she lay in ruperts arms thinking but not telling him how lovely it was to have a whole night together against her better judgment she was becoming increasingly fond of him rupert was spoilt and perfectly disgraceful but he made her laugh and then of course he was terribly attractive if you get a gold will you retire nail my whip to the wall you mean i might i cant go on riding horses forever what are you going to do about helen i really do mean it you dont want a divorce if youre going into politics as long as i can have the dogs and tab and the house i wouldnt mind helen can have marcus and the first editions and the van dyck will you promise to think seriously about politics after la urged amanda the pm was very charmed by you if sir william goes to the common market there should be a safe seat in gloucestershire in the autumn you cant play around forever an aging playboy is a pathetic sight she went on lying back on the pillow gradually he starts drifting down to girls who are less pretty and instead of making them on the first night it takes three nights or they decide after one night they dont like him youre thirtyone now and you think thats going to be my fate said rupert coldly amanda hamilton looked at the beautiful depraved face and the marvelously lean muscular suntanned body and her face softened no not for a long time but i dont think an unhappy marriage coupled with an intellectually undemanding career are doing you any good rupert took her face between his hands i suppose youd never think of divorcing rollo you and id be marvelous together amanda blushed im far too old for you and theres rollos career and anyway weve got four children to educate theyll probably all go on to a university ill educate your children said rupert he glanced at the silverframed photograph on the mantelpiece of amandas eldest daughter georgina and was about to say he wouldnt mind teaching her the facts of life at all then thought better of it amanda didnt like those kinds of jokes by now rupert wanted her again and getting out of bed prowled the room looking for novelty he could take her sitting in that pink buttonback chair then his eye lit on the huge mirror over the mantelpiece what are you doing asked amanda that looking glass is seventeenth century it was a wedding present from rollos grandmother been in his family for years i want to see us said rupert gasping under the huge weight of the mirror he balanced it on the padded arms of the chair which hed pulled alongside the bed can you see yourself now he asked amanda not a thing ill tip it forward a bit rupert piled up pale blue and lilac silk cushions behind the mirror for gods sake be careful said amanda but she was diverted by what she saw the old glass was very flattering and gave a dusky warmth to her body and a golden glow to her face she liked the way her breasts fell and the lovely curve of her waist into her hips christ thats marvelous said rupert getting onto the bed behind her he was so dark tanned it was almost like going to bed with a black man fascinated she watched his long fingers stroking her belly then sliding into the dark bush look how beautiful you are he said softly spreading back the butterfly wings of her labia next moment he had lifted her buttocks and driven his cock into the warm sticky cave of her vagina amanda gasped nice isnt it now he was lifting her right leg holding back the inside of her thigh so she could see the long length of his cock driving into her it was like an express train going into a tunnel madly excited amanda bucked back against him feeling his fingers stroking her faster and faster come on darling come on as they both came they were aware of a mighty crash amanda gave a shriek as lurching forward the mirror hit the wooden handles of the chair and crashed to the ground in a thousand pieces now see what youve done she said furiously rollo will murder me next minute she heard voices drunken excited filipinos were storming up the stairs move the chair back and get into the bathroom snapped amanda sliding into her nightie all right conceptione rupert heard her saying im afraid the mirror fell off the wall the string must have rotted hastily she shoved ruperts glass of coke behind a cachepot bring me a hoover no ill clear it up im fine you go back to your party three minutes later rupert heard the noise of the hoover still pushing it around the floor amanda opened the door to the bathroom you can come out now rupert could tell she was absolutely livid ill pay for it he said the money doesnt matter she wailed think of the seven years bad luck think of georgies o levels and the next election rupert looked out through the liftgate bars on the window at the yellowing grass of kensington gardens what about my gold he thought broodingly as soon as jake returned from dublin olympic panic set in the telephone never stopped ringing with officials press horsiana manufacturers and potential sponsors whod heard he and fen might go professional after the games because they were not rich like rupert they had to keep taking the rest of the horses to shows right up to the last moment in between there were endless medical tests for both horses and riders and jake and fen had to rush up to london to get their olympic uniforms fitted then on to moss bros to choose coats and breeches fen was livid she wasnt allowed to wear a dark blue coat blacks so hard she grumbled anyway im not going to a funeral you may well think you are said jake when you see the size of the fences jake was so ludicrously busy he had no time to see helen which despite malises strictures drove her so frantic she even rang him at the yard its me darling why havent you called pretend this is a wrong number and call me back as soon as youve got a moment it was almost a relief when she and rupert flew off to los angeles giving him a breathing space in which he could concentrate on the job in hand but if he worked flat out during the day he still spent his few hours in bed worrying about the future their finances were still in a precarious position the bank manager needed the mill house and the yard and torys shares as security he was very proud of jake and his incredible comeback and often dropped his name at the golf club but jake knew this amiability would vanish overnight if he got into financial trouble now he had been picked for the olympics he was an infinitely more bankable proposition particularly as half a dozen potential sponsors were pestering him but he didnt like any of them and he knew theyd cool off if he came home without a medal anyway hed seen the appalling pressures sponsors had put on billy humpty and driffield having to take days off to open factories and turn up at parties and chat up important clients before a big class jake knew he didnt have the easy kind of charm or placid temperament to cope with such an invasion of his privacy he was terrified of no longer being his own boss it would be back to brook farm riding school and mrs wilton if the sponsors owned the horses they might take them away as colonel carter had taken revenge more than anything he wanted to get a gold and beat rupert but now just as much he wanted helen her cool slender body and the extraordinary whitehot passion he inspired in her when he was with the horses or the family he could switch off and forget about her but at night the pain of longing came back more intensely than ever but how the hell could he support two households if helen ran off with him rupert would see she was left penniless even if she got a writing job shed have to employ someone to look after the children if rupert let the children go which was unlikely and if jake walked out on tory he would lose the children fen and the mill house not to mention tory and her incredible backup hed have to find another owner and how would he divide the horses would he get macaulays front half tory the back like a pantomime horse finally helen worried him she said she was prepared to live on nothing but shed had six years with rupert with daily women to clean her beautiful house nannies for the children and gardeners to tend those exquisite flower beds not to mention champagne and flowers at every fourstar hotel she stayed at how would she cope with poverty she had compared herself with a potted plant wilting unwatered in a greenhouse while the rain fell on the sweet earth outside but equally how would a pot plant fare when faced with the winds and snows of the outside world he had tried to discuss this with helen but she was so insecure she always misconstrued this as backing off none of this had he thought through when tanked up with champagne he had posted her the blue silk handkerchief from dublin on the day before he left for los angeles as if in answer to a prayer he had a telephone call from garfield boyson who owned a huge video empire boyson was amiable intensely tough a lifetime lover of horses and rich enough not to be worried about money im driving through your village at lunchtime said his crackling voice from a car telephone how about a drink too busy said jake were leaving tomorrow youll not be too busy for this said boyson see you at the stirrup cup in half an hour sloping off to take leave of mrs cb thought fen sourly as jake disappeared without explanation village boys stopped to admire boysons gleaming rollsroyce his chauffeur nodding in the late august sunshine inside the bar a bench seat was tightly clamped round boysons vast bulk as he downed a treble whisky and clawed up potato crisps his eyes almost entirely hidden by rolls of flesh were shrewd and kindly hello lad whatd you like tomato juice im working said jake pointedly he lit a cigarette you should give up that habit said boyson las lousy for people with bad chests so ive been told worcester sauce asked the barmaid oh its you jake didnt see you come in hows it going spare said jake the barmaid looked at the wall where one of macaulays world championship rosettes was proudly hung hope we get one from los angeles to join it she said jake turned to boyson well im sure you didnt ask me here to tell me to give up smoking boyson laughed fatly i didnt sit down lad ive watched your career for some time admired your guts the way you fought back admire that sparky sisterinlaw of yours men tend to unsmiling jake looked at his watch ruperts right about you said boyson said you were as short on charm as you were on inches thanks said jake draining his glass and getting to his feet sit down said boyson waving a fat ringed hand one thing i dont want is a pr man ill not ask you to chat up customers and open shops just like to make things easier what dyou get out of it well not to pussyfoot around my name in front of your horses boyson macaulay boyson hardy doesnt sound bad no said jake wait a minute for that id pick up your bills and your traveling expenses and give you a new lorry with my name on it noticed yours was falling to pieces at crittleden id even buy you some horses and when we start losing well draw up a watertight threeyear contract all riders lose form so do horses i know all that but youve always worked with secondclass horses making them into topclass ones id like to see what you could do with a horse like rocky or clara boyson had ordered more drinks exchanging jakes tomato juice for a large whisky jake drained it without noticing youd start ordering me about expecting me to ride your way i wouldnt i might argue with you occasionally but youd be the boss i dont expect you to tell me how to run my company what sort of terms were you thinking about about seventyfive grand a year and extra of course for the box and any horses jakes brain reeled this was really the big time he thought excitedly although his face didnt flicker not much for horses might be more if youd agree to another thing what ive got a lad of fifteen nice boy but i didnt marry his mother if you know what i mean only too well i had the same problem i know thats one of the reasons i thought you and i might get on hes crazy about horses wanted to be a flat race jockey but hes grown too big you could do with a third jockey in your yard take the pressure off hes a good lad admires you no end got your picture on his wall says youre the only rider worth bothering about what if hes no good he is said boyson believe me his mother died recently he needs a family ill think about it said jake go to los angeles first i know youve had a lot of expenses the yardll be virtually out of action for a month horses may take time to get their form back so dont worry your head about how youre going to pay for it all come home with a medal and were in business and if i dont well have to think again i dont like bribery mr boyson garfield to you and i dont like failures why dont you sponsor rupert then because he hasnt kept his nose clean too many scandals cant understand it with that beautiful wife and im squeaky clean said jake getting up well at least youre discreet said boyson i havent been able to find anything on you they left england on a perfect day tory was helping fen with her packing upstairs jake was in the kitchen checking papers sarah had left from stansted airport with hardy and desdemona two days before the horses would be out of quarantine and into their olympic quarters by the time jake and fen arrived tory going down to the kitchen found wolf on the stairs swallowing miserably knowing he wasnt included nor am i darling she said stroking his rough brindle head well have to look after each other jake looked out of the window at the soft russet stables the willows round the millpond were already touched with yellow and the millstream dried to a trickle last night hed watched a rippling arrow of migrating wild geese spread out across the sky now the house martins were taking up their positions on the telegraph wire look at those birds all in a row said darklis what are they doing theyre practicing leaving said jake perhaps thats what he ought to be doing the martins would be gone by the time he came home with an aching feeling of sadness and anticipated homesickness he gazed at his tawny fields and his stables with the horses looking out of the halfdoors all knowing something was up apart from macaulay who had turned away sulking if only he could have afforded to take tory and the children if he accepted boysons sponsorship hed be able to do things like that tory wouldnt have to work herself into the ground she and the kids could have new clothes then in his pocket he felt the tansy that helen had had specially made for him in gold for luck hed given helen the handkerchief there was no way he could go back now tory came into the kitchen fens ready you ought to be off soon she said i wish youd have some lunch ive made you a quiche and some sandwiches for the journey i splurged and put smoked salmon in them he shook his head halfsmiling we get dinner at the hotel tonight they were flying at crack of dawn tomorrow he turned to darklis go and tell fen were leaving in ten minutes as soon as shed gone he drew tory close to him cradling her round tired kind unmadeup face between his hands smoothing back the lank mouse brown hair shed had no time to wash dont she mumbled into his shoulder i look so awful im going on a crash diet ill be thin when you come home he put his arms round her feeling her comforting solidity i wont expect you to ring she said in a notquitesteady voice malise has told me what lines from la are going to be like just ring if you can but well all be thinking of you for a second they clung together suddenly he wished she was his mother wise and everloving that he could always come back to even though he was committing himself to helen with an uneasy premonition he thought this might be the last time he saw her wish you were coming i wish i was too take me next time i love you he said truthfully and for the first time hed just have to sort everything out after the games as they went out into the yard he saw she was crying to distract him she said you must go and say goodbye to macaulay macaulay had his back to the door as jake approached he flattened his ears jake went into the box im sorry boy i know how you feel im as disappointed as you are well be landing in twenty minutes said the air hostess can i have eight autographs for the crew fen fled to the loo desperately tarting up in case by some miracle dino had come to meet her at the airport when she came back they were still flying across the desert and ivor was still struggling with the quick crossword in the daily mirror which hed started the moment they left heathrow jake seemed increasingly uptight perhaps he was wondering if helen would meet them suddenly there was los angeles and fens tiredness seemed to disappear as she looked down at the great turquoise expanse of ocean and the platinum blond beaches she could even see the flecking of the breakers now they were flying over a vast checkerboard of streets houses gardens and brilliant blue swimming pools and skyscrapers glittering in the midday sun and the great network of freeways superimposed like arteries the horizon was bordered by a thick muzzy brownygray smog curtain jake fingered his gold tansy trying to keep his nerves in check this is dinos country thought fen in ecstasy ive finally made it i can see robert redford and donald duck she cried leaning across ivor where where he said gazing out of the window go back to your crossword she said soothingly you might even finish it by the time we get through customs as they stepped off the plane the heat from the scorching californian sun hit them like a knockout punch well be microwaved moaned fen well never jump in this said jake to himself customs seemed to take longer than the flight waiting for them outside wearing nothing but sneakers jagged denim shorts and a baseball cap was rupert he was so brown he almost made the black ground staff look white welcome to la he said mockingly as part of malises new solidarity drive and because big mal himself is in a meeting ive come to welcome you all security is a nightmare did the horses travel all right asked jake eventually the crates didnt fit and they had to wait for hours to load and the flight took thirtythree hours then seeing jakes look of utter horror he went on but theyre all fine and out of quarantine hardys already bitten malise so he must be feeling okay can we go straight to the stables rupert looked surprised if you feel up to it fen sometimes wished jake wasnt quite so conscientious she was dying for a bath and a change in case she bumped into dino as they drove along in the car rupert had hired not a breath of wind stirred the palm trees as they flashed past is this the roosh hour asked ivor nervously this is nothing said rupert briskly passing a cadillac on the inside then nipping outside a pontiac once youve negotiated the rush hour the individual competition will seem like falling off a log how far are the stables from the olympic village asked jake well thats another slight problem said rupert about ninety minutes drive on the olympic bus shit said jake exchanging looks of horror with fen im lucky said rupert not without a certain complacency helen and i are staying with chums in arcadia so im only five minutes from the showground nice house asked fen aware that jake was beginning to look really fed up terribly quiet said rupert blithely only thing you can hear at night is the occasional splash as an overripe avocado pear falls into the swimming pool no one could fault the stables they were huge and airy with pushbutton doors airconditioning in the boxes and water playing on the roofs all day to keep the temperature at sixtyfive degrees they were also banned to the press the grooms slept in dormitories overhead sarah whod dyed her hair red white and blue was thrilled to see them the talent is fantastic she said to fen ive just been asked out by a mexican rider named jesus desdemona was even more delighted to see fen she looked so small in the huge box as she cuddled her and checked her for bumps and bruises fen trying to keep her voice steady asked has the american team arrived yet mary jo and lizzie dean arrived this morning but carol kennedy and mr ferranti sarah winked at dizzy who was looking over the halfdoor arent due until tomorrow night hi fen said dizzy evidently dinos swept all before him this year manny hasnt had a fence down in three months hes hot favorite for the individual gold so eat your heart out mr campbellblack said sarah dont be unpatriotic dear said dizzy both of them had already acquired golden suntans dizzy was wearing union jack shorts they made fen feel drabber and tireder than ever at that moment malise rolled up svelte as usual in a cream suit and a panama with an old rugbeian hatband youve made it dont hang about here too long you need some sleep when youre ready ill take you back to the olympic village and well sort out your security chains better sleep in them after tomorrow you wont be allowed anywhere without them after an hour and a halfs drive back to the olympic village in a nonairconditioned bus which just dumped them outside the male and female sectors jake could see exactly why rupert had found a house in arcadia having been issued with his security chain which contained his name a photograph nationality and the classes for which he was entered he had to fight his way through the tightest security cordon it took ages to find his room as the guards on each floor all had to check where he was going finally tracking it down he discovered he was sharing not with ivor but with two weight lifters who were fortunately out on the town apart from three beds the room included three small chests of drawers a wardrobe a shower a hot plate and a fridge he supposed they darent provide an oven in case someone put his head in it he was pouring with sweat but it wasnt just the heat looking outside he was suddenly aware of the number of security vans prowling around between the scorched yellow lawns with their sprinkling of palm trees and the helicopters and airplanes overhead all part of the largest security operation ever mounted in peacetime the tough guys on the gate with their guns and their german accents the bare institutional corridors the guards seated on every floor the smell of fear the anonymity all unnerved him and reminded him of the childrens home overwhelmed with homesickness and claustrophobia he started to unpack underneath the beautifully ironed shirts and his new red coat he found a pile of telegrams and goodluck cards he hadnt seen there was also a letter from tory darling im missing you almost before youve gone when you get this youll be in la on the way to the greatest adventure of your life please dont be scared and please eat properly dont worry remember youre still the world champion and the greatest rider in the world give a kiss to hardy the presents are from the children all my love tory one parcel contained a black china cat with a horseshoe around its neck the other a toothbrush which had a glass bubble on the end containing a tiny model of mickey mouse and a bell which rang when you cleaned your teeth one of the telegrams was from garfield boyson another from eleanor blenkinsop feeling much happier jake undressed showered and fell into his first dreamless sleep in weeks its too awful grumbled fen the next morning im sharing with griselda and an enormous lady discus thrower of very questionable sexuality who snored all night the corridors are swarming with security guards i could do with one in the room for protection except there isnt room for the three of us as it is griselda is already making eyes at a beefy cyclist in the next room and on the other side there are three event riders who keep saying must go and ring mummy she giggled nothing really mattered today except that she would see dino they were cheered up by more telegrams downstairs although jake was slightly daunted to find three long rather hysterical letters from helen saying how much she was missing him and would he make contact as soon as possible then they explored the olympic village jake was appalled by the sheer noise and size there were sports shops hairdressers cinemas and theaters saunas swimming pools even a disco and endless souvenir shops and televisions everywhere hed expected a kind of monastic retreat it was going to be about as easy to distance oneself here as in a monkey house fen was almost more appalled in the souvenir shop to see posters of dino on sale in one he had a terrific suntan looked too ludicrously glamorous for words and was wearing a pale gray shirt in another he was jumping manny wearing the us red coat with the sky blue collar in horror she watched two american girl gymnasts buy copies of both look said jake to distract her theres sebastian coe and theres daley thompson said fen in awe then they went to a meeting called by malise the plan he said was that from tomorrow the team would rise at four in the morning drive down to the stables and work the horses from six to eight then leave them to rest during the punishing midday heat then the grooms would walk them around to loosen them up for an hour or so in the cool of the evening during the day the riders time would be more or less their own except for the odd meeting or press conference beach barbecues endless parties trips to disneyland hollywood or las vegas were also on offer malise wanted them to relax enjoy themselves stick together and save the adrenaline for the competitions it was now saturday the opening ceremony was on sunday the individual competition a week on monday and the team event the sunday after that that evening malise continued the eriksons with whom rupert and helen were staying in arcadia had invited the british and the american teams to a barbecue at their house this information threw both fen and jake into a panic jake was longing to see helen but he didnt want a hassle dublin had been a nightmare worrying all the time whether rupert suspected anything he didnt want los angeles to be a repeat fen having showered about fifty times couldnt put on her makeup she was shaking so much her eyeliner kept leaving her eyelashes and shooting up the lid she totally gave up on lipstick she wore new baggy pinkstriped andy pandy overalls and a pale pink tshirt griselda who was exchanging even hotter glances with the nextdoor cyclist cried off the evening saying she was still jetlagged luckily after two more stints on the nonairconditioned bus malise had hired a car to drive the team about as the eriksons house was only five minutes from the stables they decided to check the horses on the way to the barbecue shadows of palm trees were beginning to stripe the road but it was still punishingly hot even desdemona seemed listless probably still suffering from travel sickness said malise reassuringly perhaps dino would be suffering from jet lag too thought fen and wouldnt feel like a party but next minute she saw carol kennedy going past in dark glasses so dino must at least have arrived frantically she checked her face in the depths of desdemonas box outside she met rupert who pulled out the front of her voluminous overalls peered inside and asked if she was reduced to wearing torys castoffs which did nothing to increase her selfconfidence come on he said malise is champing for the off not that hell get any dinner before midnight suzy erikson is so disorganized as they reached malises hired car fen said theres mary jo mary jo was wearing a white tshirt with carol kennedy for president printed in large blue letters across the front wait she called out to them closeup she looked redeyed and distraught my dear child said malise concerned whats the matter its dino she sobbed whats happened to him said fen in horror manny went ape on the plane they think he may have been stung by something it was dinos plane he was driving it he wanted to crashland in the desert but he was transporting carols horses as well and there was the chance he might have killed the lot of them the terrain was so rocky so he had to shoot manny christ said rupert appalled surely they could have tranked him they tried it didnt make any difference wheres dino now asked malise dropped off carols two horses and then flew mannys body back home whos he riding now asked jake looking absolutely shattered nothing sobbed mary jo thats what makes it so awful manny was our star horse right but he was really dinos only horse his fatherd been ill and he was letting the yard run down wont he come to the games at all whispered fen he told carol he couldnt face it not after all those years and years of hard work and he just adored manny i tried to call him at his place just now but his mother said he was too upset to talk to anyone surely he can ride someone elses horse said rupert hes easily your best rider mary jo allowed herself a faint smile thanks she said well almost said rupert dino wouldnt do that to anyone take their horse off them at this stage knowing how much work theyd put in seems crazy to me said rupert if i was your chef dequipe id put him on one of carols horses im awfully sorry said malise ill write to him tomorrow its heartbreaking but extremely fortuitous for us said rupert in an undertone as mary jo moved out of earshot to tell ludwig and hans that was totally uncalled for snapped malise dino was definitely in the running for the gold exactly said rupert we had better go and have some dinner i think ill go back to the village said fen in a high flat voice jet lags suddenly got to me after all it is four in the morning in england oh come on darling said rupert come and see this amazing place theyve even got jacuzzis in the dog kennel a couple of bloodies and a good steak and youll feel on top of the world honestly im jiggered said fen whod gone terribly white are you sure said jake who also seemed stunned by the news about manny ill come back with you no ill be fine back at the olympic village fen had to climb four flights of stairs because some ghanaian athletes whod never been in a lift before were spending all day riding up and down despite her talk of jet lag griselda thank god was not in the room as she slumped on the bed fen felt the games had lost any importance if she blew it next monday or the following sunday what did it matter poor dino she kept whispering oh poor poor dino in a daze she got out her writing case donald duck paper didnt seem suitable nor a postcard of an athlete running with the olympic torch she tore a page out of her diary headed december appropriately wintry some day in the future when life didnt matter anymore dearest dino she wrote i just heard about manny i cant think of anything to say except im sorry i loved him too i know what youre going through i cant think of anything to say about my behavior last winter except im sorry too about that with all my love fen walking down the four flights of stairs again she posted the letter before she had time to change her mind the eriksons lived in a beautiful ranchstyle house which had once been an avocado farm now converted into the most exquisite garden with clematis morning glory and bougainvillea growing up every tree behind reared the mountains snowcapped and often blacked out by thunderstorms or rainstorms but seldom affecting the perfect weather in the valley rupert went into the house and kissed his beautiful hostess with whom he had once been on intimate terms she was wearing a sopping wet yellow bikini and drinking a margarita helens by the pool said suzy erikson have you any idea how many are coming so i can warn annunciata well the american team arent coming said rupert nor are either of our women riders although youd hardly call griselda a woman then he told suzy about dino she was shattered oh poor dino and bang goes our chance of a gold thats tough thats real tough what is said helen from the doorway she was wearing the briefest of dark blue bikinis that she would have thought absolutely shocking eight months ago in kenya and a blue spotted silk scarf tying back her hair it was the first time rupert had ever known her tanned it brought out the amber of her eyes and the wonderful slenderness of her body whats tough she said your lovers had an accident drawled rupert what dyou mean said helen aghast what are you talking about she gripped the door handle for support her knuckles whitening fortunately rupert had turned to the drinks tray and was pouring out some perrier his prize horse threw a fit on the plane and had to be shot so im afraid hes not coming to the games tough huh is he hurt said helen trying to keep her voice steady nothing broken except his heart according to mary jo helen as though sleepwalking found one of the leather sofas flanking the fire and sat down very suddenly on it could i have a drink please her mind was galloping where was jake had he flown home already without getting in touch did horses mean that much to him her heart seemed to be crashing against her rib cage i guess manny was insured said suzy erikson examining her back view in the long mirror i wonder if i ought to get my bottom lifted only by me said rupert putting a hand under her buttocks if hes not coming said helen shakily fenll have to jump letting go of suzy rupert looked at her irritably are you that out of touch since when did fen ride for the american team im talking about dino ferranti your admirer remember what dyou want to drink oh poor poor dino said helen shaking like a leaf at the terrible gaffe shed nearly committed rupert and suzy were having drinks by the pool when jake malise and ivor arrived several other handsome goldentanned californian couples had also turned up a splendid blonde was gamboling in the bluegreen water helen was lying in a hammock still in her bikini she wanted jake to see how good she looked hi ivor she got out of the hammock and kissed him how was the flight ivor went scarlet and mumbled something about it being joost fine then helen kissed malise which gave her the perfect excuse to kiss jake too putting her face against his cheek on the side away from rupert she whispered i love you in his ear the smell of hot flesh suntan oil and femme sent his senses reeling he was astonished afresh by her amazing beauty all his doubts fled how could he ever live without her he felt as if he was walking straight through the celluloid of a hollywood soap opera and plucking out the heroine he had little time to talk to her however malise who wanted to quash a romance which he had grimly suspected was developing in dublin sat down on the hammock and proceeded to monopolize helen ivor was soon frolicking in the pool and roaring his head off playing with the blonde and a large yellow rubber duck jake was saved by his host albie an english expatriate mad about show jumping who seemed to know every horse jake had ever owned more people arrived all very beautiful jake wished californians werent so tall they made him feel like a midget rupert not drinking was working off his excess energy in a mixed four on the floodlit tennis court you are horribly unchivalrous grumbled the brunette playing against him as she leapt out of the way of one of his thunderbolt serves gentlemen are supposed to ease up when they serve to a lady jake would like to have swum but he felt far too pale and puny to take his shirt off in this company let alone display his scarred and wasted legs helen was still trapped by malise and now as well by some film director must go and check everythings okay in the kitchen said albie come and meet paul and meryl he writes screenplays she acts in them paul and meryl were polite but obviously much more interested in ensuring meryl got the biggest part and pauls screenplay was not tampered with others joined them jake felt gauche and out of place this lotusland depressed him utterly knowing he could never conjure up paradises like it for helen wandering into the drawing room he picked up the latest copy of horse and hound wondering whether to get a taxi back to the village malise didnt look like shifting for hours and there was no sign of dinner is the heat getting to you said suzy erikson curling up beside him on the leather sofa a little why dont you swim id rather watch you would wouldnt you youre the stillest man ive ever met besides he added wryly ive got a lousy physique suzy ran her eyes over him i wouldnt say that youve certainly got something an empty glass for a start let me freshen it no thanks ive got to get up at four oclock tomorrow morning to work my horse what dyou do after that our time is pretty much our own then ill come and pick you up and drive you into the mountains the entire team no just you she said softly youre making a pass at me right havent you heard how up front californian women are and i find you very attractive im married said jake your wife cant be very smart letting you come over here on your own she would have come if we could have afforded it feeling homesick huh jake shrugged a little im real good at curing that id really like to spend some time with you with a glorious feeling of irresponsibility jake looked at the depraved little face with its gleaming catlike eyes and long dark hair as coarse and shiny as macaulays mane she had changed out of her bikini and beneath the pale beige string vest the curvy body with its high full breasts was perfectly visible he suddenly thought how nice it would be to take off into the mountains with her over the hills and far away and junk all his problems that he said is one of the nicest offers ive ever had but ive actually come to la to jump fences not into bed with beautiful ladies thats my chef dequipe out there and hes very hot on abstinence suzy laughed he hasnt had much success with rupe ruperts different he doesnt suffer from nerves ive got to distance myself ive got a marvelous shrink if youve got anxiety problems he claims youve got to be filled with both anger and calm he should start with hardy my horse said jake suzy said a sharp voice annunciata wants to know whether you want to start with the gambetta it was helen oh you tell her youre so good at that sort of thing no you tell her snapped helen people are starving when suzy had left the room helen brought jake another whisky lousy hostess cant even freshen peoples drinks that womans a nympho shame said jake i thought it was my personal magnetism what did she want said helen quickly to take me to the mountains helen went white and i refused very politely jake went on because theres only one woman i want to take anywhere you look so beautiful its a shame to spoil it by sulking you were flirting with her i was putting malise and rupert off the scent and you werent doing so badly on the hammock wheres fen shattered about dino helen then told jake about mistaking dino for him you cant imagine how i overreacted it was awful i so nearly gave us away how did rupert react im not sure if anything i guess he thinks im upset because dinos not coming well let him go on thinking that all the same we must be careful he told her about the possibility of the boyson sponsorship it would go halfway to solving all our problems but i must keep my nose clean until the contracts are signed but we can meet during the day ruperts out so much he shook his head too risky everyone knows your face over here the place is swarming with press desperate for a new angle i dont want it to be us youve just got to hack it until after the games helens lip quivered i dont think ill survive youve got to he said more sharply than he intended theres too much at stake our whole future a shadow fell across them it was rupert before either of them could say anything he shouted down the hall for christs sake suzy cant we have dinner im going to pass out if you want instant guacamole go jump on an avocado in the garden said suzy wandering in waving a threepronged fork theres steak swordfish salmon smoked chicken and red snapper so you wont go hungry itll be ready in two minutes i suppose we could always barbecue jake said rupert jake got to his feet you did that once already he said in a voice that made helen shiver at st augustines if you remember and he limped out to talk to malise you were so vile about that guy before he arrived i knew id find him attractive said suzy having finally fallen asleep at am jake had to get up jangling with nerves and hangover an hour later speeding along the fast lane reserved for car pools malise not used to fierce powerbraking kept producing appalling screeches like a butchered pig every time he tried to slow down even worse sitting between jake and fen taking up almost the entire backseat griselda grimly ate her way through two huge friedegg sandwiches as jake gave hardy the gentlest of workouts in the already punishing heat he realized ruperts horse rock star was hardly sweating and while jake felt dislocated and woollyheaded from lack of sleep rupert despite his late night seemed utterly together by leaving ahead of the pack not only had he acclimatized his horses to the heat and humidity but also adjusted his time clock as well fen walked desdemona beside jake shes very down she said like her mistress thought jake noticing her swollen eyes but making no comment ivor was worried about john its like sitting on a dead log all around them other nations were crashing their wringing wet horses over massive combinations on what was plainly very hard ground later in the day malise called another meeting rupert rolled up in a pale blue tracksuit like rock star hardly sweating after a fourmile jog along the beach the great problem with the olympic games is peaking too soon said malise now youre in la you feel you must be doing something to prepare yourself and your horse you see other teams popping their horses over all sorts of different kinds of fences and think theyve got inside information but you can be sure no one will know anything until we walk the course on monday week if i were you id concentrate on work on the flat and jump your horses as little as possible let them rest relax and enjoy yourselves and have fun id rather have fen said rupert whod also noticed her red eyes as they came out of the meeting they bumped into ludwig and hans whod just been looking at the olympic swimming pool did you know it vos specially built for zee oleempics said hans so was that girl said rupert as a spectacularly blond and voluptuous romanian athlete loped past them without a backward glance bet i can bed her before the games are over how much said ludwig hundred bucks done the event that saved fen from utter despair was the opening ceremony that afternoon everyone had been cynical about the american hype beforehand particularly rupert who made helen furious with his persistently disparaging remarks but somehow the antony and cleopatra set the girls in hot pants with their silver balloons the eightyfive males bashing away at porgy and bess on their grand pianos and the president grinning like a telly puppet the whole thing worked there was a big row beforehand rupert had removed the olympic badge from his blue blazer and had had the trousers narrowed to drainpipe proportions fen had shortened her skirt griselda had put on so much weight that she kept popping buttons like tom kitten and the skirt of her dress was so stretched there werent any pleats left ivor had typically ordered trousers too small so the turnups skimmed his ankles and a blazer so big it hung like a peasants smock youre all a bloody disgrace except jake snapped malise lets hope you can lose yourselves among the rest of the british athletes after all the razzmatazz it seemed the athletes might be ignored but on they came in country by country to tumultuous cheers from the amazingly overadrenalized and happy crowd there were mexicans in big hats and africans in national costume and the french incredibly chic in couturedesigned clothes and the english very formal with the sexes sharply defined you can tell ruperts been in the army said fen watching his straightbacked march jake tried to disguise his limp as much as possible thank god were jumping out in arcadia and not in front of a crowd as big as this said fen looking at the endless pebbledash of faces huge cheers greeted china and romania and everyone stood up then on a note of crazy informality the american athletes came on to an earsplitting roar they all wore tracksuits so unlike other countries there was no division of the sexes joyous as otters they swarmed rowdy and exuberant in total disarray all carried cameras and were soon snapping away at one another and the other teams and the stadium then fighting their way through to the other side of the parade to photograph mom in the stands even when the black athlete came on carrying the olympic torch on the last lap there was doubt whether shed ever make it as the us team swayed around her clicking away like pressmen the marx brothers seem to have taken over said rupert but finally the little flame all the way from greece was lit and after the endless speeches the doves of peace fluttered into the blue in their thousands i hope youll take note hissed fen to rupert and stop bitching at jake then the beautiful girl singer stood up and started belting out reach out and touch someone and everyone was breaking formation and kissing each other and shaking hands fen found herself kissed by ludwig count guy and rupert and three times by ivor oh christ here comes griselda said rupert im off one must draw the line somewhere i told you not to wear mascara said jake as fen wiped her eyes and suddenly it got to her the olympic ideal despite the sniping the commercialism the chauvinism and the heartbreak here she was in los angeles carrying her own torch for britain in front of this wonderful friendly deeply moved appreciative crowd for a few minutes her misery over dino and over jake and helen was put aside as she suddenly realized the magnitude of her achievement that at nineteen shed been picked to ride for britain for without all the competitors there would be no competition and if there werent people prepared to lose bravely and with a good grace there wouldnt be any winners true greatness was the ability to pick yourself up from the floor isnt this your best moment ever she whispered to jake he nodded too moved to speak itll be even better when we go home with the team gold and the gold bronze and silver in the individual said rupert oh look theres my romanian and shoving through the crowd he grabbed her for a second she gazed at him with her slanteyed impassive slav face then the crowd shoved them together and he was kissing her first base said jake wondering if helen was looking ludwigs going to lose that bet said fen cant you hear the clang of iron curtains dropping after the ceremonies they met helen whod been watching with the eriksons wasnt it wonderful said fen you must feel jolly proud to be american tolerant suddenly because dino not coming to the games had made her even more aware of the agonies of being in love she moved aside to introduce herself to the eriksons and apologize for not being able to make it to the party leaving helen and jake a moment alone together i was watching you the whole time whispered helen her eyes glowing conscious of you every single moment so proud that you finally made it here after all those setbacks knowing youd be thinking of me jake felt once again the great weight of her love they had eight days to kill before the individual event it was a bit like being on holiday knowing war was going to break out any minute griselda sweated and became more and more badtempered fen wilted ivor fell asleep on the beach and woke up scarlet down one side of his face jake being darkskinned fared better for the first time in his life he was really brown suzy erikson was constantly phoning him rupert went skiing racing surfing pursued miss romania and played endless games of poker with ludwig count guy carol kennedy and wishbone to the despair of their chefs dequipes who felt that nations should stick together at each game honoring dinos absence they left an empty chair but he didnt show up fen kept hearing little bits of news of him there was a huge piece headlined the agony of dino ferranti in the los angeles times the day after manny was shot carol kennedy had also spoken briefly to him on the telephone i guess hes still in shock he said i offered him whittier to ride but hes simply not interested countless times a day fen looked in her pigeonhole at the olympic village hoping that among the telegrams and cards from wellwishers there might be a letter from him jake had frightful trouble sleeping in the olympic village the weight lifters were so fed up with his chainsmoking that they made him go outside and smoke in the passage often he didnt bother to go to bed at all just staying up to watch television once ivor discovered you could watch cartoons all night malise had great difficulty getting him to bed as well malise organized a team trip to disneyland and fen had to hold ivors hand when he got scared in the haunted house and during the pirates battle and calm him down when he became overexcited after shaking hands with mickey mouse in amazement fen gazed at the massive overweight americans stuffing themselves with hamburgers hot dogs and ice cream and exhorting her through capacious mouthfuls to have a nice day have you ever seen people so fat she whispered to jake dyou think griseldas got any los angeles blood no said rupert overhearing griseldas far too unpleasant they remind me more of your wife jake just for a second fen thought jake was going to spring at rupert dont rise she pleaded putting a hand on jakes arm hes only trying to wind you up everywhere they went they were mobbed by autograph hunters mostly americans who had no idea who they were but who were currently obsessed by anything olympic rupert because of his dazzling looks his beautiful american wife and his earlier successes on the american circuit was the one whom they recognized but not always i know you screamed a crone with a blue rinse as they were leaving disneyland youre in television no im in shorts snapped rupert rupert kept up his jogging every morning and was soon joined by miss romania progress was obviously being made after a week he produced a pair of pale blue panties for ludwig that tag inside says made in romania how do ve know grumbled ludwig i dont speak romanian it might say somezing quite different like made in los angeles its miss romania whos being made in los angeles said rupert vot is her english like asked hans nonexistent thank god said rupert but she thinks our vicked capitalist vays are absolutely marvelous the eight days dragged by gradually hardy and desdemona seemed to be coming together as fen and jake waited on tenterhooks to see which three british riders of the five would be selected to jump in the individual as americans went on winning medals by the bucketful in every contest and the starspangled banner was played over and over again the commentators reached new levels of chauvinistic hysteria they seemed hardly to recognize that other countries existed so there was a hardening of purpose among the british team on friday to break the monotony they had a mock competition two rounds then a jumpoff carol kennedy riding his dark brown mare scarlett ohara beat everyone by five seconds in the jumpoff either hes a lunatic risk taker or that mare is phenomenally fit said rupert if its the latter were in trouble hardy overfresh and full of himself from his long rest knocked a fence down in the first round but jake was very pleased with him rocky jumped superbly apart from one silly mistake in the jumpoff he didnt put a hoof wrong desdemona also on tremendous form came fourth sailing over the fences with all her old bounce somewhat reviving fens spirits all right said malise thats the team for the individual rupert jake and fen fen didnt dare look at griselda arriving at the stables on the saturday however fen found sarah with a long face desdemona couldnt put her near hind down she must have bruised it fen sarah and jake stayed up all night poulticing her foot and trying to reduce the swelling walking her out to test the stiffness under the huge los angeles stars by morning fen thought she was all right the british vet and the american national vet thought otherwise and went into a huddle with malise fen felt her presence was purely incidental shes stiff behind and theres swelling i think she may have chipped a bone said the national vet she needs at least a weeks rest said the british vet a week said fen aghast that rules out the team event too i guess so said the american ill have another look on friday in case youve wrought miracles but im afraid tomorrow is definitely out for fen whod been up all night it was too much fucking bureaucrats she screamed you dont know a bloody horse from your elbows give her a shot of bute shell be fine shes often stiff in the morning the american vet nettled accused fen of treating her horse like a machine jake and sarah took fens part and a very undignified yelling match ensued listened to with glee by all the surrounding grooms and riders who were frantically translating for one another finally malise removed fen by the scruff of the neck and took her off for a cup of coffee in a quiet corner of the british supporters club you must pull yourself together he told her theres nothing left of myself to pull wailed fen desdemonas okay shes my horse i ought to know when you see the course tomorrow said malise gently youll understand you might get by in a nations cup or in a grand prix but desdemonas forte is speed not jumping huge daunting fences which shed really have to stretch herself to get over i know you love that pony but i cant let you ride if youre going to be nervous about pushing her every inch of the way everyone goes on and on about winning not being important and the taking part is all that matters im not even allowed to take part youve got years ahead but i may never get a horse as good as des if you dont ruin her tomorrow youll probably have a chance of another two cracks at the olympics on her how would you live with yourself if you jumped her and lost her for good like poor dino at the mention of his name fen put her head down on the table and sobbed her heart out ive tried truly i have ive tried to be cheerful ive taken ivor to disneyland three times but i did hope to see dino we were a bit close once malise patted her shoulder i know how you were looking forward to seeing him and now this its wretched can i fly home malise shook his head thats not part of the deal youre still reserve if anything happens to any of the others youll have to jump their horses ill need your help tomorrow to see how the course is riding to cheer us all up griselda isnt any good at that shell still be sulking because i havent picked her you must be joking said fen ive been as cheerful as a corpse the last few months and i need you to look after jake keep him calm dyou think hes missing tory malise raised an eyebrow fen had the feeling he was fishing yes she said im sure he is the same afternoon rupert went racing with ludwig and guy jake broke his vow and submitting to helens pleading drove her into the mountains looking for wildflowers he was reminded of the picnic he had had with tory and the children the day before the world championship then he had found the lucky clump of tansy now helens gold tansy in the breast pocket of his shirt was warding off evil helen found jake boringly worried about fen shes very young shell have other opportunities you dont think that when youre young said jake and shes had such a sod of a two years losing billy then being sent to coventry then losing dino and his not turning up at the games and now this shes very brave makes very little fuss i need you far more than she does helen wanted to shout she was fed up with the entire lovell family she was jealous of fen and she was fed up with suzy going on about how attractive jake was and assuming that he must be madly in love with tory not to submit to suzys charms not having been alone with jake for days she wanted to pour out her troubles now she was faced with his total detachment he seemed to have cocooned himself against the outside world he wasnt interested in the news or plays or the concerts she had been to at the hollywood bowl or even how appallingly rupert was behaving she failed to appreciate that the sensitivity with which he had listened to her and taken her to bed during the summer had a flip side of terrible nerves and vulnerability to outside pressures before a big class finally when tired of walking they collapsed onto the grass he lay with his head on her belly not speaking just gazing up at the snowy peaks against the stormy dark sky luxuriating in the cool air until he fell asleep unable to bear wasting precious time when they could be making love helen woke him up jake dyou really love me of course i do youre not showing it much at the moment jake sat up on his elbow his eyes deeply shadowed in his tanned face cant you understand that the emotional cauldron of the olympics either makes or breaks you i cant afford distractions he took her hand and placed it on his breast pocket so she could feel the gold tansy but i keep you next to my heart the whole time i hoped id inspire you she wailed you do said jake then remembering dublin but you also distract me i dont want to spend tomorrow when i should be concentrating on winning worrying that im going to slip up or betray myself in front of rupert dont you even want me there of course i do just dont expect me to wave and smile during the day people say im rude and illtempered i just want to go inside myself before a class if i have to worry whether youre happy itll be one more pressure seeing her uncomprehending face he said theres so much at stake our whole future i get so lonely at big classes said helen petulantly im almost glad mothers coming tomorrow she pulled jake towards her please kiss me i want you so badly but kissing was all he would do which left her feeling profoundly uneasy when rupert had been mad about her in the early days hed always made love to her before and after and frequently in the caravan in the middle of classes on his way back from the races that evening rupert dropped into the olympic village to collect his post and found a letter postmarked perthshire evercautious amanda had not used headed writing paper but she apologized for being utterly bloody about the looking glass and admitted that she was missing him very much that theyd all be staying up to watch him tomorrow and to wish him good luck shed be back in london in september equally cautious rupert tore her letter up and was about to throw it in the litter bin when he pieced it together again to see if it were really true he felt absurdly pleased and wondered why the hell hed been playing around with miss romania he had better go back to arcadia and get some sleep they were walking the course at seventhirty malise gordon was not a religious man but he prayed before the individual that night he must try and be a good loser and not make any of the three riders feel too awful if they made a cockup and try and keep them calm without transmitting any of his fears and worries ivor had a good horse and didnt usually suffer from nerves but he lacked fire in his belly jake was desperately short of sleep and likely to crack rupert was far too confident and rocky much too fresh on the right day they were invincible but malise felt apprehensive he felt ridiculously touched that fen had sent him a goodluck card with a black cat on it to the best chef dequipe in the world she had written inside well live to fight another day love fen jake slept fitfully wracked by halfdreams it was the opening ceremony and the singer turned into helen sobbing into a microphone that jake didnt love her then he was in the ring with girths breaking and bridles coming off finally he dreamed that hardy had a heart attack in the ring lying there in the blazing sun gathering flies he suddenly turned into sailor jake woke up screaming crying his eyes out the next minute one of the weight lifters was sitting on his bed patting his shoulder with a huge hand the other was lighting him a cigarette having notched up a silver and a bronze the day before they could afford to be magnanimous as it was halfpast three they said there was no point in jake going back to sleep for an hour so they might as well have a cup of tea and all chat to take his mind off things jake would rather have been left alone but he was touched by their concern the weight lifters were dozing off as with a feeling of unreality jake put on the new socks the white breeches the shirt and tied his tie with trembling fingers he was all in white like a bride until he pulled on the gleaming browntopped boots and shrugged his way into the new red coat with the black velvet collar and the union jack on the pocket the day had actually come as it came to boys going back to prep school or to men in the condemned cell good luck mumbled the weight lifters sleepily well watch you on the box sock it to em good luck said the wrestlers when jake collected ivor for christs sake look after him good luck said the dour security guard at the end of the passage smiling for the first time since they arrived have a good day it was a good thing they started early for as the sun rose pale saffron gilding the santa monica mountains cars were already jamming the freeways and a continuous stream of enthusiasts from every nation but mostly america clutching a selection of hats thermos flasks coolers beer cans sandwiches transistors and even portable televisions to sustain them during the long day poured into the showground ticket scalpers were everywhere and to get to the stables the team had to fight their way through autograph hunters and people peddling cocacola chewing gum hamburgers hot dogs and souvenirs if someone else offers me a poster of dino i shall scream said fen by seven oclock the stands were packed under a hazy dovegray sky which indicated colossal heat to come many of the crowd didnt know one end of a horse from another but bitten by olympic fever they wanted to see america notch up yet another gold at seventhirty the riders and their chefs dequipes walked the course surging out over the rich brown tan no one else not even the press was allowed into the arena royalty however brooked no such restrictions morning dudley prince philip called to dudley diplock who was hovering at the entrance walked the course yet no sir well come on come on said the prince striding straight through the cordon of security guards dudley hopping after him look at that crowd said ivor in a hollow voice look at that course said jake as he gazed at the fences whose massive size wasnt remotely softened by a riot of trees and flowers positively awesome breathed carol kennedy as he looked at the combination there were two unusual fences one built with light and dark brown bricks in the shape of a hot dog and another designed like a boat with sails at either end instead of wings with the horses jumping over the bows holy mother thats a turrible thing said wishbone looking at the hot dog even rupert was curiously silent as they measured and remeasured the distances youve all jumped higher than this said malise as they gazed at the massive oxer but not every fence said ivor fen suddenly felt overwhelmed with shame that she should have wanted desdemona to jump this course it was simply too big and she couldnt see any way hardy could get around she felt horribly frightened for jake she wanted to be with him to bolster his confidence but malise told her to stick to the riders stand and watch her eyes out for the first dozen or so rounds and pass back any advice jake icy cold with chattering teeth despite the heat kept to himself and talked to no one he had a very late draw which was bound to tell on his nerves suddenly he longed for tory and her quiet sympathy and understanding she who didnt mind if he bit her head off just as he was going through the security check into the stables he heard a cry and helen bore down on him she looked ravishing in a white grecian tunic and a big white hat with the blue spotted scarf round the brim a few yards behind her was a large handsome middleaged woman with a bulldog jaw darling helen cried ive been looking for you everywhere i just wanted to wish you luck and have you meet mother jake looked at her incredulously what meet mother ive told her so much about you dont be so fucking stupid snapped jake i cant meet anyone at the moment and turned on his heel helen was stunned hes a bit uptight she told her mother you can meet him later everyone crowded into the riders stand to watch the first round a hush fell over the arena a ripple ran through the crowd as the first competitor came in it was hans schmidt his hat at its usual crooked angle the jauntiness belied by the determination on his face papa haydn the dark bay hanoverian totally under control a groan went up from the german team as he sent the second fence a double of uprights never a german forte flying then proceeded to hit the third fence and the fourth and not getting up speed had two toes in the water unnerved by such an uncharacteristically bad round papa haydn demolished the sail boat and then the hot dog took a pole out of the massive triple which was sited away from the collecting ring and hit the first element of the combination for a final thirtysix faults and he is ranked number five in the world said wishbone in a trembling voice first competitor nerves said rupert the strain of waiting for the course to be rebuilt told on count guy who came next and who came to grief at the third fence managed to clear the water but was going so fast he couldnt pull up he proceeded to kick out the sailboat the hot dog the massive oxer and the two last elements in the combination he was followed by a japanese rider who came in with a kamikaze attitude of finishing the course at all costs and came out to loud cheers with an amazing total of fiftyfive faults one of the young irish riders coaxed his ugly brown mare round on twentyfour to produce the best round yet dinos replacement lizzie dean couldnt carry the weight of expectation piled on her and notched up twenty faults it obviously walked better than it rode muttered ivor who was as green as one of suzy eriksons avocados the heat blazed down getting more and more murderous as spaniards swiss italians canadians followed one another if they werent unhinged by the course they were distracted by the crowd who every time anyone cleared a fence uttered yoohoos and tarzan howls and yells of keep it up keep it up ludwig came in and roused a certain interest when it was announced he had won the gold at the last olympics and had been second in the world championship clara looked a picture of health as she trotted into the ring long ears shining taking in the huge crowd it was soon obvious that she was on form as she delicately picked her way around the course clearing the sheet of blue water by a foot but managing to slow up and become the first horse to clear the sailboat the yells and cheers that greeted this achievement however completely unsettled her she rattled the hot dog badly crashed into the oxer and kicked out the vast triple finishing up with eight faults all the other riders clapped sympathetically as ludwig rode out ruefully shaking his head all the same thought fen its the best round yet clear rounds were obviously going to be impossible to come by she tried to remember exactly how ludwig had tackled the sailboat so she could tell jake as she watched the mexican named jesus come hopelessly to grief she felt sicker and sicker with nerves for him even worse as ivor went back to the stables to warm up john someone moved up beside her and she found herself sitting next to helen and mrs macaulay this is jakes sisterinlaw fenella said helen this is mother fen and mrs macaulay nodded at each other without warmth fen wondered if helen had told her mother all about jake helen looked at fens uncommunicative profile jake seems very uptight she said i tried to have him meet mother the only person he wants to meet at the moment is his maker he does suffer terribly from anxiety said helen hes missing tory said fen he tried to ring her this morning but all the lines were engaged i thought it was very much a marriage of convenience said helen stiffly christ no said fen hes mad about her look how berserk he got at disneyland when rupert made that crack about her being too fat and he doesnt play around helen couldnt resist asking oh no more than the average show jumper lied fen airily you know what theyre like too many opportunities to expect total fidelity but he always goes back to tory seeing helens twitching anguished face fen decided shed gone too far ill go to hell for being such a bitch she thought but since dino hasnt turned up and im out of the olympics im in hell anyway so what does it matter oh look here comes mary jo said mrs macaulay im sorry helen but thats my girl i refuse to root for great britain for five minutes the huge crowd whod been getting up and down all morning halted their pilgrimage for food and drink cheered on by their fervor and hysterical enthusiasm and her own passionate desire to win mary jo and balthazar went round for four faults only hitting the hot dog and going into the lead red as her red coat grinning from ear to ear throwing her hat in the air and catching it like a drum majorette she galloped out of the ring the crowd rising to applaud her unable to face mrs macaulays smugness fen asked helen to keep her place and went downstairs to encourage ivor who was jumping in a couple of rounds god it was hot as though youd gone to sleep and forgotten to switch off the electric blanket the officials in their coral blazers and white panama hats sweated the colored flags wilted against the snowtopped mountains she reached ivor as a poor little swiss girl rode past crying her eyes out four years of hope shattered by three refusals at the first fence ivor didnt fare much better stricken with stage fright he rode like a novice nor was he helped by the announcement that here was ivor braine from great britain on the john the crowd thinking it hysterically funny that someone should call a horse by their name for the lavatory went into guffaws of laughter and catcalls offended and thoroughly unsettled john ground to three stops at the hot dog oh no john no john no said rupert and went off to crash rocky round the practice ring as usual getting dizzy to arrange the jumps on exactly the wrong stride so rocky hit every one and hurt himself teach him to be careful said rupert a mighty roar from the arena indicated that carol kennedy had gone in and was about to jump now thats an attractive man said mrs macaulay theres something about american men hes gay mother snapped helen despite being used to the frantic enthusiasm of american crowds even scarlett ohara was unnerved by the noise she hit the hot dog then looked as though she was going clear but as she sailed over the last element of the combination the crowd let out such a shout of jubilation that the mare assumed she had finished it took all carols skill to get her straight for the huge double and she toppled the last pole still he was second on eight faults with ludwig isnt he a prince said the girl behind helen as rupert waited to go in i saw him on tv last night you have to hand it to the british they do have class quality in every line rocky was easily the handsomest horse in the contest under the gleaming amber coat his muscles rippled like serpents and as he danced into the arena long ears cocked to the unfamiliar sights and sounds the blend of explosive power with natural grace was unforgettable for christs sake take it steadily warned malise rocky was the best horse in the contest but he had never seen a crowd this big nor heard so much noise nor seen so many undulating rows of peaked caps like a wriggling aviary his forelegs were sore where rupert had crashed him over the jumps his tail switched angrily he was horribly hot fed up and upset as rupert circled him twice to steady him he humped his back and fought for his head that horse is overfresh and insufficiently ridden in thought fen two minutes later rupert rode out of the ring with an incredible twentyeight faults everyone in the riders stand and the commentary box was stunned talk about the rocky horror show said fen under her breath then horrified by her own lack of patriotism she shot a sidelong glance at helen and mrs macaulay and was shattered to see neither of them was looking remotely upset must go and find jake she said getting to her feet wish him good luck said helen dont forget to tell him she called after fen wishbone was just about to go into the ring nearly forty hed had a grueling career and everyone was taking bets on whether the drink or anno domini would get to him first today despite three large whiskys the heat didnt seem to affect him or his big bay gelding christy mahon they too got eight faults well done shouted fen as he came out of the ring bloody good round she found ivor his face tearstained in the deepest of glooms wheres jake she asked in the gents throwing up hes got to jump in twenty minutes for gods sake go and get him jake crouched over the lavatory gazing miserably at the white bowl having had no breakfast and virtually no supper he was throwing up only bile now he felt dreadful shaking from head to foot oh god he wished tory was here someone was rattling the door it was ivor you okay jake jake groaned fen thought this might help ivor passed a brandy under the door take it easy said malises voice in a few hours thisll be all over how soon have i got to jump about four to go any clears no rupe knocked up a cricket score said malise bleakly so it all depends on me thought jake he drained the brandy amazingly it seemed to calm his nerves and take the edge off his fears outside he found fen now listen theyve all come unstuck at the hot dog i think you ought to come off the corner earlier giving hardy a bit more time to size it up and take it in five strides he seems to have got out of bed on the right side hes only given me one nip today said sarah hardy was not a handsome horse but his chubby dappled quarters and shoulders shone like polished pewter his tail was whiter than the snow on the mountains and his plaits threaded with red cotton were the neatest in the contest for a second jake smiled at sarah as she plugged both the horses ears with cotton wool youve done a good job on him he said he looks great good luck said fen i dont need to tell you this said malise but all our hopes rest on you now giving hardy a clap on the rump jake went off into the tunnel fen just managed to make her seat beside helen as jake rode into the ring this is jake whom i was telling you about helen said to her mother he nearly quit because he had such a frightful smash last year the crowd was tired they had already sat through nearly three hours of jumping they had seen all the americans go and were already drifting away for their lunch its actually happening thought jake as he cantered towards the first huge fence feeling hardys irritation at having his natural ebullience curbed he let him have his head hardy bounded over he cleared the next and the next and with a whisk of his hind legs flicked over the water with inches to spare hes in top form thought jake joyfully the sailboat caused him no problems following fens advice he then took a very sharp turn off the corner and taking five strides rather than everyones four gathered sufficient momentum and bounded over the hot dog with ease he was the first horse to clear this fence which caused such screams of delight excitement and hysteria from the crowd that they pierced straight through the cotton wool in hardys ears temporarily unhinging him breaking into a gallop he crashed through the huge oxer and sent every brick of the wall flying shit said helen helen macaulay said her mother appalled ive been campbellblack for six years mother mores the pity fen decided she rather liked mrs macaulay jake meanwhile had pulled hardy almost to a standstill stroking him and balancing him the same way he had calmed macaulay in the world championship silly buggers going to get time faults said rupert he knows what hes doing snapped malise jake kicked hardy into a canter and proceeded to bounce over the rest of the course riding out to deafening applause well done marvelous said malise looking considerably more cheerful than he had ten minutes before youve saved the day youre on eleven only three rounds followed two of them hopeless but the british hopes were slightly dashed when a nigerian on a huge black gelding went round at a gallop a broad grin on his face despite shooting out of the saddle at every fence and reducing the crowd to fits of laughter he managed to clear everything except the water and the hot dog malise got out his score sheet thats mary jo on four carol ludwig wishbone and the nigerian on eight and you on eleven jake he said then there was a grueling threehour interval before the second round twenty riders went through ivor was out rupert had just scraped in jake was fifth there would be fewer jumps but they would be harder lets go and have some lunch said malise im going to stay behind and sort out rocky said rupert grimly must try and keep wishbone out of the whisky tint said paddy his groom ivor couldnt speak for despair rupert was overconfident you were underconfident it happens to the best people malise told him on the way to lunch jake suddenly swayed overcome by heat lack of sleep and food and a large brandy you wont be jumping for at least three hours said malise firmly go and have a sleep on sarahs bed dont be bloody silly said jake mopping his dripping forehead i couldnt possibly sleep well lie down then within seconds of stretching out on the tiny bed in the attic room over the stables jake was asleep the second round was much tougher the temperature was up in the nineties turning the olympic stadium into a furnace the horses having been warmed up and jumped and put back in the stables thought that work was over for the day and couldnt understand why they were being pulled out again most of them were already tired even the vast crowd seemed depleted as spectators escaping from the punishing heat watched the competition on the closedcircuit televisions scattered round the halls biting her nails fen watched rider after rider fighting their way through a forest of obstacles ludwig had worked clara too hard in the interval and the great mare knocked up a cricket score jake having been woken up was warming up hardy as mary jo entered the ring from the arena he could see the stands heaving as the spectators stampeded to get back to their seats and cheer on their heroine mary jo was on four faults jake listened to the roars of applause growing to a crescendo which must have been heard all the way to new york then there was a silence and a terrible groan four faults that meant she was on eight then the cheers started again rising and rising once more he must concentrate on hardy then suddenly there was a deafening bellow which sent hardy into a frenzy despite the cotton wool in his ears looking up at the stadium jake could see hats being thrown in the air rising up above the back of the stand like popped corn unless carol or wishbone or the nigerian went clear mary jo had got her gold there was no way jake could catch her the cheering went on and on until finally mary jo came out of the tunnel wiping away the tears then disappearing into a shrieking crowd of wellwishers carol kennedy on eight went next and again was unlucky he was jumping cleanly and steadily when the shadow of a helicopter above fell across the first element of the double making it difficult to judge the distance the gallant scarlett ohara knocked down both elements but otherwise went clear the crowd were in ecstasy stamping their feet crying yoohoohoo carol was now on sixteen faults with an excellent chance of the silver in rode rupert it was only a miracle that he could even get the bronze he was still in a whitehot rage determined to go clear and show everyone how the course should be jumped obviously terrified out of his wits eyes rolling frothing blood at the mouth rocky went clear until he came to the triple going away from the collecting ring when he began to slow down rupert lifted his whip rocky took off too soon and sent triple horse and rider flying rupert hung on to the reins and appeared unhurt but it was several seconds before he could mount the panicstricken rocky who thoroughly unsettled proceeded to notch up a further eight faults bad luck said wishbone who was waiting to go in but rupert ignored him riding straight past him with a pale dangerous face wishbone had had enough whisky in the interval to give him courage but rather too many for perfect judgment he knew it was his last chance at a medal the irish didnt have enough riders here to make up a team but he loved his old horse and would dearly have loved to go home with a medal so he crossed himself and prayed fervently to the virgin mary as he rode into the ring the virgin mary was listening gently she guided horse and rider around the ring wishbone jumped like a man inspired with only one fence down putting him into second place the crowd erupted wishbone had entertained them with his antics for many years now he was a very popular rider they cheered and cheered ireland had got the silver but america had the gold and bronze they seem to have completely forgotten that theres still jake and that nigerian to jump said fen furiously are you all right she said to jake it must be much worse when theres so much at stake he nodded not trusting himself to speak if he got four faults he got the bronze if he went clear the silver that was the message bleakly spelled out with the crowd making such a din there was no way he could get hardy to concentrate take his cotton wool out he said to sarah are you sure she said horrified hell freak out malise came up and gave hardy a last pat theyre obviously not going to shut up he said id go in just trust to your instincts if i get a medal thought jake as he waited watching the mouthing ecstatic faces ill get a year from boyson he thought of tory and the children watching at home he thought of helen whom hed been so foul to earlier go in please said the ring steward in his coral blazer from then on jake thought about nothing but hardy riding slowly to the center of the arena he turned to the presidents box where the president who loved horses sat with prince philip and princess anne and he removed his hat to the judges showing the sudden pallor on his suntanned face then he spoke to hardy and hardy put one foot forward and bowed low to the prince and the princess and the president and the crowd burst into ecstatic charmed applause theyd got their gold they could afford to be generous there was no way this gypsy and his tricks could beat their mary jo isnt that darling said helen to mrs macaulay jake looked up at the cool snowtipped mountains beyond the stadium and the great blocks of faces watching him and calmly he replaced his hat and waited for the crowd to settle gradually the cheering decreased to a sizzle of excitement like fat in a chip pan jake touched the union jack on his saddle cloth then the tansy in his breast pocket hardy stood as still as a rock for once he had heard the crowd in all its noise and glory and it hadnt harmed him stupid exhibitionist said rupert to ludwig pity not to have any clears said dudley diplock finally when there was no sound at all except the clicking of cameras and the insect hum of a strong crowd trying to be quiet jake kicked hardy into a canter neither of them looked a bit tired it was almost as though they were jumping an exhibition round as they cleared the first two fences then the third then bounded joyously over the water the crowd realized hardy was enjoying himself and started to cheer and stamp and clap him on they really like me hardy seemed to be saying as he picked his feet up and really bucketed over the hot dog with a jaunty whisk of his tail this is the fence i hated last time he seemed to say slowing up at the oxer you like it this time listen to the applause said jake as hardy flew over like a swallow hes a bit slow said fen sitting beside malise on the edge of the riders stand yes said malise but what a round sheer poetry come on jake as if jake heard them he stepped up hardys pace and came storming over the combination now it was the last double i cant look said fen she waited head in her hands for the sickening thud of poles she heard a gasp a long pause an ecstatic scream from helen on her right and then a mighty roar of applause hes done it the only clear shouted malise throwing his panama in the air it fell and was trampled underfoot before he could even be bothered to retrieve it the crowd held their breath as everyone calculated jake glanced at the clock he was just within the time even if the nigerian went clear hed got the bronze dropping hardys rein on his neck he raised both hands to heaven in a double salute and rode out through the cheering channel of spectators grinning from ear to ear fucking marvelous screamed fen tears pouring down her cheeks as she hugged malise his wet face glistening too in the bright sun this is the most amazing turnup for the books dudley diplock was gibbering from the commentary box no one ever thought gyppo jake would make it back to the big time this is little short of a miracle lets go and congratulate him said malise and fen simultaneously but helen was too quick for either of them jumping over the row in front she rushed out and down the steps and red hair flying she rushed to meet jake oh darling darling darling she said seizing his hand jake looked down at her color in his face now dazzlingly happy handsome as never before all efforts at impassivity gone we did it he said incredulously we really did it and in the euphoria of winning he bent down and kissed her and she kissed him back clinging on to him in the riders stand trapped by the crowd fens eyes met those of mrs macaulay your brotherinlaw said mrs macaulay accusingly yes said fen equally accusingly my sisters husband from the right she saw rupert white with rage descending on jake and helen fortunately at that moment sarah in floods of joyful tears and the rest of the british grooms swarmed round jake and hardy instantly they were joined by wishbone and the american and german teams who were all patting him on the back and showering him with congratulations count guy arrived with a magnum of krug from then on everything was a daze jake was terribly glad to see malise looking so happy and fen jumping up and down and he was both pleased and sorry when he heard the poor nigerian the last to jump had been unable to cope with the strain and had knocked up twenty faults which meant jake had the silver and wishbone the bronze everywhere he turned there were photographers and people reaching forward to pat hardy i cant think why he isnt biting everyone crowed sarah now hes a medalist hes obviously turned over a new leaf the jumps were cleared and the huge clydesdales dragged on the winners podium together mary jo jake and wishbone rode into the ring followed by their three grooms sarah got a special cheer for her beauty and her red white and blue hair then the grooms took the horses as the riders mounted the podium jake found it difficult not to laugh as the girls carrying the boxes of rosettes like flagsellers came out with their ludicrously stiff wideapart legged walk he bowed his head as the presidents wife hung the silver medal round his neck touching it immediately checking it was real he thought his heart would burst with the wonder of the whole thing mary jo was crying unashamedly as the three flags climbed up the flagpole and the band played the starspangled banner wishbone had no handkerchief and had to blow his redveined nose on his shirttail well done said prince philip shaking them all by the hand but particularly jake only clear round he added you must feel very proud thank you sir jake was so dazed with emotion he was glad to get back to hardy who was so festooned with longtailed rosettes he could hardly see through them he wanted to stay with him afterwards but he was swept off to a press conference by the time the reporters had finished with mary jo jake had consumed at least a bottle and a half of champagne pity you didnt get a gold jake said the los angeles times frankly im bloody glad to have the silver being a gypsy traditionally i cross peoples palms with it its the right medal for me everyone laughed all the same he went on looking at the forest of cameras and notebooks and tape recorders its a pity dino ferranti had to pull out or mary jo and i might easily have been a rung lower do you think theres any reason you did so well asked the daily telegraph i had a good backup team said jake and proceeded to thank everyone from the family to malise to the nurses and doctors at the motcliffe what are your plans for the future asked the new york times im going to ring my wife and then go and get plastered dudley fought his way through the huge crowd of fans waiting outside congratulations jake brilliant brilliant performance weve kept a line open for you in the commentary box wed like to televise you breaking the news to tory if we may you may not said jake one doesnt often ring up ones wife to say ones got a silver some things should be done in private going into the commentary box he slammed the door can i put a persontoperson call through to mrs lovell he said picking up the telephone certainly mr lovell said the switchboard girl congratulations he got through incredibly quickly oh jakey oh jakey tory was laughing and crying so much he could hardly hear her its so wonderful you both were so wonderful the whole village have been here watching it theyve drunk us out of house and home and now theyre having the most terrific party were all so proud of you hardy was your baby said jake you sorted him out for me he jumped so brilliantly and when he bowed and the only clear too speak to the children how much did you win asked isa can you take me to disneyland said darklis jake asked if he could speak to tory again i miss you he said dyou want to fly out for the team event oh id love to can we afford it i think so now said jake boyson just rang by the way said tory he said youd kept your side of the bargain hed be keeping his oh listen listen can you hear she said in a choked voice theyre ringing the church bells oh jakey its two oclock in the morning no ones asleep theyre cheering and dancing in the street and the pubs open and theyre ringing the bells in your honor listen down the wires jake could hear the faint peal he was so moved he couldnt talk anymore ill ring tomorrow he said i love you i love you said tory everything all right said fen as he came out of the box wiping his eyes he nodded absolutely marvelous theyre ringing the church bells perhaps itll be all right after all thought fen they gave him a ride in a police car sirens blaring to get him back to the olympic village im sorry said jake at the gates feeling dazedly for his security chain i seem to have mislaid it all right mr lovell we know who you are said the security guard congratulations the other british athletes were euphoric well done said sebastian coe and daley thompson hammering him on the back the weight lifters hoisted him shoulder high and carried him around the village everyone bought him drinks jake looked in the mirror in the little room as he changed to go out to dinner he found his security chain where hed left it around his neck under his shirt you are a superstar he said jabbing his finger at his reflection pleased that the two pointing fingers met every time proving he wasnt drunk he wished he could go out quietly and celebrate with sarah and fen he didnt want the strain of behaving well he wished tory was here to share in the triumph but he had never before known such personal happiness determined not to betray his devastating disappointment rupert was in no mood for a victory celebration he had wanted to leave show jumping in a blaze of glory moving smoothly from the gold medalists podium into politics and possibly amandas arms now the months of training and abstinence had gone for nothing and although rocky had jumped like a pig with chilblains and rupert had beaten the hell out of him afterwards a small voice inside told him it was not rockys fault when he had got back from las vegas with the tornup pieces of amandas letter in his pocket he shouldnt have stayed up half the night talking to people at suzys dinner party he was thirtyone not eighteen anymore finally letting himself into the bedroom at two in the morning and finding helen breathing specially deeply pretending to be asleep rupert king of the catnappers had been unable to sleep himself lying awake and thinking about amanda now he was expected to go out and celebrate that little jerks freak silver malise had rocketed him after the competition these things happen with horses and the less said about your cockup today the better now weve got to go all out for the team gold youve got six days to get rocky together and i want you on parade at halfpast nine tonight what for to celebrate jakes silver ive got a previous engagement said rupert coldly im taking helen and her mother to ma maison thats where were all going cost a bomb snapped rupert hardly imagine the olympic fund will stretch to that its already been paid for said malise not without a certain quiet pleasure which he afterwards regretted garfield boyson rang from england and guaranteed the bill in advance ruperts face took on that curiously dead expression that boded trouble garfield boyson had already approached rupert in fact he was the only sponsor rupert would have been prepared to work with if boyson had picked up his bills for the next two years he would have been able to slack off and only enter for the big prestigious competitions gradually devoting more and more time to politics and now jake had pinched the sponsorship from under his nose i thought you werent going to drink until after the team event said helen as rupert hair still wet from the shower but already dressed in a gray striped shirt and white trousers poured himself four fingers of whisky hasnt done me much good so far said rupert adding a splash of water from the washbasin need something to get me through whats obviously going to be a fucking awful evening helen tried very hard to curb her elation rupert had told her boyson was footing the bill this evening which meant jake must have got the sponsorship which in turn must mean he could now afford to leave tory and marry her it should be fun she said ive never been to ma maison mothers dying to meet all the team and i know malise will enjoy mother should do said rupert he got enough practice driving tanks in the war helen had her back to rupert but her slender right arm was crooked over her back wrestling with the zip of her dress which was catching in her hair let me moving towards her rupert pushed the newly washed hair aside and pulled the narrow gold zip up to the nape of the neck he looked at her reflection in the mirror breathing in the waves of femme from her warm newly bathed hopelessly excited body she was wearing a dress of dark gold silk highnecked longsleeved falling to the ankles and clinging caressingly to every inch of her body her hair long at the back was drawn up at the sides by two gold combs for a second his long fingers clamped her waist then they shifted up towards her breasts he realized that totally untypically she wasnt wearing a bra or even a petticoat feeling her tense and draw away he tightened his grip havent seen that dress when dyou get it ages ago not for a special occasion i just liked it im sure you look great in it almost too great whats that supposed to mean she said defensively ma maisons always crammed with movie stars and youre always accusing me of looking too straight not this time im not rupert glanced at his watch in fact if we miss predinner drinks weve got time to he began to pull down the zip no gasped helen shrinking away from him almost falling over the dressing table knocking bottles on the floor in her desperate haste to get away im all made up and ready she said trying to make a joke of it and i promised mother wed meet at ninethirty we cant leave her stranded at the restaurant hows she getting there said rupert on her broomstick ma maison thanks to boysons munificence had pushed out the boat on the british team table there were silver plates silver goblets for the neverending bottles of krug white roses and lilies surrounded by silver leaves in the silver bowl at the center of the table with two silver horses on either side rearing up from the silver satin table cloth jake was given a heros welcome when he arrived it took him ages to get across the restaurant as people pumped his hand and wanted to touch his silver medal glinting in the candlelight a group of english actors whod witnessed his victory that afternoon in arcadia were now happily getting plastered insisting that he sit down and have a drink who were those people he asked fen when he finally reached the british team table michael caine susan george roger moore to name three said fen oh i thought they seemed familiar at that moment a beautiful girl came up and tapping rupert on the shoulder handed him a menu and a pen would you very much mind she gave him a dazzling smile not at all said rupert picking up the pen asking jake lovell if i could possibly have his autograph jake was already very tight cocooned in euphoria acknowledging the accolades with one part of his mind but with the other back in the ring jumping every fence feeling great waves of love for that tricky brilliant horse whod finally confounded the critics and come up with the goods fen on the other hand wondered how much longer she could keep going shed been up since four supporting jake all the way yet still praying dino might turn up now looking at helen shining with happiness aware that both rupert and jake were steadily getting drunk she was filled with a feeling of terrible doom can i sit next to you and can we go to disneyland tomorrow asked ivor at that moment suzy and albie erikson arrived to make up the party darling said suzy kissing jake on the mouth you were just sensational youve got no excuse to resist my advances now fen shot a glance at helen she was looking at suzy with pure hatred weve just had an earthquake warning said albie cheerfully its going to start right here at this table thought fen the waiter poured out more champagne to jake said malise everyone except jake and rupert raised their silver goblets to hardy said jake halfdraining his goblet then looking across at helen his eyes not quite focusing he raised it to her blew her a kiss and drained the rest help thought fen do you think the coursell be as difficult on sunday she asked rupert frantic to distract his attention glancing around he saw how wan she looked you okay duckie she nodded im sorry about rocky today you must be heartbroken rupert shrugged dyou know who i miss most of all billy said fen i miss him too ma maison came up with a special menu which fen had patiently to explain to ivor clear soup thats for jakes clear round then coquille st jake à la champagne thats scallops then gâteau hardy for gods sake stop gazing at goldie hawn ivor as dinner progressed ruperts anger channeled into antiamerican asides to irritate both helen and her mother the olympics have become a shambles he was saying a laboratory war between east and west the americans have better drugs better computers to detect minor faults better shrinks to psych out the athletes the whole spirit of amateurism has gone mrs macaulay who was discussing property prices with albie swelled like a bullfrog helen toying with a piece of coquille managed to engineer malise on to the subject of jake naturally im disappointed rupe didnt get a medal but if anyone deserved one it was jake malise nodded its a fairy tale really after that terrible fall youre fond of him arent you malise smiled deprecatingly hes tricky and cussed but you have to admire his integrity of course hes fantastically lucky in his home backup isnt tory kind of dull god no said malise sharply she keeps him calm i must say i never expected him to get a silver i thought hed crack but he didnt he managed without her said helen kneading her bread into pellets in her agitation shes carried him through the last ten years said malise gently a diversion had been created on the other side of the table joan collins had arrived and was being embraced by rupert helen my dear malise lowered his voice ive known you long enough to give you a piece of advice dont play with fire particularly olympic fire cool it until after the games helen blushed furiously i dont know what you mean yes you do said malise gravely ive got enough headaches keeping this lot together without you rocking the boat joan collins svelte in black lace was progressing down the table hi jake we havent met but what a round i was stuck in the studio but we suspended shooting to watch the second half all the brits went wild she turned to helen darling how are you then her eyes lit on the gold dress you meanie i had my eyes on that saw it at giorgios yesterday then i found out the price youre lucky to have a rich husband to pick up the bills let me know if you ever get tired of him helen went very still i think she already has said rupert he looked across at helen his fingers drumming on the table oh this old thing he said softly oh shut up said fen it does suit her suzy whod been flirting outrageously with jake got up to go to the loo mrs macaulay immediately took her place jake found himself getting the fifth degree her big red face seemed to have an extra pair of eyes in the middle of her forehead really he must be extraordinarily drunk as mrs macaulay questioned him about tory the children the yard and the horses it became plain to her that despite the fact that jake was obviously four parts cut and kept calling her mrs campbellblack his marriage was a good deal happier than helens was to that monster who was still badmouthing america the television coverage is utterly onesided said rupert american viewers are totally unaware of any foreign competition helen turned to malise helplessly dont you find la fascinating she said its such an eclectic mixture of the functional and the bizarre dont talk crap snapped rupert malise frowned mrs macaulay went purple thats no way to address a lady what makes you think shes a lady drawled rupert certainly not her parentage mrs macaulay rose to her feet ill not stay here to be insulted why dont you leave then said rupert only malises blandishments helens pleadings and the arrival of the gâteau hardy a splendid ice cream cake in the shape of a gray horse induced her to stay rupert returned to attacking the american team theyre all robots mary jos a robot carol kennedys a robot dino ferranti he is not yelled fen fancy him do you so does my dear wife she is dear too at least you earn your keep shes a parasite didnt know helen came from paris said ivor in surprise everyone laughed which for a moment eased the tension theres a marvelous concert at the hollywood bowl tomorrow helen said to malise and tomorrow theyre doing hamlet in russian id love to go count me out said rupert why not black beauty in urdu the only use for the hollywood bowl is to be sick in it fen resisted the temptation to giggle theres a very naughty movie on at the rialto said suzy who irritated to find shed been ousted from her place next to jake wanted to get back in on the action why dont we all go tomorrow night my wife is not interested in sex said rupert flatly jake had been watching rupert for some time his eyes narrowed and his right hand played idly with the knife hed been given to cut the cake im not surprised he said being married to you rupert looked up there was a long embarrassed pause then fen said desperately ivor and i are going on a tour of movie stars homes tomorrow were going to see rudolph valentinos grave and rupert put a hand on her arm shut up darling he said softly jake was talking why dont you give her a break for a change said jake what kind do you suggest a broken jaw perhaps there was another awful pause just because you rode like a costive chimpanzee today said jake and screwed up the chances of the best horse in the class you dont have to take it out on her he was quivering like a leopard about to spring oh dear drawled rupert we have grown in status since we won our silver medal this afternoon havent we shut up yelled jake been at the human growth hormone have we taunted rupert little man has had a happy day and is now making a big big night of it gypsy my arse youre just a little suburban creep whose mother screwed around so much she couldnt remember who your father was jake picked up the knife no thundered malise suddenly the whole restaurant had gone quiet you little creep said rupert gently the only thing id use you for is to measure my tennis net helen leapt to her feet knocking over her wineglass stop it she screamed just because youre jealous as hell of jake you have to spoil everything st georgia to the rescue said rupert im going said helen thank you malise im real sorry everyone and she fled out of the restaurant a shimmering column of gold cannoning off tables blinded by tears arent you going to cut that cake said griselda rupert caught up with helen outside the restaurant they stood side by side not speaking while the doorman conjured up their car helen was amazed that rupert could be so charming when michael caine stopped on the way out and asked them to a party the following night shut up he snarled on the journey back when she asked him to drive slower let me get home in one piece then were going to do some straighttalking at the eriksons house the servants had gone to bed drunk though rupert was he managed to switch off the burglar alarm before going into the drawing room and pouring himself a glass of neat whisky helen walked towards the stairs where are you going bed ive had enough of you for one day careful she told herself careful but all those things that malise and fen had said earlier about tory and not rocking the boat had only made her more desperate come here said rupert it was not a voice to disobey rupert once again had that curiously dead expression on his face that always heralded trouble she removed her gold high heels which would impede a quick getaway and sank into the white warmth of suzys sumptuous fakefur sofa you ought to be ashamed of yourself she said in a low voice i guess they had a celebration dinner for you when you won your bronze hey wait a minute youve got very protective about jake lovell lately havent you embracing him when he came out of the ring sticking up for him this evening whats going on helen took a deep breath aware that she was pushing a huge boulder towards the edge of a cliff and that any minute it might roll over crushing innocent people in its path whats going on repeated rupert one of helens combs had fallen out of her hair which flopped forward over her face looking at the golden tanned face and the shimmering gold body and the mass of shining hair rupert suddenly thought she had never looked so desirable almost wanton despite her terror youre looking very good as i said earlier youre looking much too good dont tell me youve got yourself a man at last yes i have said helen goaded who is it jake whispered helen jake lovell what did you say you heard me jake lovell rupert began to laugh totally without mirth are you trying to tell me youve been having it off with that pathetic little cripple dont you dare call him that a cripple rupert went on a warped gypsy cripple doing our bit for the disabled are we it figures i suppose it made you feel good a pound in the collection box on sunday a day a month for the nspcc hawking a slit tin up and down the high street once a year for the distressed gentlefolk and leaping into bed with a cripple mrs campbellblack does so much for charity you bet she does youre revolting screamed helen pulling everything down to your own disgusting level it appears to be you whove done the pulling even at a time like this all you can do is to make jokes oh believe me baby i dont think this is funny i love him sobbed helen putting her face in her hands and he loves me rupert filled up his glass then in an almost calm voice that made helens blood run cold he said how long has this been going on since february when marcus was hospitalized i was worried stiff jake came in to see the consultant about his leg he was very caring and supportive i sure needed it after the kenya trip she looked up at him he stared back as though daring her to go further helen dropped her eyes first so thats why youve been hanging around the circuit like a bitch on heat how extraordinary i was barking up quite the wrong tree thinking youd be turned on by janey wasnt i never guessed your particular buzz would be a crippled dwarf jake is not a dwarf screamed helen hes five foot seven youve measured him have you all over for a few seconds he paced up and down the room trying to calm the rage that kept boiling up inside him and you had to pick the one man whos always been out to get me remember when he tried to kill me before the world championship he doesnt give a stuff about you he just wants to score off me he doesnt he wants to marry me the boulder was over the cliff now crashing down gathering force marry you said rupert genuinely amazed how as soon as he can get a divorce and hes going to leave that fat rich cow for you yes sobbed helen if she said it it must be true and presumably that night when i came back from dinard and he was there jawing about healing breaches and team solidarity hed merely come to fuck you i beg your pardon make love with you helen lost her temper yes he had what about you and podge and dizzy and marion and samantha freebody and the one that gave me clap not to mention all the others youve never been faithful to me for one minute oh yes i was said rupert until you got involved with that sniveling child and refused to come abroad with me he doesnt give a stuff about you he went on why did he nearly kill me at disneyland for saying tory was fat why was he on the telephone to her the moment he won that medal youre not going to break up that marriage anyway whats so special about him hes a better rider screamed helen leaping to her feet and hes much better in bed the next moment rupert had hit her across the room then he picked her up and hit her again so that she collapsed sobbing across the glass table spilling ruperts whisky over the white sofa and what the fuck are you going to live on hes got no money he cant give you anything but lovell baby hes got the boyson sponsorship croaked helen he had said rupert gathering up his car keys that was on the condition he kept his nose clean its pretty murky now where are you going whispered helen through lips which were already beginning to swell up to find your lover and beat him up till he sees stars and stripes then im going to string him from the hollywood sign by his precious medal ribbon no screamed helen no please but rupert had gone next moment she heard the crunch of his car roaring off towards los angeles trembling like a palsied dog she ran to the telephone and after several false starts managed to get through to the olympic village one of the security guards answered no they couldnt possibly wake jake in the middle of the night hed gone to bed and he was sharing a room with two weight lifters both of whom had a competition tomorrow and needed their sleep there was a do not disturb sign on the door please sobbed helen its his wife i must talk with him theres been a terrible accident the security man hummed and hawed okay ill go and wake him it seemed an eternity as she stood watching the remains of the whisky drip onto the oyster carpet before jake picked up the telephone tory darling whats the matter are you okay is it one of the kids helen could hear the terrible anxiety in his voice which made her cry all the more no its not tory its me helen it was the only way i could have them fetch you she was so hysterical it was a minute before he could discover what she was trying to say steady pet calm down tell me whats the matter rupert knows everything hes suspected us for ages that wasnt true but somehow it made a better story we gave ourselves away this evening hes on his way to the village did he hurt you no yes well a little im okay but he says hes going to kill you as though in a dream jake watched a group of english cyclists drunk and stark naked except for their security chains being humored very kindly along the passage by some security guards for a wild second he wondered whether to seek asylum there were enough guards on duty even in the middle of the night to protect him from a regiment of ruperts but then rupert would probably go back to arcadia and kill helen im so sorry she sobbed i didnt mean to shop you i was so frightened sweetheart you must keep calm it was as though he was speaking to a child and watching himself in a black and white film cushioned by drink yet curiously sober this wasnt happening to him are you still wearing that gold dress okay well get out of it and change into some day clothes pack a case put in clothes to last you for a few days bring your passport bankers and american express cards dark glasses and as much spare cash as you can get your hands on ill come and fetch you jake im sorry its all right but hurry rupert stormed into the olympic village twenty minutes later and was held up by a further tenminute hassle with the guards because he was if not completely drunk obviously in a very wild excitable state finally they let him through and he proceeded to search every room on the third floor until he found jakes the weight lifters trying to get their beauty sleep were not amused to be roused by rupert roaring around the room searching under beds in the shower even in the fridge then he looked in jakes chest of drawers his passport and washing things had gone and all his clothes except his red coat his breeches white shirts ties and boots which still hung in the wardrobe on the chest of drawers were framed photographs of tory and the children it was as though hed left the most important part of his life behind rupert returned to the eriksons house to find all the lights blazing and the place full of cops suzy and albie coming in tight and finding doors opened chairs knocked over whisky spilt helens room ransacked and the alarm unset had promptly assumed that theyd been burgled rupert ran upstairs took in the chaos of clothes jewels and papers all his spare cash had gone he went back to the drawing room theres only been one burglary in this house jake lovells walked off with my wife are you sure said suzy in amazement he didnt seem remotely keen on her hes a better actor than she is said rupert its been going on since february weve just had true confessions time he looked at the carpet and the sofa sorry about the whisky he was very pale which gave the suntan an almost green tinge but seemed totally in control annunciata seems to have pushed off too said albie wandering into the drawing room and pulling off his tie oh no said suzy far more upset by that than by helens departure ive got fourteen people for lunch tomorrow only thirteen without helen said rupert grimly after the police had gone he told them what had happened in a way their flip brittle approach helped him to cling onto his sanity i must say she has been looking sensational since jake arrived in la said suzy and she got mad whenever he talked to me im sorry rupert being bored with your wife doesnt necessarily mean you want someone else to take her off your hands particularly when its your worst enemy she was amazed rupert was so calm she found it rather chilling perhaps he was still in shock then he said can i use your telephone to ring a few people itll be midday tuesday morning in england now of course said suzy go into the study she was dying to discuss the whole thing with albie hellbent on vengeance like an army scorching the earth rupert rang amanda hamilton in scotland fortunately perhaps he got rollo and explained what had happened rollo was most sympathetic and fully appreciated that jake and helen might try to seize the children he said it would be perfectly all right for charlene to fly up to scotland with marcus and tab until rupert got back from la im awfully sorry rollo said again have a word with amanda even thousands of miles away rupert could almost hear rollo putting his hand over the receiver while he briefed his wife amanda sounded extremely shocked darling im so sorry are you okay fine said rupert but they could have timed it better with the team competition on sunday the press are going to have a field day thats why i want to get tab he paused and marcus of course out of the way did you know yesterday was that why rocky jumped so badly no rupert interrupted her that was my fault then he rang his secretary miss hawkins and told her to put a red alert on all bankers cards access and american express to order the bank to stop all checks and to close all helens accounts at peter jones harrods hatchards and cavendish house in cheltenham anyone at home he said particularly charlene and mrs bodkin or any of the grooms or the gardeners would be fired if they spoke to the press he went back into the drawing room with a grim smile on his face that should clip their wings i suppose ill have to wait till morning to try and trace annunciata said suzy petulantly i expect shes moved in with that frightful boyfriend annunciata in fact was fed up with working for suzy fed up with the long hours the untidyness suzy just stepped out of her clothes and the meals demanded at all hours she never knew how many people to cater for it was only a summer job anyway and shed hardly had time to see any of the games not even mr lovell winning his silver after being woken up by the frightful row between mr and mrs campbellblack annunciata had crept upstairs and heard the whole thing including hearing rupert hitting helen and storming off into the night and a hysterical helen ringing jake lovell annunciata had then appeared and asked mrs campbellblack if she needed any help with packing she even wanted to know if we had any tissue paper annunciata told her beady american boyfriend on the telephone she was very frightened but she still remembered to take the hot tongs and heated rollers and her hair dryer the beady american boyfriend deducing that rupert would come roaring back to the house in a towering rage advised annunciata to move out pronto after all it was only a summer job and he was cute enough to realize that here was a story which if annunciata lived up to her name and related to a newspaper would save her having to work for several years tory after the victory celebrations fell into bed at five in the morning but still couldnt sleep for happiness after all that struggle jakey had got his silver shed never seen him as happy as hed been at the press conference and now with the boyson sponsorship hed be able to have the horses he wanted he and fen wouldnt have to work quite so hard and hed have more time with the children which hed always longed for and they wouldnt have to scrimp and worry all the time about where the next penny was coming from she didnt even feel tired when she had to get up at seven and take the sleepy grumbling children to school all day people kept ringing up to congratulate her and jake flowers and telegrams arrived constantly the village was in a state of total euphoria already planning the welcome home celebrations tory watched clips of jakes silver four times on breakfast television and in olympic roundup and played it back on the video as she washed up all the glasses from last night she didnt bother with lunch shed been on a diet and had lost ten pounds since jake left singing at the top of her voice she went to collect the children jake would be getting up soon she thought fondly with a terrible hangover on balance shed decided not to fly to la by the time shed got everything organized it would be friday then after a night flight thered be only half a day before the team event then theyd be coming home again thered be other occasions her mother had rung up and toryd been so happy shed forgotten to be cool with her after all it was a long time since colonel carter had taken revenge away surely yesterdays medal proved jake was the greater rider than rupert she even found time to go and give macaulay two apples and tell him about his masters great triumph housework could go by the board today it was a beautiful september afternoon just a touch of wind ruffled the millpond and the hanging green willow curtains the children were very fractious when she picked them up from school darklis had lost one shoe but at least it was better than two she said isa had been beaten up in the playground for boasting about his father tory sent them off to watch television suddenly as she was cutting the fat off the lamb chops for their supper she felt very tired shed have a large vodka and tonic when shed put the children to bed then perhaps jake would ring another wave of happiness overwhelmed her then she heard the noise of argument from the sitting room isa to darkliss rage had switched on ceefax over the sullivans so that he could see the olympic results mummy screamed darklis isas hitting me stop it isa yelled tory i always get the blame shouted isa mummy come quickly theres something about daddy shoving the chops under the grill tory ran into the sitting room silver medalist jake lovell she read over the soothing tones of the sullivans has disappeared from the olympic village not seen since last night he is alleged by the los angeles times to have gone off with helen campbellblack wife of rupert campbellblack a fellow member of the british team and a bronze and silver medalist in tory thought she must be dreaming it couldnt be true theyd made some mistake jake had only rung her last night and told her he loved her there was a moth bashing against the television screen what does it mean mummy asked isa wheres daddy gone nowhere darling said tory in a strange voice its some mistake daddy wouldnt do that she canceled the ceefax titles with the norm button then after a few seconds switched on the ceefax olympic report again mummy complained darklis i want to watch the sullivans silver medalist jake lovell tory read again has disappeared from the olympic village it was a few seconds before she realized that the telephone was ringing she rushed to answer it it must be jake to say it was a hideous mistake mrs lovell yes its the sun newspaper here it was that thickened voice again with which they announced trouble or asked difficult questions just wondered if youve got anything to say about your husband running off with helen campbellblack i dont know what youre talking about said tory and slammed down the receiver the telephone rang again it was the mirror with the same question then it was the sun again tory took the receiver off the hook she started to shake violently mummy mummy the ovens on fire darklis having wandered into the kitchen in search of a biscuit found the neglected chops ablaze under the grill the frozen peas had boiled down to a green scum mummy mummy yelled isa starting to cry theyre talking about daddy martin bell gazing sternly out of the television screen his light brown curls whipped by the los angeles breeze was confirming that jake had indeed disappeared from the olympic village so had helen campbellblack from the house in arcadia where she had been staying with her husband according to the los angeles times whose reporter had interviewed the maid helen had left after a row with rupert directly after a dinner at ma maison restaurant held to celebrate jakes silver medal malise gordon the british chef dequipe had appealed to jake to return for the team competition tory was brought back to earth by the doorbell it was a neighbor mrs irvine i heard it on the radio she said im so sorry for you ill get the childrens supper and answer the telephone youll not want to be bothered im sure its some mistake said tory the poor little soul didnt seem to have taken it in mrs irvine told her husband later so i got the doctor at that moment the doorbell went it was the local stringer for the daily mail after that they came like locusts with their longrange cameras trying to get in through the front door the back door even the windows swarming through the village attempting to bribe grooms neighbors trades people desperate for information tory tried to put a call through to la but all lines were engaged its a bad dream she kept telling herself jake wouldnt go off like that not when hed asked her to come out to la not with the team event on sunday which meant almost more to him than the individual and which he knew meant infinitely more to malise alarmed by her calmness and refusal to accept the facts the doctor gave her a sedative it was not that jake wouldnt leave her she kept saying but hed certainly never leave the horses or the children particularly in the middle of the olympics it was a belief she had to cling on to malise however rang at ten oclock im afraid we know nothing more at this end what i imagine happened was that jake and helen may have walked out together at least thats what she told rupert tempers flared rupert was absolutely livid at not getting the gold hed been simply poisonous all evening threatening to beat helen up she appealed to jake for help and he probably felt he ought to remove her somewhere safe until rupert cooled down malise reflected tory as the truth began to sink in sounded like a gynecologist telling her shed got a stillborn baby im sure theres nothing to worry about he went on im convinced hell come back for the team event but jake did not come back the games were into their second week the public was slightly bored with tales of derringdo and megaachievement they wanted a good scandal rupert his beautiful american wife and her romantic gypsy lover were the perfect answer for just a handful of silver she left him quipped the new york times everyone who knew jake and rupert rekindled the old feud jake had been bullied at school by rupert and had got his revenge twentytwo years later by trouncing rupert at the olympics and then running off with his wife it was the same in la as at the mill house once the los angeles times had led on helens row with rupert and her running off with jake the reporters were everywhere like some horror army of killer ants they crept through seemingly locked doors through windows haunting the olympic village the eriksons house the stables and the exercise rings fen as their prime target had been absolutely knocked sideways by the news i must go to tory she pleaded with malise on the wednesday morning she sounds absolutely terrible now its really sunk in the english papers are crucifying jake i cant leave her to face it on her own let me fly home you cant said malise surveying his shambles of a team unless jake comes back youll have to jump hardy everywhere fen went people were badmouthing jake everywhere the press swooped on her every time she worked hardy the exercise ring was crowded with photographers and curious onlookers rupert was far less vulnerable first he was holed up in suzys house which was electricfenced and burglaralarmed to the teeth secondly you didnt try and interview a maneating tiger rupert was in the kind of eruptive mood that kept even the press at a distance jake was just doing his bit for britain he told billy on the telephone unfortunately in this case the bit happened to be helen extraordinary for seven years she never looked at another man then according to dizzy for the last five months no ones been able to see her ears for skirt he sounds terrible billy told janey as he came off the telephone do you think i ought to fly out there the beeb have offered to pay my fare and give me a fat fee if ill help dudley do the commentary for the team competition no you ought not snapped janey ruperts had it coming to him for years i am not going to be left alone with christy when hes so littlenor she added to herself am i going to let you loose in la with fenella maxwell twentyfour hours limped by with no sign of jake on thursday morning fen was working hardy in one of the big exercise rings normally the german team should have been using the ring at this time but theyd willingly swapped over with the british to fox the press and give fen the chance of a little privacy it was nearly ten oclock and the sun was already scorching down hardy missing jake was edgy and miserable he had received so much adulation on monday and tuesday morning now suddenly no one wanted to admire the horse whose master had disgraced a nation as she slowly cantered him around on the left rein fen pondered the horrors of the last two days rumors seethed jake and helen had been sighted in england in all parts of america on a flight to bermuda jake had grown a mustache was wearing a false beard helen had dyed her hair blond brunette even cut it all off last night malise had made another stiffupperlipped plea on television for jake to come back we will jump as a team and conduct ourselves like gentlemen is he referring to griselda said rupert rupert still keeps up the stream of flip remarks thought fen allowing no one to see his black despair and utter humiliation malise seemed terribly upset too fen herself had been in tears all night she wished she could help tory bloody helen campbellblack she thought savagely not even able to hold off until after the games fens hair was wringing wet beneath her hat as was her tshirt the reins slipped between her damp hands suddenly she was overwhelmed by longing for dino she had never needed him more she could have lain down and slept for a year in his arms but she musnt think of dino or helen it only upset her she must keep calm and psych herself into the right frame of mind for sunday perhaps by some miracle jake would come back oh hardy wheres your master she sighed in the distance she could see the german team riding down from the stables in a cloud of dust to take over she must make herself scarce before the press turned up this afternoon she thought wearily she had to take ivor to disneyland again catching her not concentrating hardy gave a whinny and a great whicker of joy and carted her across the ring for gods sake you disobedient bugger yelled fen hauling ineffectually on his mouth where the bloody hell dyou think youre going hardy ground to a halt fen glanced up and gasped for there holding hardys dark blue sweat rug tall and golden as a lombardy poplar in autumn stood dino ferranti hi hardy baby he drawled putting up a not altogether steady hand to stroke the dappled face im real glad you havent forgotten me just as im real glad your mistresss language is a lousy as ever dino had had a long and very trying nine months but everything was compensated for when he looked up and saw the expression of incredulous bewildered delight on fens face the expression on which left him in absolutely no doubt about how she felt youve gone blond again she muttered i know i didnt seem to score with gray hair oh dino dino she cried and tumbled off hardy into his arms he kissed her so fiercely she had no doubt of his feelings towards her oh i love you she bleated incoherently ive missed you ive been so so miserable me too he groaned oh christ darling weve been so dumb as he held her tight she could feel how much he was trembling and how his ribs protruded beneath the blue denim shirt youve got so thin they both said simultaneously and then started to laugh next moment fens laughter had turned to tears its so awful i know im real sorry sweetheart he took her face in his hands kissing her forehead and her nose and the tears spilling out of her eyes before he found her mouth again no no she protested when at last he freed her it was so awful for you about manny did you get my letter there was so much mail and i was so unglued i didnt even get around to looking at it until yesterday hell i needed you so badly but i guess i couldnt handle seeing you again in case you were still mad at me or didnt feel the way i did so i chickened out and went home to lick my wounds then i heard about helen and jake buggering off i figured you might need me as much as i needed you right so here i am oh im so glad said fen burying her face in his chest i was so aching to see you it was the main thing that drove me on to get selected i thought id die when mary jo said you werent coming you wont ever disappear again will you lifes so awful when youre not there you try getting rid of me he was about to kiss her again when he said ouch hardy irritably trying to tell them they were hopelessly neglecting a silver medal winner had nipped dino on the shoulder then all three jumped violently as a rousing chorus started bellowing vy vos zey born so beautiful vy vos zey born at all swinging round they found the entire german squad sitting on their horses laughing their heads off and about bloody time too my friends said ludwig at the entrance to the stables the inevitable jackal pack of reporters was hovering heard from jake no snapped fen hows tory bearing up havent talked to her today wheres he gone i dont know oh the bliss of having dino there once more to get rid of them go on pack it in fucking get off our backs he said hustling fen and hardy through the gates dino dino ferranti said one of the reporters with quickening interest you stayed at jakes barn last fall didnt you what sort of guy was he the greatest snapped dino not just as a rider but as a human being if he walked out on the games he must have had a good reason okay i guess he wanted to protect helen from her bastard of a husband on the way to hardys box dino started kissing fen again give him to me said sarah grabbing hardy you are in no fit condition take her away dino she deserves the afternoon off make a change from taking ivor round disneyland dino put his arm through fens im staying at carol kennedys place just up the road lets go there at least we can be alone i ought to have a bath said fen suddenly aware of her sweaty hair and clothes ill give you one said dino itll take hours fen blushed scarlet dino shouted a voice it was a middleaged woman with the kind of lean muscular body that looks better in breeches than in the summer dress she was wearing we thought you werent coming said her husband changed my mind we were real sorry about manny yeah it was tough there was a pause the couple looked inquiringly at fen whose hand was still firmly held by dino aware she must look hot and shiny from being kissed she hung her head dropping her hand dino took hold of her hair at the back and very gently yanked her head upwards you havent met fenella maxwell he said in the most drawling voice my future wife fen jumped out of her skin then looked up at him with such startled anxious eyes that he let go her hair and put a comforting arm round her shoulders truly she gasped very very truly dino said laughing your future wife said the woman in delighted surprise is that a fact fenella er maxwell jake lovells sisterinlaw you were too polite to say said dino shes with the british team well congratulations said the husband pumping fen by the hand how long have you been engaged dino looked at his watch and laughed again about fifteen seconds he said perhaps sixteen by now oh wow this may not be the best way of relaxing before a megacompetition said dino but its certainly the nicest he eased himself out of her and collapsed onto the flowered sheets carol kennedys house was near suzy eriksons out of the window they could see the mountains i feel so relaxed i dont think ill ever get up again said fen it sure went through the top of the richter scale said dino were you scared not as much as i thought i was going to be nor was i it didnt matter if we bombed weve got all our lives to get it right shall we have lots of kids my daddys dying to be a grandfather fen rolled over are you sure you want to get married dont you he said appalled oh yes more than anything i just dont want you to feel trapped i want to be trapped you gotta make an honest man of me he leaned on his elbow running his hand down her body stroking the hollow of her stomach im going to feed you up im sorry i was so vile in england well i came on pretty hostile too you were bent out of shape over billy i overreacted and backed off too hard so as not to crowd you but all that stupid business with enrico protested fen ouch thats my boob youve dug your nails into anyone else i wouldnt have minded but hes such a bastard no thats not true id have killed you if it had been anyone i was so jealous i havent been out with a single man since you left what about married guys said dino fen giggled nor them either how about you um well i did try to screw my way out of it but it didnt do any good i knew id never love anyone else i worked and worked i had fantasies about getting the gold and dazzling you into loving me back fen snuggled up to him you didnt need a gold god i feel guilty feeling so ridiculously happy when everything else is so awful she knew she ought to put a call through to tory but couldnt bring herself to burst the bubble of bliss just yet she looked at the lean brown length of him reveling once again in the thick blond hair the siamesecat eyes the wide curling mouth i never dreamed id end up with anyone as stunningly attractive as you she said humbly in fact your looks have definitely improved with age dyou think i ought to ring malise just in case he thinks his entire team is doing a disappearing act he knows very gently dino began to stroke the inside of her thigh i wanted to test the water so i made sure i bumped into him first this morning he told me where to find you he also reckoned dino smirked slightly you were going into a decline i was not said fen indignantly then as dino moved his hand upwards and began to slide two fingers in and out of her she gasped and said well perhaps i was come here said dino bending over to kiss her i need a fix again in the end it was he who made her ring tory she heard the operator saying the call came from la jake is that you torys voice trembled with hope no im afraid its only me fen you okay no im awfully sorry theres really no news of him this end how are the children taking it were managing very well said tory in an unnaturally bright voice i just hope jake isnt too shattered by the press furor to come out of hiding she started to cry oh please dont said fen feeling her eyes fill with tears look dyou remember dino dino ferranti he turned up today have a word with him she handed the receiver to dino dino was immensely kind but very practical had she got enough food in the house was anyone helping her with the kids and the horses who was fending off the press everyones being marvelous said tory but theyre so embarrassed they were so proud of jakey and were planning this huge welcome home bonanza now they dont know what to do tell them to cheer for fen angel please dont cry he raised a palm upwards in a particularly latin gesture of despair then said listen im going to get a night flight right oh no whispered fen in horror you cant do that i need you ill be with you sometime tomorrow he went on dont bother to meet me ill call from heathrow ill sort everything out well he might do still well just cross our fingers putting down the telephone he gathered fen into his arms i cant bear it not so soon after ive found you i need you as much as she does she sobbed im sorry to be so selfish dino let her cry stroking her hair cradling her its the most awful thing ive ever had to do he said but if im joining your family right i have a responsibility towards all of them things are simmering along at the moment but if jake doesnt show on sunday the shit is really going to hit the fan hes already blown the monetary advantages of his silver the press are gonna assassinate him for letting down his country and youve no idea of ruperts capacity for vengeance every doorll be shut to him hell probably be suspended for ten years oh poor jake said fen in horror why did he do it dino brushed her damp hair and kissed her forehead i guess he fell in love we know how potent that is helen was suicidal frantic to escape from rupert jake momentarily wanted someone glamorous to complement his new star status probably wanted to deal the coup de grâce to rupert nothing like cuckolding your enemy all the same i figure helens to blame however much rupert hammers jake for enticement i guess it was helen who pulled the plug out she blew it to rupert knowing it would trigger jake into leaving but whatever happens jakes on a collision course rupertll ruin them both he glanced at her watch id better book that flight as he came off the telephone fen put her arms round him i didnt believe it was possible but i love you about a million times more than i did an hour ago all the same i wouldnt tell tory about us yet other peoples happiness tends to push you over the top it was like the house of atreus as disaster after disaster hit the british team despite every effort desdemona was still not fit which meant that unless jake came back fen would have to ride hardy hes a misogynist grumbled fen next morning after hed had her off for the second time ill never get him out of the collecting ring in this mood well weve got to have someone whose round we can drop said griselda kicking mr punch on and clearing the combination on a perfect stride bitch thought fen may you be struck down by toads and pestilence she spoke too soon coming back to the olympic village that evening she found griselda staggering out of the loo as green as the elephant who ate the mushroom in the babar books ive vomited fifteen times she announced collapsing onto her bed too many cyclists muttered fen under her breath shall i get a doctor no groaned griselda ill be okay by late evening poor griseldas temperature had gone up to and she was admitted to hospital with suspected food poisoning and then there were three said rupert next morning as they had a final workout before the competition the following day despite his appearance of icy indifference rupert was in a terrible state rage against both helen and jake kept bubbling up inside him corrosive as black bile despite the quantities of whisky hed shipped each night in search of oblivion he had hardly slept since theyd gone drink had never affected his eye in the past but watching humphrey bogart movies on television all night hadnt helped in the relentless los angeles sunshine that morning as he was cantering towards a huge upright jesus the mexican decided to gallop across his path ten yards beyond the fence just for a second rocky panicked took off too early clouting the heavy pole with his forelegs turning a somersault in the air he crashed down with rupert under him by the time fen malise and jesus the mexican had reached them rocky had scrambled to his feet shaking himself gingerly he decided he wasnt hurt and cantered off rupert tried to get up groaned and fell back clutching his shoulder what is it said malise dropping to his knees shoulder said rupert through clenched teeth dislocated get me to a fucking hospital at once and get it put back jesus si said the mexican i am here just for a second a ghost of a smile flickered across ruperts face not you he said i was talking to an earlier model malise went with rupert to the emergency room he lay stretched out in the ambulance his face graygreen sweat beads drenching his forehead and upper lip cursing quietly to himself the whole way just to look at the horrible angle of his arm made malise feel sick at least its not fractured said the doctor after the xray pretty straightforward to put back youll just be out of action for a few days malise and rupert exchanged glances rupert turned to the doctor i dont want an anesthetic dont be ridiculous said malise i dont need one how did they manage before they had chloroform i dont want my reflexes fucked up for tomorrow youre not jumping tomorrow said malise what other alternative do we have appealing to jake to come back if he shows his face within fifty miles of the show ring hell end up in here as well said rupert in the morgue have you any idea how painful it will be without an anesthetic said the doctor yes said rupert our doctor at home put it back for me once when i was out hunting i carried on for the rest of the day you were younger then said malise this is the second time said the doctor i know said rupert throwing back his head and clenching his teeth come here sweetheart he added to the beautiful nurse who was gazing at him with pity and admiration and hold my hand he was about to say he expected hed do it a third time but as the doctor got to work he fainted at least the pain should take my mind off my erring wife he said when he came around but despite repeated shots of morphine he had never known such agony at five oclock malise called a press conference the british team is down to three riders one of them rupert campbellblack has been very seriously injured today but is determined to ride tomorrow i want to make one more appeal to jake lovell to think seriously about coming back great britain needs him rupert has agreed there will be no reprisals fens night was scarcely better than ruperts she had thought that now dino had reappeared everything would be easier but she found herself even twitchier had he really been there at all did he really love her and want to marry her she felt bitterly ashamed of the resentment she felt that hed gone to look after tory if he really loved you mocked a voice as she got dressed at four oclock in the morning he wouldnt have been able to tear himself away shed been miserable for so long she couldnt adjust to happiness in a few hours she was going to face the worst ordeal of her life and she felt quite unprepared to cope with it she must get herself into the right frame of mind but enrico had gone off her as soon as hed got her into bed might not dino tell me how stupid i am she said to lester the teddy bear as she tied her tie but lester didnt answer have a nice day she said to him as she left the room its more than i shall have malise was standing by the car ivor was already in the back looking green i slept like a log he said in a surprised voice lucky you said fen the press surged forward any news from jake nothing said malise bleakly we shall only be fielding three riders its too late for him to declare now rupert was glad when the night was over hed always assumed he would be able to withstand torture now he wasnt sure he wondered if the doctor had trapped a nerve when hed put the shoulder back at fivethirty he had a bath the hot water helped to relax him but after a quarter of an hour he found he couldnt get out the slightest move to raise himself produced absolute agony in his shoulder another half hour passed as he slumped between each thwarted attempt he was terrified of slipping with his left foot he pulled out the plug waiting for the enamel surface to dry so he might have more grip it must be getting on for sixthirty theyd be walking the course in an hour hed have to yell for suzy who probably had a hangover and wouldnt wake up he was almost sobbing with pain and frustration if only he could crawl to the bedroom he could give himself another shot of morphine then he heard the doorbell go then again he made another attempt to get out then he heard suzys door open suzy he croaked then he heard voices in the hall probably malise wondering where the hell he was hes not in his room so he must be in the bath suzy was saying sleepily thank god he hadnt locked the door suzy banged on it someone to see you rupe who the hell is it he said its me said a blissfully familiar voice and there in the doorway stood billy for a second rupert gazed at him dumbfounded christ do i ever need you he said in an unsteady voice i know im terribly sorry about helen no to get me out of this bloody bath said rupert but give me a shot of morphine first its on the chest of drawers in my bedroom the sting of the needle entering his shoulder was the most wonderful sensation he could imagine how the hell did you manage to get out of janeys clutches he asked billy grinned i told her that sometimes water was thicker than blood draws good said malise were fourteenth out of sixteen all the other riders were tremendously sympathetic and friendly they can afford to be said rupert they think weve had it who are the favorites asked fen americans germans swiss said rupert were about a million to one ive put a monkey on dont let fen see any of the papers hissed malise theyve all crucified jake good said rupert then shooting a sidelong glance at malise he said its not the winning that matters its the being taken apart it was a tremendous boost to the british team to see billy cant you jump said ivor im going to sit in the commentary box with dudley said billy and be wildly partisan at least youll get the names right said fen im glad you think so fiona said billy hows rupe bearing up he added in an undertone he wont talk about either helen or jake except to make the odd flip crack he probably will with you i think hes going through hell but i cant quite work out if its violent possessiveness or murdered pride or whether hes suddenly realized he loves her at seventhirty they walked the course everyone agreed it was the biggest ever built in show jumping fen could walk straight underneath the parallel without bumping her head close up for the first time she realized how huge the fences were cant think why they dont stage the olympic swimming contest in the water jump she said ivors mouth was open wider than ever its even worse than the individual in front sauntered the american team in their white shortsleeved shirts and breeches showing off their mahogany suntans long bodies and thoroughbred legs laughing and exuding quiet confidence they looked as though theyd been fed on peaches and tbones all their life the crowd gave them a colossal cheer of encouragement as they passed the german team looked equally together as they goosestepped out the distances but for the first time fen felt there was real solidarity among the british team the arena was like an oven already by the time i go in thought fen itll be turned up to regulo thats going to cause the most trouble said malise looking at the fence constructed in the shape of a huge brown derby hat its so unfamiliar youll have to ride them really hard at it then theres that big gate immediately after at least theyve scrapped the hot dog said ivor in relief all these flowers are giving me hayfever rupert broke off a frangipani and gave it to fen youll be had up for demolishing the course even before you start she said malise was right the derby fence upset everyone ludwig the german pathfinder expected to go clear was nearly brought down by it and knocked up sixteen faults roll on ze next olympics he said ruefully as he came out of the ring i am very bored of being ze good loser canadian australian italian and french riders all came to grief jesus the mexican had a punishing fall the first american rider lizzie dean came in and cleared the derby but ran slap into the gate and had eight faults at the combination i cant watch anymore my selfconfidence is in tatters said fen the only good thing about this competition is billy doing the commentary he keeps saying hooray every time a foreign rider kicks out a fence youll be jumping in threequarters of an hour said malise better go and warm hardy up by the way some flowers arrived for you theyre in the tackroom he allowed himself a small smile as fen bolted the yards to the stables the flowers were two dozen pale pink roses and the card inside said to darling fen good luck i love you dino how the hell did they get them delivered here she said carol kennedy bought them said sarah he promised dino hed make sure you got them stop grinning like a cheshire cat this is no time to be worrying about the opposite sex having got these said fen putting them in a bucket of water i can now stop worrying about it because they were fielding only three riders the british team started jumping with the second riders of the other teams among these hans schmidt only had a couple of poles down for eight faults and mary jo came in and showed everyone how to do it with a glorious clear that should encourage ivor said fen who had jumped off hardy for a second to watch him ivor rode in blinking not a seat was empty after mary jos gold earlier in the week and her clear now the huge crowd was at fever pitch i always enjoy ivors intellectual approach to the sport said rupert from the shade of the riders stand now ivor has removed his hat will he ever find his head again after tuesdays fiasco ivor started well and rode with colossal determination the sailboat the derby the high gate the huge wall the massive blue water jump caused him no trouble at all then he unaccountably stopped twice at the parallels thats that then said rupert lets go and have a screw dizz for gods sake get your bat out ivor billy was yelling in the commentary box to the startled delight of the viewers one more stop and the whole teams eliminated scarlet in the face as if by telepathy ivor pulled his whip out of his boot in which it was tucked and gave john half a dozen hefty whacks good god said malise the picture of injured pride john heaved himself over the parallel and swishing his tail in rage proceeded to go clear except for bringing down the middle element of the combination absolutely marvelous well done ivor said billy excitedly from the commentary box do you know he only paid for that horse ten faults plus one time fault thats not at all bad said malise fen knew she should have some inner tap which could turn off all outside excitement and leave her icily calm on desdemona shed always jumped best when she was angry but hardy needed to be kept serene he seemed a little tired after his medalwinning adventures on monday which would at least make him jump more carefully and not start ducking out of his bridle following jakes lead she had removed the cotton wool from his ears and let him go to the entrance of the arena so he could watch the preceding round it was both inspiring and daunting carol kennedy went clear to colossal applause which meant the americans were on twelve faults at the end of the third round and could probably scrap lizzie deans round the tarzan howls and the waving american flags had hardy hopping all over the place the time is incredibly tight said malise dont waste any of it in the corners but remember the important thing is to get round at all costs if youre disqualified were out you do say the cheeriest things said fen good luck said rupert fen felt the butterflies going berserk in her stomach as the terror finally got to her i cant face it she said in panic i simply cant jump in front of all those people yes you can said rupert putting his good left hand up to squeeze her thigh come on darling youll float over them hardys done it all before leave it to him are you sure suddenly she looked terribly young rupert smiled quite sure out in the arena there was nothing like it nothing like the fear and the exposure in that blazing white hot heat watched by eyes and millions and millions of television viewers billy who by now was well stuck into the whisky admired the slender figure in the black coat her blond hair just curling under her hat one of dinos pink roses in her buttonhole this is certainly the most beautiful girl rider in the world he said riding hardy with whom her brotherinlaw jake lovell did so brilliantly on monday to get the silver medal now come on darling i told you not to mention jake hissed dudley putting his hand over the microphone and dont call fiona darling the relief of the bell stopped all thought process suddenly fens nerves vanished its you and me babe she whispered to hardy as he cleared the first four fences without any trouble kicking up the tan following the hoofprints of earlier riders she steadied him for the derby he didnt like it then decided he did and took a mighty leap clearing it by a foot the yell of the crowd distracted him the heat haze above the gate made judging the distance difficult fen asked him to take off too early he kicked out the fence and then toppled the wall after that hurting himself eyes flashing ears flattened tail whisking like an angry cat now shell go to pieces thought malise in despair but fen held him together and drove him on picking her way over the obstacles not touching any of them look at him said sarah in ecstasy hes really really trying coming up to the last fence hardy started showing off and gave a huge kick back the crowd laughed he kicked back again lazily whisking over the last fence he gave it an almighty clout for a second the pole shuddered trembled on the edge then fell back into the cup god is on our side after all said malise bloody good said rupert as fen slipped off the huge horse flinging her arms round hardys neck and taking back all the beastly things shed ever said about him until the next time said sarah now the last riders in each team had to jump peter colegate riding instead of dino knocked up a surprising fifteen faults so his was the round the americans dropped hans schmidt went clear the round however the world was waiting for was ruperts fen straightened his tie and did up one brass button of his red coat which was draped over his damaged right shoulder are you okay does it hurt horribly yes but ive just had another shot im so spaced out ill probably carry rocky over the fences with one finger not by a flicker as he rode into the ring did rupert betray his awareness that every camera in the world was trained on him to see what the effect had been of helen pushing off if the press had gone to town on jake that morning it was without ruperts help he had refused to say a word to them he held the reins lightly in his left hand he carried no whip the crowd seeing that he was coming in to jump the most punishing course in history with one arm in a sling roared their approval and encouragement dropping his reins he removed his hat his blond hair glittered golder than any medal the pain was agonizing even the gentlest pop in the collecting ring had jolted his shoulder unbearably but none of this showed in his face rocky was a gallant and kind horse something was different today perhaps it was the sympathetic almost helpless way rupert had jumped him earlier perhaps it was because for once his master wasnt carrying a whip suddenly there was an expression of deep responsibility on rockys handsome golden face i will take care of you today he seemed to be saying just to make you feel a sod for all the times youve beaten me up in the past over the first two fences rupert had the greatest difficulty balancing himself then he settled in rocky was jumping carefully only clearing each fence by an inch or so now he was thundering down to the water and over now he was over the derby and the gate now turning for the huge threepart combination undoubtedly rupert is the best rider in the world shouted billy jubilantly in the commentary box look at the power of those leg muscles he isnt even shifting in the saddle go on rupe go on for a miraculous moment it looked as if he was going to go clear then rocky trailed a leg at the last fence and unlike fen brought it down out he rode to almost the biggest cheer of the day billy bolted out of the commentary box to congratulate him wait wailed dudley there are still the japs and the portuguese to jump that was absolutely brilliant said billy rushing up to rupert god knows how you did it should have been a clear said rupert kicking his right foot out of the stirrup and wincing and biting his lip as he lowered himself down tremendous performance rupert said malise looking at his score sheet the yanks are on twelve the germans on sixteen the swiss on eighteen the french on twenty were fifth with twentytwo he added with quiet satisfaction you shouldnt be jumping but im sure glad i saw you congratulations said a voice it was the doctor from the hospital rupert smiled but the doctor noticing his pallor and how much he was sweating waved his medical kit i thought youd probably need something stronger to face this afternoon i need an enormous whisky said rupert not too enormous said malise afterwards fen couldnt recall if she ate any lunch ivor ate his way solemnly through two steaks without realizing it billy came too cracking jokes with rupert keeping up everybodys spirits they knew they wouldnt win the margin was too big but they were quietly elated they had conducted themselves with honor prince philip who was an old friend of ruperts came up and congratulated them really tremendous well done all of you dont know why you bother to ride with any hands at all rupert id better go back and wind up dudley said billy getting to his feet he says i must be more enthusiastic about the other nations good luck everyone take care of yourself rupe rupert raised his hand he wished billy could stay he was beginning to feel desperately tired and the pain was really getting to him can you give me something he said to the doctor itd be better nearer your round or the effect might wear off i darent give you two shots or youll pass out in the ring when the riders came out for the second round it was soon apparent that the first round had overstretched the horses despite menacing clouds on the horizon and the rumble of thunder the sun was at its height beating down on to the stadium at a heat of over degrees only the top ten teams went through but it still meant nearly forty rounds for the crowd to watch the americans who had been led to believe that their team couldnt lose came back in anticipation of slaughter bored now by foreign rounds screaming and hysterically cheering on their own riders their chauvinism was equaled only by billys in the commentary box hes a nice guy he deserves it he said when ludwig went clear dashing british hopes but he was unashamedly delighted when mary jo put in an unexpected twelve faults and lizzie dean hit two fences and put in a stop and the early french and swiss riders knocked up cricket scores ivor came in so elated by his first round success that he knocked up only eight faults marvelous said billy thats really marvelous now with all the second riders gone great britains edged up to third place and the germans are moving right up behind the americans as it became apparent that a duel to the death was setting in people ran in from the halls and the stands filled up to bursting i must have another shot said rupert you cant risk it said the doctor carol kennedy went clear again once again fen had to follow him the americans are on thirtyone we are on thirty malise told her fens nerves were in tatters last time theyd had so little to lose now they were in with a chance if hardy started kicking out fences all was lost kiss me hardy eer i die of fright she said in england they were televising only the second round of the competition dino checked the video for the hundredth time to see if there was enough tape for fens round tory darling he called into the bedroom fens about to jump i think you ought to come and see it he could hardly bear to watch her she looked so small and defenseless as she rode into the ring he had seen rupert patting her hand and giving her encouragement the bastard looked so impossibly handsome and with his dislocated shoulder a more romantic figure than ever and even worse billy lloydfoxe was doing the commentary what the hell was he doing in america and here comes fenella maxwell riding her second round for great britain said billy only nineteen and easily our most brilliant and beautiful girl rider and voted sports personality of the year in come on now fen darling oh shut up billy howled janey and dino from different parts of england please dont cheer fen prayed to the crowd as hardy plunged all over the place please dont distract him let us get around concentrate hardy my darling suddenly hardy decided to behave jumping over the fences as though they were fallen logs in the wood i want to go clear oh please let me go clear prayed fen getting excited but hardy took such an unexpectedly huge jump over the wall that it didnt give him enough run into the water and he landed well in with a splash fen felt her face covered with tepid water hardy was drenched he loathed getting wet he lashed his tail ears flattened thats done it groaned rupert hell never clear the upright hes come in too close determined to prove rupert wrong hardy did an incredible cat jump up and up he went as if he was climbing a ladder then with a merry flick of his back feet he was over dino put his arm around tory go on fen yelled darklis dont look round screamed isa daddyll murder you he stopped remembering and looked in embarrassed apology at his mother i mean for goodness sake hurry fen thundered down to the last triple she was over hooray yelled billy stamping his feet in the commentary box the applause was so defeaning fen didnt realize shed got a time fault once again everyone got out their calculators that puts us on thirtyfive very much in contention said malise the germans are on thirtyfour the americans on thirty but we cant afford any complacency the italians are on thirtynine with piero fratinelli to come rupert was seriously worried the morphine wasnt having the desired effect this time he hardly warmed up rocky at all every stride was agony there was no point risking a fall and finishing himself off altogether over a practice fence he sat in the tackroom on an upturned bucket with his head in his hands he darent go near the first aid post in case they stopped him riding you going to be able to make it said the doctor sure said rupert but i hope they bloody hurry hans schmidt had eight faults thats good for us billy was saying in the commentary box then blighting everyones hopes piero fratinelli came in and jumped clear for italy thats not at all good for us sighed billy good round though he grinned across at fen who was biting her nails in the riders stand and mopped his brow in came peter colegate whod replaced dino the american crowd was in a state of hysteria all across the stands us flags were being waved in encouragement as the big striding bay thoroughbred whod won several races in his youth ate up the course i dont fancy anyones chances against him if theres a jumpoff said billy the thoroughbreds racetrack origins were his undoing however picking up the tension from his rider hearing the hysterical yelling of the crowd he was reminded of his youth and thundering towards the final fences he cleared the pink wall with ease then accelerated and flattened both parts of the double and hearing the howl and groan of the crowd only just scraped over the last massive triple hooray said billy from the commentary box thats absolutely marvelous for us but admittedly not great for the americans carol kennedy turned to fen shaking his head our mutual friend would have gone clear whats the score fen asked malise italians forty americans thirtyeight germans fortythree they looked at each other for a minute that means if rupert goes clear we get the gold four faults we get the silver eight faults well have to jump off which will be too much for rupert rupert rode into the ring and here comes rupert campbellblack on popstar said dudley he has a dislocated shoulder which was put back yesterday the suspense is absolutely killing but i think we are about to witness a great display of courage courage is a quality the campbellblacks have never lacked said billy one of ruperts ancestors was on the kings side during the civil war and even though he was tortured by roundheads he never squealed all the vengeful heat of the sun seemed to be concentrated on ruperts black velvet hat the colored poles and the flower arrangements swam before his eyes the officials in their coral blazers seemed to be dancing the derby rising and falling by itself the red and blue boat sailing away the pain was excruciating now if rocky played up he was doomed somehow he removed his hat but as rocky sidled away it took hours to get it back on again where the hell was the first fence for a panicstricken moment he couldnt remember he looked up at the sea of faces curiously still for once the peaks of their caps like a million beaks he had a terrifying hallucination they were going to swoop down and peck him to death everything went black he swayed then forced himself to look down at rockys blond plaits his good hand was shaking violently like a wanking schoolboy the thought made him laugh thank god there was the first fence he kicked rocky into a canter and there goes rupert said billy in a voice that was not quite steady all our hopes go with him rocky aware that his master was wildly untogether jumped the first fence wrong rapping it really hard jarring ruperts shoulder appallingly to a man the crowd winced the next jump was almost as unhappy rupert lost a stirrup his balance all awry then he jabbed rockys mouth over the sailboat and the horse pecked on landing god that must hurt moaned billy coming up to the derby rupert found his iron and somehow managed to stay on oughtnt he to retire said fen in anguish it must be killing him suddenly with a relentless surge of courage rupert cleared the gate and turned to the water riding at it like a man possessed clearing it by two feet the crowd roared in ecstasy and then in apprehension rupert was beginning to do a bit too well suddenly an american victory was in jeopardy now he was turning towards the big combination three vast brickred fences with their clashing bright green pools of ferns he left the first element to rocky who jumped it big leaving him too close to the second element with a brilliant shift in the saddle rupert swung rocky to the right so he had more room and could get in an extra stride before clearing it then swung him back again so he had the same extra diagonal rocky clouted the final pole which was almost indistinguishable from the greenery filling the jump but it stayed put the crowd burst into a spontaneous yell of applause the gods who live forever muttered malise to himself are on our side today that was the most glorious piece of riding said billy oh come on rupe i cant bear to look anymore you take over dudley there were only three fences between britain and a medal and because of this they all seemed higher than the grandstand rocky was jumping majestically but rupert realized he must speed up he couldnt afford time faults through a haze of pain the three fences receded and came towards him hed never judge the distances he couldnt really gallop on with only one hand he can either go carefully and risk time faults or risk knocking them down said billy knowing rupe i bet he chooses the latter rupert did he came thundering down to the first fence oh steady said malise in anguish too fast gasped fen oh god help him rupert was over the first fence meeting it absolutely perfectly well have to jump off for the bronze shouted billy excitedly rupert was somehow over the two treacherous uprights of the double weve got the silver yelled billy come on rupe come on rocky gathered himself together took a mighty leap and sailed through the air over the triple and into the history books pandemonium broke out in the commentary box billy was hugging dudley both yelling at once dizzy burst into tears im awfully sorry maam said fen realizing she was hugging princess anne suddenly she heard a hoarse strangulated sound behind her it was ivor cheering like an old mule we got the gold screamed fen jumping up and down we got the gold as rupert rode out of the arena at a walk the whole stadium rose to their feet to applaud him the cheers went on for a full five minutes naturally disappointed the home team hadnt made it the crowd were prepared to honor such a display of courage rupert rode up to malise his face was expressionless what price fairies now he said malise grinned up at him on the day my fairies came good bloody marvelous then surprised at ruperts lack of excitement you went clear you know weve got the gold rupert shook his head a loudspeaker confirmed his victory he stayed absolutely calm he didnt smile or give rocky great slaps of joy on the neck which was his normal practice his hand didnt even tremble he slid off the horse gave him a quick pat and leant his head for a second against the redgold satin neck everyone swarmed round him cheering and yelling great rupe terrific you showed them rupert broke away from them and stumbled towards the tunnel everyone followed him cheering malise fought his way back to ruperts side leave him alone he snarled at the pack suddenly losing his temper cant you understand the strain hes been under its all right he said gently to rupert rupert turned his eyes streaming a moron a schoolgirl and a cuckold he said we took on the whole bloody world and beat them said malise halfway down the tunnel rupert slumped against the wall shutting his eyes battling to stop the tears im sorry he mumbled been a bit of a strain the last few days too much dope not much sleep oh christ look said malise patting ruperts good shoulder over the years ive seldom seen eye to eye with you but i have to hand it to you today without doubt you produced the finest and bravest display of riding ive ever seen you made the other riders look like gymkhana kids no one in that stadium or watching it on television will ever forget it rupert sniffed and wiped away the tears with the back of his hand think jake wouldve beaten me my dear boy today no one could have beaten you rupert stretched out his good hand and grabbed malises arm ive always given you a hard time he said shakily but i guess youre the best too odd thought malise how the moments of greatest happiness come from the people you least expect suddenly rupert brightened perceptibly i put a monkey on our winning he said i must have made a fortune chestnut dappled gray and dark bay they walked proudly into the arena ears pricked eyes bright knowing they were the best in the world on their backs rode rupert and ivor in their red coats with fen in black in the center and realizing once again they were riding one man short the magnanimous crowd cheered them to the top of the stadium everywhere union jacks seemed to be waving and straight against that great array forth went the dauntless three thought malisespan mummy said georgina hamilton in scotland you really must allow me to meet rupert i mean he may be old and frightfully wicked but he is phenomenally attractive and they always say its best to start with an older man tabitha whod been allowed to stay up bounced on amandas knee daddy jump she said daddy jump well he did indeed darling said amanda she turned to rollo trying to keep her elation within bounds if that doesnt get rupert a safe seat nothing will he is stunning said georgina oh promise youll introduce me its a good thing thought amanda that georgina is going back to boarding school next week want mummy when will i see mummy said marcus for the hundredth time that day im so proud of her said tory she rode so wonderfully well its so awful that such a marvelous victory should be blighted by the other thing jakey must be heartbroken not to be part of it he couldnt come back into that said dino i guess he didnt want to rock any more boats if hes coming back i figure itll be later malise followed them with his military walk marching on air the crowd once again gave an extra cheer in appreciation of dizzy and sarah in their union jack shorts as she stood on the highest middle step of the podium fen was still smaller than carol kennedy dino will be very proud of you he said kissing her youd have pulled it off if he hadnt dropped out said fen carol shrugged youd have pulled it off more easily if youd had jake we might not have said fen we were more of a team than ever before the presidents wife came forward in a pale blue dress and fen bowed her head as the pink blue and green ribbon was hung round her neck as though it were in braille she put her hand up to touch the gold tracing the lady with her sheaf of corn on one side the athlete borne aloft on the other we got a gold she said incredulously team golds the best said rupert they watched the british flag slide up the white pole a breath of wind stretched it out never had the national anthem sounded so beautiful god save began fen then found she couldnt go on tears splashed onto her high cheekbones rupert put his hand on her shoulder squeezing it reassuringly when the music stopped she turned back to him burying her face in his shoulder what shall we do this evening he said you ought to go to bed said fen how about a really marvelous fuck said rupert fen burst out laughing ive always wanted you said rupert kissing her hey lay off howled dino hurling a cushion at the television set lucky thing said georgina hamilton shes very attractive mind you i expect shell console him now helens pushed off amanda hamilton was surprised how much she minded that embrace she knew it was victory euphoria but fen really was very pretty amanda caught a glimpse of herself in the mirror and pulled in her tummy shed been eating too much porridge and must go on a diet before rupert got back ive seen a lot of things malise told prince philip wiping away a tear as the riders galloped round the arena their rosettes streaming like colored meteors when i went all through the war but this is the greatest experience of my life makes you very proud to be british that was a staggering piece of riding by rupert campbellblack said prince philip jake lovell in a scruffy motel near kennedy airport and rapidly running out of money decided not to have another cigarette as he had only half a packet left with helen in his arms he lay in bed watching television hardy was your horse sobbed helen you ought to have been up there getting a gold too im on the winners rostrum already ive got you said jake but his heart was like lead helen must never realize the colossal sacrifice he had made or shed never forgive herself dino tucked tory up in bed making sure that she took both her sleeping pills her apathy worried him he felt it would be healthier if she raged against helen and jake then he put the children to bed darklis was so overexcited she wanted a story every time dino tried to skip or missed a word because he was tired she corrected him he found isa in floods of tears why had his father gone off with helen why was the paper calling him a traitor and a deserter what did treachery mean who would look after his mother now was it something that he isa had done dino comforted him as best he could he didnt really know the answer to any of those questions either but he knew jake going off had nothing to do with isa and he was sure that once the games were over jake would want to see him and darklis again at last isa fell asleep it was two oclock in the morning the mill house seemed bitterly cold after america dino supposed it was the changeover from summer to fall now jet lag was catching up with him and he felt absolutely shattered for the hundredth time he asked himself if hed been insane to indulge in this quixotic gesture of rushing off to europe to look after tory he had avoided going into fens room because he was missing her so appallingly now desperate for reassurance he pushed open the door breathing in the faint trace of her perfume and the mustiness of damp and dust and lack of use all the china horses on the shelves and the teddy bears that used to fill up the entire windowseat had been put away perhaps that was his fault for telling her during that terrible row she ought to grow up hed liked the room better as it was before except for the photograph of billy lloydfoxe which had been removed feeling he shouldnt be snooping he opened the top drawer of the chest and found a small pile of newspaper cuttings and photographs held together by a pink plastic paper clip they were all of himself making him feel slightly better all the same hed been mad to leave her with rupert and billy he went back into the sitting room and opened a bottle of wine he felt shattered but not really sleepy his time clock was still up the creek turning on the television he stretched out on the sofa they were now showing the press conference everyone cheered and whooped as malise and the british team filed in there was a tremendous popping of champagne corks rupert who sat next to fen with his good arm along the back of her chair in a vaguely proprietorial way did most of the talking he looked great the earlier tears might never have occurred he must have lost another half a stone since helen left him but it merely made his arrogant slightly depraved face more finely planed than ever now none of us want to talk about my wife or fens brotherinlaw so no questions about that he said i think we proved that we can win medals without the others ivor had the most difficult task as the pathfinder he jumped quite brilliantly fen had to jump on a different horse and he can be a sod i promise you hes much too strong for her but she kept him sweet and id like to remind you that shes only just nineteen and jumping in her first olympic competition fen blushed as a huge cheer went round the room im incredibly proud of them said malise i think today they all moved up a gear and that people will talk about ruperts legendary second round as long as show jumping lasts and it wasnt just us either said fen holding out her glass for more champagne as the cheers subsided it was malise who kept us all calm when we looked like going to pieces and dizzy and sarah our grooms and poor griselda whos in hospital and our families whove had to put up with us being offish and totally selfobsessed for the last monthalso she added defiantly theres my brotherinlaw jake lovell somebody booed then everybody followed suit stamping their feet shouting out out out no shut up said fen furiously he taught me everything i know and he made hardy the horse he is hardy who got a silver and a gold so we ought to thank him and give him credit as well particularly drawled rupert for taking my wife off my hands for a second there was an embarrassed pause then everyone roared with laughter rupert seized the champagne bottle filling up his glass in fact the toast definitely isnt absent friends we like the people who stuck by us dont we angel he stroked the back of fens neck there wasnt a reporter in the room who didnt respond to his magnetism we noticed you had fen in a clinch on the podium said the man from the daily mail who can blame me said rupert insolently fen looked wary our horses are good friends she said what about you two said the man from the daily mirror this is quite unnecessary snapped malise they came here to discuss the gold medal the man from the mirror ignored him might be nice if you consoled rupert he said no it would not said fen furiously im going to marry dino ferranti then she clapped her hands over her mouth in horror dino knew that where rupert was concerned fen was unfinished business he trusted fen but for the last three hours he had been through all the agonizing jealousy of a man deeply in love yippee he shouted yippee then exactly on cue he heard the bells pealing out in the village he opened the window it was a clear starlit night orion was climbing out of bed on the horizon pulling on his boots not a breath of wind ruffled the curtains the peal of the bells must be carrying miles down the valley his darling darling fen had won the gold the village hadnt known what to do they had been shellshocked by jake walking out now they had another heroic exploit to celebrate they could carry on with their welcome home celebrations not many villages in england could boast a silver and a gold tory woken by dinos shout of joy pulled the blankets and pillows over her head to blot out the sound of the bells remembering in anguish how they had rung out for jake only six nights ago oh god please please bring him back as the telephone rang she experienced a frantic surge of hope then the black black despair overwhelmed her again as she heard dino say fen darling you were fantastic a bloody miracle i never figured id want another country to beat america but you were just great great great dino said fen in a small voice ive got something to tell you i didnt mean to force your hand but they goaded me about rupert at the press conference and i told them i was going to marry you i know said dino best program ive ever seen you saw it said fen in amazement i taped it so you cant change your mind means we wont have to put an announcement in the new york times either fen giggled oh you are lovely i didnt want to trap you baby how many times do i have to tell you look are you coming home tomorrow ive got the most godawful withdrawal symptoms oh yes said fen i cant bear another minute away from you and when you get back im going to frogmarch you into the nearest registrars office and marry you what the bloody hells billy doing out there were you jealous insanely thats why i want you home i dont trust either of those bastards for a few minutes they talked nonsense have you said anything to tory about us no not really i guess she knows shes not in very good shape tory who had been listening at the top of the stairs desperate for some crumb of comfort some tiny piece of news about jake slunk back to bed only when dino had checked that she was asleep did she give way to tears autumn came bringing huge red suns and frosty mornings and clogging the millstream with yellow leaves tory carried on as though there was a key in her back there were no money problems fen came back from la to a heroines welcome she and dino carried on taking the horses to shows and trying to keep their delirious happiness within bounds at least when they were with tory the children particularly isa were at first bewildered even distraught by jakes disappearance but soon got involved in a new term where they were both the object of increased sympathy and interest dino whom they both adored was back and fen and he infected the children with their happiness and took them out a lot to give tory a break to tory they seemed like four children or very young parents with two kids she was glad dino and fen had finally got it together but it didnt ease her own despair tory normally loved autumn best of all chopping logs for huge fires making chutney jam and elderberry wine loading up the deep freeze with vegetables and apple pies but this year there seemed to be a glut of everything too many green tomatoes too many apples thudding from the trees she tried to pick them and gave up she was always cold always shivering she covered herself up with three or four jerseys so that no one should realize how much weight she had lost or that she wasnt eating alone in the house she spent her time crying then crept into bed at night to clutch an equally shivering wolf who missed jake as much as she did malise came down to offer comfort but was daunted by her grief his own sadness that helen had run off he kept to himself to buck tory up dino and fen tried to persuade her to go to wembley but she couldnt face the prying eyes or the memories billy lloydfoxe had a brilliant week and won the victor ludorum every night ivor braine fen and rupert with his arm in a sling appeared at the end of the personality parade and brought the house down as they displayed their gold medals otherwise rupert was off the circuit for two months the doctor in la had in fact trapped a nerve when he put ruperts shoulder back an operation was needed to sort it out that rupert had been brave enough to carry on jumping despite such excruciating pain only enhanced his almost magical prestige the press reported his increased interest in politics he was tipped to take over a safe seat in gloucestershire the press were also wildly interested in jake keeping a watch on all the airports and continually ringing the mill house in case there was news of him but there was none he simply hadnt got in touch heaven only knew what he and helen were living on then in the middle of october the press caught jake and helen arriving at heathrow both wearing dark glasses neither would say a word to anyone and somehow as elusive as his gypsy forebears jake managed to shake off a pack of reporters and vanish but not for long the presss blood was up and within a few days they had hunted them down staying near gloucester with a horsedealing friend of jakes again he and helen refused to talk despite the astronomical sums of money which were offered for their story and two days later blazoned across every paper were pictures of jake again in dark glasses applying for the dole at gloucester labor exchange the fact that jake was so near yet still hadnt contacted tory was for dino the final straw he saw how tory was being crucified he was all for driving over to gloucester and beating the hell out of jake but fen managed to restrain him you cant make him come back if he doesnt want to tory would hate that more than anything once back in england when he wasnt dodging the press jake made heroic efforts to get work but found every door shut there was no point in ringing garfield boyson as he hadnt kept his nose clean but he rang all the other sponsors whod been pursuing him before the games they all gave him an earful or hung up he buried his pride and applied for jobs running riding schools or working as a stud groom a few people saw him out of curiosity before rejecting him no one wanted a fallen idol horse and hound had announced that the inquiry into his defection at the olympic games would be held at the bsja headquarters in november jake was expected to turn up and defend himself if he didnt the general consensus of opinion was that hed be suspended for at least ten years if not for life jake could have handled all that if he and helen had been happy but as the days passed he began to realize the full extent of her neurosis and egoism even if he did get a job her insecurity was such that she couldnt bear him out of her sight for an instant before the games all they had really talked about was their love for one another and the situation like a prisoner of war helen had dreamed of escape now having escaped she found she was living in some bleak gray eastern european zone by running off she and jake had deprived themselves of everything except each other claustrophobically thrown on their own resources they found they had nothing in common helen longed for her beautiful house and garden her children particularly marcus her checkbook and her status as ruperts wife rupert blocked her application to see the children so she would have to go to court and as they had no money that would mean applying for legal aid horses had been jakes life deprived of them he was like a junkie without a fix he missed the mill house the children wolf but most of all he found he missed tory and yet some strange pride stopped him getting in touch he was convinced they were all managing perfectly without him it would look as though he was slinking back only because hed run out of money and couldnt cope he also realized the enormity of his crime towards her and towards his country and was too ashamed to show his face above all hed given helen the handkerchief he must stick by the rules he never blamed her once for forcing his hand but he retreated inside himself knowing he was miserable she became obsessively jealous of tory the good wife who never made a fuss why the hell couldnt jake bitch about her occasionally but jake realized now that tory had loved him for himself helen only loved the new infinitely desirable image of herself which his love had created and which must be preserved at all costs feeling that the horse dealer whod put them up shouldnt be subjected to such a bombardment from the press helen and jake moved into a bedsitter in gloucester but they were absolutely skint the social security office came up with one reason after another why they shouldnt give jake any money he sold his cuff links and some of helens jewelry soon the only thing left would be his silver medal and all the time fleet street was tempting him offering more than a quarter of a million pounds for their story jake was accustomed to being poor helen was not she tried to economize but she was used to going to the hairdressers at least twice a week and never having a run in her tights and paying for a pot of face cream if she paid any less she was convinced jake would go off her having run away in los angeles with only summer clothes she was desperate to buy winter ones and thought wistfully of her furs in the wardrobe at penscombe the last monday in october began badly for tory she got up and took the children to school only realizing when she got there and found the doors locked that it was halfterm later making her bed she retrieved her hot water bottle from the bottom and unscrewing it found herself solemnly emptying it into her jersey drawer in the middle of the morning dino found her in floods of tears turning out the contents of the vacuum cleaner in the sitting room because shed hoovered up a moth by mistake the poor little thing was alive she sobbed scrabbling frantically through the dust i cant find it anywhere dino cleared up the mess then sat her down angel youre very very tired fen and i have got to go up to london for this program they were doing billy lloydfoxe on this is your life that evening were going to take the kids to get them out of your hair for twentyfour hours theyll enjoy seeing the inside of a studio hannah will be here to keep an eye on you sarahll be back first thing tomorrow morning so you dont have to worry about the horses tomorrow when we get back i am taking you to the doctor im all right protested tory but the childrens wild delight at the prospect of a jaunt only depressed her more theyre bored by me she thought miserably im no fun anymore you do promise to look after her dont you said fen to hannah as they left after theyd gone tory tried to pull herself together and get down to making green tomato chutney but as she was chopping the onions she remembered it had been jakes favorite and how he used to eat it neat out of the jar with a spoon which made her cry again she started as the doorbell rang why did she still harbor some inside hope that it might be jake but it was her mother in a new burgundy suit looking very chic despite a burgundy face from the car heater im not crying lied tory wiping her hands on her skirt no i can smell youre not said molly backing off slightly were on our way to stay with some of bernards dreary relations i left him in the car as though he was a smelly old labrador behind a grille thought tory doesnt he want to come in no we wont be able to gossip would you like a cup of coffee molly looked pointedly at her watch i would have thought it was more like sherry time as tory poured her a glass molly said how pleased she was about fen and dino tory returned to chopping onions seems a nice chap molly went on very goodlooking and very rich you should have married someone like that in the first place now i want to have a serious talk with you tory gritted her teeth what are you going to do about your future said molly fen and dino wont want to stay here forever with you and the children theyll need a place of their own perhaps theyll go back to america tory looked up in horror dyou think so i know so of course theyre too nice to say anything but you cant hold them back forever tory said nothing but chopped one piece of onion to pulp and when are you going to divorce jake i mean hes deserted you so you shouldnt have any difficulty his father did the same thing to his mother like father like son i suppose please mummy dont torys voice broke i cant bear it cant think why you mind so much said molly you always knew he never loved you only married you for your money what dyou expect tory looked down at the sink tidy it was a disgusting mess of bacon rinds spaghetti hoops rusty brillo pads and old tea bags like me she thought im as useless as an old tea bag lets be positive molly was going on im pleased to see youve lost a lot of weight you may be looking quite frightful but at least youve got a waist and even ankles now but you really shouldnt have let yourself go like that cant blame jake pushing off really you never tried to hold him however bernard and i have a plan were going to send you to a health farm for a week theres a special offer for one in harpers this month no i wont take no for an answer weve filled in the form and sent it off you can have it as an early christmas present tory was obviously not going to offer her another glass of sherry so molly helped herself she wondered if the child was quite right in the head at the moment cheer up she said youre only twentyeight if you smarten yourself up you might easily get another man one of your own class this time after her mother had gone tory sat down and cried and cried wolf sat at her feet raking her knee with his paw licking her face desperately trying to comfort her eventually she responded to his sympathy she had to go up to the village to buy brown sugar for the chutney and afterwards shed take him for a walk she couldnt be bothered with lunch as she got her coat and purse the telephone rang but it was for hannah who took it in the tackroom going out into the yard tory met hannah standing on one leg her boyfriend she explained had got tickets for the rolling stones concert that night of course she must go said tory if hannah gave the horses their final feed tory would check them last thing to see everything was all right are you sure youll be okay said hannah ill be fine tory reassured her itll be rather peaceful to have the house to myself she didnt need a lead for wolf anymore since jake had gone he never left her heels waiting outside the village shop for her with an anxious expression on his pointed brindle face as she came out of the bakers the low afternoon sun shone directly into her eyes suddenly she gave a gasp of excitement across the road a blackhaired man was watching them then she felt a desperate thud of disappointment it was very like him but it was not jake wolf however gave a bark of joyful recognition and shot across the road into the path of an oncoming lorry the passersby watching in horror couldnt be sure if it was the dog or the girl crouched over him who was screaming everyone was very kind they recognized poor mrs lovell a man offered her a lift to the vet but wolf died on the way he licked torys hand and gave a last thump of his shepherds crook tail as if to apologize for deserting her too and his head fell back the vet drove tory home and dug a grave for wolf beside sailor and various of the childrens guinea pigs and hamsters and buried him in his blanket with his old shoe he didnt like what he saw tory was shivering uncontrollably there was no color in her cheeks her clothes hung off her she insisted on making him a cup of tea but forgot to put any tea in the pot and didnt even notice that shed handed him just hot water and milk it was jakes dog she kept saying i should have had him on a lead now youre not going to be by yourself asked the vet no no the othersll be back soon hannah going off at dusk her thoughts full of her boyfriend and the rolling stones wondered if she ought to ring dino and fen in london tory was just sitting at the kitchen table twisting a dryingup cloth gazing unseeingly at a mountain of chopped onions honestly im perfectly okay she said sarahll be back first thing and ive got an awful lot of chutney to make at nine oclock tory checked the horses they were all dozing or lying down she gave macaulay an apple and a cuddle and then shut all the top doors then she took a flashlight and looked at wolfs grave youre lucky she said you wont miss him anymore life without jake she reflected wasnt worth a farthing a far thing nothing could be further away now than he was she was useless as a mother no good as a human being if she wasnt there jake could come home with helen when dino and fen went to america and take over the yard the note took her hours to write her mind was working so slowly she screwed up several drafts and chucked them in the bin in the top of jakes chest of drawers in the bedroom under the lining paper she found the key to the poison cupboard back in the tackroom she had to stand on a chair to open it what a choice awaited her like jake asking her what she wanted to drink the first time hed taken her to a pub there was henbane used by dr crippen and hemlock water dropwort which jake often used as a poultice for horses with sore backs deadly poison it was but it also paralyzed you leaving your mind clear to the end she couldnt cope with that then there was deadly nightshade or belladonna as it was called a more appropriate name for helen than herself jake had once told her that there was enough poison in that bottle to kill off a dozen campbellblacks with all their phenomenal strength it should be enough for her she took down the bottle next morning jake walked towards the social security office to have another crack at getting some dole it was totally against his nature hustling or wheedling for money but things were getting desperate a conker fell at his feet automatically he picked it up and was about to put it in his pocket for isa then he realized there was no point and savagely hurled it across the car park hello jake said a voice wary of rejection he turned frowning but it was tanya his old groom now married and wheeling a baby in a carriage jake knelt down to admire the child picking up his little hands tickling his ribs to make him laugh hed always been sweet with kids thought tanya he must miss his own terribly his swarthy face gray his eyes deeply shadowed the cotton jacket and jeans were far too thin for a bitter cold morning hes beautiful he said reluctantly getting to his feet im sorry about wolf she said what about him said jake suddenly tense oh god perhaps i shouldnt have told you hannah rang me he was run over yesterday afternoon an hour later jake got back to the bedsit to find helen painting her nails and not in a good mood she had just read in the daily mail that her husband had joined the tory party and was expecting to be given a safe seat at any minute tory helen reflected bitterly was not her favorite word at the moment she thought so even less when she saw jakes face whats the matter she asked in alarm ive got to go home she winced at the word theres been an accident oh god not one of the kids no wolf wolf is that a horse no the dog he was run over yesterday a dog said helen incredulously a dog youre going back just for that i could appreciate it if it was a child wolf was like a child to tory and to me he wanted to add helen looked at him in bewilderment it was all part of this hideous conspiracy between the english and their animals i simply dont get it she said you refuse to go back when malise appeals to you over and over again to jump for your country then you scuttle home because some goddam dogs been run over i just dont understand you there was a pause how long will you be she asked i suppose youll want the car jake looked at his watch ill be back in time for you to go to the hairdressers if i get delayed take a taxi we cant afford it and ive got to pay the hairdressers jake pulled a huge wad of tenners out of his pocket did you rob a bank asked helen in amazement jake shook his head i flogged my silver oh jake she wailed how could you it was the one thing we had to cling on to your one link with immortality weve scrimped and saved so much so that you could keep it he gave her eight hundred and fifty poundsnow you can buy some winter clothesand kept a hundred and fifty for himself with it he went to his friend harry who bred lurchers and bought a puppy a tiny replica of wolf with a brindle fluffy coat a nose like an anteater and huge anxious eyes by the time he drove over the bridge at withrington the puppy had been sick five times as he gently lifted the little creature out of the car she was sick again all over jakes coat jake hardly noticed unsure of his reception his heart was thumping his throat dry the yard seemed curiously deserted except for the stable cat who arched his back at the puppy and the horses particularly macaulay who nearly broke down their halfdoors with delight at seeing their master again the back door was open but there was no one in the house as jake washed the vomit off he was tempted to go upstairs and get a sweater but helen would do her nut if he came back wearing something different his heart was still thumping when the telephone rang and he automatically picked it up he had great difficulty in even saying hello dino said a voice this is malise im desperately sorry just wondered if there was any more news of tory what about tory snapped jake whos that jake what the hell are you doing there what about tory said jake on a rising note of fear she tried to commit suicide last night must have been a mistake im afraid not said malise losing his temper she took a massive overdose of one of your bloody poisons she wasnt expecting anyone back till this morning dino and fen got worried came back and found her last night oh my god whispered jake is she is she malise realized hed been too harsh im afraid shes dying jake where is she the great warwickshire jake took fens car because it was faster it had never been driven so fast in its life the poor puppy rattled back and forth in the back like a shuttle the hospital steps were swarming with press hello gyppo shown up at last have you shouted the daily mail about bloody time you come to pay for the funeral asked the sun fuck off snarled jake mrs lovell was in intensive care on the second floor said the receptionist giving jake a strange look you cant bring that puppy in here but jake was off limping across the polished floor pulling the heavy gates of the lift with one hand holding the puppy with the other on the way up it licked jakes face oh please god he prayed frantically dont let her die as he walked down the passage a voice said what the hell are you doing here it was dino towering over him barring his way like the archangel michael with the flaming sword for a second jake thought dino was going to smash his face in knocking him flying back into a trolley of instruments jake stood his ground i want to see tory well you bloody cant shes in a coma and fading fast and its all your bloody fault you bastard you and your lousy poisons my god you wouldnt treat a horse or even a dog the way you treated her leaving her without a fucking word never getting in touch letting her just pine away for two minutes dino carried on in the same vein calling jake every name under the sun his eloquence was fueled by misery and guilt that he and fen had left tory on her own not appreciating how desperate she was jake let him finish everything you say is true he said hearing the din a nurse came out of torys room if youd like to come in mr ferranti jake stepped forward im her husband ive got to see her but at that moment fen came out fighting back the tears and went straight into dinos arms look whos just turned up said dino bitterly fen spun around jake where the hell have you been she gave a sob youre too bloody late thats all shes dying she was just conscious when we got to her but shes got no will to live not waiting to hear any more jake pushed past them and into the room at first he thought he was hallucinating for there on the bed was fen then he realized it was tory shed lost so much weight since hed seen her her face still flushed from the belladonna gave an illusion of health long lashes swept her hollowed cheeks all jake could think was how beautiful she looked he sat down beside the bed taking her hand it felt so small and bony now almost like helens oh christ how could he have done this to her it was he whod killed her not the poison the doctor came in and decided to overlook the sleeping puppy curled up on jakes knee this was really no time to worry about hygiene cant you do anything asked jake in desperation the doctor shook his head weve done all we can she took a massive overdose enough to kill four people luckily we caught it very early but im surprised shes lasted this long we washed out her stomach of course but shes got no resistance there was nothing in her stomach she cant have eaten for days im afraid theres very little hope shell ever regain consciousness im so sorry jake was frantically wracking his brain when he was living with the gypsies one of the girls had taken an overdose of belladonna after her lover had walked out the old gypsy grandmother had produced some antidote or emetic and saved her what the hell had she used but it was such a long time ago he must concentrate and try to remember did she leave a note he asked fen fen got it out of her jeans pocket it was addressed to you shes left you everything she knew horses were the only thing that mattered to you that you and helen could only come back if she was out of the way but jake was reading the note she loved you said fen bitterly isa darklis me the horses wolf were only extensions of how much she loved you she knew you didnt love her but she felt you needed her that she made life easier that was enough oh christ jake groaned putting his head in his hands i only realized in la how much i loved her then helen spilled the beans to rupert i couldnt let her down i was frightened at what rupert would do to her id got myself into such a stupid fucking corner you could have got in touch said fen bleakly nothing not a word to anyone since you walked out i didnt know what to say id treated her so horrendously i felt so guilty and besides id given helen the handkerchief fen lost her temper what about the handkerchief you once gave tory she hissed you conveniently forgot about that when it suited you didnt you so much for your bloody gypsy integrity tory was clutching it when we found her jake was stunned she always seemed so strong that she could cope with anything i didnt realize i meant so much to her he looked down at tory touching her cheek with a lurch of fear he realized her breathing was even fainter both he and fen jumped as dino came in youve been here long enough he said to jake making absolutely no attempt to conceal his contempt and loathing suddenly jake seemed roused out of his state of apathy shes my wife he snarled and i love her funny way of showing it said dino holding the door open for him tipping the puppy gently onto the floor jake stood up well they wont cure her in here what the hell are you doing taking her home shes dying godammit then she might as well die at home surrounded by people and the animals she loves pulling one of the thick gray blankets off the bed jake wrapped it around tory and picked her up she was so light now he could carry her easily the puppy already recognizing jake as her new master wagged her tail and trotted after him out of the room deaf to the protestations of doctors and nurses desperately trying to remember the name of that miracle cure of the old gypsy grandmother jake hardly seemed to recognize malise coming out of the lift where dyou think youre going said malise icily home what about helen helen jake wrinkled his brow it was as if malise were asking him whether hed turned off the tap in his cabin as the titanic sank under the waves yes helen said malise grimly holding the lift door shut blocking jakes path dragging his mind back jake gave malise the address in gloucester she doesnt know whats happened could you go to her explain to her look after her and say im sorry back at the mill house jake tucked tory up in the big double bed and lit a fire in the grate then he settled down in an armchair as near her as possible to pore over his ancient flower books and herbals frantically searching for a clue to the missing ingredient that might cure her late in the afternoon the children came home jake braced himself longing to see them but prepared for sullen antagonism even abuse he nearly wept at their incredulous joy that he was home again hurling themselves into his arms without a word of reproach isa was clearly demented with worry about his mother darklis was young enough to be distracted the puppy was a godsend and was soon taken over by both children what frightened jake was their touching faith that now he was back their mother would recover macaulay and hardy had been close to death numerous other horses dogs and members of the family had been ill and jake had cured them mummy definitely wont have to be put down now jake heard darklis telling dino but tory showed absolutely no sign of regaining consciousness gradually growing weaker and weaker jake hardly left her side not eating or sleeping his anguish was so obvious fen and even dino came to respect it leaving him on his own with tory they fended off the press keeping the children away if they became quarrelsome even though most of the time jake seemed to gain strength from their presence two more days crawled by doctors and specialists wheeled in by dino came and shook their heads they no longer suggested tory should go back into hospital there was nothing anyone could do jake refused to give up if only it had been high summer or even spring some of the plants he suspected might cure her might have been flowering or at least in leaf and identifiable anyway he was terrified to leave her too long in order to search in case she died when he wasnt there hour after hour he turned the pages with his right hand holding her hand with his left hoping against hope that she might return the pressure showing some sign of life and now it was midnight on the third day outside the foxes were barking the fire was dying in the grate torys breathing had almost stopped her heartbeat was so faint he kept thinking he had lost her she was deathly pale the belladonna flush had long since gone if only she could regain consciousness just for a second so she could die knowing how much he loved her in one last desperate hope he turned back to his most ancient flower book he was so exhausted and hed been reading small print for so long now that the words blurred before his eyes the only possibility had been the lesser spearwort but it was such a strong emetic it would finish tory off completely in her hopelessly weakened state it was no good he was powerless to save her frantic he took her in his arms trying to warm some life into the frail body he remembered how she had held africa for him when hed rushed off to be sick that first hot afternoon at the bilborough show never letting on she was scared stiff of horses he remembered how shed got tight and bought africa for him and how shed never complained at the long hours away had always welcomed him home delighting in every victory yet boosting his morale professing her faith in him whenever he lost believing she would always be there he had taken her for granted he knew she was going to be taken away from him at the end he had failed her again by not being able to remember that missing ingredient dont die he pleaded for the thousandth time please dont die laying her gently back on the pillow he noticed the fire was nearly out and got up to put on another log he hadnt even bothered to draw the curtains stiff from sitting so long he went to the window there were no stars the sky was already in mourning he couldnt bear it despairingly he pressed his forehead against the cold windowpane he had no idea how long he stood there jake came the faintest faintest whisper he swung around in terror drenched in sweat his heart pounding it must be her ghost come back to mock him jake she whispered again he was beside her in an instant seizing her hands willing her to speak is it really you she murmured really me you came back the words were so faint he had to bend close to catch them or have i gone to heaven must be hell he said unsteadily if you found me there please dont die i love you so much you need a shave she said drifting back into unconsciousness sick with terror jake had to wait cradling her in his arms frightened even to move hed asked only to be able to have time to tell her he loved her but now it wasnt enough and didnt make him feel any better he longed to call for fen and dino but panicstricken that she might die at any moment he knew he could only face it alone after a couple of hours she gave a little sigh shuddered and opened her eyes again im sorry i took all your belladonna i couldnt go on without you jake kissed her forehead i was the same i just didnt know how to come back please get better ill never survive unless you do im sorry about wolf i should have had him on a lead but he stuck so close since you since you her voice faltered i know i got you a puppy he picked the sleeping lurcher out of the basket and laid her beside tory on the bed placing torys hand on the fluffy narrow head the puppy gave a deep contented sigh licked the inside of torys wrist and snuggled back to sleep again tory smiled weakly hes lovely i didnt mean to blackmail you into coming back you didnt have to i didnt even know youd taken the belladonna until i turned up here with the puppy tanya told me about wolf being run over all i needed was an excuse to come back i never stopped missing you the whole time i was away please dont talk you must rest can i see your silver she said drowsily i flogged it to buy the puppy as he drew the blankets up around her the door opened softly it was fen jake put his finger to his lips shaking with sudden hope fen tiptoed towards the bed you were speaking to her twice did she make sense perfect oh my god is she going to be all right i dont know its too early to say together they gazed at the sleeping tory then fen put a hand on jakes shoulder you made her better she said softly for a second he glanced up his face soaked with tears i failed her he mumbled i tried and tried but i couldnt remember the missing ingredient you blind stupid idiot said fen very gently only you could have cured her dont you understand the missing ingredient was love epilogue the following afternoon rupert campbellblack passed his first interview with the birdlip and chalford constituency committee with flying colors there was only one sticky moment when deaf old lady oakridge who never read the papers asked rupert if he and his wife would be living in the constituency everyone held their breath in embarrassment my wife will certainly be living in the constituency said rupert emphatically good good glad to hear it said lady oakridge but not actually with me said rupert everyone except lady oakridge suppressed smiles better to have a wife she said i absolutely agree said rupert unfortunately mines only just pushed off so i havent had time to get another one fellows certainly got charm said lord oakridge after the meeting views are sound too said the brigadier think we should seriously consider him you did so well said amanda patting ruperts thigh as she drove him back to london its a cinch glad you think so privately rupert wondered how much he would enjoy listening to his constituents grumbling about oneway streets and their rows with their neighbors being off the circuit for two months had made him realize how desperately he missed show jumping with any luck he should be back for olympia oh damn said amanda as they drew up at her house in rutland gate conceptiones left the drawing room light on shes getting awfully slack hope it isnt rollo rollos in paris said amanda opening the front door anyway he knows im driving you around georgina she cried in outraged tones as she went into the drawing room what on earth are you doing here the rest of the forms gone to the old vic i couldnt face it i thought it would be more fun to come and see you said georgina hello she turned to rupert mummys never allowed us to meet oh christ thought rupert helplessly for there in school uniform exuding lascivious innocence was a replica of amanda just as beautiful but twentyfive years younger no he told himself firmly it simply wouldnt do now he was almost a prospective tory candidate hed got to behave himself although heaven knows they all seemed to be at it what was the play he heard himself saying in an abnormally avuncular voice alls well that ends well said georgina smiling dreamily i hear youre going into politics not sure ill be very good confessed rupert the only babies i like kissing are female and over fifteen oh brill said georgina i was sixteen last week billy lloydfoxe just back from amsterdam watched his beautiful wife feeding his beautiful son with enormous pride and decided against pouring himself another glass of whisky he was just getting over the glow of being on this is your life so many people had emerged from his past and said such amazingly nice things i heard the most riveting bit of gossip today said janey what was it well tracey told me she heard it from dizzy who heard it from sarah who heard it from bridie whos just got this tremendously intellectual boyfriend who actually takes her to the opera poor bridie had to sit through parsifal the other night said she nearly died of boredom oh get on with it said billy grinning janeys eyes gleamed ill give you three guesses who she saw in the stalls together looking radiant and not at all bored you know i can never guess anything malise and helen good god said billy astounded isnt helen rather too old for him i would have thought so said janey and monica carlton will certainly call malise out tory was getting better by the minute but jake terrified that she might still elude him hardly left her alone for a second from the way he bullies her into resting and polices her every mouthful youd think she was macaulay grumbled fen but she was so happy for them both as the doctor said it was little short of a miracle a few days later however when tory was definitely out of danger jake was persuaded downstairs to see garfield boyson well lad said boyson well said jake youve made a right cockup of your career havent you i dont need anyone else to tell me i gather youve been to see every other sponsor touting for business didnt come to me not much faith have you i said id keep my side of the bargain if you kept yours and you did you got your medal im still ready to back you the bsja are going to suspend me happens they wont under the circs you may get off with a hefty fine im not interested said jake im not going back on the circuit im going to train instead i dont want to leave tory or the children anymore and dino and fen are going back to the states looking out of the kitchen window he saw fen ride into the yard and collapse off macaulay and into dinos arms he wouldnt have believed it was possible for anyone to go on kissing for so long boyson brought him back to earth youll be looking for riders then my lad can be your first jockey jake looked skeptical so boyston went on ive just had a look at africas foal dino said she jumped six foot out of her field this morning jake laughed for the first time since the night he won his silver i suppose youre trying to tell me that she and your boyll be ready for the next olympics he said
