bertrice small lara the first book in the world of hetar series for ethan ellenberg with thanks prologue she was naked the girl reached up to touch the thin gold chain that she had always worn about her slender neck it was still there her fingers gently wrapped about the delicate crystal star that hung from the necklace it also remained and relief flooded through her she lifted the star to her sight and whispered silently are you there a tiny golden flame flickered within the star of course i am here the familiar voice murmured as silently back to her where else would i be i am afraid the girl said the unknown can frequently be frightening but you need not be fearful the voice reassured her all will be well this is but the beginning the beginning of what the girl wanted to know she simply could not keep her eyes open a moment longer they were closing in spite of her efforts to stay awake your journey came the reply as the flame within the star flickered again and died dropping from the girls fingers as she fell into a deep and dreamless sleep chapter we must sell lara husband there is simply no other choice if you are to have your chance susanna wife of john swiftsword said quietly she was uncomfortable with this matter but sometimes her husband would not face simple facts and the simple fact was that john had a beautiful daughter for whom he could no longer provide but that same daughter could provide for them all given the opportunity i cannot her husband replied but his voice was filled with the desperation that came from knowing she was right lara was all he had left of his brief union with the faerie woman ilona the faerie had loved him for a brief time given him their daughter whom she had named larashining one in her tongueand then disappeared from his life as easily as she had entered into it that midsummers night so long ago he had not married until two years ago and while he loved his susanna the memory of ilona would remain with him forever listen to me husband susannas voice penetrated his thoughts have you considered what is to become of lara we are poor people there is no dowry for her how can there be given your situation many fear her faerie beauty and her faerie blood who will wed a dowerless girl like that and if she is not married what will happen to her all your life you have wanted but one thingto become a member of the order of crusader knights you have served as a mercenary soldier since you were fifteen and your reputation as a great swordsman is known throughout the land but you know as well as i do that your poverty prevents you from attaining your greatest desire the tournament for entry into the ranks of the order of crusader knights is to be held in just a few months husband it will not be held again for another three years could he not see or understand why did she have to be the one to point out these things she very much liked her stepdaughter but john needed to advance and she wanted a better life for their son there was but one way to achieve their goals but to sell my daughter into slavery john swiftsword protested weakly susanna sighed i know husband how much you love this child but she is all we have that is of any value she is so beautiful that it almost hurts the eyes to look upon her i have grown to love her too still think of what little we have and consider the son i gave you but six months ago what will happen to mikhail the hovel we live in is yours only by virtue of your service to the guild of mercenaries your sword gives us food and small necessities but nothing else what clothing we possess is ours but when your sword is no longer useful where will we go how many of your kind have deliberately allowed themselves to be killed in battle rather than face a homeless old age and how many of their women roam as beggars without sons to provide for them but if lara is sold into slavery what will happen to her john swiftsword asked his wife his gray eyes were troubled and he ran a nervous hand through his brown hair she will most likely be bought and trained to be a pleasure woman for one of the great pleasure houses here in the city susanna said it will be a good life for her and in all likelihood some magnate will eventually purchase her from the pleasure house to be his own personal pleasure woman she will enjoy a life of luxury husband which is a far better future than we can offer her susanna put a comforting hand on her husbands sinewy arm he was a good man but like many men he needed to be led in the right direction such was a wifes duty how can you be certain that she will be so fortunate in her fate he demanded i have already gone to gaius prospero husband susanna answered honestly you went to the master of the merchants of the midlands and he saw you john swiftsword was astounded by her admission the master of the merchants holds an open audience once each month for any who would come to proffer him something of value i took lara with me several days ago that he might see what we had to offer him gaius prospero is who he is because he is a clever man and always eager for profit he has told me what he will pay for lara it is a more than generous sum with it i can purchase the finest materials to make your application garments with it you can order up the best suit of armor new weapons and the best warhorse bred for whom i will sew the most beautiful caparisons that you may be proud of yourself your talent with the sword and your perfect appearance i have already alerted the armorer and the swordsmith they are eager to service you husband because they know that if you enter this tournament you will win your place among the crusader knights thus burnishing their own reputations gaius prospero was particularly pleased when i told him why we were selling lara your skill as a great swordsman precedes you husband she spoke strongly he must be convinced that this was the right thing for all susanna think husband she interrupted him when you gain your rightful place we will be given a house in the garden district where all the crusader knights and their families reside oh it will be small at first i know for until you have made your mark among the knights in battle you will not merit a large home but one day we shall have one i know and even the lowest of the crusader knights is given a servant i will have someone to help me our son mikhail will be raised as a knights son with an automatic place within their ranks should he merit it but if he is not the warrior his father is he will receive an education that will keep him in the upper strata of our society selling lara to gaius prospero will benefit us all she will live a life of luxury and we will climb into the ranks of the elite you will have your dream our son will have more opportunities than even we can imagine there is no honor or advancement in poverty husband there is only the certainty of death her eyes suddenly filled with tears john swiftsword nodded susanna was absolutely right in this matter this was an opportunity that would not come again for him his daughter was exquisitely beautiful even as her faerie mother had been but he could not provide lara the kind of life to which she was entitled and of late the mercenary guild had not been as active as they had always been those needing their services were seeking menatarms not allied with his guild to whom they might pay a lower wage it mattered not that these outsiders had no real training or skills they were cheaper to employ which meant more profit and if they died they died it was no great loss most of the assignments that did come into his guild these days were going to those men willing to share a percentage of their wage with the guild sergeants i will need to speak with lara he said his eyes mirrored his anguish susanna looked up into her husbands face yes she agreed reaching up she touched his rough cheek with her fingertips i would wish it otherwise husband she said if lara were plain of face and meek of spirit we might have put her as a maidservant into the house of a magnates family she would have earned her keep and even been able to put a bit aside for a dowry portion but she is beautiful and highspirited like her mother he half whispered ilona was glorious to look upon and fiery of temperament i can understand why she left me but at least when she did she left lara so i should never forget the faerie who once loved me he sighed sadly susanna felt a stab of jealousy but she hid it from him saying instead your faerie woman was a fool john swiftsword for you are as good a man as ever was born he looked down at her and marveled that after all those lonely years he had found susanna of the lea he had been heartbroken when ilona had departed despite his pleas he was a man with an infant daughter and an old mother it was his mother who had taken charge of his child finding a wet nurse and raising lara while he was off in service to whoever was willing to pay for his skillful sword and his temporary loyalty and then his mother had died when lara was ten years of age to his great surprise his daughter took over the household chores whenever he returned home she would be waiting for him with a hot meal lively chatter and a clean bed for him he was grateful that his mother had trained his daughter so well but he found himself growing lonely for the companionship of a good woman pleasure women he had aplenty but john swiftsword wanted more now at laras suggestion he went to the matchmaker susanna of the lea was the daughter of a farmer from the midlands she was the youngest of eight daughters and a son her family was delighted to find a husband for her who was willing to accept her miniscule dower portion consisting of the clothing on her back her shoes a second skirt and bodice a woolen cloak a feather bed two down pillows and a single silver coin of a small denomination and she was willing to leave the country for the city youll not find a better wife the matchmaker had told him she is pretty enough but most important sweetnatured she is not fearful of that faerie child of yours either she will be a good mother to your daughter if she is such a good catch then why is she still unwed he asked the matchmaker the matchmaker sighed its the dowry john swiftsword shes the last of her parents children and there is practically nothing left for her usually these girls remain at home to care for their elderly parents but her mother died last year and the old farmer her father took himself another wife a widow the girl is not needed any longer and the new wife wants her gone she has an ugly daughter who will be the one to stay home and look after the farmer and his new wife only when i told the farmer there was no way i could get a decent husband for her without silver was the coin offered and grudgingly at that the new wife is not happy about it but the girls brother spoke up for her and as he is the one who will inherit the farm one day his voice carried weight john swiftsword nodded he understood what it was like not to be wanted he had been born on a midland farm himself but being one of his parents younger children he was encouraged almost from birth to find his own way he had been fortunate in that his eldest brothers wife was the daughter of a mercenary who had come to live with them in his old age it was the old soldier who had taught john how to use a sword and encouraged him to join the mercenaries that he might have a life of his own ill take susanna of the lea for my wife he had told the matchmaker and it had been done he had gone to her fathers farm found that the matchmaker had not lied and they had been united on the next marrying day along with twentytwo other couples by the squire who ruled the midlands region the squire performed this service one day each month and susanna had come back to the city with him immediately afterwards spending their wedding night in their hovel she had shrieked satisfactorily when he broke through her maidenhead so he knew with certainty that any children he got on her would be his she was a good bedmate and he quickly realized he had found a treasure of a wife in her his hovel was kept clean his daughter was cared for and his meals were excellent when he got a child on her he knew his life was a good one good except for the fact he could not think of a way to make his dream of joining the order of the crusader knights come true when he had first come to the city and joined the mercenaries he quickly learned that mercenaries were not a particularly respected group they were needed yes but not wellregarded mercenaries were the cannon fodder used by the crusader knights in the wars they had once conducted nowadays mercenaries were hired to protect the caravans that traversed the four kingdoms they were the menatarms used when one traveled the streets at night or carried valuables they had no stature at all the district in which they lived was a poor one and their hovels were not their own they were at the mercy of their guild and the only escapes available to them were death or entry into the order of the crusader knights having earned the appellation swiftsword for his skill with a blade john wanted more than anything to be a crusader knight entry into this high order was not an easy task every three years the crusader knights held a great tourney in the city to replenish their ranks due more to old age and death than battle these days but the crusader knights would not take just any man men who applied to enter the tourney had to appear before the entrance board properly garbed in fine garments if they gained a place in the tourney they had to arrive that first day wellequipped with a warhorse a good suit of armor and an array of fine weapons any man not appearing as required was immediately disqualified and sent away for the next five days the applicants would battle with each other at the end of each day the winners would be separated from the other aspirants and on the sixth day all the previous winners would battle at days end the last few men remaining were paired to fight crusader knight opponents one run only with horse and lance if the applicant was not unhorsed he would be accepted into the order those men who tumbled from their mounts were sent away it was a grueling tourney but john swiftsword knew in his heart that he could prevail if he could only enter but it was such an expensive undertaking and he had never made enough coin to be able to put some aside he barely managed to support his family it was very rare for a mercenary to be able to enter the tourney most applicants came from families of some means with second and third sons who had been trained to fight in hopes of joining this vaunted order but now his wife had offered him a solution to gain his dream he could still not bring himself to sell his beautiful daughter but at susannas suggestion he invited both the armorer and the swordsmith to a local inn so that they might speak together both were enthusiastic at the possibility of his entering the tournament youre a warrior born john swiftsword rafe the armorer said enthusiastically i would be proud to make your armor youll win too you know he grinned ive seen you in the practice yard wielding your blade there isnt a man who can stand against you im not as good a horseman as i would want to be john replied slowly rafe leaned forward and lowering his voice said ive three crusader knights among my patrons i have told them you may enter this tourney and they all evinced enthusiasm at the prospect for your reputation precedes you though you are too modest a man to realize it if i ask and you have but to give me the word they will tell me the trainer you will need to polish your other battle skills john swiftsword he picked up his tankard and drank deeply from it now bevin the swordsmith leaned forward to speak i made the sword with which you have always fought my own skills have improved over the years and i will make you the finest sword ever created it will sing a song of death as you wield it john you will be envied by all for this swords beauty will almost equal your prowess with it the mercenary sighed deeply to realize all of this i must sell my daughter he told them you know i am a poor man as you have said you are a poor man bevin said quietly but the faerie you mated with left you a most valuable gift in the person of the lass and what is to happen to the girl john swiftsword if you do not sell her rafe asked his direct gaze pierced the mercenarys own john swiftsword nodded i know i have no choice in this matter he replied to them i will go tomorrow and speak with gaius prospero myself come just after sunrise to be measured so i may begin working on your armor rafe told him we want time to make any adjustments needed he downed the remaining ale in his tankard and standing bid the other two men farewell you are doing the right thing the swordsmith told john what good is the girl to you now that she is grown you have a good wife and a little son to consider now your daughters beauty will give her the future that you surely cannot john swiftsword nodded slowly in reluctant agreement and then he ordered them each another tankard of ale he said nothing to susanna when he returned home late and the next morning he left their hovel to go into the golden district where the magnates had their city homes he had dressed carefully in his best tuniche had but two he had polished his worn boots his sword hung from a wide leather belt reaching the tall gates of the golden district he said to the two guardsmen who guarded those gates i am john swiftsword of the guild of mercenaries i have come to speak with gaius prospero are you expected one of the guardsmen asked i do not know if i am or not john answered wait while we check the guardsman replied then turning he went back into the little guardhouse and leaning out a window that opened beyond the gates he called out for a messenger to come john waited riders and travel wagons carrying the women who lived in the golden district came in and out of the great gates he could glimpse what appeared to be a parkland beyond those portals as they opened and closed finally after some time had passed the first guardsman motioned him forward you must leave your sword with me and then you may be admitted he said you know who i am the mercenary replied and i will find my sword here when i return do i look like a common thief the guardsman responded indignantly nay not at all but so many pass by here and you could be distracted john quickly said the sword is my livelihood i understand the guardsman replied i am a member of the guild too john swiftsword i was injured several years ago but was fortunate to obtain this post your sword will be safe in my care now go gaius prospero doesnt like to be kept waiting you will find a conveyance directly inside the gate that will transport you to his house he then took johns sword from his hands and ushered him through the gates where the cart was awaiting the visitor john climbed aboard and the vehicle moved quickly away from the entrance to the golden district all around him was an incredibly beautiful green parkland there seemed to be huge trees everywhere and the grass was neatly manicured they trotted down a wellpaved road here and there through the greensward and trees he could see great houses of shining white marble he had never imagined a place such as this within the city and susanna had said nothing about it how like her he smiled to himself to want him to be surprised and see for himself and it was quiet several feet past the entrance the cacophony of the city had disappeared entirely he wondered if the garden district where the crusader knights lived was quiet like this too a man could actually think in such quiet john grew alert once more as the cart in which he traveled turned down a narrow road of white gravel as his transport passed by liveried servants stepped from behind the flowering bushes to rake the path smooth again such a thing would have never occurred to him had he not seen it for himself he thought amazed the cart drew up before the house now he had no time to observe but that it had a rotunda over the main entrance before a servant stepped forward to help him from his transport and usher him into the building he was taken to a wide marble bench in the rotunda and told to sit before him was a rectangular pool at one end of which was a bronze boy on a dolphin water spouted gently from the fishs mouth there were green water hyacinths floating in the pool someone will come for you when the master can see you the servant said and then he was gone john swiftsword sat the day was warm he was thirsty and had had nothing to eat as he had departed early from his hovel first he had gone to the armorer to be measured for the suit of armor he would need and then he had walked across the city to the golden district a cup of water would have been nice he considered but john swiftsword knew he was of little importance and would be offered no refreshment he waited he was startled when a small goldfish leaped up from the pool splashing back down into the water the sun reached its zenith and poured into the rotunda the air was still and it grew hot he struggled not to doze in the still heat it had not seemed so warm in the city outside of the golden district this morning and then finally a man came forward and spoke to john i am one of gaius prosperos secretaries you will come with me he turned without waiting for any reply john stood and quickly followed the man into a side hallway down its length and into a large room wait here the secretary said and disappeared through a door at the end of the room john swiftsword stood quietly in the center of the room was a great round blackandgoldflecked marble table with solid gold legs that had gold balls and claw feet upon the table was a great round polished stone vase from which a colorful arrangement of exotic blooms spilled one side of the room was an open colonnade and beyond it a small garden he would have liked to have looked into that garden but he dared not move his manners for he did have them overcame his curiosity come this way the secretarys voice snapped breaking his reverie he was ushered into another large room where sitting at a long marble table was the man he had come to see for it could only be gaius prospero in that thronelike chair you may go jonah gaius prospero told the secretary then he looked at john swiftsword the mercenary bowed politely and waited for the master of the merchants to speak you did not speak unless spoken to by a great man he knew so you are to become a crusader knight gaius prospero began i should like to but nothing is certain my lord as you surely know the mercenary replied it should please me if you did came the surprising reply and there are others who agree with me your battle skills are legend john swiftsword the order of crusader knights is where you rightfully belong thank you my lord john said this will be of course about your decision to sell me your beautiful daughter gaius prospero began the negotiation yes my lord john replied i had your wife remove her garment she is exquisitely made every pleasure house in the city will want her the bidding will be unprecedented and i had my physician validate her virginity i am pleased that she is fully intact her firstnight rights will bring her owner a fortune he smiled and she is half faerie if i understood your wife correctly his temples were throbbing they had stripped his daughter of her clothing to examine her they had probed her innocence he blinked back the bloodred in his eyes swallowed hard and said yes my lord her mother was a faerie woman called ilona she was my first woman and came to me on a midsummers eve a most powerful time gaius prospero remarked now john swiftsword are you willing to sell your daughter to me this was the moment he had dreaded closing his eyes briefly he nodded and said aye i will sell lara to you my lord he wanted to weep he wanted to run from the room where he now stood before the great master of the merchants but he did not he opened his eyes and looked directly at gaius prospero excellent and a most wise decision on your part john swiftsword i am pleased to see you are not restrained by any foolish sentiments for the girl i shall have jonah bring the papers for you to sign now you do write dont you i both read and write the mercenary responded as does my daughter the master of the merchants raised an eyebrow then the girl is even more priceless he said magical beauty innocence and an education he rubbed his hands i beg one boon of you my lord john swiftsword quickly interjected and that is gaius prospero asked what could the man possibly want he was being paid a fortune for his merchandise please my lord i will sign your papers today but let my daughter remain with me until the time of the tournament so the mercenary loved his child you will need monies for your clothing your armor and your weapons the master of the merchants reminded john swiftsword i will ask only what my wife needs for materials john said and a down payment to the armorer and the swordsmith they are my friends and will accept a final payment after the tourney ends gaius prospero considered the request the girl will not run away he asked nay she is an obedient lass and my wife and i will explain all the advantages this change in her circumstances will afford her lara is not a stupid girl she will understand that this future we have planned for her will be a good future please my lord it is unlikely i shall ever see my child again once she leaves me the mercenary was right of course crusader knights were family men who generally cleaved to their wives although he knew some who had the morals of alley cats still it was unlikely this father and daughter would meet again gaius prospero loved his own two daughters dearly and this was an area in which he was disposed to be reasonable i will have it written into our agreement he said then he struck a bronze gong that sat on the table and almost immediately the secretary jonah was there bowing to his master the master of the merchants gave him his instructions and be quick john swiftsword will want to tell his wife and daughter of our agreement today and he must walk across the city before dark and i have promised my daughters that we are going to the farm for a few days send a message to my wife that we will leave within the hour and have the traveling vehicle ready then the master of the merchants turned to john swiftsword and said perhaps you would enjoy waiting in my little garden jonah will come for you when the papers are ready for us to sign the mercenary bowed turned and followed jonah into the anteroom when the secretary had disappeared in a cloud of his own importance john swiftsword walked through the colonnade into the small garden one day he would have a house with a garden like this a garden where susanna could sit at her loom or with her sewing on the warm days a garden where mikhail could play in safety and when he had that garden he would remember lara with silent thanks he sighed and sat down on a small marble bench looking about him more carefully there was a small fishpond in the middle of the walled garden there was a miniature flowering tree at the end of each flowerbed the beds were filled with blooms reds and pinks purples and lavenders yellow orange and blues and white flowers that perfumed the little garden with an incredible sweetness it was so beautiful and so perfect he felt near to weeping or was it the garden he brushed the tears from his eyes he had no other choice he knew with certainty that if he entered the tourney he would win a place for himself among the crusader knights and in doing so he susanna and mikhail would ascend to a higher social strata they would never be poor again even if he were injured in his duties and unable to serve his order further he and his family would be taken care of to remain a mercenary could only lead to eventual disaster susanna was right his daughter was the only valuable thing he possessed to retain lara in his custody would be to doom them all to continued poverty and misfortune he must put his sentiment his memories firmly aside and do what was right for all of them he heard an impatient cough and looking up saw the secretary jonah my master is ready for you the secretary said haughtily where are the papers john swiftsword asked in the antechamber outside of the library jonah responded i will want to peruse the papers before i sign them the mercenary said what the secretary looked outraged do you think my master is attempting to cheat you such a thing is impossible restrain your outrage john swiftsword replied dryly i merely wish to see what it is i am signing would you sign an important paper without reading it first no the secretary admitted but i would hardly think a man in your position would care you are being paid a most excellent price for your daughter were i not in my position the mercenary said low i should not sell the child i love now let me see the papers you have drawn up he followed the secretary back into the antechamber where the parchments lay upon the round marble table picking them up john swiftsword scanned them carefully his eyes widening at the price he was being paid for his daughter ten thousand gold cubits half to be put with a goldsmith today that he might draw upon it the other half to be turned over when he surrendered lara to gaius prospero the surrender date was to be to his surprise the day after the tournament was over is this correct he asked jonah the master thought you might want your daughter to see you attain your goal john swiftsword he is a family man himself and loves his own daughters the secretary answered in a gentler tone than he had previously used with the mercenary john swiftsword nodded and surreptitiously wiped his eyes again then he turned his attention once more to the parchment all was exactly as he had agreed with gaius prospero he handed the parchment back to the secretary i am ready to sign he said together the two men reentered the great library of the master of the merchants i have the papers my lord jonah said spreading them before gaius prospero who glanced at them carelessly before taking the inked quill from his secretarys hand and signing the two parchments a copy for him a copy for john swiftsword jonah handed a second quill to john swiftsword the mercenary closed his eyes but a brief moment then opening them took the quill and signed his name in a strong legible hand with a deep sigh he handed the pen back to the secretary then to his surprise the master of the merchants held out his hand you have done a hard thing this day john swiftsword gaius prospero said i shall look forward to your victory in the tournament in a few months the crusader knights need men like you the mercenary shook the hand offered him thank you my lord was all he could say he had just sold the child of his heart into slavery come along now john swiftsword the secretary said ushering him from the august presence of gaius prospero now tell me if you have a preference in goldsmiths for i must send a messenger to he with whom you choose to open your account i have no experience with goldsmiths the mercenary said honestly will you recommend someone to me with pleasure jonah replied and a small smile touched the corners of his mouth this man would soon belong to an important group and while jonah served one of the most important men on hetar it could not hurt to have a friend among the crusader knights avram the goldsmith has his shop just outside the garden district he is honest and has many of the order as his patrons with your permission i shall open an account for you and transfer the five thousand cubits to his keeping if you will come with me i will give you a receipt for the gold john swiftsword was suddenly in a daze yes he answered the secretary jonah like his master was assuming that he would gain one of the places open into the crusader knights in the coming tourney the mercenary followed jonah waited while the receipt was made out and then offering the secretary his hand he shook it took the receipt and departed the house of gaius prospero outside he found the transport awaiting to return him to the gates of the golden district the cart traversed the quiet parklike area once again and then he was outside in the noisy dirty streets of the city the receipt for five thousand cubits clutched in his hand he quickly tucked it into his doublet retrieving his sword from the guardsman at the gate he began walking back across the city to the mercenaries quarter where he lived where his wife his son and his daughter awaited his coming the day was waning and the streets grew dusky with the coming evening john swiftsword moved quickly he was more than capable of defending himself but he didnt want to have to bother right now he reached the gates of the quarter just before they closed for the night nodding at the two old pensioners who guarded those gates but not stopping to chat with them as he often did turning into his lane he stopped a moment then a deep sigh issued forth from him he was a brave man but he truly dreaded what was to come he could see the candlelight in the window of his hovel smoke rose from the narrow chimney straightening his shoulders john swiftsword walked down the lane opened the door to his hovel and stepped inside susanna was at the hearth stirring a pot from which arose a savory smell she turned at the sound of his boot steps her face was serene with the familiar task she performed looking up she asked softly is it done husband he nodded where is lara bathing mikhail for me susanna answered the supper is almost ready the butcher gave me several pieces of poultry that he would have otherwise discarded i didnt even ask i have made us a fine chicken stew husband then the word is already about that i am entering the tourney he replied and he sat down at the table near the fire of course it would be nothing is a secret for long in the quarter give me something to drink wife i am parched i have had nothing all day from the moment i departed our hovel she set a mug of cider before him where is the gold she asked bluntly with avram the goldsmith he has a shop outside the gates of the garden district gaius prosperos secretary jonah deposited it and gave me the receipt i have made a bargain with the master of the merchants half down and half on delivery of lara and she will remain with us until the day after the tourneys end susanna came up behind him slipping her arms about him she kissed the top of his head it is a fair bargain husband and how proud your daughter will be to see you win your place among the crusader knights when will you tell her tonight before i lose my courage he replied you must leave us after the supper that lara and i can be alone to speak on it she nodded and then she smiled as her stepdaughter entered the room her baby brother in her arms here he is all sweet and clean stepmother will you nurse him now or after our meal she handed the baby to its mother afterwards i think put him in his cradle he will be content to play with his toes while we eat susanna said and she handed her son back to lara who put the baby boy down in the cradle what john swiftsword said teasingly no greeting for your old father lass where have you been all day da lara asked kissing his cheek and sitting down on the floor by his knee she lay her head against it smiling up at him he reached out to stroke that head her hair was a color he had seen only once lara had the golden gilt hair of her mother and she had ilonas limegreen eyes in fact everything about her was ilona everything except her full lips which she had inherited from him what have you been doing he asked ignoring her query mistress mildred watched mikhail while my stepmother and i visited several mercers shops in the merchants quarter we wore our best skirts and bodices so they would not think we were beggar women lara reported oh da i have never seen materials such as i saw today i never even knew such fabrics existed and everyone was so kind to us one of the mercers gave me a silver ribbon for my hair his heart contracted so they knew in the shops as well well gossip was the meat and drink of the city he should not be surprised the supper will be cold if you two do not eat it susanna said briskly lara scrambled to her feet and took her place while her father swung about again to face the table i have put my ribbon away but i will get it after supper to show you da the girl said i shall only wear it on special occasions they ate the chicken stew that susanna had ladled onto the worn wooden plates tearing chunks off a small round loaf to mop up the gravy they ate in silence when they had finished lara quickly removed the plates and mugs from the table taking them to the small stone sink outside the back door then she went to the hearth and taking a kettle of hot water poured it into the sink refilled the kettle and replaced it on its hood over the fire adding a little cold water to the sink she washed the wooden plates and mugs clean dried them with her apron and replaced them in the bureau on the wall across from the hearth her father and her stepmother had been speaking quietly but now susanna arose took mikhail from his cradle and went into the garden to nurse her son come back and sit with me john swiftsword called to his daughter i must speak with you lara she rejoined him saying you look so sad da what is it you know he began that the tournament of the crusader knights will be held again this spring aye da i know you should be one of them you should why have you not entered the tournament before lara asked him to enter the tournament a man must meet many requirements he must know how to use certain weapons he must be able to read and to write you are a great swordsman da and you can read and write lara said but i have not been able to meet the third requirement lara i do not look like i belong among the crusader knights john said to his daughter why not she demanded i must have a warhorse and the beast must be well caparisoned i must have beautiful armor and fine weapons i need more than my skills lara how silly the young girl replied i would think your skills would be what counted most not your appearance she slipped into his lap and kissed his rough cheek but my skills are nothing if i do not look like one of the order he said he put an arm around her giving her a little hug it was rare that he allowed himself to show her any real affection but now their time together was growing short and we are poor she noted have we nothing of value that we could sell that would allow you to enter the tourney da it is very costly lara and i have not the means or so i thought until recently i have one item and one only of great value i have you me she said genuinely surprised and a small tendril of fear rose within her she pushed it away what value have i da he smiled at her innocence lara you are extraordinarily beautiful and you have your virginity which has great value as you have noted we are poor i have no dowry for you i cannot make a match for you without one it is all i can do to make ends meet now that my guild is receiving fewer and fewer assignments there is less work for me which means no coins in my pocket i need to move up in the world lara for all our sakes what will become of you of susanna of your brother if i do not i know i can triumph in the coming tournament if i can but find the means to enter it that is why susanna took me to the house of gaius prospero isnt it da she said thoughtfully that is why i was stripped naked and why a physician probed my body isnt it the master of the merchants will pay a handsome price for me he would purchase me ten thousand cubits daughter john swiftsword replied lara nodded slowly it is a great price da am i truly worth all that gold more he told her for gaius prospero expects to make a profit from you lara i think he will probably gain double or more when he sells you what will he do with me da she asked suddenly she was truly afraid and she trembled then swallowing hard she fought back her fears reminding herself that her father loved her he would do nothing to harm her i expect he will sell you into a pleasure house her father answered his arm tightening around his daughter in a small gesture of comfort pleasure women are admired da they live lives of great luxury and privilege lara said then she reached out and patted his hand you must not be sad what other future could i have you have sold me then she had to be brave for her fathers sake she could see he was distressed it wasnt a terrible fate and actually a better one than she had considered given their circumstances he nodded wordlessly when must i go her face was pensive not right away da the day after the tourney daughter john swiftsword told her lara clapped her hands then i shall see you attain your goal da that is good i will go with a light heart knowing that i have been able to aid you in this way if there were any other way lara he began but she put a little hand over his mouth if there were da you would have found it for us she said quietly the celestial actuary gives us each a talent yours is skill with a sword i will make my way through life using my beauty if i had been born ugly you would have already put me into service in some magnates house where i would be at the mercy of all nay this is much better i shall be a famous pleasure woman like roxelana of the rose she bought her freedom and now manages a pleasure house i would be like that charting my own destiny at the mercy of no one i had not expected such understanding from you lara he told her gratefully sometimes i think my mother comes to me in the night and whispers wisdom in my ear da i am young but there are times when i feel that i have lived a thousand years or more she told him with a small smile there are moments when you amaze me daughter john swiftsword told his eldest child thank you for understanding my position for understanding what i must do i did not make this decision that will affect all of our lives either easily or lightly he tipped her from his lap kissing her brow then standing he said i will go and tell your stepmother of your courage now lara remained where she was seated her life had stood still for so very long and she had always wondered what would happen to her she was fourteen and grown many girls her age were already wed or in service but neither would be her fate she did not mind she had always wanted to know what lay beyond the city and now perhaps she would have that opportunity she could be sold into a pleasure house in the coastal region it was said the coast was a rich and beautiful land the midlands were dull just farmers and their crops women in the midlands pleasure houses lived dull lives it was unlikely any of them could purchase their freedom one day the land of the shadow princes was the one she knew the least about few in the city knew a great deal about the shadow princes did they even have pleasure houses and as for the forest lords they kept to themselves for they were the most ancient of the clans on hetar with the purest of bloodlinesor so they claimed their lives were guided by tradition but she was beautiful her father said beautiful enough that the master of the merchants would pay ten thousand gold cubits for her and then resell her for more lara had not a great deal of experience with life outside the quarter but she knew that if her value was that great then her future could be even greater her prospects were exciting and she eagerly awaited her fate she was half faerie and now more than ever she felt that part of her stirring restlessly susanna said it was because lara now suffered her womans blood flow each moon span that her mothers influence was upon her more than it had ever been before there was no denying her faerie heritage susanna said lara was happy that her going would help her family rise in the social ranks but she felt no sacrifice at what was to come she saw only great opportunity ahead and the promise of a golden future yet it niggled at her that her stepmother had been the one to provoke the changes that were to come to them all should not john swiftsword have been the one to instigate these shifts in their lives susanna had changed since the birth of laras baby brother six months ago still she did not envy her fathers wife the thought of being tied to one man as susanna was tied to her father was abhorrent right now again her faerie blood spoke but she had never confided any of these thoughts to anyone her stepmother she suspected would have been shocked she had no friends her own age the girls in the quarter did not treat her well at all many were afraid of her faerie blood she often wondered what they thought she was going to do to them she knew no spells or magic but now she realized that it was also her beauty that kept them at bay beauty it would seem was both a blessing and a curse she must remember that in the times to come lara considered chapter susanna was relieved when her husband told her of laras reaction she thought to herself that if she had been in laras position she would be very unhappy but then the girl was half faerie who knew what she really felt susanna was glad that her stepdaughter would soon be gone she was but five years older than johns daughter she was young enough that she didnt want to share her husband with his beautiful child but lara had been so sweet and welcoming when she had married the girls father that she was unable to be unkind and could find no fault with her indeed they were almost friends odd as that seemed the next morning when john had gone out to see bevin the swordsmith susanna called lara to her will you help me choose the fabric for your fathers application clothing and sew them with me i cannot embroider half as well as you can and your stitches are so fine as to be invisible what will you do when i am not here to help you with your sewing lara half teased her stepmother what for a moment susanna looked confused by her stepdaughters words then lara quickly said will we return to the mercer today i think we must if we are to have your fathers garments ready in time susanna said with a bright smile now tell me which of the fabrics we saw last you favored my fathers eyes are gray and i think he must have a silver brocade silver brocade and skyblue silk would suit him lara answered her stepmother you did not like the gold brocade susanna sounded disappointed the gold was very fine but perhaps a bit vulgar lara replied thoughtfully i thought the silver more elegant with das eyes ashbrown hair and fine features yes susanna reconsidered laras instincts for fashion had always impressed her considering the girl hardly ever left the quarter yet she always knew what was right it was very annoying at times but still best to listen to her then the silver brocade it is she agreed run and ask mistress mildred if she will watch mikhail today for if she will not we must have him with us take her one of the fresh loaves i baked early this morning lara took the stillwarm loaf and put it in a small market basket then she hurried to the hovel next to theirs where mistress mildred a widow lived with her son wilmot susanna has sent you a nice warm loaf she called out as she entered the room she wonders if you can watch mikhail again today we are going to the mercers to purchase cloth for das application garments so its true then the old woman said coming forward and taking the loaf from the basket hes going to enter the tourney well ill be sorry to see you all go he has been a good neighbor and his mother before him where did he get the coin for such an expensive undertaking are you so certain da will win a place in the crusader knights lara replied avoiding the query neatly of course hell win mistress mildred said hes the finest swordsman in the land child did your grandmother not always say it and everyone else then youll watch mikhail lara gently pressed her ill be over in just a few moments mistress mildred responded and lara was swiftly gone out the door warning susanna of the old ladys curiosity she and her stepmother were quickly on their way as soon as mistress mildred stepped into the hovel well not be too long susanna promised take your time mistress mildred called after them remember you must choose the right fabrics and colors for your man if he is to make a good impression they left the quarter and traveled through the city to the merchants quarter where the mercers were to be found why they should be recognized lara never understood but they obviously were as soon as they stepped over the threshold of the first shop the mercer oozed with goodwill his apprentices tumbled over one another to unroll bolts of fabric for susanna they snuck looks at lara from beneath their lashes the bargain struck between john swiftsword and gaius prospero was publicly known now for the master of the merchants was already seeking to drum up interest among the owners of the pleasure houses they looked at what the first mercer had to offer and then moved on to two more shops but lara was not satisfied with the quality of fabrics being shown her grandmother had once been in the service of a magnates wife as a seamstress she had passed her knowledge of fabrics on to her only grandchild and when they were in the quarters market square she had also instructed lara in the fine art of bargaining susanna a country girl was not good at haggling for she had never had any experience in it as her fathers daughter and lara still did most of the marketing for the household walking on they almost missed a small shop squeezed between two larger and more ostentatious ones susanna was not inclined to enter for it looked a poor place with its dirty window and a door that hung but barely from a single hinge however lara gently insisted that until they found the perfect fabrics no establishment even one so unfortunate looking could be overlooked you are probably right she told her stepmother but we must look anyway the inside of the shop looked little better than the outside it was dim and dusty but when the ancient mercer hobbled forward laras instincts told her they had come to the right place we are looking for silver brocade she said i have precisely what you seek the mercer replied politely his voice was strong for one whose limbs were so frail reaching up he brought a bolt of fabric off a shelf and unfurled it on the counter before their eyes the silk brocade was cloth of silver and its raised design was of skyblue velvet the quality was excellent the finest they had seen this morning its perfect lara breathed turning to her stepmother isnt it perfect she fingered the beautiful material i have never seen anything so fine susanna agreed softly the old mercer smiled slyly showing his worn and yellowed teeth it would make an applicant for the tourney more than presentable my ladies and i have a fine matching blue silk that would sew up nicely into a pair of more than elegant trunk hose and velvet for a cap lara said quietly the mercer nodded and i know where you can obtain an excellent selection of plumes the twinkle in his eyes was not quite human his gaze met laras for a long moment while susanna was murmuring over the cloth then he looked at her chain and its star and nodded ilonas star he whispered you knew my mother lara murmured softly once long ago was the reply like you i am half faerie though few live today who would know my heritage then he was all business once again will you take the brocade lady he asked susanna she nodded and the silk and the velvet as well you have not asked the price he said susanna blushed at her ignorance and stammered i must have them she said weakly she looked nervously to lara and the mercer will be more than fair stepmother will you not sir lara quickly put in if i am fair then the wife of the new crusader knight will patronize my shop again the old man responded your husband will need many fine garments as will you and your little son you know i have a lad susanna looked surprised everything that can be known about john swiftsword is known in the city lady we have been waiting for this day he measured out the length of brocade she would need and quickly cut it then he did the same for the pale blue silk and the medium blue velvet wrapping the materials together in a piece of clean rough cloth he tied the packet shut with a bright piece of yarn and handed it to her if the lady will wait i will write her a receipt the mercer told susanna a second receipt signed with your mark will be sent to avram the goldsmith the amount will be deducted from the credit your husband has with avram susanna was half in shock with the transaction she had never bought anything in a shop like this in all her life she looked helplessly to lara it is stuffy in here stepmother the girl said go outside and take the air i will sign the mercers receipt and learn where we may find feathers for das cap yes i think i will go outside susanna replied thank you stepdaughter taking up her package she departed the little shop slowly the ancient mercer wrote out the two receipts he pushed one forward and handed the young girl the slender charcoal writing stick it was almost entirely worn away but lara was still able to sign her name to the little parchment lara daughter of john swiftsword of the quarter she wrote in her best hand thank you sir she said taking up her receipt as she pushed his toward him love and light be always in your path daughter of ilona the mercer said and he personally ushered her through the door of his shop you will find the feather merchant two lanes over choose a hawks feather for it will bring your father additional good fortune your stepmother will want a more showy plume but be certain your will prevails in the matter one feather no more i understand lara responded and then the shop door closed behind her and she rejoined her stepmother who waited in the street come she said to susanna he has told me where to find the feather merchant as the old mercer had predicted her fathers young wife wanted the largest whitest plume she saw think how fine it will look with the blue velvet of your fathers cap lara she said excitedly waving it about as the feather merchant grinned it is beautiful lara agreed but do you not think it too big it will draw all the attention away from da no one can compete with so wonderful a waving plume the least breeze and it will lift the cap from his very head she laughed lightly her eyes scanned the tall glass canisters of feathers displayed i can see such a plume in your lovely hair one day stepmother but not i think on das cap the feather merchant scowled at her it is my finest plume he said oh it is very fair lara agreed but i think a feather that spoke more to my fathers skills as well as his good taste would better suit the plume is too ostentatious she pointed let us see that glass of hawks feathers dont you think them elegant stepmother she drew forth a long slender feather mixed with black white and russet that was tipped with gold this one she exclaimed it is very nice susanna agreed hesitantly but is not the white plume better the plume i think is the sort of thing every boy applying for the tourney will have jutting from his cap is that not so she directed her question to the feather merchant i will wager you have sold more plumes than anything else since the tourney was announced i feel the hawks feather will distinguish da and it will bring him luck stepmother the feather merchant nodded reluctantly your lass is right he said i have sold nothing but white plumes to those applying and i am the only feather merchant in the city the hawks feather she so carefully drew from the canister is the finest one i possess it will indeed identify your man and permit him to stand out among the others then i shall have it susanna told him firmly the hawks feather is more expensive than the plume he said wrap it carefully susanna instructed him my stepdaughter will sign the receipt our account is with avram the goldsmith lara i will await you outside and susanna swept grandly from the feather merchants shop her dignity restored restraining her laughter lara stood quietly as the man first rolled the elegant hawks feather in a length of gauze then slipped it into a long narrow wooden tube with a metal top he wrote out two receipts and pushed one forward for lara to sign so youre to be a pleasure woman he said as he handed her the container and her copy of the receipt he eyed her boldly i know not what i will be lara said coldly that is up to gaius prospero then she turned and left the establishment the man was too forward what is the matter susanna asked her seeing the anger on her stepdaughters beautiful face are you all right lara shook her head the feather merchant spoke out of turn she replied it is nothing do you have the proper needles and threads we will need for this undertaking susanna nodded aye i do when lara got that particular look on her face it was best to leave her be and inquire no further then we should go home stepmother we have much work ahead of us the girl said in gentler tones then she smiled at susanna we have been most successful this morning you must speak to the cobbler in the quarter da will need fine new boots to complete his attire and the shoemaker must seek out the best leathers he can find but lara will that not be expensive susanna said the girl laughed and patted her stepmothers arm very expensive but it will not make a dent in the credit avram the goldsmith holds in das name she said you are almost rich susanna and i think it is time you got used to it she teased the older woman when we have finished das garments we must make you a fine gown in which to attend the tourney what of you her stepmother asked you should have a fine gown too i think that gaius prospero should supply me with such a gown lara answered i do belong to him now do i not if he wants to display his merchandise at the tourney i believe he should see that i have a proper gown to wear how can you be so cold about this susanna wondered as they walked what else am i to do stepmother you are the one who suggested to my father that he sell me and you were right it was the only solution to his dilemma besides what would become of me with no dower portion no magnates wife would have me in service in her house i am too beautiful i am told although the most i have ever seen of my own face is what i can see when i gaze upon my reflection in a basin of water you might have taken me to the public market and sold me there but you did not you sold me to the head of the merchants of the midlands guild himself which assures me a good fate i am not cold i have simply resigned myself to the fact that my childhood is over and my future awaits did you not do the same when your father sought out the matchmaker you did not know what kind of a man would take you but you accepted that your fate was your fate that is what i have done i wish there had been another way susanna said i do not consider becoming a pleasure woman a terrible fate stepmother but if your conscience troubles you and i see it does then before i go tell me what i must know of men and women there is no shame to my virginity but my ignorance distresses me greatly i fear i have heard you and da at night in your bed but i know not what you do to elicit such sounds i can only account for the squeaking of the bedsprings susannas cheeks grew fiery with her stepdaughters speech but she managed to say of course i will instruct you in all i know lara but pleasure women know far more than i do of course they would lara replied but i certainly should have a grasp of the basics shouldnt i i would think so susanna murmured but perhaps we should send to gaius prospero for his thought in the matter as you have pointed out he is now your owner let us go now lara said we are nearer the golden district than we are to the quarter stepmother now but he is not expecting us and he has gone to the country or so your father said he had promised his children susanna replied we can ask at the gate lara responded as they traversed the main square of the city she then turned into the avenue leading to the golden district behind her susanna followed helpless to her stepdaughters strong will reaching the gates they sought lara strode up to the guard and said is gaius prospero at home sir the guard looked her boldly over then replied you would be the new slave he purchased from john swiftsword but i did not think you due until after the tourney or so i was told you are indeed a prime piece of goods lass lara glared i asked you a question she said in icy tones if my master is in residence i need his advice on a matter that concerns me i cannot act without his permission and while i yet live with my father i need my masters words to guide me the guard stood straighter now aye gaius prospero is in residence his wife and daughters departed for the country yesterday but he remained behind for his son grew ill and could not travel i will allow you through but this woman must remain outside the gates to wait for you this is the wife of john swiftsword but i will tell her to wait will you offer her a place to sit and some water please lara said the wife of swiftsword then she may wait inside the gates there is a bench beneath the trees and i will bring her refreshment myself come he beckoned them susanna was actually relieved not to have to accompany her stepdaughter she reassured lara that she was content to wait for her and watched as the cart took the girl from her side and down a smooth path she thanked the guardsman who presented her with a wooden goblet of sweet watered wine and sighed with pleasure at the greensward before her the cart disappeared from her sight like her father lara was enchanted by the parkland through which the cart traveled she had seen it but once before when susanna had brought her first to gaius prospero how different and wonderful it was in comparison to the quarter she recognized the little road they now turned off upon they were almost there as her transport pulled up before the magnificent house a servant hurried out to greet it the master is waiting for you he said as he helped lara from the cart how did he know i was coming she wondered aloud faeriepost the guard sent one from the gate the servant explained they arent like the one who bore you they are tiny winged creatures no bigger than a minute come this way mistress lara faeriepost she had never heard of it before but then there was much she didnt know about the world outside of the quarter the servant led her directly to gaius prospero who was seated in the courtyard garden outside of his library with him was a young boy lara judged to be about eight years old the master of the merchants guild looked up and smiled his fat hand with its several rings waved her forward i am told you would ask my advice he said that pleases me greatly lara daughter of swiftsword i am your possession my lord she replied but there was no servility in her voice i am aware of my place in the scheme of things to come her limegreen eyes met his directly and then she lowered them politely he nodded the girl had spirit and intelligence she would one day be a famous pleasure woman because he had been clever enough to see her worth he congratulated himself silently then he said this is my son aubin he will follow in my footsteps one day you may speak to him lara nodded graciously at the boy i greet you young master she said she is beautiful the boy said to his father as if lara could not hear him she is the most beautiful girl i have ever seen his father told him always seek out the best and the finest merchandise my son you will make no profit with the ordinary only the unique and the rare will be of benefit to you he patted the boys head and then turned to lara now tell me what it is you desire of me my beauty first she began i would ask your permission for my stepmother to educate me in the ways of men and women i am totally ignorant of such things tell her she may explain the basics to you but no more gaius prospero replied a highpriced virgin should have certain knowledge but only that she not be frightened by her first experience with passion a man purchasing a virgins firstnight rights likes to lead the way surprised innocence has a great charm all its own he smiled at lara in almost paternal fashion what else i should like to see my father win at the tourney but i thought i would need your permission to attend and if you give it should you not also give me a gown to wear that this beauty i am told i possess be displayed to your advantage gaius prospero chuckled and the chuckle grew into hearty laughter the girl was amazing despite all her lack of advantages she had incredible instincts she was a survivor he pulled a large purple handkerchief from his sleeve and wiped his eyes with it he let his mirth subside and then he said in calmer tones than he had thought himself capable of aye to both your questions my beauty you shall go to the tourney for i promised your father you should see his triumphand you shall be displayed as the rare piece of merchandise i intend you to be and i shall send two litters to your home that day in one your stepmother and half brother will ride the other will be for you alone you will be brought to my private box on the tournament field where all will see you and many will desire you he looked quizzically at her you have never seen yourself your own image lara this is true i have glimpsed my face in the basin and the well bucket but i see nothing out of the ordinary she answered him you must see yourself then before you leave us today he stood up come and he hurried from the garden with lara and his son following behind he led them into a gallery that was lined with mirrors on one side and with windows that overlooked the vast parkland outside there my beauty he said triumphantly there is your image the image of perfect beauty lara stared not quite certain that what she saw was real truly my lord i look upon myself the tall and slender image in the glass stared back it wore a simple sleeveless dark blue gown tied at the waist by a twisted naturalcolored cord her graceful neck rose above the gowns round neckline her hair was pale with golden lights her limegreen eyes stared at her from a heartshaped face with a straight little nose and generous lips her chin had just the daintiest of clefts in it her brows were dark in comparison to her hair as were her eyelashes i see only a girl lara said remove your gown gaius prospero said to her quietly but the boy she began and then she stopped the boy was his fathers heir in all ways lara undid the little ties at the shoulder of her gown and let the garment drop to the floor there was a faint blush to her cheeks you see aubin the perfect breasts small yet but perfect nonetheless and the way her hips flare gently below her slim waist her limbs are most shapely are they not and see how full the golden bush so coyly hiding her sex is such is an indication of a very passionate nature everything is in perfect proportion on this girl touch her the skin is like silk and utterly flawless he ran his hand casually down laras back over her buttocks and the boy imitated his motions you see my son a rare piece of merchandise lara my beauty do you not have a beautiful body do you now understand your value she gazed at herself in the mirror with new eyes she was beautiful there wasnt a mark on her body to detract from her perfection she wondered why gaius prospero wasnt desirous of her but then she realized as their eyes met in the glass that her value to him was in her worth as quality merchandise nothing more profit was in his heart and soul yes she agreed though i have no other with whom to compare but never allow that knowledge to overcome your common sense my beauty he advised her he bent down and drew her garment back up fastening the tabs at the shoulders then he touched her face gently lovely he murmured almost to himself thank you my lord lara said quietly may i have your permission to withdraw now and return to susanna who awaits me he nodded his assent calling for a servant to lead her back through the house to where her transport was awaiting her lara was a glorious creature he thought he desired her himself but she was simply too valuable to tamper with and because he never allowed his own emotions to interfere with his judgment he hid his desire well her stepmother looked up relieved as lara stepped from the cart together the two left the golden district thanking the guardsman on duty for his courtesy as they departed susanna was clutching their purchases to her ample bosom as they walked swiftly through the city finally she spoke what happened she asked lara gaius prospero says you are to instruct me in the basics of passion that i not be fearful lara began and he will give me a gown to wear so i am properly displayed and he will send two litters for us i am to ride alone in one you and mikhail in the other we will be escorted to his box that we may see all susanna almost dropped her packages how shall i ever make a gown for myself that will not shame your father she began to fret i know little of the mighty i will help you lara told her stepmother perhaps we should return to the feather merchant tomorrow and obtain that white plume for my hair susanna responded lara swallowed her laughter i think perhaps a little less ostentation stepmother would serve you best you must appear an elegant and proper young matron it is true susanna worried aloud my appearance will be judged as well as your fathers and yours exactly lara said so if you appear in too much finery it makes you look gauche and overproud it would not i suspect sit well with the women whose husbands and fathers are crusader knights modest but fashionable is what you must be when they returned to the hovel they found mistress mildred with a very hungry mikhail susanna immediately put her son to her bosom realizing as she did so that her breasts were quite full their old neighbor was filled with curiosity and lara assuaged it by unwrapping the beautiful brocade the silk and the velvet for her to see mistress mildred touched the fabrics reverently and nodded satisfied she told susanna that mikhail was a very good child and she would stay with him whenever needed in these next busy months susanna thanked her and mistress mildred went home to her own hovel where her son would be expecting his dinner john swiftsword returned home after sunset to find his own dinner awaiting him on the hearth he told them of his search this day for a good warhorse with the help of an old crusader knight to whom he had been introduced by rafe the armorer we may have found one out at a midlands farm today hes four years old and has had a good year of combat training john said excitedly i rode him for a time and we seemed to become friends sir ferris says a man must feel kinship with his beast we will go back tomorrow and arrange to buy aristaeus he was very happy happier than he had ever been in all his life what did you two do today he asked them we went to find the perfect material for your garments susanna said i do not know what i would have done without lara her taste is frankly better than mine and she signed all the receipts thus saving me the embarrassment of admitting i cannot read or write we found the perfect feather for the cap we will make you lara visited gaius prospero and then we came home susanna concluded john swiftsword turned to his daughter you went to gaius prospero why he was still troubled by what he had done but lara it seemed was not in the least unhappy at the future ahead of her i wanted to know if i might go to the tourney to see you win da and i wanted to know if susanna could speak to me of men and women he is my master now da i believed i needed his permission he seemed well pleased that i came to ask him john nodded you were right to go to gaius prospero he said slowly he says i am to have a beautiful gown and that he will send two litters that day susanna mikhail and i are to sit in his private box at the tourney da tomorrow susanna and i will begin the process of fashioning your application garments you will wear the most glorious brocade da lara told him he could not bear it his beautiful golden child would shortly be gone from him and he did not know if he would ever see her again go to bed now lara susanna said softly and the girl arose kissing them both and disappeared into the tiny chamber she shared with her baby brother she is content john susanna said to her husband she looks forward to her future she has no idea of what awaits her he groaned she is so innocent her whole life she has lived here in the quarter rarely venturing out until now how can she envision a future she cannot possibly understand susanna sighed you underestimate lara john your mother taught her a great deal more than how to keep a house and sew you should have seen her today i should have had little success without her i was frankly intimidated by those with whom i was forced to traffic not lara she has the bearings of a young queen the mercers actually deferred to her she has a certain assured quality about her they recognized even as they recognized my hesitancy and she treated me with such great and public respect husband suggesting i wait in the fresh air while she concluded our transactions and knowing with the certain instinct that she has suddenly displayed that she should go to gaius prospero and she wasnt one bit frightened when i first took her to him i was terrified but not your daughter and not today nay john lara knows precisely what she is doing and you need feel no guilt in having sold her so you might have your chance she has no regrets what will you tell her of men and women he asked his wife susanna laughed now husband sooner or later this conversation between your daughter and me would have had to be voiced i know what to say she will know what she needs to know and learn the rest as her life moves forward now tell me about this sir ferris you met today sir ferris ironshield john began is one of the oldest and most respected of the crusader knights he is sixty wife and still active he is a client of the armorers and rafe asked him if he would be interested in helping me we met today outside the city on the road to a midlands horse farm but before he would take me on he said he had to test my mettle with the sword for which i have earned my fame he warned me not to hold back but to fight my best hes the finest opponent i have come up against in years but i beat him susanna he laughed and said my reputation was justly come by and he would be happy to sponsor me for it seems i must have a sponsors name upon the application i have so much to learn wife and you will she encouraged him so you found your horse aye and while i am good with a sword and a spear my skills with the axe and the mace need work sir ferris says we will work on them over the next few months then all is as it should be now husband susanna replied it was autumn and as the days lengthened lara and her stepmother began the process of creating and sewing the garments that john swiftsword would wear on the day of the applications for entrance to the rank of tournament goers lara carefully cut her fathers tunic out from the beautiful silver brocade they had purchased then she cut the trunk hose from the sky blue silk only then did they begin the sewing susanna carefully stitched together the hose taking her time and working hard to make her stitches as fine as laras an impossibility she decided but she tried anyway little mikhail sat on the floor of the hovel playing with pieces of discarded material and quite content to do so he was his fathers son in all ways lara had returned to the old mercers shop twice to purchase other materials as she considered how she would decorate her fathers tunic she had also found a lovely lilac cloth for susannas gown which she would make only after the tunic was done she had designed the tunic with a round neckline around it she sewed a wide band of cloth of silver she had embroidered with gold silver and dark blue threads she then added tiny gold and silver beads the small straight opening in the neckline gave way to a short stretch of the same embroidery down the front of the tunic the garment was slit on either side and the slits as well as the hem of the tunic were decorated with identical embroidery which also curled about the cuffs of the full sleeves lara also made a wide embroidered belt to hang low on the garment it was a labor of love that took weeks to accomplish while she toiled over the tunic susanna made her husbands trunk hose and the velvet cap with the hawks feather he would wear she had also gone to the cobbler and had a pair of soft leather shoes with turnedback cuffs made along with a pair of fine leather boots for her husband lara took the shoes and embroidered their cuffs to match her fathers tunic and then to their surprise one day sir ferris ironshield arrived at the door of their hovel i have come to inspect the application garments he said in his gruff voice my husband is not here susanna said nervously of course he isnt sir ferris growled he is on the practice field where i left him with sir ajax and sir iven he has improved tremendously under our tutelage mistress i have no doubt that in a few weeks he will be one of us come in sir lara beckoned giving her stepmother a moment to recover i will fetch das garments which we have completed only yesterday yes susanna finally found her tongue may i offer you a bit of cider sir ferris while lara brings my husbands clothing she ushered him to the bench by the fire sit down please she bustled to pour the cider into her best wooden cup and handed it to him quickly he drank it appreciatively it has been a long time since i have visited the quarter he noted nothing here seems to change i fear it is still a poor place and i hear the mercenarys guild is now taking a fee from its men to provide them with work shameful but what can you expect with so much of their custom going to nonmembers i did not know susanna said softly nay i expect your man would keep it from you well not to fret mistress youll soon be ensconced in the garden district where you belong here are my das garments sir lara said as she brought forth the tunic and held it out for him to see the trunk hose are skyblue silk and my stepmother will fetch his cap that you may see it sir ferris carefully looked over everything they displayed to his view the tunic was quite magnificent and the shoe cuffs were a nice touch the application officers would be very impressed without a doubt it was the garment of a crusader knight when he saw the velvet cap susanna showed him he nodded with a pleased smile excellent mistress and you have been wise enough to avoid those damned white plumes almost every applicant feels he needs to put in his cap the hawks feather is elegant and most manly john swiftsword would stand out with just the cap alone he stood up you have done well and i am content that with a good performance on the field john swiftsword will soon become a crusader knight i thank you for the cider then with a stiff little bow to them both he departed the hovel imagine susanna finally managed to say he came to us he must really like your father and think well of him i am so proud when we are settled in our new home i shall ask him and his two friends to dine with us i must begin your gown tomorrow lara said you would not show me the material you obtained susanna complained will you show it to me now lara laughed very well but you must swear you will trust me to make the gown for you i am in your hands susanna chuckled now show me the fabric lara went to the chest on the far side of the room and lifted out a carefully wrapped packet bringing it to the table she undid it and susanna gasped its too beautiful she cried i am not worthy of such loveliness it is perfect lara said i have planned a simple design for a more elaborate garment would not be suitable for an applicants wife but the fabric itself susanna held it up and against her the lilac silk had a shimmering and iridescent quality to it it was quite unique the fabric lara told her stepmother is perfect with your dark brown hair and eyes and your skin has a lovely rosy glow to it when i saw it i knew it was for you susanna began to cry and lara snatched the material from her lest her tears stain the fabric i wish you didnt have to leave us she said and thought for the first time that she actually meant it my fate isnt with you and da lara replied i do not know where it will be but i know it isnt with you perhaps that is my faerie blood speaking and then the winter was over and lara celebrated her fifteenth birthday with the spring the day of the applications was upon them her father had risen early and susanna with him he had bathed himself completely in the wooden tub not just his body but his hair as well susanna had shaved his handsome face smooth being careful not to nick and bloody her husband she called for lara to come and put the tunic on her father when he was garbed in his skyblue trunk hose and the dark blue shirt whose sleeves would show from beneath the tunic together lara and susanna drew the tunic over johns head the garment fell and lara carefully closed the little silver frogs at the neckline she stood back and smiled pleased da you have never looked so grand sir ferris told us that these are the garments of a crusader knight and he was surely right fastening the embroidered belt about the tunic she knelt and fitted the soft leather shoes to her fathers feet susanna handed her husband his velvet cap he placed it on his head drawing it to one side and the hawks feather jutted jauntily he strutted about the hovel proudly and then turning to his wife and daughter he said thank you lara went to the door of the hovel and unbarred it go now susanna said when you return i will have a meal for you he strode from the dwelling and when he was out of sight susanna turned to speak to her stepdaughter but lara was nowhere to be found susanna chuckled her stepdaughter she had not a doubt had followed her father that she might stand in the crowd in the citys main square and watch john swiftsword as he made his application to the tournament of the crusader knights and was formally and publicly accepted she was entitled to this little triumph susanna thought generously for it was laras sacrifice that had made this all possible lara had snatched up a dark cloak so that she might remain anonymous as she hurried through the streets already the citizens were gathering to witness this rare event reaching the square she pushed herself to the front of the crowds but no one seemed to mind her slender form was no more than a breeze as it brushed by them all she saw her father standing in the long line that already stretched halfway across the square listening she heard comments of the onlookers they seemed to know most of the applicants either by name or by reputation john swiftsword felt his heart pumping with excitement looking about him he decided that he was the best dressed of all the applicants and he smiled at the prevalence of white plumes susanna had told him the story of shopping at the feather merchants and sir ferriss comment when he had visited the hovel he tried to calm himself for the interview ahead he didnt want to sound like a bumbling idiot it wasnt just the honor of belonging to this order that thrilled him it was the opportunity to truly serve hetar the crusader knights were retained by the high council as a deterrent against savages and chaos they had always been and they would always be while there had been no great wars in many years and hetar was a peaceful kingdom only the presence of the crusader knights protected hetar from those in the outlands the outlanders were barbarians with no rule of law and he often wondered why the celestial actuary had created them at all the sun rose over the square and the chill of the spring morning was warmed by its rays then suddenly john swiftsword found himself facing a crusader knight and his attempt to step into a better world began the knight behind the table looked him over very carefully name he barked john swiftsword of the mercenary guild was his voice squeaking the crusader nodded and wrote it down then he said turn about please john swung around slowly appearance excellent the crusader knight said and checked off a small box on the parchment application place of origin the midlands fathers occupation farmer how long a mercenary since age fifteen your age now thirtyone married yes children two have you sired sons or daughters a son with my wife and a daughter with a faerie woman he replied and you desire more sons aye who is your sponsor john swiftsword the crusader knight asked sir ferris ironshield he replied his throat was getting dryer by the minute any secondaries sir ajax and sir iven first battle skill the sword was the proud reply secondary skills the crusader knight demanded sharply lance mace and axe was that sweat running down his back you are a talented soldier the crusader knight said with a small smile your application is accepted by the tournament committee john swiftsword what colors will you wear when you fight green and gold john said green for laras eyes and gold for her hair he would honor his daughter in this fashion the crusader knight marked it down on the application and then wrote in large letters across the face of the parchment accepted i shall look forward to seeing you on tournament day you will draw a number now to determine the day upon which you will do battle he held out a velvet bag to the applicant john plunged his hand into the bag and drew out a tile he handed it to the crusader knight it says one he noted then you fight on the first day that is good you will have time to rest up for the final battle congratulations step aside next he stepped away from the table halfdazed and walked into the crowds pressing in about the square suddenly he felt a small hand slip into his and he knew at once it was his daughters were you able to see he asked not even bothering to look at her i was right up front da you looked so lordly and your voice was so strong and sure i was very proud im sorry mikhail wasnt old enough to see this day but you will tell him about it when he is wont you aye lass i will and i will tell him of his half faerie sister whose beauty made it all possible john swiftsword said softly i have not said it before lara thank you then stopping he bent and kissed her smooth forehead i am not unhappy da i know my mother broke your heart but the beauty i have inherited from her will atone for her sin and we will both begin new lives i am happy you are certain of that lara i could not bear if you were unhappy aye ilona broke my heart but your loving sweetness has healed my hurt long since i am happy da i swear it and besides she teased him it is too late to go back now for i doubt the mercer would accept your tunic in exchange for his cloth he laughed lara could always wheedle him from the deepest doldrums and he had been very torn over these last months he had fretted like an old woman but now he must release all his crochets and fears lara was right it was much too late to go back he must clear his mind and heart of all darkness in six days the tourney would begin and while everyone was certain that he would win his place among the finalists nothing in life john swiftsword knew was ever a certainty chapter but he did win as they had all predicted he had slept little the night before but from excitement not from nervousness he rose early bathed and then he had gone off to the tournament field where sir ferris sir ajax and sir iven awaited him in a small tent he had checked his weapons and lifted each of aristaeuss hooves to be certain they were clean and free of stones that might impede the animals performance the three old knights had helped him to dress the call to the joust had sounded and he had mounted his warhorse ridden out and prevailed over all his opponents it had been he thought shockingly simple there had been no time to look for his wife and family in the stands he would not have known where gaius prosperos box was anyway when she awoke on the morning of the tournament lara had found her father already gone her stepmother was weeping softly in a corner by the fire what is the matter susanna she inquired anxiously what if he loses susanna said sobbing then it has all been for naught irritation pricked at laras nerves but she restrained from shouting at susanna for even considering such a thing and bringing bad luck on her father da will prevail she told her stepmother do not think to bring ill fortune on him susanna now we must bathe quickly our litters will be here shortly i am certain no sooner had they finished bathing than mistress mildred arrived to help them with mikhail she was dressed in her finest gown for susanna had invited her to accompany them go about your business my dears she said i will dress the laddie and have him ready youve nursed him susanna aye hes content susanna replied she hurried to don the beautiful gown lara had made for her it was of lilac silk brocade with wide flared sleeves with dagged edges the waist was high and beneath the bosom lara had embroidered a band with a swirling design of silver and gold the neckline had a simple white silk collar it was elegant but not overdone on her dark head susanna would wear a heartshaped headdress her hair was done up beneath a crispinette of fine gold mesh a knock sounded and mistress mildred hurried to answer it tis too early for the litters she grumbled but opening the door she discovered a large woman with a basket i am tania i was sent by my master to do the slave laras hair she said come in come in the girl is just out of her bath mistress mildred said lara here is a woman to fix your lovely hair gaius prospero sent her she called i was not expecting such kindness lara said coming forward wrapped in a drying sheet kindness hah tania scoffed you are being displayed to future buyers girl and nothing more you must be shown at your best sit down at that table i will need it to hold my tools you will not garb yourself until your hair is fashioned i have seen the gown and since it fastens at the shoulders you can step into it lara sat down and tania began brushing out the girls long hair until it was a smooth thick sheet standing back she considered her next course of action reaching into the basket she drew out strings of beads they were tiny gold silver crystal and pearls strung on almost invisible gold chains tania took a hank of laras silverygold hair and fashioned it into a thin braid then she wove several more narrow plaits into which she fastened the slender gold chains studded with their beads of silver and gold these she interspersed with the strings of little pearls and sparkling crystals weaving them into the tops of the braids which lay atop a background of laras thick hair let us get you dressed now and i will finish my work tania said the gown gaius prospero had sent for lara was simple and virginal yet sensual and exotic it was sleeveless fastening at the shoulders and having a round neckline that lay at the base of her collarbone the material was of creamy silk diaphanous and shot through with gold her entire young body was quite visible susanna brought the garment forward wait tania said and she reached into her basket her nipples must be rouged to draw the eye to them she drew forth a small round container removed its lid and pulling away laras drying sheet briskly colored the young girls nipples give it a moment to dry and then we will put your gown on she said laras pale cheeks grew rosy with her blushes should a virgins breasts be so displayed susanna asked nervously the girl is to be a pleasure woman mistress today our master will display her to her best advantage to gain the highest price already the rumors abound about her faerie beauty and i can see that none will be disappointed she has a lovely bosom and it must be shown come they should be dry now quickly the garment lara could tell by the stunned looks of mistress mildred and susanna that her gown was everything gaius prospero intended it to be she wished there was a glass in the hovel as there had been at gaius prosperos home she had removed the hair from her pubic mound as her master had instructed her to do her mound seemed somehow plumper without its covering of golden curls tania set a small circular cap of gold and silver mesh dotted with crystals on her head then she placed a thin cloth of gold cloak about the girls shoulders you are ready now and the litter should be waiting for you tania said i will see you in a few days when you come to the masters house thank you lara said softly you have been kind i have done my duty as i was instructed tania said gruffly but the girls simple gratitude pleased her the attiring woman might be a slave but she appreciated good manners she had served many a girl like lara for her master some were frightened and wept constantly others were aware of the opportunity being offered them and became proud and rude this girl was different not only was she the most beautiful girl tania had ever seen there was something about her tania scrambled to find a word within her mind but she could not it had to be the girls faerie blood she finally decided good day mistress she said to susanna and then she was gone leaving the door open behind her outside they saw the litters were indeed awaiting them susanna took her son from mistress mildred who was helped into the vehicle by one of the bearers it was constructed of solid ebony striped with gold and hung with sheer red curtains mikhail turned nervously as he was handed to the older woman and was about to cry a protest until his mother entered the litter his little mouth closed even as he began to inspect his new surroundings with his bright eyes lara had made her baby brother a little tunic of the blue and silver fabric lara entered her own transport which was painted silver and hung with sheer turquoise silk curtains she lounged luxuriously upon plump cushions of coral and gold as if she had always traveled in such a manner she felt the litter lifted up and the four bearers set off at a brisk pace they quickly departed the quarter moving through narrow streets that eventually opened into broader avenues they crossed the great square where lara had watched her fathers application be accepted for the tourney taking an avenue that led through the tournament gate out to the large field where the tourney was held every three years the gate itself was opened only for the tournament the litter bearers stopped and the curtains were drawn aside a plump beringed hand lara recognized immediately offered itself to help her out gaius prospero beamed at her nodding with approval as he lifted the cloak a moment to see the gown ahh he noted i see tania has rouged your nipples the woman has incredible instincts i could not do without her assistance you look lovely lara i foresee a golden future for my golden faerie girl he chuckled i am but half faerie master lara replied and i know no magic just as well gaius prospero responded but you have the faerie look lara and that is important for none are more beautiful than your mothers race even the coastal peoples are not as fair but come and you as well mistress susanna i will take you to my private box my wife and children are there today for john swiftswords reputation is famous and todays jousts will be legend he led them to the covered pavilion whose awning shaded comfortable chairs with leather seats and backs their wooden arms and legs decorated with gilded carvings a woman a man and three children were already there my wife the lady vilia gaius prospero said here is the lovely lara my dear is she not perfect as i have said and laras stepmother mistress susanna her son and the little lads nursemaid it did not occur to gaius prospero that poor people did not employ nursemaids for their children susanna was about to correct his interpretation when she caught mistress mildreds eye and the old woman shook her head in warning susanna smiled and said i am honored to meet you my lady vilia and i you the lady vilia replied she was an attractive woman not a great deal older than susanna ohh i love babies she cooed at mikhail who gave her a large and toothless smile a second wife obviously lara thought silently wealthy men like gaius prospero were known to divorce older wives and take young ones as if a young wife would keep them young too this is my secretary jonah gaius prospero spoke again but he was addressing lara alone his wife susanna and mistress mildred were already chattering like old friends as for aubin prospero he was looking as bored as any child would he wanted the jousting to begin his two older sisters looked at lara and giggled behind their hands we are beginning to attract some notice my lord jonah said i think it is time to remove the girls cloak may i the master of the merchants nodded imperceptibly jonah lifted the garment from laras shoulders and laid it carefully aside taking her hand he drew her forward so she might be seen in all her golden beauty across the tournament field where the mistresses of the pleasure houses and the magnates sat there was an immediate stirring of interest are the invitations out yet gaius prospero asked his secretary yesterday my lord the acceptances will come quickly now i suspect there was almost a smile on his narrow lips sit down now lara her master said quietly she did and took the opportunity to gaze about the field flags flew everywhere to their left were the magnates and the mistresses of the pleasure houses to their right sat the crusader knights their families and their guests at the opposite end of the field was the entry where the contestants would enter gaius prosperos pavilion was but one of six at his end there were few places for ordinary folk but many managed to clamber up onto the low stone walls that surrounded the field the tournament began with a flourish of trumpets and the combatants paraded into the ring and past the crusader knights stopping to dip their lances to their leader the grande knight before riding off the field next came the pairing of contestants and the jousting began lara cried out with delight as her father unhorsed his first opponent then leapt from his steed to do battle afoot but the young man yielded without a fight amid the boos of the spectators several times more that day john swiftsword rode forth to do battle defeating aspirant after aspirant at days end he was the only one left standing and was declared the winner of the first day his place within the ranks of the crusader knights was assured on the last day of the tourney he and the other four winners would battle symbolically with each other and members of the knightly order then they would be knighted in the arena by the grande knight lara and her companions were returned home in the litters that had brought them susanna hurried to remove her beautiful gown and don a more sensible garment so she might prepare a fine feast for her husbands victory already word had spread throughout the quarter of john swiftswords victory that day and neighbors were pushing into their hovel to taste a small bit of his victory lara had slipped immediately into the tiny chamber she shared with her baby brother and removed the exquisite garment she had worn that day it was not for inhabitants of the quarter she wiped the rouge from her nipples and slipped on her plain roundnecked gown of dark blue then she carefully removed the slender gold chains from her hair undid the elaborate plaits that tania had fashioned earlier and redressed her tresses into two simple braids then she went out to assist her stepmother except for the neighbors life was as it had always been her father arrived home on foot for aristaeus was already stabled in the garden district he smelled of wine for sir ferris sir ajax and sir iven had insisted they celebrate his victorytheir victorytogether in just five more days he would be knighted and officially one of them but as exhausted as he was from his physical travails and as tired as he was from the strain of worrying if he was really good enough to win the day he greeted his neighbors with charm and goodwill what had begun as a small celebration given by his family now turned into a quarterwide fest this was a great moment for the mercenaries one of their own had not reached the rank of crusader knight in over sixty years food was shared ale and cider flowed and it was well past midnight when the quarter finally grew silent the next morning a page was sent from the garden district to accompany the future sir john swiftsword and his family as they chose which house they would have among those currently available susanna was beside herself with excitement lara must come her father said but it will not be her home susanna said carelessly she could think of nothing else but that she would soon have a real house where i am my daughter will always have a home john swiftsword said sternly to his wife she has earned the right to see what her sacrifice has gained us susannas face fell as she realized how unkind her words had sounded she turned to her stepdaughter oh lara forgive me lara laughed and put her arm through susannas lets go and see your new dwelling she said softly i know you meant me no harm outside they discovered a cart drawn by two pretty gray donkeys with johns horse tied to the back of it he mounted aristaeus while the young page helped lara and susanna into the cart which was white and had gaily painted wheels they sat facing one another upon red leather benches the page joined the driver at the front of the cart and they were off the soontobe crusader knight riding by their side reaching the garden district they were met by sir ferris there are several fine houses just now available he told them smiling broadly i of course have my preference but i will be curious to know which dwelling pleases my lady susanna he helped the two from their cart well walk he said the day is fair and most are at the tournament oh susanna said nervously should we have gone today nay my dear the old crusader knight told her your man has won his place and now he is not expected back at the tournament field until his knighting day i should not like to do the wrong thing susanna confided to sir ferris this is all so new for me and i am after all just a farmers daughter so are many of the women you will soon meet among our stratum although some have forgotten their humbler beginnings and occasionally need to be reminded sir ferris chuckled wickedly i am very good at that susanna laughed at the twinkle in his eye when he spoke i think sir you were a most naughty fellow in your youth still am came the quick reply they were shown seven homes and susanna marveled at the size and number of the chambers she exclaimed at the wonderful light and the privacy never in all her days had she seen such fine homes except on the day she had gone into the golden district these houses were smaller of course but they still had many of the same fine features it was difficult but she finally selected a house built around an inner courtyard with a shallow narrow reflecting pool in its center at first she considered if the pool might not be a danger to mikhail but sir ferris poohpoohed her fears you will be given three welltrained household slaves my dear a maidservant to help you a nursemaid for your children for you will certainly have more and of course one manservant to do the heavy work and look after your little garden you have chosen wisely for this is the dwelling i would have chosen we have a garden susanna was surprised the house itself with its inner courtyard seemed more than adequate a walled garden behind your home he answered her it has an apple tree susanna began to weep softly there was an apple tree outside my bedchamber at home on my fathers farm she said sir ferris patted her arm and smiled well pleased now that is settled i shall send you and lara off to the crusader knights warehouse so you may choose your furnishings men are useless in such an endeavor you may bring a few personal possessions from the quarter but nothing else he explained we like our new knights and their families to fit right in your husband will meet you at home later my dear they returned to the cart and were taken out of the garden district to a large building on the edge of the city there they were greeted by the manager a selfimportant little man who escorted them through the warehouse as susanna made her choices of furniture draperies and all manner of household goods lara at her side when they had concluded their business the manager assured them all would be delivered on the morrow early and if my lady would be there to tell the movers where to put everything it would certainly be helpful gracious susanna exclaimed as they were returned to the quarter i have never in all my life had such a day nor could have even imagined one like this we are both beginning new lives lara responded the garden district was lovely and the house susanna had chosen was beautiful lara wondered if her new home would be as fine but then the pleasure quarter was said to have some of the loveliest houses in all of the city she had never been there of course but it was said and if it was said then it surely must be true the following day when lara and susanna arrived at the new house they found three slaves awaiting them the trio bowed politely i am nels and this is yera and ove the man said indicating the women who stood beside him we now belong to john swiftsword and are bound to obey him and his wife mistress for a moment susanna was speechless but lara quickly spoke up my stepmother the lady susanna thanks you serve her well and you will be treated well serve her badly and you will be beaten susanna now recovered which among you is the nursemaid she asked she didnt know what she was going to do without lara who seemed to have instincts beyond her knowledge and above her station i am my lady the younger of the two women curtsied and you are susanna said ove my lady my son is called mikhail he does not yet walk but he will in a few weeks you must keep him from the reflecting pool at all times ove yes my lady the girl replied the furniture arrived and the rest of the day was spent deciding where it would be placed yera took charge of all the household supplies and began to set up the kitchen susanna was kept busy running from place to place making decisions while lara quietly directed nels in the hanging of the draperies on the following day nels arrived in a cart at the hovel to collect the few personal items they would be taking with them when they departed on the day of the knighting they would not return again a young mercenary and his bridetobe had already been assigned their hovel at the end of the knighting ceremony lara would spend a final night with her family on the following day she would be taken to gaius prosperos home and after that she knew not what on the day of the knighting the master of the merchants sent his litters for them as he had on the first day of the tourney john had already gone ahead tania arrived once again and this time she braided laras magnificent long hair into a single braid into which she wove fresh flowers lara and susanna donned their fine gowns tania departed and without a backward glance susanna picked up her son and hurried to the waiting litter but lara remained for several more minutes looking about her she felt tears coming and forced them back this was her home the only home she had ever known she had been comfortable here with her grandmother ina and her father and after her grandmothers death and the passing of the initial sadness she had never been lonely there was dear old mistress mildred her grandmothers best friend nearby and then susanna had come she knew every inch of the quarter for she had explored it over the years but she had never had any friends as a child she remembered playing with other children but after her grandmother died there were fewer and then none of them she had heard the word faerie murmured often enough as she passed by why did people hate her mothers race so much her grandmother had said it was because they were so beautiful and people were jealous of such beauty but not just the beauty ina said there was faerie magic to be feared faeries were different from ordinary folk you never really knew what a faerie would do they could be the kindest of all creatures and the most vindictive their women seduced human menfolk out of spite because their menfolk seduced human women who seemed to give them intense pleasure more so ina said with a wise nod than the faerie women who had cold hearts lara knew she looked like her mother for her father had always said so but did she have a faeries cold heart she wondered with a final look around the hovel lara stepped through the door for the final time there she found mistress mildred waiting the old woman hugged the girl and there were tears streaming down her face reaching up with a dainty hand lara brushed some of them from mistress mildreds lined face and smiled sweetly dont weep she said softly ive known you since the day your father came to his mother my friend ina with you all swaddled in his arms i wasnt born here lara was surprised nay you was born in an enchanted place or so your da told his mother you was six months old when the faerie woman who bore you left him he awoke one morning to find himself and you on the edge of the forestland he said that he had gone to sleep the previous evening in the magic place where he lived with the faerie and you were in your cradle mistress mildred shook her head your da was barely fifteen when the faerie woman lured him away from his familys farm your grandfather had died during that time and your uncle who had inherited the farm would not allow his brother to remain when he returned with you he did not even want you in his house for you were half faerie and he feared you but your grandmothers will prevailed and he said you might remain until your father joined the mercenaries once that was accomplished your grandmother brought you to live in the city she was so angry at her eldest sons behavior that she stayed to care for you rather than go back ina never spoke to him again or even saw his children i know he did not come to her departure ceremony after she died i dont believe your father ever forgave his brother for it how odd that i should know none of this lara murmured tonight before you are separated from your father ask him to tell you about your mother child mistress mildred said then she kissed lara on the forehead and gave her another hug the celestial actuary will protect you i know thank you lara responded kissing the old ladys withered cheek and hugging her back then she turned and got into her litter drawing the curtains she settled back she would not look again she felt the bearers lifting her transport up and they began to hurry through the city toward the tournament gate and to the grandstand where she would alight and enter gaius prosperos box once again she could hear the murmur of the crowds as they drew closer to the tourney grounds now and again the litter bearers would slow until the mercenaries hired to clear their way could force people aside when the litter was finally set down it was aubin prospero who drew the curtains aside and handed her out my father has sent me to escort you he said i am learning his trade and will one day be the master of the merchants myself who told you that lara asked him as she exited the vehicle it is an elected office young master my mother told me he replied and my mother is always correct come and he led her up the steps of the box how old are you lara asked him i was eight on my last natal day the boy responded do you not play games he was just eight and he sounded like an old man games are for those with no goals in life aubin prospero answered her games are for the poor i have no time for games there is so much to learn lara shook her head poor child she thought to herself ah lara here you are at last gaius prospero was beaming at her reaching out his grasp closed about the gold chain with its crystal star what is this he asked her curious fingering the star that seemed warm to his touch it is the only thing other than life that my mother gave me she answered him you will not take it from me my lord gaius prospero thought a moment and then he said nay i will not it burnishes your natural beauty each time i see you i am amazed at your beauty my dear are you excited to see my father knighted oh yes my lord lara said nay i mean about tomorrow night tomorrow morning you will be brought to my house and spend your day being prepared for display that evening when i shall accept bids for your person my dear but only for a days span after that you must be sold promptly it is not wise to hold choice merchandise for too long lest the excitement surrounding it wane although i do not expect that to happen in your particular case he smiled broadly tomorrow night will be a very exciting one for you i was not aware of how it was to be done lara responded i have never been to a slave auction and you shall not be part of one my dear child gaius prospero clucked nothing so common for you my beauty as a public display rare merchandise is offered privately only a choice number of guests have been invited to view you the following day they will return in the morning to offer me their bids you will not be there it will not be necessary when the bidding has ceased and i have accepted the highest bidder the agreement will be struck under our laws pleasures houses can only be owned by men but they are managed by women both have been invited to your displaying i see lara said this was the most amazing new world she was about to enter the trumpets sounded with a grand flourish and they all turned their eyes to the arena a dozen trumpeters in red and gold livery the sun gleaming off their shining brass instruments were standing at the knights entrance to the exhibition area several crusader knights and the new candidates galloped forth and did mock battle before the delighted crowds when they had finished a parade of the high officers of the crusader knights entered led by the grande knight the five men who would be knighted this day and their opponents joined the great procession around the circuit they rode to the cheering of the crowds gathered lara susanna and little mikhail clapped wildly as john swiftsword passed them wearing his fine armor his horse was caparisoned in green and gold and several ribbons of the same color flew from his lance finally the procession came to a halt the knights all dismounted their horses held by young pages the grande knight took his place upon a raised dais and each of the new knights came forward one at a time to kneel before him they were bareheaded as they knelt and each man clearly recited the oath of loyalty to hetar before the grande knight tapped them with his sword of honor and raised each one up to present the new member of the crusader knights to the citizens gathered four of the men were known to come from crusader knight families john swiftsword however received the loudest cheers for he was the everyman who had overcome obstacles to gain his rightful place among this high order of warriors he was a popular hero today and his companions were happy to allow him his moment each of the other men was secretly glad he had not been fighting on the first day of the tournament for none of them was certain that they could have prevailed over john swiftsword he was a great asset to their group and when it had become known that he was prepared to apply for this tournament the leaders among them had been greatly pleased and were prepared to welcome him it was not by accident he had fought the first day of the tournament the tournament was now officially over and the crowds began to stream out of the arena and through the tournament gate which would when all had reentered the city be closed again for another three years lara told gaius prospero that she could easily share susannas litter with her baby brother i do not need to be paraded into the garden district before all some of the knights might one day come to my pleasure house and it could prove embarrassing for them and for my father he nodded understanding you will want to spend your last few hours with your family alone i quite understand my beauty susanna was quiet as the litter made its way through the gates and toward the garden district mikhail had fallen asleep in laras lap the slight rocking motion of the litter lulling him into slumber this is all a dream but i hope i never wake up susanna finally said i cannot believe that i am not returning to our hovel but to a beautiful house with a real garden my sisters will be so envious of me how they mocked me when i prepared to wed your father scorning him because he was a humble mercenary now they shall see he has risen high and i with him lara laughed why stepmother she said i have never seen this side of you susanna grinned back at the girl they were very mean lara they never saw what a good man your father was the matchmaker gave me the choice of three men but i wanted only your father they said a mercenary would amount to naught do you love my father lara wondered aloud i do her stepmother said enthusiastically im glad the girl replied it makes it easier for me to go away susanna sighed thank you seems like two small words in light of what you have done for your father for mikhail and for me i do not know if you will be permitted to come home once you have been purchased she stopped and then her eyes filled with tears it is not fair she sobbed susanna you are older than i and should know that life is often unfair lara gently chided her stepmother you were wise to suggest i be sold we will all have a much better life because of it especially mikhail he will never remember the quarter or the hovel in which he was born my fathers soft heart will be the undoing of him but that you are there for him i am glad for it i know i am five years older than you susanna said but sometimes you seem so much older even than your father lara laughed i expect that is my faerie blood she said i am told they are different fromfromwell you know what i mean susanna being both faerie and human i have no idea really where i belong i always thought i belonged in the human world but now with all this fuss being made over what is called my faerie beauty i do not know at all where i belong the litter came to a halt and was set down immediately the curtains were opened up and nels helped susanna from the vehicle welcome home mistress he said ove take the little master from the girl the girl susanna said sharply is sir johns daughter and will be treated with courtesy nels help my stepdaughter from the litter grudgingly the slave man obeyed his new mistress the girl was known to be half faerie and would be shortly entering a pleasure house faeries were not to be tolerated he was glad the girl would be gone on the morrow he was startled when lara thanked him for his service and wondered if she had put a spell on him inside her new house susanna began giving orders her husband would want a bath when he arrived home they were to begin their preparations immediately mikhail was to be bathed at once brought to her for feeding and then put to bed dinner a simple meal she had discussed with yera the day before was to be served in the first hour of the twilight wine would be served as well for they would be celebrating the new knight arrived just before sunset he was slightly drunk for the order had been celebrating the induction of its new members his bath was waiting susanna ready with her scrubbing brush mikhail was already in his bed lara smiled at the splashing and laughter she heard coming from the bathing room from the first day of the tournament when he had won all his matches she had seen a great change in her father all the weariness and care that had been weighing him down lifted from his shoulders he looked young again and in these past months with the scarcity of work he had looked so worried and worn part of lara was happy that her life was taking this new turn but another part of her was slightly apprehensive she was leaving her family she was leaving everything she had ever known and for what the unknown she would be a vessel for a mans desires men it seemed got pleasure from putting their manroot into a females body this knowledge was hardly a secret among girls her age she had listened secreting herself about the edges of groups of giggling girls in the quarter learning what friends had she had any might have shared with her susanna had been willing finally to answer all her questions with gaius prosperos permission ignorance in such matters was not to be tolerated hetarian girls were supposed to be prepared to please their husbands and their lovers finally her father and stepmother joined her in the garden where a table was set up for them to dine john swiftsword kissed his daughters brow i am glad that we can have this evening together he said as he seated her at the dining table i have questions that i beg you answer me before i leave you lara said quietly questions about my mother and my birth you have never spoken on it but you must tell me now da mistress mildred said things to me today before we left the quarter and she told me i must ask you before i could not will you tell me aye i will tell you all but let us have our meal first he responded and i will speak only with you for ilona warned me that should i ever speak of her before another woman i love that woman would cease to love me and so susanna can hear naught of what i would say to you this night he turned to his wife lara looked anxiously toward her stepmother i will leave you after the meal susanna promised i do not choose to hear of laras mother she said but nothing you say john could make me stop loving you you do not understand faerie magic wife was his cryptic reply nels served them the meal yera had prepared they began with a delicate cold soup of pureed peaches and plums topped with sour cream next came a salad of baby lettuces and herbs to be followed by a juicy capon that had been roasted golden and a platter of ham slices as well as fresh warm small breads that had been twisted into graceful shapes there was sweet butter on the table and a small dish of salt salt had always been a rarity in the quarter when the fine pottery plates had been cleared away smaller plates were placed before them and a bowl of fruit was set in the center of the table lara had never in her life seen fruit other than oranges fruits were reserved for the privileged classes nels to his credit had explained everything to them as they ate the wine in their crystal goblets was sweet and heady with the aroma of its grapes lara felt sleepy but she forced herself back from the brink remembering that gaius prosperos people would come early for her and she must speak with her father before she slept da she said softly john swiftsword was looking at his nubile wife and considering how much he was going to enjoy futtering her in that fine new bed in their bedchamber very shortly his first act as a crusader knight would be to get susanna with child again another son for the order and then his daughters gentle voice pierced his consciousness i have not forgotten he told her susanna arose from the dining table walking around the table she kissed lara tenderly good night she said simply and left the room she could not bring herself to say goodbye let us walk in the garden the new knight said to his daughter what i have to say is for your ears alone daughter he led her not to the inner courtyard where someone might have secreted themselves in the shadows of the portico but rather out into the small walled garden with its apple tree there they sat upon a rustic wooden bench now tell me what it is you would know lara and i will answer begin at the beginning she replied i would know all there is really not that much her father answered her it was shortly after my fifteenth birthday midsummers eve my friends and i were gathered about our fire flirting with the girls we knew dancing and drinking and lying about our adventures with those same girls and then for the briefest moment it seemed as if the whole world was frozen in time and i saw ilona standing in the shadows at the edge of a woodland i remember my mouth falling open i had never in all my days seen such beauty the long golden gilt hair the eyes as green as new leaves in springtime a body so tempting and lush that i knew she was magic and i was afraid then she beckoned me and i could not help but go to her suddenly i could hear my friends behind me calling me back i could hear the crackle of the fire but i could not for the life of me turn away from the vision who called me so sweetly and so silently i reached out to her and she took my hand in hers leading me away to her secret bower in the forest i should have been afraid but i wasnt i knew the tales of those bewitched and i had always wondered why they allowed themselves to be taken by the faerie folk now i knew ilona was utterly impossible to resist i didnt care what happened to me as long as i might be with her you were conceived that very night lara it amused her that i had never known a woman in the fullest sense before at first she was tender and gentle with me then she began to teach me what pleased a lover later she said i was the best pupil she had ever had it was because of my innocence that she let her guard down that night and conceived you i dont understand da lara said to him faerie women conceive children only when they want them lara if they do not want them they do not have them unlike human women who conceive more often than not when their lovers mount them and spill their seed remember that for i do not know if you have that ability of your mothers i pray that you do i stayed with ilona during the months in which she carried you i thought not of the morrow but only of how much i loved herand i did from the moment i laid my eyes on her i love her still in spite of it all but i love susanna too and i am wise enough to know i shall never have a love like the one i had for ilona again so i content myself with my good wife and am glad the matchmaker found her for me when i was with your mother everything i did every thought i had was for her and her alone she consumed me entirely and i did not care what happened to me as long as i was with her and then you were born she birthed you quickly and easily and once she had seen you she lost interest in you i was stunned for from the moment you entered the world i loved you but for ilona the mystery and the excitement was over and she began to lose interest in me where did you live during this time da lara asked her father in her bower in the woodland he said i cant really describe it to you for it seemed to have no walls or roof but we were warm in the winter and the rain never touched us our bed was made of moss and covered in a downy quilt you slept in a cradle that i made you which hung from a tree branch if my mother ignored me how did i survive who fed me what did i eat lara wondered your mother bewitched a young girl she found lost in the wood one day and by magic put her milk in the girls breasts she fed you several times a day and then would fall into an enchanted slumber but as the next midsummers eve approached i saw your mother less and less she began to wander i no longer held her interest in desperation i told her i intended to take you and return to my family oh she said you understand dont you you are truly the most unique human i have ever had as a lover john thank you yes yes go and take lara with you for she will not be accepted in my faerie world you have my blessing which will one day bring you good fortune and lara will have my blessing as well i have loved you both and then i found myself growing weary and when i awoke i was on the edge of the woodlands and you were carefully and neatly swaddled and lying next to me you were but three months of age he paused and wiped a tear from his eye so my mother abandoned us both da lara said if she loved me but then she didnt love me not really not the way susanna loves mikhail i am sorry to hurt you her father said but you would know all shall i go on lara nodded aye please da it was early morning he continued the grass and flowers were wet with dew yet we were not nor was the ground beneath us there had been a midsummer bonfire nearby in almost the exact same place as the previous year i recognized several of my friends asleep about its warm embers i picked you up and walked past them back to our farm the first person i saw was your grandmother she was drawing water from the well and seeing me she dropped her bucket to come running when she saw you she knew immediately who your mother was and she wept why da because you were a faeries daughter you would not be accepted by my family she brought us into the farmhouse and sat me down to learn the whole story of my disappearance and when i had related all to her she told me my father had died in the winter and my oldest brother was now the head of the family dorjan has never been an easy man he is the first of my parents children i was the last we had seven sisters between us he was already grown when i was born i was scarcely a welcome addition in his world the first words i ever recall him saying to me were the farm is mine that morning when he discovered i had returned he was not pleased at all and when he learned i had brought my half faerie child with me he grew angry and accused me of drawing disaster onto his house i would have to go he said and take my faerie brat with me it was then your grandmother spoke up indeed she said i would have to go to the city and join the guild of mercenaries to earn my living but first she would have me rest myself a few days for my sojourn in the woodland would have weakened me and her granddaughter would remain with her after i departed for the city your brother can scarce apply for the guild carrying a child in one arm lara stays with me and i will care for her your grandmother said when john is settled then his daughter shall join him and who shall care for the babe in the city my brother dorjan demanded to know i will your grandmother replied my brother was astounded but she went on you have a wife who has resented my presence since the day your father died now she will be sole mistress of this house it was then my brother who often spoke before he thought a matter through said if you leave my house mother you will not be welcome back if you leave you choose the faerie over your real grandchildren i cannot abide such a thing i can still remember the cold smile that touched your grandmothers lips at his words but she said nothing and he foolish man did not know what he had done i did though i knew that the day she left her comfortable farmhouse to live in a mercenarys hovel in the city she would never return she was mistress of that great farmhouse dorjans wife was a meek creature who harbored all manner of resentments but was lazy she might be annoyed having her motherinlaw as mistress of the house but my mother kept that house in perfect order i can but imagine what happened when your grandmother left them to come to the city he chuckled dorjans wife was no housekeeper so you came to the city and joined the mercenary guild lara said how did you become so proficient with the sword a young fellow joining the guild is sent to training school which is one reason i couldnt send for you as quickly as i would have wanted john explained the old swordmaster running the school saw i had a knack for the sword for i had begun to learn its use from a retired mercenary at home the swordmaster drilled me mercilessly in its proper use he had been famous in his day when i finally beat him in a mock combat he said he could teach me no more that i was better than he had ever been it was quite a compliment on his recommendation i was hired to fight in several small wars between local bandits and the province rulers my reputation grew i have escorted caravans of taubyl traders from the city into all the other provinces for once i gained my reputation as a ruthless warrior few would take me on i know how to impose hetarian order lara as a society we cannot allow discord to disrupt our lives why did my uncle not come when grandmother died lara asked my brother is a stubborn man daughter john swiftsword said he never forgave her for leaving him for leaving his house for a time she kept in touch with old friends in the midlands but eventually there was no point in it he always blamed me for stealing her from him he said i brought back faerie magic with me and used it against him it was never true of course did you ever see ilona again lara asked her father once he replied when i came to take you and my mother to the city i went first to the edge of the woodland and called her i was not certain at all she would appear but to my surprise she did i told her what had happened and how i was now a mercenary and would be taking you into the city did she ask about me lara wondered hopefully her father shook his head she gave you life child and for her it was enough i told her how you possessed her beauty and she smiled for she always enjoyed a compliment i told her i would probably not see her again and she laughed that is up to me she said i might marry i replied do not she said ever discuss our love or our time together with another woman you love but for our daughter if she asks you one day you may tell her of me and our life that year but no other or bad fortune shall befall you and then we parted lara i have not seen her since i have watched as you grew into her image and sometimes it hurts me to look at you for you are so like ilona then it is a good thing i am going lara responded softly you have been a good father to me and i would not hurt you da the world of the crusader knights is where you belong and now you have entered it susanna is happy lara giggled she told me she cannot wait to brag on your latest accomplishment to her sisters who were always mean to her and mocked her for marrying a poor man perhaps in that way your own brother and his family will learn of it too and you will have a small revenge john swiftsword chuckled that is something your mother would have said she did not easily tolerate a fault she felt was directed at her is that all da lara looked closely into her fathers face aye that is all daughter there is no more to tell you from the time you were six months of age you grew up in the city the necklace i wear around my neck da my mother gave it to me grandmother once said she put it about your neck the day you were born lara he responded do you know that the chain has grown in length as i have grown she asked he nodded his head there is magic in the chain and pendant but of what kind i do not know lara all i can tell you is that your mother said it would always protect and guide you what if it is taken from me lara fretted gaius prospero has promised it will not be he reassured her then he arose drawing her up with him he kissed her on the forehead i have told you all i can now lara and i would go to bed good night my daughter and a final time my thanks for all you have done for me and for my family you are to be collected early and i will not see you again may the celestial actuary guard and guide you he kissed her a final time and then turning left her in the garden lara stood quietly in the still night air everything was silent a sliver of the new pale blue moon hung in the dark skies hetar had four moons one for each province and the only place they could all be viewed at once was in the outlands she wondered what the four moons would look like together but she was unlikely to ever know in just a few hours gaius prosperos people would come to get her and her new master had promised that tomorrow would be a very exciting day lara hurried back into the house and going to the guest chamber took off her clothing and lay down to sleep but before she fell into her slumber she touched the crystal star about her neck and the tiny flame within flickered encouragingly chapter the slave woman yera woke her just before dawn a faeriepost has just arrived from the gate young mistress she said your transportation has just arrived and will be here shortly come with me to the kitchen i have fresh bread and milk for you before you go lara arose sleepily and yera pulled a chamber pot from beneath the bed there is water to wash with and i will be in the kitchen the slave woman said do not dally they will be here soon and will not want to wait finishing her ablutions lara hurried to dress then went to the kitchens where yera gave her a cup of fresh milk and a slab of buttered bread just warm from the ovens there was also a dish of cutup fruit lara ate it all down you have a good appetite on you for such a slender girl yera noted dryly so my grandmother always said lara replied with a smile the conveyance is here nels had come into the kitchen lara arose thank you for your kindness she told yera and then turning she followed the male slave he led her to the front door of the house beyond which she could see a beautiful litter well curtained drawing a deep breath lara walked outside waiting while nels drew the draperies aside and then helped her into her transport as he closed the curtains with a snap lara called out thank you nels the litter was lifted up and she was finally on her way she was sorry she had not seen her father or susanna or little mikhail before she left but she knew they had done her a kindness in saying their goodbyes the previous evening it really was better this way and she could be strong for whatever lay ahead reaching down she raised her star pendant to her lips and kissed it the tiny flame flickered for a brief moment she was safe had her faerie mother not said the necklace would always keep her safe her father had told her so and lara believed him the bearers moved quickly and before she knew it she heard the hail of the guard at the gate to the golden district he opened the curtains a moment winked at her and then closed them the litter moved off again finally stopping for good the curtains were opened gently and fully welcome lara welcome gaius prosperos fat hand helped her from the litter we have a busy day ahead of us have you eaten yet she nodded my fathers slave woman fed me she told him excellent he beamed his approval then come with me my dear there is much to do and you must get started the northern wing of my house is for the special slaves that pass through my hands tania is waiting there for you she will prepare you for this evening i am giving a dinner for the owners of the finest pleasure houses in the city and the pleasure mistresses who manage these houses many began as you will as simple pleasure women you are to be the final course of the meal the sweet if you will he chuckled well pleased with himself i will display you to them so they may inspect you thoroughly the bids on your person must be brought to me in writing between sunrise and sunset tomorrow this permits me to weed out the serious buyers from those who do not have the wealth it will require to purchase you there will then be one more viewing of you at which point those remaining may bid on you in a formal auction at its conclusion you will be consigned to your new owner and i shall have you delivered to his premises do you understand yes my lord gaius lara said he took her little hand in his plump one and patted it comfortingly it all sounds very complicated i will admit but it is actually quite a simple process and after your firstnight rights have been taken you will be very well trained to service the men who come to take their pleasure of you what are firstnight rights lara asked him you have three virginities gaius prospero told her each of them will be sold for a fabulous sum to the men who want them the most since you have never known intimacy your reactions to these men and their knowledge that they are the first to possess you are valuable innocence has great charm but afterward you will need to be taught the complexities of offering varied pleasures to a man ah here we are tania here is the lovely lara she is in your charge until she leaves us see she is well prepared until tonight my dear he purred and turning was gone let me see your hands tania said and then she exclaimed what have you been doing child a pleasure woman must have the softest hands and yours are all rough and your nails are broken and to think i have only until tonight to make you presentable come along come along lara followed tania and during the next few hours her world was expanded as she learned the secret of how pleasure women were treated she was seated and a slave woman began to pare and shape her nails her hands were first soaked in a mixture of hot water and soap then her nails were cleaned and each hand massaged before being put into a separate bowl of warm scented cream while her hands were being treated another slave woman began on her feet tsking at the rough heels and soles she possessed make them like silk tania ordered it will take days to make these feet presentable the slave told tania she is being shown tonight tania said you dont want the master displeased do you do you remember how long it took the welts to go down on the last slave who made him unhappy he has a great investment in this girl then he should have taken her from her family sooner and not left it to the last minute the slave at laras feet huffed ill do my best but im not promising anything and threatening me with a beating isnt going to change a thing the girl has feet like a farm worker although i admit their dainty size will work to her advantage lara remained silent as the slaves worked on her she was bathed next slaves washing her all over with large sea sponges filled with scented soap then she was scraped and rinsed to be certain the dirt was removed from her body a sweetsmelling paste the color of almond blossoms was smeared on her legs and her pubic mound it burned slightly and she complained as it was quickly rinsed away she was then washed again this time by tania who pushed the cloth she used into the most intimate areas of laras body causing lara to blush furiously tania snorted with impatience every part of you must be fresh and sweetsmelling for your lovers she explained youll get use to this she rinsed lara with basins of fragrant warm water now get into the bath pool and sit down while your hair is washed child the bathing pool had a bench that circled the entire pool lara sat down the water was warm and very relaxing she waited for someone to get into the water with her to wash her hair but instead she was instructed to put her head back and a slave woman washed her long tresses from the outside of the pool her pale gold locks were twice soaped twice rinsed and then rinsed a third time with lemon juice and water it makes golden hair even more golden tania told her are you hungry she busily toweled laras hair dry first with a drying cloth and then with a silk one a little lara admitted she had been pampered for several hours now then i will have something brought to you before we continue tania said it will be light and you will not eat again until after you have been displayed she gave orders in a brisk tone and shortly lara was served a dish of yogurt flavored with berries a piece of flat crisp bread with a thin slice of cheese and a small goblet of wine when she had finished tania handed her a goblet of minted water with which to rinse her mouth then to laras surprise her mouth her tongue and teeth were brushed with a boars bristle brush and she rinsed again a woman should always have sweet breath tania said lara was then laid out on a padded table her face was cleaned and creamed her body was thoroughly massaged until she felt as weak as a newborn kitten and could barely stand on her own two legs she was then led to a soft mattress and a silvery curtain was drawn around it you will sleep now tania said when it is time i will come and get you lara needed no encouragement and when she was awakened several hours later she realized that she felt better than she had ever felt in her life instinctively she touched the pendant she had not allowed them to remove it from her neck while she was being prepared for display tania offered her a small goblet of water and thirsty lara drank it down then at the older womans suggesting she relieved herself and was washed in that private place once again what am i to wear this evening she asked tania you will be displayed naked but for your pendant and some flowers tania said you understand that you will be touched by both the men and the women at the table you must show no emotion at all no matter how intimate a gesture it seems to you fear or repulsion will irritate the masters guests there are also some among the guests whose houses cater to those men with odd or brutal tastes you do not want to end up in one of those places child remain emotionless at all costs lara nodded i dont understand but i know your advice is sound she told tania what is it these men like that is so strange pain and degradation came the answer your firstnight rights would be sold to men who would rape you instead of enjoying your sweetness and innocence these men like inflicting punishment on women they whip them with all manner of cruel instruments they beat them with their hands and make them beg for mercy before using them in vile ways you should never hear from my lips show no emotion lara lest you fall prey to one of these pleasure houses but surely gaius prospero would not permit me to be sold to such people lara cried he seems a kind man tania laughed bitterly child remember gaius prospero cares only for profit if one of these creatures should offer him the highest price for you he will take it and you will be lost remember what i have told you come now i must place you she led lara to where a large round golden tray was placed upon a small table you are to sit upon this on your side on one hip and when lara had placed herself according to instructions tania brushed the tangles from her long hair spreading it out then she placed a crown of small white flowers upon the girls head next she decorated the tray with the same white flowers and standing back surveyed her handiwork and nodded pleased are you afraid of being enclosed she asked lara i do not know lara replied well it will only be for a few moments tania remarked then she clapped her hands and two ebonyblack men slaves stepped forward they were muscular and their beautifully formed bodies were oiled they were completely naked and their male organs had been painted with gold paint to display them they seemed very large to lara but then she had never seen a male organ except her baby brothers about the necks of the men were twisted gold torques you are to be carried to the dining room tania explained and then she lifted a large gold dome which she placed over lara and her tray take her to the master lara felt the tray lifted up she struggled a moment to maintain her balance but once she found it she had no more difficulty the two men hurried with a measured step from the north wing of the house through the halls and finally they stood outside the dining room where gaius prospero was entertaining his special guests lara heard the doors to the room open wide and then she heard the voice of her master saying ahh here is our dessert my friends a most special treat i assure you and he chuckled richly at his own humor if its as good as the rest of the meal lara heard a mans voice say we will surely have no complaints and laughter erupted about the room oh i think you will find this a most special and rich dish one such as you have never had before gaius prospero said then he nodded to his majordomo who quickly lifted the lid to reveal lara the guests gasped as one surprised and delighted laughter rippled around the dining room where the instinct came from she never knew but she looked coyly at the guests about the table her head moving slowly to take them all in the impression she gave was of utter elegance and pride now my friends i will give each of you the opportunity to inspect this truly rare and you will agree unique piece of merchandise she is a virgin every orifice is intact untouched by man or woman she is ready to be trained as the most perfect of pleasure women but before that her firstnight rights will bring her owner a fortune who among your clientele will not lust after this exquisite beauty he stood before lara on her tray and offering her his hand helped her down from the table and up onto a small dais of polished wood look at this skin silken to the touch his hand swept down laras graceful back she was startled but she remembered tanias warnings remaining still and without expression no matter what happened she would show no emotion when did you last see breasts like these a bit small perhaps but perfect in every way and she is young they will grow with loving handling he chuckled and have you ever seen hair like this his fat hand ruffled through laras hair and it cascaded about her like a waterfall of golden gilt i have never had a finer piece of merchandise to offer you and i will expect your bids to echo my expectations by this time tomorrow night is it true she is faerie one of the men asked her mother was faerie none will deny it you know her father sir john swiftsword gaius prospero said a fine lineage the guests now arose from the table and came forward to get a closer look at lara open your mouth one woman said lara complied she has all her teeth and there is no rot the breath is sweet the woman remarked her eyes are beautiful they are green but the lashes are dark a most striking contrast lara felt a hand fondling her bottom she swallowed as discreetly as she might but the expression on her face remained impassive the skin is soft and firm the fondler noted he ran his hand down laras calf very nice gaius she isnt mushy like many but rather nicely tight my lord this is the best slave i have ever had for sale the master of the merchants said proudly i would see her more important attributes another man said yes agreed a woman draw your nether lips apart so we may inspect your treasures girl if they may be called that well know soon enough lara reached down and opened herself to the prying eyes the woman put out her hand touching a small plump nub of flesh that had been revealed almost immediately a tiny pearl of liquid appeared a man reached out and wiped the bead of moisture onto his large finger putting it in his mouth ahhh the guests breathed she is perfect as i have said gaius prospero murmured yes the man agreed and sweet as honey he took a strand of her hair between his fingers rubbing it as did several of the others gaius prospero then helped lara down from the little dais go now he told her you will find tania outside the door waiting to escort you back to the north wing lara ran quickly to the door and was gone the guests sat back down again at the table its no wonder you have remained the head of the merchants guild for so long one of the men said to gaius prospero so that is how john swiftsword managed to get the wherewithal to finally enter the tournament could you not have just lent him the monies and taken a usurious share of his profits for the next ten years gaius i could have the merchant replied but i would have had to wait for my profit if i did that wouldnt i there was laughter about the table at his remark believe it or not i did not seek the girl out her stepmother brought her to me and asked if i would have her a pretty girl not much older than lara but obviously ambitious for her husband and happy to have a beautiful stepdaughter out of the house he chuckled it was too good a chance to pass up and when the father agreed i could not turn away from such an opportunity now you all know the rules you have between sunrise and sunset to post your bids with me in your own hand go now and talk among yourselves owners and pleasure mistresses the sale must be in gold and presented the day you take possession of the girl he stood up again thank you all for coming i hope it has been worth your while and then gaius prospero the perfect host ushered his guests from his house to their waiting vehicles returning into the house he sought out his wife vilia well he said you were watching werent you he sat down next to her on their bed aye vilia answered your presentation was masterful my dear gaius if you had allowed it they would have taken the girl on your dining table she laughed the lust was palpable she will bring you a fortune i cannot wait for the bids to begin coming in you must let me open them not all will be able to bid but most will even if they cannot afford it but by sunset of the following evening no bids for possession of the slave lara had been delivered to gaius prosperos door the master of the merchants was sick with anxiety and concern when his majordomo announced a visitor the lady gillian my lord he said as he ushered in the head mistress of the pleasure mistresses guild into his masters library you look pale gaius she said by way of greeting she was a tall imposing woman with dark hair and bright blue eyes her simple gown of burgundy red silk hung in graceful folds it had long wide pleated sleeves and a square neckline that revealed her fine large bosom her hair was piled upon her head and covered with a sheer veil why have there been no bids gaius prospero managed to gasp out yes i will sit down and have a goblet of wine the lady gillian answered him pointedly the majordomo quickly handed the lady the requested goblet and then departed the library but he remained on the other side of that door listening the lady gillian sipped at her wine it is always a pleasure to visit you gaius she said you never stint on the vintage what has happened he ground out in a harsh voice he was becoming calmer for if gillian was here he would get the truth there will be no bids for the slave girl lara gaius she began she is simply too beautiful and of course there is the matter of her faerie blood faerie blood never bothered you before he snapped at least three very wellknown members of your guild possess it and so do a number of pleasure women and what the hell do you mean she is too beautiful what is wrong with beautiful not just beautiful gaius gillian told him too beautiful exquisite she is perfection and therein lies the problem no sooner had you ushered us from your house last night than two owners got into a physical quarrel over the girl and the pleasure mistresses were no better there was at least one incident of hairpulling and when they all returned to their pleasure houses most found their women in a disturbed state at the thought of lara joining them they fear her great beauty will rob them of their clients and if they protest her magic will harm them no one believes a girl this beautiful does not have faerie power i know she does not for if she did she would not be in the position she is now in but convincing the others is impossible ignorance is a dangerous thing gaius by this morning regular patrons were offering the owners additional coin to help purchase the girl others were attempting to book time with her for you displayed her well at the tourney several of my guild have been threatened with bodily harm if they are not given the girls firstnight rights i have no choice but to forbid this girls sale into any of our houses it is too risky i am sorry she sipped again at her wine goblet nor can i permit an untried girl to be sold as a pleasure woman to one of the magnates whoever purchased her would find he had bought a most dangerous possession he would be envied by all and therefore find himself in peril of his very life lara is the kind of girl that men see and must have at all costs gaius prospero was stunned by her words his investment was suddenly gone the head mistress of the pleasure mistresses guild and its satellite the guild of the pleasure woman was no fool and her word was law among the owners and the houses what am i to do with her then he asked helplessly i cannot give her back to her family and ask for my gold to be returned he ran a nervous hand through his thinning hair i am ruined how could i not have seen it oh gaius she told him do not be so melodramatic you are not ruined and your eye for a fine piece of merchandise simply blinded you to the fact the girl was too beautiful to not cause difficulty you have a cousin rolf fairplaya taubyl trader i believe am i correct yes he said he was listening intently gillian was an intelligent woman and might have been a merchant herself had she not been of the female sex cut your losses now gaius she told him give the girl to your cousin to sell in one of the provinces you can make a small profit on her even with the percentage you must give your cousin the provinces are not as sophisticated as the city nor do they have our refined tastes she will still be beautiful beyond compare but that will just make her unique there where here it will cause problems the coastal province would probably be best for there are so many there who are fair she will not stand out as much what did you pay for her ten thousand gold pieces he groaned i expected at least thirty for her gillian laughed and you might have gotten it had she not been so perfect gaius but if i understand she only came into your possession a few days ago you can hardly have expended a great deal on her but for that outrageous gown she wore to the tourney i am certain you can get at least fifteen for her in the provinces your cousin will have heard of what has happened so offer him not the usual fifteen percent of the girls sale but a full quarter share of the profit you will at least break even if she goes to the coast i can ask for a minimum of twenty thousand gaius said almost to himself the coastal kings are wealthy men they would pay that or more for lara at twenty thousand i should make a profit of at least five thousand i had the gown made by one of my slave women and the material was purchased several years ago it was just lying there in my storerooms waiting i have actually expended little in this endeavor he was beginning to feel better it was a disappointment of course but all was not lost after all gillian laughed gaius gaius trust you to find a bright side in a dark matter yes i think you are right have rolf fairplay take her to the coastal province it is the perfect place for her she drank down the remainder of her wine and stood up you have not been to my house in some time now you should come again your young wife cannot keep you all to herself i came only to see you gillian he told her then come again she purred at him smiling i have a new girl anora i thought you did not entertain any longer he responded eying her breasts gillian had always had the finest bosom i dont but for old friends gillian murmured touching his cheek with her elegant long fingers i am glad i was able to help you solve this little problem gaius she put her hand on the door handle my felicitations to the lady vilia good evening and then opening the door she glided through it smiling in amusement at the majordomo who had had little time to vacate the spot where he had crouched listening he ran ahead of her now to open the front door and she playfully waggled her finger at him as she passed through to her awaiting litter gaius prospero sat for several long minutes reliving his conversation with the head mistress silently he chided himself for not seeing the problem with lara himself but then he had always been a connoisseur of beautiful things he simply could not help himself he bought only the best as his many clients knew and lara was the best alas she was too perfect he called out for his secretary whom he knew was nearby for jonah was always nearby my lord you heard yes my lord all of it yes my lord go the traders guild and learn where rolf fairplay is if he is out of the city find out when he will return yes my lord jonah said do you think she is too beautiful gaius prospero asked his secretary what is too beautiful my lord i thought your instincts were perfect as always it is not your fault that the minds of others are narrow and unseeing do you always say the right thing jonah the merchant asked i try my lord having you as my example came the clever reply gaius prospero laughed one of these days i shall have to free you he told jonah but only if you agree to remain with me you will have to free me eventually if i am to realize my goal in life jonah told his master and i have the gold to purchase my freedom now and what is your goal gaius prospero asked to be master of the merchants my lord was the startling answer gaius prospero laughed heartily nodding be patient jonah he counseled his secretary you have the right attitude now go and find my cousin he waved the man away and hurried from his library to tell his wife of what had transpired vilia was not pleased they are fools fools she cried now i shall not get my new travel cart and i had already decided upon the one i wanted you shall have it my dear her husband promised but i wanted it now vilia said and she began to sob we shall go tomorrow and purchase it my love he said but can we afford it as you have expended so much coin on that worthless girl i want the one with the soft leather seats and the crystal lanterns and flower vases gaius it is very very expensive the wheels are handpainted and gilded and i wanted new horses to draw it as well i saw the prettiest pair of blackandwhite animals at the horse yards but then there was also a golden pair with creamy manes i just cant make up my mind they are very expensive too she pouted prettily at him you may have anything your little heart desires vilia he promised her after all gaius prospero thought to himself he couldnt have anyone thinking that this unfortunate incident with lara had weakened him financially yes it was absolutely the right thing to go out tomorrow and purchase vilia her new travel cart and a pair of lovely horses to draw it kissing his wife he told her to go to bed i will join you after i have spoken with jonah my love you will want to thank me for my generosity i am certain i do not have my new cart and horses yet gaius she told him have you not taught me never to pay for what i do not possess we will consider it a down payment then he chuckled and left her he waited for close to two hours for jonah and was about to join his wife when the secretary returned with gaius cousin in tow while gaius prospero was a roundfaced man of medium height and comfortable girth whose very appearance exuded prosperity rolf fairplay was tall and rangy with a long narrow face but his gray eyes were intelligent and alert those eyes now looked directly at the master of the merchants guild how may i serve you cousin rolf asked jonah get my cousin some wine and then join us gaius said no wine rolf replied but i appreciate your hospitality cousin i must depart in the morning with my caravan and i need a clear head you will understand this is a long trek i have ahead of me ill be going through the forest and desert provinces crossing into a portion of the outland and then heading for the coast before i return to the city i will be gone for almost a full year you caught me just in time gaius nodded his cousin was probably the best trader of them all he might have even been their leader but he had turned the opportunity away preferring to travel with his caravans the length and breadth of the four provinces you have heard of the purchase i recently made lara the daughter of sir john swiftsword rolf fairplay nodded she is to be a pleasure woman a most sound investment cousin when is the auction the owners and the pleasure mistresses came last night to view her they were to place their bids between sunrise and sunset today the auction was to have been held tonight but no bids were received and earlier this evening i was visited by the lady gillian who told me because of the girls beauty and the dissension it was already causing among the house owners the pleasure mistresses the pleasure women and even their patrons no bids would be offered me she has in her position as head mistress of the pleasure guilds forbidden the girls sale here in the city she suggested i consign lara to you for sale in the coastal province what if i can sell her before i reach the coast tis the last stop on my trek cousin it would be better if i could if word gets out that i am carrying such a valuable piece of merchandise my caravan could be attacked if i agree to take her i will need at least six more mercenaries and you must pay for them nay rolf you will pay for them but if you take her i will pay you a quarter of the profit and not the usual fifteen percent the traders get i want twenty thousand in gold for her she is worth more but unfortunately the market here is closed to me think of it cousin five thousand to you for selling her she cost me ten i shall have little profit from it as you can see but as gillian has pointed out it is best to cut my losses as quickly as i can i want an agreement in writing rolf fairplay said of course gaius prospero agreed but remember twenty thousand cousin and you get a quarter share less and you will just get fifteen an additional ten percent should certainly make it worth your while are we agreed then ill get you your twenty thousand gaius possibly more if i can his cousin promised the shadow princes like their women fair and young jonah his master called draw up the agreement two copies jonah rolf fairplay said smiling at gaius prospero when can i have the girl i want to leave at dawn and everything else is ready as soon as we sign the agreement you may take her cousin she is a virgin and i need not tell you that her value is not just in her beauty but in her innocence as well see that she remains pure and untouched of course cousin rolf answered we want your little investment to bring the highest price for us and she willi guarantee it the agreement was a standard contract between the master of the merchants guild and a taubyl trader with the exception of the fee it took an hour for the secretary to draw up the two identical contracts but finally the parchments were ready to be signed carefully he spread them on his masters desk and handed gaius prospero an inked quill when both contracts had been signed by both men he sanded their signatures and rolling up the parchments handed one to each man go to tania yourself and have lara dressed for transport gaius instructed jonah tell her briefly what has happened and see the girl has a small pack of necessities for her travels nothing elaborate mind you he warned at once my lord jonah answered and hurried out he reached the north wing knocked and was admitted by tania what has happened the woman demanded he did not send for lara for the final auction it has gotten so late i have put her to bed she was so nervous i gave her some wine with a bit of poppy in it there will be no auction there were no bids for her and tonight the head mistress of the pleasure guilds came to tell him she had forbidden the girls sale to any in the city they say she is too beautiful that after last evenings display the owners and the pleasure mistresses began to quarrel over her patrons who had seen her at the tourney were threatening the houses if they were not given the girls firstnight rights there was too much dissension being caused and so the lady gillian called a halt to the proceedings he stopped waiting for her to say something tania shook her head what will happen now she asked him he is consigning her to his cousin rolf fairplay the taubyl trader he thinks she is good for one of the coastal kings but rolf says she will appeal to the shadow princes it matters not tania awaken the girl she is being put into the traders care tonight his caravan leaves on the morrow at dawn the master says you are to give her a small pack for her travels nothing elaborate go back to him and say because of the poppy juice she will not awaken for several hours i will make certain she gets to the caravan before rolf fairplay leaves but i cannot awaken her now jonah left tania who began to prepare for laras departure she was not surprised when gaius prospero angrily entered the room several minutes later she knelt quickly saying forgive me master but the girl was becoming unmanageable when it grew so late i did what i thought best for all concerned he grimaced you are certain you can awaken her in time i do not want the additional expense of sending her along in a separate transport to catch up with the trader are you preparing a pack yes master and i swear i will get her to the caravan on time you have recently acquired the habit of getting above your station tania gaius prospero said threateningly attempt to curb this habit or i will have to send you to the country i know how much you love it there tania and he laughed nastily as he left her knowing that tania hated his country estate there she would be forced to do farm labor under the eye of his estate manager creager who was not above putting a woman slave on her back to service him gaius prospero overlooked creagers lustful nature because he did his job well and after all the women were only slaves tania arose from her knees resentment burning in her breast she might be a slave she thought but she worked hard and was honest well she thought for once she would not be quite so honest she would give lara more than her master wanted but he would never know gaius prospero had so many possessions he could not remember half of them and the poor girl should not be penalized for what had happened who knew how long and how far her travels would take her tania packed two simple gowns with round necks full long sleeves and long pleated skirts one of silk was light blue the other a mixture of tawny orange wool and silk she packed four white cotton chemises and two pairs of stockings one a light wool for cold weather she wrapped all of these items up tightly so laras pack would not look excessive she put in the pearwood brush with which she had been brushing laras hair and a small lacquer box of hairpins she lay out a plain dark green gown for her travels another chemise stockings a pair of leather boots and a long veil to cover laras hair satisfied she lay down on her mattress and slept for exactly four hours as she had trained herself to do awakening tania arose to fetch a basin of warmed water and a small cloth then she drew the silvery curtains around laras sleeping place and shook the girl gently but firmly by the shoulder lara stirred sleepily wake up child tania insisted it is almost time for you to go laras green eyes opened slowly her wits felt dull and she could scarcely move go where is it time for the auction she found herself growing stronger the mists clearing from her brain as she spoke tell me who has bought me i hope it isnt the woman who wanted to see my teeth i thought her rude no one has purchased you get up lara and bathe quickly i will tell you all tania said she poured out a goblet of pomegranate juice from a decanter and shoved it into laras hand drink this it will help lara drank down the entire portion she had been very thirsty relieving herself she washed as quickly as she could while she did she listened to tanias explanations of what had happened and what was to happen to her i am to leave the city she was astounded and perhaps a bit afraid it could be worse child tania said how lara asked she brushed the fuzz from her teeth and tongue rinsing with minted water how could it possibly be worse your father could have failed in his attempt to become a crusader knight or you might have been bought by one of the cruel owners to be used for the pleasures of depraved men and women all that has happened is that you are considered too beautiful and that men and women are already fighting over you the trader who has you in his care is the masters distant cousin his reputation is a good one and he is a kind man he will see you come to no harm lara and it is in his best interest to see you fetch the highest price for the higher your price the greater his profit his blood runs as cold as that of gaius prospero and like our master his only goal is for profit come now and dress i have laid out your clothing we must reach the caravan before it departs at dawn looking outside lara realized it was still dark she pulled the stockings on the clean white chemise and the dark green gown tania then brushed her hair out quickly braiding it into a single thick plait and pinned on the veil part of which she drew over laras beautiful face then she fitted the short boots onto laras feet and draped a dark cloak over her shoulders come we must hurry she said and together the two walked from the north wing to the front door of the house where jonah was awaiting them with a small transport he would be driving himself climbing into the vehicle they moved off hurrying down the narrow private road onto the main avenue of the golden district escorted by the six mercenaries on gaius prosperos payroll things might not have turned out quite as the master of the merchants had expected but lara was still very valuable merchandise when they reached them the gates were opened without comment and they drove out into the city lara had never been up this early nor had she ever known the streets to be so empty or so silent it was a little frightening they passed by the closed gates to the quarter and for a moment she thought that she would cry she reached for her star pendant and the tiny flame within flickered as if to give her new courage master jonah she said politely i have nothing to give you but a faerie blessing but will you tell my father what has happened to me so that he does not worry not my stepmother susanna would not tell him for she overprotects him my father and tell him i am not unhappy or afraid for i know i am shielded from harm she felt almost guilty telling gaius prosperos secretary that she would give him a faerie blessing she hadnt the faintest idea of how one would do that but she needed his aid and she had seen he was not a man who did something for nothing a faerie blessing is a valuable gift young lara the secretary replied i am happy to accept it for i need all the luck i can muster if i am to be free one day you will be lara told him amazed as the words came from her mouth yet she knew them to be the truth what was happening to her i will tell him young lara i will also tell him he has a daughter to be proud of jonah said you are a brave girl i think will you give me a faerie blessing tania asked anxiously i will give you two lara smiled you have been more than kind to me i put the pearwood brush in your pack tania whispered thank you and blessings on you tania and you jonah how odd lara thought at the sight of their suddenly smiling faces she knew little of her heritage or its customs but faerie blessings were obviously highly prized it was a piece of knowledge she would retain they reached the place of the traders where rolf fairplays great caravan was even now preparing to get under way jonah jumped down from the cart and sought out his masters cousin bringing him back to where lara and tania waited the trader lifted lara down from the traveling cart and unfastened the veil they are right he said softly you are beautiful then he refastened the veil keep your face covered when in public lara he warned her i dont want you stolen away when you can bring my cousin and me such a fine profit he turned to jonah i will take her from here he said return to your master and say you have delivered the merchandise here is her pack sir tania said holding it out for him take your possessions lara and follow me rolf fairplay said goodbye lara told tania and jonah and then she hurried after the trader he led her to a large covered cart you will have several female companions for some of your journey he explained as he helped her into the conveyance then he was gone lara looked about at the halfdozen sleepy girls they were silent and so she remained silent too outside of the cart the sounds of the caravan getting under way could be heard a flap had been drawn down but she could see through the crack along the sides of the canvas their cart began to move lara watched as they exited through the traders gate as was the law for all caravans she watched for some time as the walls of the city grew smaller and smaller and finally faded from sight one of the girls began to weep why are you crying lara asked her gently i have never been a slave before the girl sobbed neither have i lara told her tell me your name i am lara i am noss the girl hiccupped i know who you are one of the other females said you are the daughter of john swiftsword your father sold you so he might enter the tourney you are a faerie child she said drawing her cloak around her with a sneer i thought you were to be a pleasure woman in one of the great pleasure houses and yet here you are in a wagon of common slave women trekking off to who knows where why like you lara said softly i am a slave slaves are not given reasons why humphh the woman replied but she grew silent lara smiled to herself the woman was looking for trouble she could just imagine what she would have said to the explanation that lara was considered too beautiful to enter a pleasure house are you really a faerie child noss whispered her soft brown eyes were wide my mother was faerie but she deserted my father and me when i was only three months of age while her blood runs in my veins i know nothing about the faerie kingdom from whence she came i was raised to be human just like you noss my father was a mercenary too but when he was badly injured he could no longer find employment i was sold so they might live she told lara our hovel was taken from us and we were homeless we last lived in a tunnel beneath the city walls but my mother was violated by some soldiers who found her there she heard them coming and hid me i saw it all lara afterward she swore me to secrecy and told my father that she had fallen while he was out begging so we might buy bread noss sighed they hoped by selling me they might escape the city and buy a bit of land to work in the midlands i hope they can she finished sadly the life of a mercenary is difficult lara agreed i hope your parents find a new and better life my father and stepmother did and i am glad my baby brother mikhail will never know what it is like to be a mercenarys child what do you think will happen to us noss asked were going to be sold to the highest bidder you stupid little bitch the woman who had earlier attempted to quarrel with lara said all of us are a special consignment for the forest lords they have quite an appetite for female flesh given how many women are sold into the forest province nowadays i guess their own women dont satisfy them she said and laughed out loud i wont mind one of those big brutes foraging between my legs girls i have heard they are the lustiest men on hetar you talk too much truda another woman remarked i have heard the forest lords only mate with those of pure forest blood if were going to be sold to them it will be as servants who cook and clean and sew and slop the pigs dont tell me any man is true to his wife all the time belda truda snapped back sharply men are like dogs always sniffing at a new tail and i intend wagging my tail prettily in my new masters direction but i dont suppose lara is meant for the forest she sneered my master gaius prospero suggested i be sold in the coastal province but rolf fairplay said he thought one of the shadow princes might like me lara murmured ill wager a forest lord would enjoy your favors greatly truda said meanly being a hall whore is quite like being a fancy pleasure woman except for the niceties involved she said with a chuckle dont pay any attention to her belda said truda is angry because her last masters wife caught her fucking one of the houses sons and insisted she be sold she was a servant in the garden district and what about you truda demanded angrily i am no better than i ought to be belda laughed my husband sold me to pay his debts debts he ran up with another woman but then i was in bed with his brother when we were caught and i was condemned to slavery by the courts was your husband not condemned too for his lechery lara asked nay the law considers it a mans right to have any woman he desires belda said do you not know this i lived in the quarter my entire life lara answered i suppose i was sheltered my grandmother raised me and after she died and da remarried my stepmother susanna did we were friends but we never spoke on things such as these it is a hard world in which we live lara daughter of swiftsword belda said they were silent again for the rest of the morning when the sun had reached its zenith the caravan stopped briefly they were herded from their wagon fed bread and water sent into the bushes to relieve themselves and then returned to the wagon their trek began again finally at dusk they stopped once more mercenary guards were posted about the encampment a fire was built and food cooked the women were each given half a trencher filled with a rabbit stew and a wineskin was handed them to share but truda drank the most of it growing more belligerent by the minute when she attempted to attack her companions physically rolf fairplay had her strung up naked between two trees then he strapped the womans bottom until it was red and welted while the entire camp looked on as truda shrieked more with outrage than pain ill not have my merchandise damaged woman he growled in her face as she hung there between the trees do you understand me then cutting her down he shoved her toward a group of mercenaries shes yours for the night i want no bruises on her in the morning shes one of the forest consignment he walked away what will they do to her noss whispered fearfully fuck the ears off of her belda laughed serves her right the bitch thatll sober her up quick enough come along now girls its time for us to get our beauty rest and she cackled once again as they walked back to the wagon inside there were thin mattresses that were rolled up rolf fairplay told me earlier that lara and noss are to sleep in the wagon the rest of us will spread our mattresses beneath it for protection from any rain in the night i am happy to sleep out of doors lara said not wanting to appear as if she were privileged she smiled at the other women with them they were adda wilda and jael nay belda said quietly you are to be in the wagon for we all know you are the most valuable among us by far and noss is the youngest and still frightened without truda complaining and causing dissension we will have a good night the mattresses were spread out and lara climbed into the wagon with young noss to spread theirs how old are you she asked noss twelve noss replied how old are you i am just fifteen lara told her my mother mated with my father one midsummers eve and i was born with the next spring she smiled laying down next to the girl and drawing up the coverlet they had been given over the both of them i am so afraid noss whispered to lara then i must give you a faerie blessing to take away your fears noss go to sleep i am by your side and come the morning you will no longer be afraid really noss quavered truly lara said putting a comforting arm about the younger girl and soon noss was sleeping peacefully lara however lay awake for some time considering how quickly everything had changed in her life three nights ago she slept in her fathers new home in the garden district two nights ago she stood displayed for sale to the powerful of the city last night she waited to learn her golden fate and tonight she lay on a thin mattress in the bottom of a wooden wagon with absolutely no idea of what was to happen next she sighed and picked up the pendant between her two fingers what is happening she asked silently everything the voice replied as silently but where am i going lara demanded straight ahead the voice answered and then the flame flickered bright for a moment and died back lara closed her eyes and slept there was nothing else to do chapter the caravans route led through the midland province which was the largest of the four civilized precincts on hetar it was from here that those men and women no longer needed on the farms emigrated into the city the region was made up of a large flat wide valley sandwiched between two long ridges of gently rolling hills some with vineyards of growing grapes the farms were comfortable places growing all manner of edibles some with orchards as well the cart rumbled past green meadows and fields of hay being baled the houses they saw were all sturdy and substantial lara having never before been out of the city had never seen their like she watched thoughtfully young noss pressing against her side as if for protection truda had rejoined the women the second morning but her harsh punishment had done nothing to sweeten her disposition the others did their best to ignore her taking silent pleasure in the fact that sitting was obviously painful for truda after her beating last night she had brought whatever she got on herself belda insisted a slave kept her mouth shut unless it was required she speak truda knew better fairplay was known to be good to the slaves he transported the wine that she had so freely swilled had been a generous treat meant for them all and her greed had spoiled it it was unlikely they would see wine again the day passed without incident and the next morning they turned off the main track into the hills the women learned from one of the mercenaries that their first stop was to be in the forest province at the great hall of the head forester the six women traveling with lara were a prepaid consignment for the forest lords they would be delivered and the caravan would move on toward the next destinationthe desert kingdom of the shadow princes the forest lords are not easy masters ive been told belda said are they kind noss quavered her eyes wide to those who work hard aye im sure they would be kind belda responded poor little noss was afraid of her own shadow she would have to toughen up or it was unlikely she would survive theyre lusty as buck deer in all seasons ive been told truda said with a smirk they will just love mounting a fresh little virgin like you noss and she laughed be quiet belda snapped do not frighten the child with your gossip which is more than likely wrong if you do not shut your mouth truda i will tell rolf fairplay perhaps you would like another beating with his strap you are still having difficulty sitting and it has been several days since you felt his wrath truda glared darkly at belda but she said no more the road wandered through hillsides of lowing cattle and fat woolly sheep lara was enchanted with the beauty of it all she had never imagined that such a world existed outside of the city ahead she could see trees and with each step the donkeys took their cart closer and closer two mornings later they stopped at the border post between the midlands and the forest kingdom officials from each province were there to inspect rolf fairplays papers his cargo was thoroughly checked to ascertain that he carried no contraband and that the number of slaves listed was exactly the number in the caravan the border official from the midlands province knew that all of rolfs papers would be in order for the traders reputation was sterling but the official from the forest kingdom carefully inspected everything on the roster checking each item off as he came upon it foresters were very traditionbound peoples when finally both sides of the border were satisfied that everything was in order the caravan was waved through into the forest lara had never seen a forest let alone been in one there were so many trees and in some places they were so thick that the sun had difficulty getting through even the city was lighter she thought but it was also very beautiful yet still but for the birds singing in the trees and the rippling of water from the streams and brooks the green she thought was a very soothing color now and again the road led through a flowerfilled meadow sometimes browsing deer startled by their passage would leap away into the safety of the tall trees they stopped at midday to rest and water the pack animals rolf fairplay came to the wagon where the women were now milling about taking lara aside he said you will remain in the wagon when we reach the hall of the head forester my girl you are not for these rough crude men but for a coastal king foresters however are lusty and greedy if they see you they will want you and i shall have great difficulty convincing them otherwise it is better if you remain hidden i will see to your comfort while we are here but you must remain out of sight do you understand yes my lord lara said then would it be possible for noss to remain with me she is very frightened and so young rolf fairplay patted laras hand it was a gesture that reminded her of gaius prospero you have a good heart lara but the girl has already been bought and paid for she belongs to the forest lords i will suggest to the head forester that she be put with a kind mistress it is the best we can do yes my lord lara replied they were fed and took their relief and then the caravan moved from the meadow back onto the dark forest track because it was summer the day was a very long one and they reached the hall of the head forester before dusk as the caravan stopped lara peeked out but she saw nothing but trees where are we she asked belda who seemed to be relatively knowledgeable look up belda whispered back their halls are in the trees themselves see the staircases winding about the great trunks it is impossible for an enemy to break into their halls because of it the stairs are steep and narrow lara looked up amazed she could see the lights from a great hall twinkling amid the leaves and branches and smoke there was obviously a fireplace in this odd building as well she could never have imagined such a thing and realized now that beyond the city a great and varied world existed she could not wait to see more she bid her companions farewell advising noss not to cry and appear a weakling lest she be victimized by others she thanked belda and the others for their kindness and company then she watched as they were led up into the hall in the trees praying that they would have kind masters instinctively her hand went to her star pendant for comfort and she smiled at herself for her own foolishness a mercenary brought her a slab of bread meat and cheese he poured some wine from his own skin into a little cup for her thank you lara said softly he nodded saying in a gruff voice you are one of our own lara daughter of john swiftsword we will guard you on your journey never fear then he moved quickly away lara ate her cold meal and then curling up on her mattress she drew up her coverlet and settled down to sleep she wondered what was happening in the great hall in the trees above her and peeped a final time through the canvas flap she could hear singing coming from the trees or was it the sound of voices raised in protest she shivered and dropped the flap settling back on her mattress far above her the head forester was arguing with rolf fairplay though lara could not hear the rough voice who shouted i was promised six women slaves i have delivered you six rolf said you have brought me five and a whining frightened girl i paid for six women durga the head forester snarled i have brought the six females consigned to me by the trader with whom you placed your order take the matter up with him my lord i only agreed to deliver these women as a favor to my guild i am receiving naught for my trouble i might add i need six strong women women who can work the day long and be used for pleasure by the lower lords at night even i can see that the child is too young to be mounted he glared at noss how old are you he demanded of her twelve my lord noss quavered are you moonlinked yet durga persisted no my lord the girl whispered she had begun to shake with her fear belda put an arm about her to keep noss from collapsing i will not accept her durga said firmly that is your decision my lord rolf fairplay said i am content to refund you your coin for the girl or send back to the city for a stronger older female for you the bill of lading says the little lass was but five gold pieces i can take her along with me to sell in the coastal province as i have pointed out i did not take this order from you myself i did not choose the women in the consignment i have only made the delivery he stood tall and firm before the head forester i wanted six young women durga grumbled i offer you my most abject apologies my lord had you placed the order with me there should have been no difficulty i am aware of your tastes i will bear the extra cost above your five gold pieces for another woman in an effort to regain your favor rolf fairplay said smoothly it is the least i can do for the inconvenience caused you well lord durga said sourly i suppose if that is the best you can do i must be satisfied rolf fairplay your reputation for honesty is well known throughout hetar the taubyl trader felt an easing of the tensions in the hall with durgas words but suddenly the slave woman truda broke away from the other women and fell to her knees before the head forester he has another woman in his caravan my lord what is this durga growled fiercely he stared down at truda deciding he liked her large pillowy breasts he would mount her later and take pleasure of her then he looked directly at rolf fairplay is this true is there another woman with your party have you attempted to cheat me by palming off this child on us while you keep the woman meant for us his hand went to the dagger at his waist if he had had a weapon he would have slain truda where she knelt rolf fairplay thought angrily instead he said i do indeed have another woman with my caravan my lord she is a consignment for one of the coastal kings from my cousin gaius prospero he smiled a quick smile but his eyes were cold and cautious i would see her bring her to me now rolf fairplay the head forester said my lord she is already consigned to arcas a kings son the trader lied give him the girl noss durga replied my lord this girl is a very rare and expensive slave the plain truth is that you could not afford to purchase her even if she were for sale and she is not shes half faerie truda murmured wickedly at this both the head forester and his younger brother cast a meaningful look at one another leave us durga said waving them all from the hall rolf fairplay await me outside the hall he turned to his wife who had been sitting quietly at his knee sita take these new slave women to their quarters return the girl noss to the caravan bowing her head in acknowledgement sita gathered up the slave women and hurried them from the hall which was quickly emptying rolf fairplay was the last from the great chamber he hoped the head forester a rather dullwitted man would not attempt to steal lara from his caravan he was well guarded for travel purposes but not enough to fight off a small army of foresters he touched sitas arm as she passed him beware truda the one who spoke she is a troublemaker he said softly i saw it at once rolf fairplay sita answered my thanks and then she moved away with the slave women inside the empty hall durga turned to his brother a half faerie girl he said thoughtfully is it possible if we breed her we can somehow remove this curse that hangs over us enda i do not know enda replied who has studied what breeding can do or cannot do durga i just enjoy mounting a woman and pleasuring myself on her body he was a tall handsome man with a ruddy outdoor complexion dark auburn hair and brown eyes he looked nothing like his elder brother although they shared the same parentage durga was a stocky man of barely medium height with small black eyes and black hair he disguised a rather bad complexion with a bushy black beard the head forester looked just like his late father whereas his brother looked like their mother that woman had died birthing enda who had been a large infant her fortuitous death had saved her master the trouble of disposing of her durga considered it was a faerie who brought this disaster on us in the first place he said why can a faerie not remove the scourge the slave woman said she is but half faerie brother i doubt her magic is strong enough the curse has been on us for over seventy years now only the faerie queen who spoke it can remove it and the faeries are gone from the forest thanks to our foolish grandfather and his stubborn pride enda remarked the faeries were just as obdurate durga insisted was it not one of their own who led the hunting party on that day and then mocked them was it necessary for that hunting party to violate the faerie and then kill her the faerie girl was asking for it taunting the men with her charms what did she think would happen besides she might have vanished away if she chose she wanted those men between her legs brother durga said crudely you know as well as i do brother that a faerie having spent a day shapeshifting as that one did would be weakened when she took her own form once more and unable to act in her own defense so did our men did we not in those days rule the forest along with the faeries and the giants we knew each other well once but now we have driven our allies away and are cursed for it enda said the faerie girl could help us regain our purity enda i am certain of it durga insisted and our children would have faerie blood in their veins the girl would help to bring her queen to us to remove maeves curse on the forest lords each generation born to our breeders grows less pure no matter they are raised in our traditions our women are also of impure lineage now only two of the pure blood remain among our clans enda we must reverse the tide of our destruction before it is too late mayhap the half faerie girl will not be the answer but she suddenly has been placed in our midst and so we must try it is surely good fortune that has brought her to us brother she is consigned to a coastal king enda said we do not want difficulties with the coast durga we are no longer as strong as we used to be if the faerie girl has been paid for we must let her go on with the caravan and we will seek another half faerie girl for our purposes but if this girl is to be paid for upon her delivery which i suspect is the case then we must pay rolf fairplay the amount agreed upon ourselves as long as gaius prospero receives his monies he will not care and another girl can be found for the son of that coastal king first however we must learn her price and if it is as high as i suspect it is where is the coin to come from durga we have wealth the head forester said our hidden wealth enda but will it be enough the younger man asked you and i will pool our resources durga responded agreed enda replied but you must agree to allow me first rights with the girl you are too rough and lack finesse to deal with so delicate a creature as a half faerie girl if you didnt kill her outright with your wooing you would likely frighten her to death she will be a virgin without a doubt else her price would not be so high our mother always said you were too greedy durga grumbled you are impatient with virgins brother i have seen it before we do not want to ruin our investment i will woo her gently and when she finally enters your bed she will be well trained and eager enda tempted his elder what if you get her with child right away durga asked when she has spawned her child then you will have her next enda said reasonably besides i saw you looking at that big breasted wench among the new slave women the one who spoke up in an effort to gain your favor dont tell me you didnt intend getting between her legs tonight he chuckled shes a healthylooking wench and will give you a good ride she could breed you up a healthy son before you dispose of her durga grinned aye i could see immediately that shes a hottempered one i imagine ill be beating her as much as ill be fucking her and ill enjoy both very well tis agreed we will purchase the faerie girl together and you will have her first shall we call the trader back into the hall enda asked nay we shall go down to his encampment and settle the details of the matter durga said if we meet his price hell not refuse us outside the hall the two brothers found rolf fairplay waiting beneath the treed portico he looked up as they came forward do you want your monies refunded or shall i send back to the city for another woman to complete your consignment we want to buy the faerie girl durga said come and let us descend to your camp so i may examine her and see if she is worth the outrageous sum you say you can obtain for her on the coast the trader swore silently to himself not only did durga resemble a wild boar he had the intellect of one well there was nothing for it but to tell him the price and end it here his cousin had wanted a minimum of twenty thousand gold coins which he knew the head forester would not be able to pay but to make it entirely impossible he said the kings son is paying twentyfive thousand gold pieces for the girl my lord there was an audible and sharp intake of breath from both of his companions but then durga said well want to see her she is a virgin guaranteed of course rolf fairplay answered there was no chance that the head forester could meet his price but he would show them lara to torture them a little bit as durga had given him so much difficulty this evening they reached the ground and walked across the clearing to where his caravan was settled for the night a mercenary guarded the wagon where lara was housed he had not ordered it but they all knew who she was they would consider her one of them and watch over her with great and tender care the trader realized i will go in and speak with lara before bringing her out rolf fairplay said and then he climbed into the cart noss gazed at him startled he put his finger to his lips warning her to silence and turned to lara listen to me lara he began thanks to truda the head forester would see you i have told him that you are promised to the son of a coastal province king who is paying twentyfive thousand gold pieces for you i know durga cannot afford such a price but he must still see you now in order to preserve his dignity he will find fault with you and then the incident will be concluded i understand lara said good then let us go out do not speak unless spoken to girl climbing back out of the cart the trader lifted lara down and brought her over to where the two men waited her name is lara he said i would see her naked durga said leering i want to know that this treasure you have is worth the outrageous price reaching up lara unfastened her gown at its shoulders and let it fall to the ground she said absolutely nothing but turned slowly that the two men might look their fill the younger handsome man reached up and pulled the pins from her hair so that it fell like a swath of silk down her back he rubbed a coil between his fingers and smiled slowly into laras green eyes it was a cruel smile and his brown eyes remained cold even as his mouth turned up at its corners he reached out and fondled one of her breasts she wanted to slap his hand away but she remained motionless spread your legs girl his command startled her and she looked anxiously to rolf fairplay the trader nodded the young man knelt before lara and opening her nether lips with the fingers of one hand he slowly pushed a thick finger from his other hand into her body shes a virgin without a doubt durga he said in a hard voice he withdrew the finger sucking it as he stood up and sweet as honey we will take her the head forester said my lord she is twentyfive thousand pieces of gold and she is promised to the coastal kings son arcas rolf fairplay said nervously is she paid for enda demanded to know well no but the order was given me last time i was in his domain i promised that i would bring him just such a girl as this one he wanted a half faerie lass for a wife he does not have one among his wives my cousin gaius prospero found the girl and not without difficulty i can assure you i simply cannot let her go my lord durga rolf fairplay was growing nervous these foresters were cruel men lara was still half in shock from having had her body invaded in such a startling manner by the younger of the two forest lords although he looked calm and in complete charge she could sense that the trader was growing frightened we will pay you thirty thousand gold pieces rolf fairplay enda said such a sum should make it easier for you to overcome your qualms if arcas has not paid you you can tell him you have not yet found a girl to suit his requirements he will not doubt you for you are a man of the highest repute my brother and i want this girl he smiled his cold smile at the trader showing his teeth and reminding rolf of a feral animal then he heard laras soft voice murmuring in his ear say yes it is not my custom to bargain in the open like some common trader rolf said to the two men i will put the girl back in the wagon and then we will speak on it shall i return to your hall my lord durga so we may seal the bargain with a goblet of your fine wine he drew laras gown up and fastened it at the shoulders agreed the head forester said jovial once more come enda he turned and began climbing the steps to his hall again his brother behind him rolf helped lara back into the wagon are you mad he asked her these are brutal men they will not treat you kindly and they are as likely to steal back their gold as look at me once they possess you may the celestial actuary help us all now listen to me my lord lara said from the moment i knew i was to leave my family something strange happened to me instincts i never knew i had began to boil up within me that is why i have been so composed while i do not believe i possess any real faerie magic i think these new feelings may be due to my faerie blood these two men whatever their reasons want me for some purpose i cannot yet divine but they will indeed consider violence if you refuse them you will be allowed to depart their hall and your caravan will begin its trek again but then something will happen and whether you are ever heard from again is another matter altogether they will claim they have no knowledge of what has happened take their gold my lord but refuse to consummate the sale until you stand on the border between the forest and the desert only then will you turn me over to them my grandmother ina taught me the history of this land and i know that the forest lords will not dishonor themselves publicly it is the only way to save yourself and i would not have it said that lara daughter of swiftsword brought you ill fortune the trader shook his head it must indeed be some faerie magic that gives you such wisdom lara i shall do exactly as you have suggested and i am grateful to you for your advice i am sorry i must leave you with these people you deserve a better fate than this this is only the beginning of my journey rolf fairplay lara told him and he climbed from the wagon this is all my fault noss began to weep nay it is the fault of the trader who purchased you for this consignment despite knowing better which i am certain he did lara soothed the girl some traders are good and honest men others are not the one who bought you thought to gain a few more coins in his pocket i do not doubt rolf fairplay will have them from him eventually what will happen to me now noss asked lara rolf will sell you to one of the desert people or you will have a master from the coast he is a kind man and will see you are placed with a good master i am certain lara reassured the frightened girl i will be alone now noss said i would have been alone if you remained here lara replied i will ask my mercenary friend to look after you you are very important lara arent you noss asked her eyes wide lara laughed no i am not important at all the mercenaries watch over me because my father was a mercenary once now he is a crusader knight they are proud of him for being able to gain such heights i am too but if your father is a crusader knight why were you sold noss wondered to become a member of the crusader knights one must enter the tournament which is only held every three years an applicant must be beautifully garbed to offer his applications and he must be outfitted with the finest armor and the best weapons all of this costs much gold my father is a great swordsman but he was also a poor man my stepmother suggested i was the only possession he had of any value and she was right so i was sold to gaius prospero for a great price my da was able to enter the tournament and win one of the five places available to the applicants and that is my story lara explained but you are very beautiful noss responded and beauty always wins a place of importance in the world and you are half faerie it is said my faerie mother deserted me when i was an infant lara said i know naught of faerie magic but you gave me a faerie blessing noss reminded the older girl her lip beginning to quiver i did and i meant it lara smiled then reaching out she ruffled nosss browngold hair go to sleep youngling we leave tomorrow for the desert noss obediently lay down and was soon asleep lara touched her star pendant the flame flickered within the crystal this is my fate she asked it silently nay but you have a task to complete here the voice responded what is it you will know soon enough the voice of her magical guardian ethne replied you will have to sacrifice yourself but we will help you be brave lara closed her eyes be brave she would have to be she had been horrified when the forest lord pushed his finger into her body but she had somehow managed to remain silent and still soon she knew he would push his manroot into her as well she had seen the look in his eyes as he probed her innocence so boldly and the other man the head forester he had licked his lips in open anticipation as the younger one examined her with rough hands what purpose was there in all of this ethne her guide said this was meant to be so it must be the flame within the pendant had always been with her and she couldnt even recall when it had first spoken with her so familiar had the voice become she wondered how rolf fairplay was doing in his negotiations with the forest lords they wouldnt be happy with his decision she knew and they were not you will sell her but only when we reach the border do you take us for fools rolf fairplay durga demanded my reputation is gold the trader said in icy tones but i must protect myself my lord durga you have agreed to pay me a small fortune but i do not see it nor are your forest clans noted for much wealth lara is an extremely valuable piece of merchandise she was meant for a kings son i know her owner for he is my own blood arcas has agreed to pay twentyfive thousand pieces of gold for the girl you offer thirty thousand i would be a fool not to sell her to you my cousin would chastise me for such foolishness but i have not seen your gold and until i do there can be no agreement between us my lord and if indeed you pay me this great amount and take the girl what is to stop you from attacking my caravan before i reach the next district my route for this journey as for all the journeys i make is public knowledge each trader must publish with the guild the route he is taking the stops he is making the merchandise he is carrying you could steal your gold back and murder me yet claim no knowledge of me after i left your hall i think not my lords i have agreed to sell lara to you but the transaction will not take place until we reach the borders between your land and the desert region the border guards will witness the compact between us you will count out your coin and when you have i will turn the girl over to you that is how i desire our agreement to be if you choose not to do it my way then i will depart but you have my word that i will have a suitable slave girl sent to you as quickly as possible you offend us by suggesting we would betray you after we have the slave durga said his black eyes were narrowed in irritation and what makes you think we couldnt take the girl now and dispose of you and the rest of your caravan you live by a certain code my lord it would not be the honorable thing to do and so i can trust you will not do it if you give me your word this night and we shake hands i know you will keep your word and all who bow to your authority will as well very well i give you my word durga finally said then give me your hand the trader replied is my word not good enough durga roared angrily nay it is not rolf replied just as loudly give me your hand or the agreement between us is null and void i know your ways my lord the members of my guild have not traveled your lands all these years in safety because they are fools durga held out a fat broad hand and shook the traders thin hand grudgingly and your brother as well my lord rolf fairplay said quietly enda laughed and offered his hand to the trader in a firm grip then we are agreed rolf fairplay he said i am eager to have the beautiful lara beneath me the trader nodded reluctantly we are agreed i will leave at dawn we should reach the border in two days of traveli shall meet you there the gold will be counted weighed and the girl will be yours then he added while my cousin will certainly be pleased with this transaction arcas will be quite disappointed i wonder if i should not send a faeriepost messenger to the coast and perhaps you might bid against one another it did not hurt to keep up the pretense and worry the forest lords rolf thought he was not happy leaving a girl like lara with them after all her father was a crusader knight and famous even before he won his spurs in the recent tournament we have agreed verbally and i have given you my hand durga protested you cannot break our agreement now trader rolf pretended to consider i suppose not and why waste the time after all in my business time is always money oh one thing the girl wears a thin gold chain with a tiny crystal star about her neck her faerie mother put it there gaius prospero requests that it remain with her who knows what magic it possesses he smiled at the two men and then with a neat bow left them to ponder his words the girl possesses faerie magic durga said i knew it she will be worth every coin we give the trader and they say that faerie women are passionate beyond all other women take her virginity brother and teach her a few tricks but then i want my turn and i do not choose to wait was her sheath tight when you put your finger in her i have never known a virgins to be tighter enda said wickedly and then regretted his words immediately his brothers black eyes gleamed in lustful anticipation i have said i will leave her to you and i willbut the night you take her virginity i must have her too so i can also experience that virgin denseness it is only fair enda for i have put up much of my gold for this purchase too enda laughed mother always said you were greedy too durga the girl will receive a full measure of our lust that night and if she conceives then it matters not which of us is the childs sire the infant will have her faerie blood we should have thought of this before we must find more like her so all of our men may breed sons on faerie women the curse will finally be lifted from us you must marry tira as soon as possible durga said she must be ready to receive her son from the faerie girl we cannot kill her as we do the others enda told his brother this disaster came upon us because our men murdered a faerie woman in the first place this faerie and the others we find must be treated well for their wombs hold our future i am ashamed that my blood is tainted by that of a midland woman once our seed was pure and we wed only with each other we did not have to bring strangers into our midst in order to breed up our sons at least the same breeder gave us life durga said she must have been a clever creature to lure our sire back into her bed when she was nursing me none before her had done so they suckled their nurslings like good little ewe sheep never knowing that when their children were weaned they would be taken away and given to their real mothers never suspecting poor little lambkins that the men who filled their wombs would strangle them and bury their bodies in the darkest part of the forest he laughed it will not happen in our generation enda said but possibly in our sons time or our grandsons one day we will produce sons on our own women again one day our women will not weep with the curse of their infertility because the men of our grandfathers generation murdered a faerie woman and then refused to atone for their crime this is a new beginning for us durga we will be hailed as heroes by our descendants durga nodded and then swilling down his goblet of wine he arose from the high board i am going to bed he said i have a fresh and juicy woman to give me pleasure this night the trader may depart tomorrow unharmed tis only a days ride to the border by horse though the caravan travels slower i intend plugging the fiery truda until her legs can no longer hold her upthe memory of the beautiful lara will encourage me onward he chuckled i will tell sita you are to wed her sister tira soon i think the autumn is a good time eh enda nodded why not he agreed we will plan the date for a time when laras moonlink is broken she is unclean then and i will need a pretty outlet for my lustful nature tira will be a good substitute now that i have a breeder to get a son on it is time i wed the brothers parted enda remaining in the hall drinking he considered taking one of the new slave women for his amusement but he knew now he would never be content knowing that lara lay sleeping below the hall in the traders wagon he licked his lips in anticipation of their first night she would be afraid of course but he would soothe her with kisses and caresses and when he had convinced her she had no other choice but to sweetly yield herself to him he would fill her tight little sheath full with his manroot leaving her breathless with his skill and while he plundered her virginity his brother would watch his own need for lara swelling when enda had finished with her that first time durga would cover the girls fair body with his own he would howl with his satisfaction for durga was a noisy lover how laras eyes would widen when his brothers thick manroot filled her sheath he fully admitted his elder sibling had a bigger mass of man flesh but enda had a much longer organ he would push it right to the mouth of her womb and she would cry out when he filled her full with his potent seed then enda grinned looking down to see his manroot engorged and poking up beneath his tunic the mere thought of the beauteous half faerie girl set more than his pulses racing he was afire with need for her standing up he walked slowly from his brothers hall and stood on the treed portico looking down at the traders encampment where the object of his intense desire slept her innocent sleep or was she thinking of him and tossing with her own thoughts she could feel him he was somewhere near and his very presence was disturbing i dont want this she murmured silently to the crystal you have a fate to follow to live out the voice said back to her they repel me these forest lords she replied you will not be long with them ethne promised her just a little while be brave child you are protected the caravan awoke before the dawn noss gently shook lara awake and handed her a piece of flat bread with cheese the older girl nodded her thanks and began to eat slowly she had not slept well at all but she knew she would need all her strength and her wits about her if she was to survive what was to come she smiled suddenly remembering rolf fairplays lies yesterday as he attempted to save her from the determination of the forest lords to have her for themselves what made them want her surely it was not just her beauty if it was then her beauty was an anathema and she didnt want it but no she sensed it was something more but what she hoped the revelation would not be too awful noss brought her a basin of warm water you dont have to wait upon me noss lara told her you saved me from those men noss whispered i shall be forever in your debt and must do what i can to serve you while we are yet together lara thank you lara said quickly washing herself then she grew serious in two more days i will leave you noss you will be protected by my mercenary friend but you must stop being afraid of life little one it is an adventure to be lived promise me whenever you think you are growing frightened to remember those words and me you are braver than i noss said until a few days ago i had lived all of my life in the mercenaries quarter of the city noss i have no deep well of experience to sustain me and i am only three years older than you lara replied we are on a journey you and i how we travel our journeys road is up to us if we choose to live in constant fear the journey will be an unpleasant one but if we live it with enthusiasm taking each day as it comes enjoying the surprises and appreciating the quiet times then we will travel a far less bumpy road arent you afraid of being left with the forest lords noss asked lara lara sighed afraid perhaps a little but i will master my fear for to be afraid of these men will give them power over me i do not want that they have some plan in mind for me but i sense i will not be with them for long my road does not end here in the forest it is longer and more complex she smiled at the girl come let us roll up our mattresses and fold our coverlets it is almost time for the caravan to depart we have a long day ahead of us noss shook her head you are so brave she said will you try to be brave even when i am gone lara replied i will try noss promised they left the head foresters compound just as the first rays of the sun crept over the horizon traveling at a steady pace as they had since leaving the city at midday the wagons stopped to allow the animals a small rest they ate and then were on their way again not stopping until the summer twilight had almost faded into night rolf fairplay came to see how the two girls were doing he patted nosss cheek telling her i will only sell you to a kind master little one i have promised lara and i have promised her to try not to be so fearful noss said the trader chuckled excellent he said will we reach the border tomorrow lara asked him late probably the exchange between the head forester and myself will take place the following morning lara i could slip over the border and refuse the sale one of the coastal kings will pay just as much for you you would make a fearsome enemy my lord lara told him one who would complain to your guild who would probably attack any traders caravan that entered his precincts from now on even gaius prospero would disapprove of such behavior and your good reputation would be ruined you have agreed to the bargain and you must keep it but i thank you for your kindness it pains me that a slave as fine as you should be condemned to life with the forest clan rolf fairplay answered her you are meant for a better master lara laughed do not compliment me so my lord i might begin to believe you i did not know my mother but believe me i am protected by her faerie magic this star i wear about my neck is proof of it i will be fine lara says she will not be long with the forest lords noss spoke up the trader looked askance what is this an instinct my lord nothing more lara told him softly faerie magic he said nodding only those with it know such things it sets my heart at rest lara i am a trader by profession and commerce is in my very veins but i am also a man like my cousin who likes to see fine merchandise with fine people this sale i have made is grand in scale but far less than i had hoped foralthough i must admit to you that i have made an outrageous profit and obtained more for you than my illustrious cousin would have dared to dream he chuckled i intend to send the gold directly back to him from the desert kingdom is that not dangerous sending so much coin by another caravan she asked him nay i will give the gold to one of the desert men who acts as a banker for the shadow princes and traders like me the banker will send a faeriepost to the city crediting my cousins account for the amount he in turn will have his banker credit my account for the commission i would not travel a step farther than i must with all that gold it is not likely i will see the city for another seven or eight months rolf bid them goodnight then and the two girls unrolled their mattresses and their coverlets and slept again that night in their wagon transport the next day was very much like the previous but the landscape began to change as they traveled the forest thinned out and then was gone entirely during the last few hours of daylight they traveled across a flat terrain of scrubland with stunted trees and bushes rising from an increasingly sandy soil finally as darkness was falling they reached the border station between the desert and the forest grumbling the border inspectors from the forest painstakingly inspected the bills of lading why do you carry two slaves instead of only one one of the guards demanded one slave was considered unfit i only delivered the order but i agreed to see the inferior one was replaced i am taking her for sale elsewhere rolf explained the guard grunted satisfied with the answer content with his inspection he passed the caravan through into the desert realm there rolf fairplay requested permission to camp for the night the head forester from the forest district will be here on the morrow to complete a sale he explained to the desert official i expect he will arrive shortly after the sun is up there is much involved and i thought it better to finish our transaction here rather than at his hall have you a banker nearby the official nodded i will send one of my men for him at dawn you need not depart until you have put your monies with him for credit in the city they ate and prepared for bed once again the sky above them was darker than any lara had ever seen and filled with bright crystal stars while the blue moon of the midlands had been new when she left the city the deep redorange desert moon was a full glorious globe the forest moon a first quarter the previous night was a pale green she wondered what hue the coastal moon was and whether she would ever see it or if one day she might stand somewhere in the outlands and see all the four moons of hetar come to bed lara noss called to her in a moment lara responded she wanted a few last minutes alone in the night to enjoy her freedom she knew that once she came into the possession of the head forester and his brother she would not find much time if any to be alone again she had always enjoyed her solitary time she looked down into the crystal that hung around her neck the little flame flickered and grew brighter what do you want ethne asked to remain brave to not show fear before the forest lords the strength is within you came her reply you have but to use it lara dropped the crystal and it fell to lie in the valley between her breasts she felt its subtle warmth against her skin she wondered once if the voice she heard was her mothers but her father had said no ilona had given her the chain and pendant from her own neck she too had heard the voice for so had she told him when she first showed him the crystal star still it was faerie magic and lara was glad to have it it was odd but she did feel strong it was a sensation she had never truly experienced until recently with a final look at the sky she returned to the cart to sleep too soon morning would come climbing into the cart lara sighed softly noss was already sleeping no doubt relieved that she would not go to the forest lords tomorrow yet the next day noss was awake early and again she brought food for lara and water for her to bathe in before she left them lara thanked her once more and when she had finished her food she washed her face and hands in the warm water even as the forest lords arrived at the border hearing the approaching hoofbeats she brushed out her hair and plaited it into one braid knowing that she would be sent for when it was time rolf fairplay would not let her go until he had counted and weighed every coin in the end it took several hours for the trader was a suspicious man where transactions of this sort were involved each coin was checked to be certain it was pure gold and not a baser metal merely gilded some coins weighed a bit more and others a bit less but the final weight was exactly what it should be the desert banker was standing by on his side of the border to take the gold that the head forester passed over lara was called to come hugging noss she reminded her to be brave and kissed the girls cheek then the papers transferring laras ownership from gaius prospero through rolf fairplay to durga and enda of the forest kingdom were signed and finally lara daughter of sir john swiftsword stepped across the border separating the desert from the forest and into the custody of her new masters chapter can you ride enda asked lara she shook her head in the negative but i can learn she told him reaching down he pulled her up and settled her before him on his saddle his free hand smoothed over her breasts sweet he murmured in her ear she probably should be afraid lara considered but she wasnt it was a childish display of ownership she said nothing as he drew her back against him his sinewy arm clamped about her slender waist we wont go very fast he told her if you expect to return to your hall tonight you will have to eventually lara said if it took rolf fairplays caravan two days to reach the border you must have ridden quickly to reach here in just a day you are educated he was surprised enough to understand time and distance she told him you have not been raised a slave his voice was hot in her ear no lara replied shortly tell me he said curious now you know my mother was a faerie woman she deserted us when i was an infant my father was a member of the mercenary guild lara said my fathers mother raised me and then my stepmother susanna my father is a great warrior and very much wanted to join the crusader knights but he had not the means until it was suggested that he sell me to gaius prospero and so i am now in your possession did your father at least win his place among the crusader knights enda asked yes lara said i saw it all and he fought well why did not gaius prospero sell you to one of the pleasure houses you are obviously meant for one enda probed that was his plan but the head mistress of the guild of pleasure women would not permit it my beauty was already causing dissension among the women the owners of the pleasure houses and their patrons and then there is my faerie heritage some feared it lara concluded i do not fear it he said softly and she felt his hot mouth on the back of her neck for centuries the forest folk and the faerie folk have been allies we enjoy making love to faerie women his teeth nipped her flesh i am not a faerie woman lara protested softly i only had a faerie mother i know nothing of magic or spells if you have purchased me for that reason you have cheated yourselves there is still time to catch rolf fairplay and have him return your gold he will do so and the coastal kings son will not be disappointed enda laughed no we will not return you and poor arcas will never know what he has missed the trader is satisfied with the transaction and the banker who took our gold has already sent a faeriepost to the city to credit gaius prospero you belong to me and my brother now lara best to get used to that fact the hand fondling her breast pinched the nipple sharply making her gasp in surprise he laughed and they continued on their way after a short while their pace increased until they were cantering along a barely discernible trail and the forest around them was deep and dark the caravan had not come this way lara realized but it occurred to her that the travelers route might not necessarily be the fastest route but the easiest their path led up hills and across meadows the horses never seemed to flag and lara wondered if they would stop before they reached their destination but as the sun reached its zenith in the summer sky the brothers drew their mounts to a halt in a small clearing with a stream durga was off his mount first and coming over lifted lara down from her perch on endas saddle he tipped her face up to his saying do not be fearful faerie girl we will treat you well and you will do our bidding obediently eh yes my lord lara told him his black eyes were small and piggy restrain your lust brother enda said joining them remember your promise to me and he chuckled do not take long then his elder replied if you were not so delicate in your manner we could have her here and now on yon mossy bank think of the pleasure we would gain and tis a fine day for it durga concluded enda laughed aloud no he said our seed will grow more potent if we wait then he turned to lara who had been listening to them and struggling to restrain her aversion go into the bushes girl and relieve yourself we will be doing the same are you hungry aye do what you must and then well eat he told her hidden behind the greenery lara obeyed him for it was the only sensible thing to do she gazed down at her pendant the little flame glowed steadily she drew a deep breath and stepped out into the clearing again where the two men were awaiting her enda handed her a chunk of bread spread with the most delicious cheese she had ever tasted in all her life it was soft and creamy and had bits of mushroom in it lara gobbled it down none too delicately and enda eyes dancing with amusement handed her a second piece my betrothed wife tira makes the cheese he said it is good isnt it you have a wife she was surprised we wed in the autumn she is the younger sister of durgas wife sita my brother and i are members of the ruling family it is tradition that our wives come from one particular family what if a particular generation had no females lara asked him it has never happened enda said our bloodline is pure and goes back to the days of the creation the forest clans are the oldest families on hetar they gave her a little wine to drink and then they remounted their horses and were on their way again it was very late afternoon when they arrived back at durgas hall sandwiched between her two owners lara mounted the narrow winding staircase that led to the treetop structure she was amazed by it all there was nothing like it in the city i have my own quarters here in the hall enda told her as he led her away although my brother and i both own you you will remain with me for the interim he opened a door at the end of a dim passageway and led her inside it was different from anything she had ever known but it reminded her somehow of the hovel yet it was not the large chamber was dark because of its rough wood walls and ceiling a big stone fireplace with a blazing fire gave the room a pleasant warmth the floors were covered with sheepskins to keep out the cold the furniture a large table and several chairs were roughmade of heavy wood there was no decoration of any kind she did not know if this was because it was a mans quarters or because the forest clans did not have such finery he walked across the chamber and flung open another door this is where you will spend a great deal of your time lara here in my bed when tira and i are wed i will not live here but rather in my own hall you however will remain here waiting on the pleasure of your masters he slid an arm about her are you afraid of what she asked him striving to seem unconcerned yes she was afraid afraid of this dark place afraid of the knowledge that it would be her task to give pleasure to both of these brothers who called themselves her masters but she would never admit it never of what lies ahead for you he said turning her about to look down into her beautiful face of me his lips brushed hers gently she felt nothing nothing but icy disdain and she was surprised i should be a fool not to know that you and your brother have purchased me to be your pleasure woman but i know naught of what you desire lara told him in the city a virgin who enters a pleasure house has her firstnight rights auctioned off to the highest bidders for i am told every girl has three virginities to take after that first night she is trained in the arts of pleasing the men and the women who visit her since the pleasure guild refused to have me among them i have had no training in the pleasure arts my brother and i will teach you how to please a man he told her and we shall enjoy taking your virginity i shall go first for it was my extra gold that allowed my brother to pay what he did for you but he shall be with us that night in our bed and he shall enter your body second that same night it is only right as he is the elder why did you pay such an outrageous sum for my person lara asked him our reasons are our own you would not understand enda told her do not ask me again or i will personally whip you i would dislike marking that lovely skin but i will be obeyed lara lest anyone think me weak do you understand me yes my lord she replied softly then we shall not quarrel he said his fingers caressing her arms as he spoke he could feel his lust for her rising durga was right they would not wait long not tonight for he could see the girl was tired but perhaps tomorrow if she had no knowledge then it was probably best to begin her schooling as soon as possible is there somewhere i may wash my lord her soft voice made the request there is always water and a basin in the bedchamber he told her you will want to rest until the evening meal i will have food brought to you you will be left in peace tonight i will have one of the women bring you your belongings you will not leave these rooms unless i come for you lara yes my lord she agreed and watched as he turned and left her when he had gone she looked about her more carefully but her first impressions were only confirmed durgas dwelling was a comfortable but rough place she went into the bedchamber and looked about the wooden bed of course was huge with four carved pillars and a wooden canopy she wanted to see what covered it but she also wanted to bathe the dust of the road from herself she hadnt had a bath since leaving the city there would be time enough to explore if she was truly to be left alone tonight she found a pitcher of water in the coals of the bedchamber fireplace exactly where it should be she tipped the water into the basin on the little table that stood against a wall loosening her gown she let it slip to the floor and taking up the cloth that had been in the basin she washed herself all over when she had finished she shook the dust from her gown she disliked donning it again as she thought it dirty but there was no other choice she did not yet have her pack then she went out into the other room and sat by the fire it felt good to sit still and quiet the warmth of the hearth took the forests dampness from the chamber she was certain that durgas hall was filling up with his family his friends and retainers as the evening came on but she heard nothing and then the door to the chamber opened and two women entered one carried a tray and the other her pack lara recognized them at once belda jael she cried were not supposed to talk to you belda whispered durgas orders jael added putting laras pack on a chair are you all right lara said low they both nodded belda put the tray on the table well find a way she murmured and then she and jael hurried out of the chamber on the tray lara found a bowl of venison stew fresh warm bread a piece of cheese and a small cup of ale never a fussy eater she wolfed it all down leaving not even a crumb for a mouse going to the chamber window she looked out but in the twilight saw nothing but thick green leaves she wondered if she should bar the door but there was no lock shrugging she walked back into the bedchamber she was very weary with all that had gone on in the past weeks enda had said she would be left to herself tonight and she suspected it would be a good time to catch up on her sleep to her surprise there was a glimpse of the green forest moon through the trees outside this chambers window she added a bit more fuel to the fire and then fetched her pack setting it on the bed she opened it and drew out a clean chemise she removed her dusty travel gown and put on the clean one then digging down in the packet she pulled out the pearwood hairbrush that tania had given her and began to brush her long gilt hair her hair needed washing but the morning would be time enough lara thought to herself she slowly rebraided her hair as she considered that for the first time since her grandmother had died she was completely alone it was both comforting and frightening the light had now faded completely and lara drew the coverlet from the bed surprised to find it made with rough but clean linen climbing in she settled down reaching for the crystal about her neck am i really where i should be she wondered silently you are exactly where you should be the flame flickered its answer these men frighten me they are so different from those i have known men are men the fiery voice murmured these are simply less civilized than many and yet they are the proudest on hetar why must i be sacrificed to them lara asked suddenly rebellious i shall hate it when they touch me i already do i shall feel nothing it is the only way i will survive no you must feel everything for to understand passion and to control it you must know it most intimately lara your faerie blood will protect you believe me what is it they want of me and why me she begged the guardian of the crystal you will know when the time is right you will find a true friend here one of the best you shall ever have lara that friend will reveal all you need to know when you need to know it why do you refuse to understand that you are protected by whom lara pleaded desperately by me the voice said softly by those who arranged for your creation on the body of a faerie woman by a young human warrior you will serve us in a special way and then we will serve you in gratitude for the remainder of your life which i can tell you will be a very long one tomorrow night the forest lord brothers will take your virginity from you accept it learn what they can teach you for though they are rough and crude they possess the rudimentary skills of lovemaking do not fear the pleasure you will experience at their hands lara you need to know it and you were never meant for an ordinary life as an ordinary woman now sleep child you will need your strength in the days to come are you my mother lara asked nay you know i am not the voice from the crystal flame replied then who are you one who loves you came her answer you know my name i am ethne and with the words echoing softly in her head lara fell asleep and slept until the sun was well up the following morning she opened her eyes to see the dappled sunlight coming in through the leaves outside of her window she felt both well rested and strangely calm she had never spoken so familiarly or at such length with the guardian flame in the crystal before last night but then her life until just a few weeks ago had been quiet and predictable she had never considered that she was growing up and that her life would have had to change in some way she had assumed that despite her fathers poverty someone would have her to wife and she would go on as she always had but serving a husband instead of her father she sighed and rolled over to gaze out the small window at the green leaves blowing in the summer breeze the patches of blue sky beyond them then resigned she arose and pulled a clean gown on over her chemise going into the dayroom she discovered her tray from last night was gone and in its place was another with a thick slice of brown bread a wedge of hard yellow cheese a hard boiled egg and a peach there was also a carafe of clear spring water to drink she ate and then opening the window of the chamber leaned out to see what she could see in the light of day the air was warm and the scent of the forest was fresh and entirely different from the smells of the city but she could see naught but leaves turning she looked about the room for something to do she was bored and the thought of spending the entire day penned up here was not a pleasant one exploring the room she discovered a trunk full of endas clothing much of it in need of mending didnt his bridetobe keep his clothing in good repair she slammed the trunk lid shut in desperation she took some of the water from the carafe and her bathing cloth and cleaned the two little windows in the two rooms in midmorning the door opened and belda slipped inside finger to her lips in warning she beckoned lara into the bedchamber we can talk here she said in a low voice i came for the tray so i dont have a great deal of time how did you come to remain here surely you were meant for a better place in life lara for some reason i neither know or understand the head forester and his brother would have me they paid rolf fairplay thirty thousand pieces of gold for me the trader did all he could to discourage them even saying i was meant for one of the coastal kings but they were adamant and would not be denied but i do not know why they would pay such a sum belda the woman shook her head truda says they mean to sacrifice you to one of their forest gods because you are a highborn virgin truda is a fool i am a mercenarys daughter although my father is now a crusader knight i have been poor my entire life and tonight my virginity will indeed be sacrificed but to no godrather it will be sacrificed to the lust of both enda and durga one does not spend that kind of wealth for a religious sacrifice but let truda think what she will lara said with a small smile durga has used her for pleasure already she thinks that makes her special and has tried to lord it over us but durgas wife the lady sita slapped her for her presumption belda said now i must go i was to ask if you needed anything two things if i might be indulged a real bath so i may wash my dirty hair and a needle and some thread to do some mending lara told belda i am not used to being idle and i am bored ill tell the lady sita they are not bad these forest folk ill be back if i can belda promised and picking up the tray left lara alone again to laras surprise however belda returned shortly bringing with her a small basket containing needles and thread the lady sita sends you this with her compliments she says she must ask her husband and lord enda if you may bathe for you would have to be escorted to the bathhouse do they all live in the trees lara asked belda nay only the few lords among them there is a village below but you could not see it from the caravan the trees are like the great walls of a town or the city then she hurried from the room again lara went to the trunk and pulling out the most damaged of endas garments set to work repairing them the day did not seem so dull now as she sat by a window for light plying her needle industriously by late afternoon she had finished the worst of his clothing and was making minor repairs on the rest of them she did not hear the door to the chamber open and close and jumped at the sound of his voice what are you doing are those my clothes enda asked her in a hard voice where did you obtain your sewing supplies lara looked up calmer now you could not expect me to remain here all day without something to do i found your garments and asked the woman they sent with my meal for needle and thread she returned with this basket and the lady sitas compliments surely you are not displeased with me i would have thought your betrothed wife would have done this but perhaps you have not asked her tira is the daughter of a great family like mine she does not do slaves work he answered lara then he picked up one of his shirts examining it carefully this is very good work i cannot see the stitches he complimented her thank you lara told him i am glad if i have pleased you my lord there are other ways in which i would have you please me he said drawing her into the circle of his arms and so you shall my lord i have not a doubt lara said i am told i am a good student i hope i shall prove worthy of your teaching she looked up at him but briefly and then down again her dark lashes set off by her fair skin and in vivid contrast with her hair i have not your skill with words my fair slave girl but i shall teach you better ways to entertain me that little tongue of yours will soon discover other talents than speaking cleverly he tipped her face up to his i am told you would bathe aye his deep brown eyes were very beautiful and even mesmerizing do not fear the pleasure she heard the echo of the crystal guardians voice you look clean enough to me he said i am used to bathing regularly she told him at least several times a week my lord and my hair is filled with the dust of my travels if i take you to the bathhouse i will remain to watch you he replied it is your privilege my lord she answered sweetly are you always so amenable and mildtempered he wondered not always my lord lara said are you not in the least fearful of losing your virginity tonight he demanded i am anxious aye she responded quietly what virgin is not but it is a natural thing which must happen to all girls mustnt it it is a part of life my lord you have said you mean me no harm and so i have hope that you will be patient and gentle with me she gave him a faint smile my brother and i love differently that is why i have insisted upon being the first with you enda said i will be gentle and i will be patient i have great hopes of you lara but durga is a bull of a man he is likely to be rough and impatient with you in his lust but remember i will be by your side too and after tonight he must wait several months again before i will share you with him she wanted to ask why he wanted her why his brother wanted her why they would share her body between them but he had already warned her away from the subject and even her crystal guardian had said it was too soon for her to know all she looked up at him her green eyes unwavering may i have my bath my lord he nodded yes come and i will take you he said then grasping her small hand in his larger one he led her from his rooms and from his brothers great hall they descended the winding stairs but this time they stopped at a small landing and he led her down another flight of steps that went around the huge tree until lara found herself in a pretty village the houses all blended into the landscape they were wood with thatched roofs which she recognized from her grandmothers description of country houses in the central square was a great stone fountain where women were even now drawing water they looked briefly at her as she passed with enda finally they arrived at a square stone building og enda shouted where are you i am here my lord came a voice and a huge creature shuffled from the dimness when he straightened himself up lara gasped he had to stand at least six cubits tall how may i serve you master stoke the furnace up my new pleasure woman would bathe herself enda said og shuffled away bending to pass beneath the stone archway i have never seen a creature like that lara admitted what is he the last of the forest giants enda told her they have served us for centuries he drew her down upon a stone bench he will tell us when your bath is ready his hands began to fondle her breasts i am told a maids breasts grow with loving he said and brushed her lips with his tira has almost no breasts at all i shall have a great deal of work on my hands he chuckled to give her pretty tits you however have two nice little fruits about the size of summer peaches i shall attempt to grow them to nice large apples by autumn he undid her gown and slid his hand beneath her chemise touching her skin with easy fingers do you like it when i touch you lara you must not be afraid to tell me what pleases you as i tutor you in passion his thumb rubbed a nipple and he smiled as it puckered ah you do like it dont you she hid her face in his shoulder his hands were invasive but it was exciting they say daughters are like their mothers if that be true then you will have a deliciously licentious and lascivious faerie nature they say faerie women enjoy humans because they are more passionate is that so my girl he murmured in her ear nipping the lobe and licking at it seductively as his fingers tightened about her breast i do not know my lord lara half gasped i have never had a lover why did her blood feel like it was beginning to boil no little virgin you havent have you but tonight i will instruct you in the joys of passion you are going to like it i promise you but to what purpose lara wondered once again and then she sighed which seemed to please him greatly the water is growing hotter by the minute my lord the giant og had returned he seemed able to stand within the bathhouse but for the arches there is soap drying cloths enda demanded as he loosened his grip on lara and drew his hand from her chemise everything is as you would have it my lord the giant replied then get out and do not return until you are certain we are gone go and ask for food at my brothers hall tell them i said you were to have it thank you my lord you are generous og said bowing but lara heard the hint of sardonic rebellion in his voice the giant withdrew from the bathhouse he sleeps here enda said it is the only place in the village large enough for him come he led her into a room with a great stone tub in the floor take off your garments but do not enter the water until i have had my fill of looking at you lara complied with his request feeling shy but refusing to show it enda and durga had seen her naked when they had inspected her but that was somehow different she slipped slowly from her gown and chemise standing quietly beneath his gaze he stared hard and then said the hours until i can couple with you will be long lara get into the water and do what you must he sat down on a single stone bench in the bathing room and watched as she bathed herself thoroughly he almost wept at the beauty of her body and the long hair she now washed even dirty it was glorious when she had finished she said quietly would you not like to bathe too my lord i have been taught by my stepmother how to wash a man he couldnt resist stripping his clothing off so quickly she had no time to look at his masculine attributes but she noted that his arms and legs were hairy well she thought soon enough she would be most familiar with them he slid into the warm water and placed himself in her capable hands he would have never admitted it aloud but this custom of the citys was a most enjoyable one her soft hands moving the washing cloth over his shoulders his back his chest was not simply pleasant it was seductive as well although he could see she was working hard not to entice him im going to wash your hair she told him and before he might protest she did just that and then she washed his face his neck and his ears as well there she said finally we are done my lord and she climbed swiftly up the tubs steps and wrapped herself in a drying cloth while holding one out for him he entered it meekly and sat quietly as she dried him efficiently then he watched as she dried herself off and toweled her long hair damp im sorry you must wear dirty garments she said mine were clean this morning i should have thought to bring some next time then she handed him his clothing while quickly donning her own did you like it i did and durga will be most jealous when he learns of this interlude but then if he had come with us he would have not been able to restrain himself and would have taken you upon the floor but we will bring him next time eh it is your right to command my lord and mine but to obey lara responded enda laughed why is it i sense you are not as meek as you pretend he asked her but i shall soon teach you that a man is the master he caressed her beautiful face with his hand and when i have taught you the beginnings of passion i shall make you beg me for the pleasures a man and woman can give one another when his manroot is buried deep in a womans hidden garden then he yanked lara into his arms and kissed her surprised mouth hard tell me you want me he groaned not yet lara heard herself say and wondered where the answer had come from she was amazed at her calm in the face of her situation she felt an odd strength filling her and knew that she was indeed protected as the guardian of the crystal had told her tonight you will he said curtly ashamed to have shown her even the slightest moment of weakness what was the matter with him this faerie girl was intoxicating and he began to wonder if they had not made a mistake in purchasing her come he said i must return to my brothers hall and you to my rooms you will not yet be allowed to speak with our women back in the dayroom lara found her supper waiting she had been given a portion of broiled trout a ham slice and a roasted capons wing there was bread and cheese and another peach and wine a large carafe of it she ate everything and drank sparingly then finished she washed her hands and face and cleaned her teeth removing her clothing she climbed into the large bed she instinctively knew he would want her naked and she had few garments as it was tonight she could hear singing from durgas hall she finally fell asleep only to awaken at the sound of a footfall in the other room she heard wine being poured into the silver goblet that had arrived this evening with her meal enda entered the room and slowly pulled off his garments folding them neatly and laying them upon the chair then he moved to the hearth and added some fuel to the fire lara noted his buttocks were nicely rounded and firm finally he turned to her pausing to allow her a full measure of his manliness mens bodies lara decided then and there had not the beauty of a womans enda was bigboned as were all the forest people he walked to the bed and lifting the coverlet climbed into it reaching for her as he did so lara tensed as he pulled her atop him so that their bodies were matched breast to breast belly to belly thigh to thigh her flesh seemed to melt into his hardness she swallowed hard as a big hand caressed her from the nape of her neck to her buttocks but she was unable to restrain the shudder that overcame her the touch was so possessive easy girl he said softly as if he were speaking to a frightened animal the hand encircled her bottom slowly slowly slowly thats right get used to your masters touch be good and you will be rewarded the hand fondled her again just as she was getting used to it his two hands clamped about her slim waist and lifted her up just enough to put his face in the narrow glen separating her little round breasts she felt him breathe deeply inhaling her scent then raising his head enda deliberately licked the flesh between her breasts laras eyes widened with surprise and when he shifted her position just slightly to clamp his mouth over a nipple she felt her heart skip a beat the brown eyes stealthily observed her every little reaction he suckled on her nipple and was rewarded with a startled gasp he sucked harder his teeth gently worrying the tender nub of flesh and she cried out softly she was utterly charming in her surprise he released his hold on her breast and quickly rolled lara onto her back within the curve of his embrace did you like that he asked her she hesitated but then remembered ethnes advice aye she admitted i did there is more to mating than the coupling he told her although with durga you will simply be mounted and used my brother is not a subtle man i on the other hand find women who enjoy passion more enjoyable as lovers durga does not understand why the slave women prefer my attentions to his except for women like truda who think by lying beneath him they can gain power and status for themselves but they cannot lara noted quietly of course not she is not of the pure blood he answered her then he tipped her face up to his and kissed her how clever of you to see it so clearly and so quickly lara his knuckles grazed her cheekbone now enough talking girl if we do not get on with this business of deflowering you soon durga will be here and eager for his share he kissed her harder now he was the first man to ever kiss her lara thought she let her mouth kiss him back tasting him sensing the rising desire in those kisses what would it be like to love and be loved she wondered briefly then she put the thought from her mind love was a luxury available to a very few if indeed it even existed it was not her fate to be loved enda now rolled lara beneath him growling in her ear open your legs for me girl i am almost ready to have you obediently she spread herself for him this much she understood for susanna had explained it she felt his fingers playing with her most intimate flesh which sent a bolt of sensation through her what was this susanna had said nothing of reciprocal feelings but perhaps she was not allowed to speak on such things the tingling in her nether regions made lara uneasy and she squirmed restlessly ahh yes girl you are almost ready for me the fingers swirled expertly between her nether lips playing with the sensitive nub he half rose putting her between his two sinewy thighs he leaned forward moving carefully toward his ultimate goal lara watched him fascinated through halfclosed eyes the play of emotions across his face was most revealing she sensed the tip of his manhood touching the entry to her body felt him pushing his manroot into her stopping and then with a cry of undisguised triumph bursting through her maidenhead to fill her entirely lara cried out for the momentary fork of pain caught her off guard she struggled to unseat him scratching and clawing at him even as the pain subsided quickly and was gone enda caught at the dainty hands that fought him pinioning them at her sides as he found his rhythm and began to pleasure himself within her tight sheath he groaned with his enjoyment relishing her compactness as he was filled more and more with hot desire never had a woman given him such delight he actually wept with the feelings consuming him and realized he craved far more of her than he had any right to want he brushed her lips tenderly and was startled when their gazes met lara looked at this man laboring atop her and for a brief moment she felt sorry for him his need for her seemed so genuine and so desperate she didnt understand why free my hands my lord she whispered to him tell me what to do he released her immediately put your arms about me and close your eyes he instructed her in a tight voice she did drawing him down against her breasts her fingers caressing the back of his thick neck with her eyes closed she was more acutely aware of him inside her she sighed and catching his rhythm matched it he told her to wrap her legs about his torso and when she did so she felt him slip deeper she began to gain a certain pleasure herself now that she was no longer afraid or in pain enda could not hold back any longer she was too delicious but he hadnt had enough of her yet still his juices exploded forth with a ferocity that left him breathless and lara surprised at another revelation susanna had not mentioned but when he collapsed upon her she held him as she would have held a fretful baby and in that moment lara understood the power that women held over men men might think whatever they chose to think but in the end women would rule the day she almost laughed aloud to take a man between your legs was nothing at all finally his breathing grew normal and he rolled off of her you show promise he said to her i am glad if i have pleased you my lord lara told him dryly i must summon durga now enda said he will want his share of you tonight before i may have you to myself again do not let him frighten you he will be rough and he will be quick if he is up to his usual form he laughed as he arose from the bed she lay quietly as he left the room returning several minutes later with his older brother durga viewed her with contemplative lust his piggy black eyes bright has she washed your scent off of her he demanded of his sibling she will do so now enda said i arose from her body immediately to fetch you brother reaching out he pulled lara up from the bed she hurried to the hearth where the bowl of warmed water and a cloth was waiting susanna had advised her to always wash ones private parts after passion she winced however as she bathed herself amazed at the amount of blood that had been shed in the taking of her virginity when she turned back to the bed she found both men were already in it durga had drawn off his clothing and she saw that while he was a big man he did not run to fat lara approached the bed slowly hurry up now durga snapped ive waited for you long enough i think reaching out he yanked her atop him sit up now faerie girl and let me play with your titties they have a ways to grow but theyre the prettiest ive ever seen his two big hands sat her up and grabbed at her breasts crushing them and making her cry out gently brother enda said laughing lara is a delicate little creature not like that big healthy cow truda youve taken to your bed truda knows how to give a man a good ride durga answered you should try her sometime she can suck a manroot better than any ive ever had i think ill keep my little faerie girl for a while enda replied she gave me much pleasure tonight and will give me more when you have had your turn brother all right wench durga said looking directly at lara the time has come for you to give me a bit of that same pleasure he removed her from his torso and put her on her back then climbing atop her he lifted his engorged manroot to her eyes and pushed it between her two breasts closing his eyes for a long moment what do you think of this one he demanded of her knowing she was expected to comment lara said tis a very fine manroot my lord quite different from the lord endas durga laughed heartily aye mine can split a girl in two and leave her wanting more than she ought to have and he roared with laughter once again then withdrawing himself from between her breasts he pulled her beneath him and without another word thrust hard into laras body groaning with delight at her denseness his black eyes closed a look of rapture blooming on his face as he pumped her vigorously over and over again she had not been ready but he hadnt cared didnt even notice all he had wanted was her body for his pleasure at least enda had made the experience a pleasant one but lara knew what was expected of her with this man she cried out as if she were actually enjoying his attentions she wrapped her legs about him whimpering but she felt nothing but anger at his cruelty with a roar and a howl he released his seed into her body for the briefest moment he lay atop her crushing her but then he arose shes good brother and with your careful schooling she will eventually be perfect ive had my fair taste and i wish you much enjoyment of her you may have her to yourself for the autumn but come the winter i will want her again but i am willing to share as we have this time good night and gathering up his few garments he left them to find truda for if truth be known it was durga this night who wanted more than he ought to have lara arose and bathed herself again she was sore now and where enda had taken care with her durga had left her feeling dirtied returning to the bed she lay down and waited for enda to claim her again instead he said sleep now lara i will stay with you and later i shall have my pleasure of you again he rolled away from her and was quickly asleep she was surprised but grateful she doubted he would be as thoughtful in the nights to come but this was tonight she reached for the crystal to reassure herself well it is done she told the guardian silently yes it is done ethne returned as silently and the flame flickered lara closed her eyes and slept when she awoke she could see a sliver of light coming through the leaves outside the window and enda was covering her face with his tender kisses you wish more pleasuring she said quietly looking at him directly she supposed he could be called handsome he was tall and bigboned his skin ruddy from being outdoors durga however was stockier and shorter than enda although just as bigboned and durgas features could not be called pretty by any means though his black beard was attractive his dark eyes were small and his nose large yet they had the same mother it was curious lara thought aye he agreed but first you need a little bit of soothing open your legs for me lara and when she had he slid between them drawing her nether lips apart with two fingers he let his tongue begin a journey of exploration about the coral shell of her womanhood he licked her slowly first the inside of the lips themselves and then moving deeper into the more hidden regions of her body lara murmured with surprise at his actions but it was so nice and he was soothing her newly opened flesh the pointed tip of his tongue swirled gently about the opening to her sheath and her eyes closed to better savor the sensations he was now arousing within her she was almost purring the tongue touched the sentient nub within her flesh and began to tease at it she moaned and moved restlessly as her body grew hot and she experienced a longing she had never before felt she could feel her own wetness as the nub tingled he raised his dark auburn head his brown eyes glazed with his desire for her then slowly he moved his big body up and over her his manroot sliding into her smoothly in a single motion and then he lay quiet do you feel me within you lara aye i do my lord he seemed thicker and longer than he had earlier tell me he murmured hotly in her ear you are hard she whispered harder and bigger than before i feel the heat from you i am almost afire you are beginning to experience passion he told her and you could not have a better teacher my little faerie girl for i am a master of passion tonight i shall begin teaching you all you must know to please me and thereby any man you take between your legs but now i must release my lust for you for it but weakens me he began to move on her and shortly she felt him filling her with his seed again and when he had finished he arose from the bed they had shared gathering his garments remain in bed to rest he told her i will send a woman to you with food and water i want to bathe again she said will you do this every day he asked her amused she nodded i like being clean and i can smell both you and your brother on my flesh besides i am more pleasant for you when i smell fresh she gave him a small smile i will tell the woman she may escort you to the bathhouse he agreed and then was gone out the door lara slept awakening when belda entered the bedchamber calling her name i have brought you something to eat gracious that bed looks well used lara slid from beneath the coverlet i am well used and the prize of my virginity gone in the night lara told her stepping from the bed you bled heavily belda said pointing was he pleased well satisfied and his brother as well lara replied both of them beldas eyes grew wide you poor girl first the lord enda and then his brother who came conquered and departed lord enda is not a bad sort i suppose he was not unkind last night when he breeched me or this morning when he took his fill again lara pulled on her chemise he says i may go to the bathhouse aye so i was instructed by the lady sita do you want to eat first belda inquired ive brought a meal first i need to get the stink of those two men off me lara told her she picked up her cloak and started for the door have you see the giant og who lives in the bathhouse lord enda says it is the only place other than the outofdoors where he may stand up she followed belda down the stairs through the hall and outside they say the forest giants were servants of the forest lords until some plague wiped them out og was an infant and the only survivor belda said imagine an entire race being extinguished like that poor fellow must be lonely they hurried through the village which was busy this morning lara noticed that some of the women pointed toward her and others made signs as if to ward off a hex reaching the bathhouse they went inside where og greeted them bowing low the lord enda sent ahead to say you would be coming lady he said i am lara she told him a pleasure woman and nothing more og please call me by my name and this is belda a slave woman the water is hot lara og said to her and he smiled a sweet smile he had very light blue eyes and short cropped red hair go in go in ill come back for you belda said do you know how long you will be the lady sita doesnt approve of idleness and so i must return to the hall now or be punished perhaps a half an hour lara said i washed my hair last night ill tell my lady and someone will return to escort you back belda said and then she hurried out og ushered lara into the bathing room and then withdrew closing the great oaken door behind him alone now the girl shed her enveloping cloak slipped out of her chemise and stepped down into the water pinning her hair up as she did it was hotter than last night and perfect to take the soreness from her body with a sigh she closed her eyes the worst she hoped was over although she still didnt understand what it was they wanted of her after a few minutes lara stepped onto the lower step of the tub and taking up the washing cloth dipped it into the stone jar of soft soap she washed herself thoroughly removing the soap with the rinsing shell by the bathing tubs edge and then returning to soak for a few more minutes finally remembering that someone would be coming to escort her back to durgas hall she stepped from the water and wrapped herself in a large drying cloth a long dull day stretched ahead of her but at least there was more mending to do she had not finished repairing endas garments yesterday but she probably would today and what would she do tomorrow penned in those two rooms she would ask him tonight for a little more freedom even in the city she had been permitted to roam pulling her chemise back on and covering herself with her cloak lara came from the bathing room but no one was waiting for her she sat down on a bench within the waiting room where they had waited last night for og to stoke the fires heating the water the giant shuffled into the chamber ducking his length beneath a stone arch in order to do so i would take you back myself but they are very bound that things be done a certain way your desire for a bath has discommoded them they will make you wait here to punish you if they would permit me to speak with the lady sita i could schedule my visits here to coincide with their tasks lara said yes he agreed that would be the sensible thing to do but the forest folk dont always do things in a sensible manner they have their traditions their ways and will change nothing you are part faerie aye i am and you are the first to understand that half faerie is not all faerie lara told him with a smile he chuckled if any of them had ever seen a real faerie they would know the difference he told her you have seen them lara was intrigued you must not tell he said and was suddenly frightened i should not have said it lara i will keep your secret she promised reaching out to pat his huge hand with her tiny one i am good at keeping secrets i thought the forest faeries were the allies of the forest lords once og said but no more they work hard to keep that fact unknown lest any think they have lost their powers as the oldest clans on hetar the door to the bathhouse opened and truda stepped inside im to escort you back to my lord durgas hall she said sourly goodbye og lara said rising and following after truda goodbye lara he called after her chapter you talk with that dirty giant truda wanted to know he is the bath keeper lara said she didnt want to talk to truda my master lord durga came right to my bed from yours truda said you obviously didnt give him much pleasure but you do lara answered sweetly i am glad truda looked confused she had just bragged on her allure practically saying that hers was obviously greater than laras and yet the faerie girl had simply agreed and she had even been pleasant lara could see the puzzlement on trudas face good she didnt want to speak with the woman to begin with and now she had rendered her speechless they climbed the winding staircase up the tree and entered the hall thank you lara told truda cheerfully and ran into the corridor where endas chambers were located safely back in those two rooms she opened the trunk and took out the two garments that still needed mending suddenly the door to the chamber opened and a woman stepped through i am the lady sita lord durgas wife she said i came to see if you were all right after your ordeal last night she was a tall woman with sad eyes but an air of command lara arose and bowed from the waist thank you lady i am well tired perhaps but well you are mending endas garments there was surprise in sitas voice i am not used to being idle lara told her that is why i asked for needle and threads yesterday thank you for sending them i did not know pleasure women were able to sew sita replied i am not a pleasure woman lady i was supposed to be but i wasnt sold to a pleasure house i was sent to the coast virgins entering the pleasure houses have their firstnight rights auctioned off and not until after that night are they taught their craft my father was a mercenary until he became a crusader knight at this last tournament just held in the city and i helped my stepmother keep his house clean and his garments mended i am just a girl no more lara told her quietly then why did they buy you from the trader sita asked i do not know but i believe it had something to do with the fact that i am half faerie they seemed quite interested in that lara responded who told them that sita said the slave woman truda lara answered sita nodded and then she said you will tell no one of this conversation between us girl do you understand me sometimes it is better a wife know things that perhaps she should not for the protection of her family you are the mistress of this hall lady and i will obey you in return i beg your permission to bathe at the bathhouse each day it is my habit you dare to bargain with me girl sita did not know whether to be angry or amused by laras simple request nay lady i but humbly ask your permission lara quickly said displease me and you will die of your own stink girl sita said by way of acquiescence you know that my younger sister will wed lord enda in autumn aye lady i do and that forest folk do not mix their blood with those of outsiders sita continued aye lady i have been told i will tell enda you may come to the hall then sita said and turned to go thank you lady lara responded to the retreating figure the summer came to an end and all around her the forest grew bright with color the trees were dazzling in their brilliant display of hues lara had never seen such glorious shades of reds purples oranges yellows gold and russets in the city the vines on the walls of the quarter had gone red or purple the trees about the great square turned a pale yellow and their leaves were quickly gone blown away in the winds that began to come from the north here however the display seemed to go on forever on the last night of the year enda married his betrothed tira the following morning their bloodied bedsheet was offered as proof of tiras perfection after that enda spent part of each night with lara and the remainder of the night with tira lara did her best to stay in the background as much as possible having discovered her skills at sewing sita saw that all mending needed by the household was brought to lara for repair and she was grateful to be busy enda and tira had not yet moved into their own hall it would not be ready until the spring lara caught tira staring down at her several times from her place at the high board the look was filled with venom after it had happened for the third time lara began taking her meals from the hall and retreating to the two chambers which were now hers one evening durga caught lara by the arm as she attempted to make her escape with some bread and cheese why are you departing the hall faerie girl he asked her roughly my lord endas wife does not like me and i would not disturb her lara said she hates you durga said with a grin she is young foolish and jealous she knows her husband gains more pleasure between your legs than hers go on then and he released her arm still grinning that night as enda pushed himself eagerly into her he said to lara are you not with child yet lara i have seeded you almost every night for the last four months why would you want a child with me she asked him candidly you forest folk do not mix your blood with outsiders i have been told it often enough seed your wife as vigorously as you have me and you will have a fine son but i want you to give me a child my faerie lover he murmured low in her ear if you do not durga will take you into his bed and he will seed you vigorously until his child grows in your womb he held her hips firmly in his two hands and pumped her until she was crying out with the pleasure they had come to share i dont understand lara moaned wrapping her legs about him she had come to crave the pleasures their bodies could give one another you dont have to understand you have but to obey me he told her thrusting hard and smiling wolfishly at her whimpers the rumors had been right faerie women were the finest lovers on the face of hetar after he had left her lara took up her crystal why does he crave a child of me so badly when the forest folk do not mix blood she demanded of her guardian ask the giant og and tell him that ethne says he may speak the truth to you the guardian of the crystal replied in her silent voice in the morning lara went to the bathhouse for her daily ablutions she was now allowed to go alone as she had shown no desire to escape the forest folk og was expecting her and greeted her with a smile he was her only friend now that belda and the other slave women with whom she had comeexcept for truda alasworked in other halls few spoke with her and then rarely the water is hot lara he told her we must speak where we cannot be overheard lara said softly he nodded and led her into the bathing room i expect no others for they are afraid to come when you are here he told her they fear the faerie she said resigned og grinned fools he said he always spoke freely with lara though with others he answered their queries but simply or with a grunt many thought him a lackwit you see the crystal i always wear about my neck she began and he nodded again it was put there by my mother see the flame within it that is my guardian ethne she says you are to speak the truth with me and answer all my questions og ethne a smile lit his face aye i will answer as best i can lara how do you know her lara queried him she is part of my own history i knew ethne as a little one he told her why does enda want a child of me when the forest folk do not mix their blood with that of outsiders og for that matter why did he and durga buy me og sighed it is a long and tragic tale i have to tell you but you will understand when i have finished many years ago the forest was ruled by the ancestors of these men who now people it the giants who served them and the faeries of the forest who were the forest lords allies in everything they did durgas grandfather was head forester then one day in the autumn a group of his men were out hunting they had spent the day chasing the most beautiful roe deer any had ever seen they should have known better for the deer wore a jeweled collar about its neck it was obviously magic the day was coming to an end when the beast was finally cornered in a clearing as they prepared to shoot it with their arrows it turned from a roe deer into a beautiful faerie woman seeing her their lust for the hunt became a lust for the faerie woman she laughed at them mocking them for being so foolish as to follow her the day long now she said they would go home to their halls emptyhanded madness ruled what happened next the hunting party attacked the faerie woman who was weak from having sustained anothers shape all day she could not fight back each of the men had his way with her and when they had finished they killed her taking the beautiful jeweled collar she had worn about her neck back to their head forester the faerie womans body they left lying where they had violated and murdered her that same night as they sat in the hall of the head forester bragging on their day maeve the faerie queen appeared she demanded justice for the slain faerie from the head forester but he refused the faerie woman had taunted his men all day through the deep forest in her guise as a roe deer it was one thing he said for the faerie to amuse herself for a short while with the hunting party but she teased them the day long only revealing herself when she was finally cornered and then she did not offer an apology or give them another deer in exchange to take home for their trouble instead she mocked them and called them foolish she flaunted her beauty before them the faerie woman had gotten what she deserved the head forester told maeve and it should be a lesson to all of maeves people to cease their torment of the forest lords with what they called playfulness there was no justice to be rendered the faerie queen was very angry but the faeries of the forest had been such longtime allies of the forest lords she hesitated at first to destroy that alliance at least return the bejeweled collar maeve asked the head forester but before she might even finish her thought the head forester cried out that he would not he had given the collar to his wife it would serve as a forfeit for his hunters wasted day then give me the lives of five of your hunters in exchange for the faerie womans death maeve said to him blood for blood the faerie woman was young she was foolish but she has paid a terrible price for that foolishness queen maeve reasoned attempting to hide her anger trying to retain the alliance between the faeries and the forest lords but the head forester remained adamant his wife by his side smirking fingering the collar about her neck maeve offered the head forester a months time in which to rethink their difficulties but he told her no amount of time would ever make him reconsider what was done was done the faerie queen could restrain her anger and her outrage no longer she pronounced a curse upon the forest lords that has been their secret shame ever since no one on hetar knows it but me and if they knew i knew it i should be slain like all my kind who once lived in this forest og said gravely what was the curse and why were the giants slain i was told they died in a plague lara was fascinated but ogs story still did not explain why durga and enda had paid such a high price for her or why they even wanted her you know how proud the forest lords are of their heritage how they claim to be the oldest of the peoples on hetar how they do not mate with outsiders maeves curse on them was one that can never be lifted she raised her hand that night and said that never again would the women of the forest clans bear children neither sons nor daughters if they wished to continue to exist they would have to mate with outsiders in order to gain the sons and those sons would be forced also to mate with outsiders in order to reproduce the daughters they created would be either rendered infertile or able only to birth females their proud and pure bloodlines would disappear in the next centuries until all trace of who they really were would be gone from hetar and then maeve the faerie queen pointed a long finger at the wife of the head forester almost immediately the collar about her neck began to tighten until the woman was strangled and died maeve then stretched out her hand and the collar flew into it even as she disappeared in a clap of thunder from the hall og concluded how terrible lara said softly it was but the beginning og continued on all the women who had been carrying children in their wombs at the time maeve cursed the forest clans either miscarried or bore dead infants and no matter how vigorously the men of the forest seeded their women no children of pure lineage have been born to them since after several years the forest lords were forced to admit the curse was real at first they sought for the faeries themselves in an effort to have the curse lifted but they could not find them the men of the forest began to mate with outsiders and suddenly their halls were filled with children once more the mothers of these children were kept alive only until the children were weaned from their breasts then they were slaughtered and buried deep in the forest the children were raised by the wives of their fathers and only learned the truth when they came to manhood and needed to reproduce themselves it has been a fearsome secret to keep but kept it they have no one knows they import women as household slaves but they are actually used for breeding purposes that is why durga didnt want little noss lara exclaimed he asked her if she had linked with the moon yet and she said no it was then he refused to have her making such a great fuss and truda in her effort to please him exposed my existence to the forest lords og nodded truda is growing a big belly he told lara i overhear much for few pay a great deal of attention to me he chuckled now i shall tell you something else i overheard i know the reason they insisted on purchasing you lara they believe if they can get children on a faerie they can expunge the curse maeve put on them but i am only a halfling and besides there is no way i could ameliorate a curse placed on them by a faerie queen i know nothing of magic my faerie mother deserted my father and me when i was only a few months old i am said to look just like her but i know nothing of her world og she thought enough of you to give you a crystal guardian the giant noted looking down at his young companion let me tell you something of her world as the daughter of a faerie woman you have all her powers although you have not known it you are not with child yet are you yet it is said that enda comes to your bed almost every night i know why you are not with childyou do not want his child and a faerie woman never gives children to those she does not love they do not know this do they lara said nay they dont there is much they do not know my kind served the forest lords for as long as memory allows yet they slew my people when they could not find the faeries of the forest they sent the giants to look for them when we could not find them they set about killing us for we knew their secret and they would not have it revealed i was in my mothers belly at that time her name was oona and she managed to flee into the deepest part of the forest where she bore me we lived in a cave and saw no one but the beasts it was there i met ethne she is not a faerie but a faerie spirit it was she who told me what my mother did notthat all giant memory is passed on to their unborn children in the womb that should i ever fall into the hands of the forest lords i was to pretend to be innocent of all that had passed before my birth and when i was four years of age they found us they killed her but me they spared for before she died she told them i had been born but four years prior i was brought back here and raised in durgas hall although in those days it was his grandfathers hall when i became too large to live in the hall i was given the bathhouse to attend and to live in i am small for my kind they have told me poor og lara said taking his huge hand in her own two and giving it a little squeeze what a terrible life it has been for you having to pretend ignorance and yet knowing so much i wish there were a way in which i could help you it is i who must help you the giant replied winter is coming and if you are not with child by winters end durga will wonder why perhaps he will sell me into another province they do not know i am privy to their secret certainly they will want to recoup their losses as best they can lara said durga but that he is considered the eldest of his clan would be sweeping out horse stalls og said his family has always ruled the forest it is his right but he is a stupid man if you fail him he will be angry and if he becomes angry he is just as apt to slay you as his grandfathers men did that poor faerie woman seventyfive years ago but not yet lara said no not yet og agreed i must bathe quickly now lara told him they will wonder why i have been gone so long go now and we will speak again the giant nodded and left her she washed herself quickly then hurried back to the hall truda was seated by the fire and seeing lara beckoned her over there was no way to avoid the woman and so lara joined her holding out her hands to warm them trudas belly was very obvious and her pride in her condition was irritating where have you been she demanded of lara it is not your place to question me lara told her but you surely know i go to bathe each day at this time you were gone longer than you have been in the past truda said the water was very hot and i am chilled to the bone these days i remained to soak and it felt wonderful it is almost time for the winterfest lara replied the city was not as cold as it is here do you not feel it i feel nothing but the kicking of my son in my belly truda responded proudly my lord durga is a vigorous lover and i am a fertile field for his potent seed you will see soon enough as his brother does not seem to plow as fine a furrow with you my lord durga says he will be visiting you soon for shortly i shall be unable to accommodate his lusty nature she smirked at lara it shall be as the celestial actuary ordains lara said sweetly if i am meant to give one of these forest lords a child i will but will they not favor my offspring with its faerie blood to that of a slave woman you are a slave too truda said angrily her hands going to her belly but i am special being half faerie lara taunted her wickedly and then she turned and went down the dim corridor to the sanctuary of her rooms stepping inside she was shocked to find durga there awaiting her her heart began to beat nervously my lord she greeted him he arose from the chair by the hearth where he had been sitting you smell sweet he said are you just come from your bath lara yes my lord she replied her hands by her side were balled into fists her fingernails digging into her palms he took a step toward her and lara instinctively backed away he smiled wolfishly and reached out for her before she might evade him again drawing her against his chest he said i desire you faerie girl i am a man of vast appetites and the bigbellied bitch in the hall can no longer be mounted lest i endanger my son you belong to me as well as to enda and he is gone for the next few days on a hunting trip while he is gone you will open your legs for me does my lord enda know you do this lara asked him durga smiled but it was a cold smile the fingers of one large hand dug into her scalp and he yanked her head back yes he said and do not ever dare to question my actions faerie girl i am master in this hall and you are my slave he pushed her against the door to her bedchamber his hands reached down sliding beneath her gown to cup her bottom he lifted her up commanding her put your arms about my neck and your legs about my waist lara and when she obeyed afraid to do otherwise he released his grip on her a moment lifting his tunic up to release his manroot which he then pushed into her with a smooth hard thrust now faerie girl he said his hands cupping her buttocks once more you are going to be well used and thoroughly seeded by the hour of the evening meal lara was in shock enda had always been gentle and thoughtful with her she was even learning to gain great pleasure in their passion durga however was a hard man and a cruel lover he ground into her brutally making her whimper with each thrust of his loins she thought of the faerie woman og had told her about today and realized that this is how the poor creature must have felt as she was violated her head slammed against the bedchamber door as he pushed into her again and again and then it was over with a roar he released his seed into her and lowered her to the floor laras legs buckled and she would have fallen but durga caught her up in his arms and kicking the door open brought her into her chamber and laid her on the bed ill get you some wine faerie girl and then we will begin again he told her going back out into the day room when he returned lara had managed to seat herself on the edge of the bed he handed her the wine drink it all down and then get out of your gown lara i dont want you damaging your clothing for you have little enough she swallowed the wine almost eagerly relishing the fact that it burned her throat as it meant she could still feel something he took the goblet from her when it was gone and she stood up disrobing slowly her fingers all thumbs as she undid her laces she laid her gown aside and pulled off her chemise on your back now faerie girl he ordered her and as she lay upon her bed she saw that durga had also disrobed and was now quite naked she trembled to her surprise it was unlike her to be fearful of these men but the tale og had imparted to her earlier made her realize how dangerous the forest lords really were he was a big man his hairy arms and legs like the thick tree trunks in his forest his chest was massive and broad and covered in wiry dark curls as was the area surrounding his manroot he climbed into the bed and pulled her up into his arms his fingers tugged the pins from her long giltcolored hair its like thistledown faerie girl he complimented her then his hand patted her mons it matches the pretty curls you have grown back since you came to us a finger pushed between her nether lips to find her jewel he began to play with it gently you should have begun a child with my brother by now lara perhaps his seed is not as potent as mine perhaps he weakens it going between two women at night my seed is fertile i will plant your hidden garden fully and well in the next few days you will ripen with my child faerie girl i am not some animal to be bred lara cried out finally finding her voice thats exactly what you are my pretty faerie girl you are a sweet beast to be bred he pushed two fingers into her moving them vigorously then withdrew them almost ready he noted has enda taught you to play with his manroot yet i expect not he gets little joy out of it but i enjoy it take it in your hand lara fondle it gently tickle the seed sacs beneath it they are filled with life she took him in her hand afraid to disobey him he made a sound halfway between a growl and a purr praising her skill and encouraging her onward her fingers moved beneath his manroot to tickle the seed sacs they were almost icy to her touch she fondled them in her palm restraining her urge to squeeze them so hard they would pop thats it girl he said approvingly his hands fondled her young breasts squeezing them tenderly pinching the nipples sharply so that she squealed aloud he laughed saying such pretty little apples faerie girl now on your back and he dumped her from his lap onto the mattress put your hands above your head now his dark head lowered and he kissed her breasts and her belly his bushy black beard scratching her delicate skin then without another word he was atop and into her thrusting and withdrawing as he panted with his exertions lara closed her eyes a sweet beast to be bred she would not be bred for she wanted no child of this man or his brother but neither her beauty nor her faerie blood would save her from their revenge if they chose to kill her she had to get away from the forest lords before they grew suspicious of her but how and where could she go that she would not be branded an escaped slave she shuddered and durga took it for passion rising in her and redoubled his efforts on her body until finally he cried out loudly satisfied for the interim by the old forest gods faerie girl you know how to give a man pleasure he told her approvingly then he arose from the bed ill send some supper for you but rest for tonight i will share your bed until the dawn this brief interlude has but whetted my appetite for your sweet faerie flesh he pulled on his clothing again and left her for the first time since she had left her family lara cried the human side of her was showing itself at last after months in which her faerie blood had allowed her to be as hard as nails it had aided in her survival but with ogs tale today she was only too aware of her precarious position within the realm of the forest lords until she produced the desired child she needed to speak with og but she dared not leave the hall again today and the night loomed long and dark ahead she rose from her bed and washed herself clean of his juices but his scent still clung to her body the tears kept coming until finally she fell into a fitful sleep it had been early afternoon when she dozed off but the sun had been already setting for winter was upon them lara awoke in darkness but for the scrap of flame in the bedchamber hearth she scrambled up and fed the fire until it was blazing again then dressed went into the dayroom and repaired the fire there a tray had been set on her table and as the food was hot she guessed that the footstep of the servant delivering it had awakened her everything smelled delicious and she found she was hungry she ate everything on the tray and then began to drink from the carafe of sweet wine she was going to need it to sustain her courage in the hours ahead when durga finally entered the room she was able to muster up a small smile which pleased him greatly but the night was a long one in midmorning when lara was finally able to rouse herself from her bed she dressed quickly and fled the hall for the bathhouse what is the matter lara og demanded seeing her lovely face with its tearstains what has happened to make you weep faeries rarely weep she told him the tears coming again and to her surprise he lifted her up and cradled her against his shoulder it was an incredibly comforting gesture and leaning her golden head against the giants shoulder seemed to renew her strength you can put me down now she said finally and he gently set her on the floor how typical of enda he said scornfully to go off without telling you his brother would come to your bed he is the more beautiful of the two but he has less character they are unique you know for they share not only a father but the same mother as well before durga was weaned from her teat and given to the lady ida the slave who bore durga managed to lure his father into her bed again and conceived enda i think she had discovered what was happening and tried to save herself that way of course they killed her after enda was weaned her master never visited her bed after enda was born poor girl lara sympathized but for enda to go off and not tell me what to expect was more than unkind it was cruel it was the giant agreed but typical enda is a beautiful weakling durga is a crude fellow but he is proud of his family and desperate to maintain the fiction of their heritage for centuries each of the clans in the forest have only intermarried with one other family the bloodlines have never varied they were becoming very inbred and in a way maeve actually did them a kindness but durga and his generation have only a quarter pure forest blood in them their children will have less they know it and fear if their secret is revealed they will be considered weak enough to be attacked still they maintain the old ways and keep to their traditions and customs but times change lara and nothing remains the same forever even if we might wish it so og said i had thought you would be given more time but durga has always been an impatient man you must escape the forest and very soon i think i will be considered a runaway slave lara said nay for the law gives you some small protection once you have crossed the border into another province without being caught and can live free for a year and a day you are legally free lara the only place to which you may not return in safety is the forest or the city but live free a year and you can return to the city but if i cannot return to the city now where can i go she queried him ask ethne he told her with a smile she is your guardian and your guide now you must bathe before they wonder why you are gone so long the giant said with a smile ethne will have some of the answers that you seek lara ethne once told me i should find a good friend here in the forest i believe that friend is you og you must come with me i cannot go without you i have often thought of travel og said i am told there are other races of giants on hetar but i have always been afraid to probe my memory too deeply for fear of what i would find perhaps now i should i owe the forest lords nothing we must make a plan lara said the best plans are those carefully considered he advised her i know what you must bear now can only be difficult but if we are hasty we could fail and that would be far worse og was right of course and lara knew it and now that durga was certain that he could satisfy himself on her body at will durga came only in the night to grunt and strain over lara but her life grew no easier endas bride tira was open in her hatred truda her belly growing larger by the day could scarce contain her jealousy even the softspoken sita avoided her unless there was no other choice enda returned from his hunt six days later he brought a great deal of game with him and was welcomed joyously now the halls larder was full for the long winter ahead lara was mending a piece of clothing when he swaggered into her chamber and sweeping her into his arms kissed her heartily did you miss me he demanded with a boyish grin i had no time with your brother between my legs every night she returned angrily you could have told me my lord but you knew he would come eventually he attempted to excuse himself he owns you too i thought it a good opportunity as i had to be away and his woman has a big belly now did you please him he thinks your seed too weak lara said cruelly he says you have rendered it impotent running between your wife and me which is why i remain barren while truda burgeons with his offspring she smiled but it was a cold smile he slapped her hard and laras head snapped back be careful faerie girl he warned her if you do not continue to please me you could become a pleasure woman in the hall servicing any man who desires you it would be a most generous gesture my lord considering the price you and your brother paid for me more than generous lara said ignoring the stinging in her cheek you would probably do better to sell me and recoup some of your loss never he snarled you will continue to be seeded by both my brother and me until you produce the child we desire of you or i will kill you with my own two hands i will share you with my brother but no other lara lara said nothing more on the subject nor did she bait him again but turning away from him she concentrated on her sewing once more enda slammed from the room angrily and she did not see him again until the evening meal he came into the hall arguing with his wife and tira spying her rival gave a shriek of outrage you went to her first i am your wife but you went to the pleasure woman first i will not stand for it i will not how dare she come into the hall when i am here be silent tira you do not understand enda said no i do not i want my own hall and when i have it i will allow none of your pleasure women in it my sister may put up with it from your brother but i am not sita lara gathered up her food and quickly exited the hall obviously endas wife was not aware of the situation regarding the forest lords until she understood she would accept no child of another woman behind her lara heard tira cry out in pain and the slap of flesh against flesh tira was being beaten for her rebellion poor girl lara thought but even she knew enough not to argue with a man in a public forum each night from then on both durga and enda came to laras bed the two men took turns using her until they all would finally fall asleep at first she hated them until the night she realized that they bored her in their competition to get her with child after that she lay placidly thinking of her escape moaning now and again thrusting up to meet their downward rhythm and they were content with her the winterfest was coming but there had been no snows yet a winterfest without snow was unusual but they prepared for it anyway og had reasoned that the night of winterfest would be a good time to make their escape durga and enda would be celebrating with their wives as winterfest was considered a prime occasion for conjugal bliss they had already told lara she would be left alone and should seize the opportunity for rest she thanked them and wished them good fortune with their wives that night if one of your men should come to my chambers shall i allow them in she asked innocently no both durga and enda spoke with one voice it would be unthinkable if lara was successfully seeded by one of their clansmen when she had not been seeded by one of them and all will be told you are offlimits to them you are to rest the winters in the forest are long and we will want you to ourselves durga said lara gave them a smile i am grateful for your kindness my lords at least there is no snow on the ground now to show the direction in which we go og told lara i will carry you so we may make better time you are lighter than a feather my faerie friend where will we go she asked him i am not certain yet there are faeries yet in the forest although i am not certain where but perhaps it would not be wise to seek them out we could flee to the midlands but then we are caught between there and the city where you could be reclaimed by the forest lords i think we have but two choices we must either go into the desert realm of the shadow princes or into the outlands perhaps ethne will advise us if you ask her my father used to tell me that the outlands are a dangerous place filled with war and tribal rivalries the outlanders are not civilized at all i will ask ethne but i think we must go into the desert i am sure we can find shelter and work you are strong and i can earn my bread with my sewing we will survive og lara you are far too beautiful to go unnoticed you will not have to survive as a seamstress one of the princes is certain to favor you and want you for his lover i will never be a slave again lara said fiercely the women who give pleasure to the shadow princes are all free he told her the shadow princes want no woman who does not come to their arms willingly how do you know this she asked my people have traveled hetar for centuries and learned many things i have known them all since my first moments in my mothers womb he explained we have nothing to fear from the desert peoples lara how do they live there she said the common folk live in tents and travel the surface of the desert trading with the caravans that pass through the shadow princes live in great palaces carved from the tall desert rocks they raise horses how will we cross the border without being caught she wondered the road is not the only place to cross the border he told her with a wink the hall of the head forester was decorated for winterfest with pine branches and holly outside in the clan villages great piles of wood were raised for the bonfires that would be lit at the exact moment of sunset the fires would burn high and strong until the dawn when they would be extinguished with the sunrise there would be feasting dancing and drinking the night through songs of the old days would be sung and scarce a girl of marriageable age would be left untouched for a full week before the women in the hall cooked and prepared for winterfest og revealed to lara their method of escape on the day the winterfest dawned you must not go through the hall tonight for you must not be seen at all he said you are slender enough to get through the window in your bedchamber climb onto the great tree branch outside of that window i will guide you to the branch below from where i may pluck you down i will put you into a pouch on my back where you will be safe and hidden no one will pay a great deal of attention to me if indeed they even notice me in all the celebration with my long stride we can be over the border before moonset dress warmly and eat as much as you dare without attracting attention he advised her durga came to laras chamber in early afternoon but he had not come to couple with her neither he nor enda would touch her until winterfest was over and done by ancient tradition husbands seeded only their wives during winterfest and among the forest clans tradition was always observed the head forester had come to tell lara to bar her door from her side of the chamber i will bar it from the outside as well it will not be opened until tomorrow when i come to tell you that i have unbarred my side he said go to the hall now before sunset and fetch the food and drink you will need faerie girl i likely will not come until midday tomorrow as i will eat and drink well tonightand of course seed my wife as much as i can which i think you know will be many times he leered at her wickedly then giving her a hearty kiss and smacking her bottom he went off laughing she did not see enda to her relief when she went out to fetch her food and drink for the next day lara filled her tray with as much as she dared knowing she could claim durga had told her to as she must remain in her chambers placing the food in her day room she returned to the hall seeking out sita to ask if there was any mending she might do while she remained locked away you must not work during winterfest sita said quietly tradition dictates it is a time of celebration you look tired faerie girl eat and rest for the winter will be particularly long for you until you bloom with a child she appeared almost sympathetic lara thought thank you lady for your kindness lara told her and i wish you a joyous winterfest she gave durgas wife a small smile and then returned to her own quarters darkness fell quickly that day and the moon would not rise until late from her windows through the bare branches lara watched the redgold sunset and then the fires began to spring up as if the light had been transferred soon lara could hear the singing and carousing from both durgas hall and the village below she ate what she could and wrapped bread cheese apples and pears in a napkin which she tied up carefully next she transferred the wine from her carafe into a water skin that og had given her she dressed herself in all three of her chemises and gowns tucking her pearwood brush into the pocket of her cloak which lay across the foot of the bed as an afterthought she added her sewing implements then she lay down to rest and slept for several hours until she was awakened by the sound of pebbles being thrown at her window rising she went to the window and opened it og she called softly it is time lara his voice whispered back a moment while i gather my things she said to him hurry he returned she had barred her door earlier when she heard durga outside fitting a great timber across the portal from his side she had noisily turned the lock and set the small iron bar into place hearing his grunt of approval as she did so now she quickly donned her cloak strapped the wineskin across her chest and gathered up her packet of food opening the window she called down to og to catch her pack so her hands would be free to climb then she dropped the shawl hearing his grunt as he caught it carefully lara climbed out onto the thick wide branch her only light coming from the fireplace in her bedchamber turning slowly she pulled the window shut behind her then following ogs whispered instructions she inched out upon the branch remembering not to look down the giant instructed her to sit down upon the branch and to her relief she felt the tree limb below her feet as sturdy as the one above she stood upon it and moved out upon the second branch her heart was hammering for it suddenly occurred to her she could easily be killed if she fell she stopped frozen just a few feet more lara og encouraged her gently she forced herself forward again praise the celestial actuary that there was no wind the night was very cold however above her the black skies were filled with twinkling stars she thought for a moment how very beautiful it all was and then she heard og instruct her to sit down carefully on the branch lara did and immediately she felt him pick her up she was set down in the pack on his back and she smiled to discover he had lined it with furs and there was a fur robe to keep her warm her pack had been set there too lara undid the strap of the wineskin and laid it aside her quarters were not commodious but there was enough room to be comfortable are you settled he whispered to her its lovely she told him then we are off he said remain quiet lara particularly if we are stopped but they were not stopped og moved quickly and quietly from the vicinity of durgas hall and its village into the deep forest he carried a small lantern with him to light his way carefully avoiding the villages of other forest lords and the winterfest fires that blazed in some of the more remote locations finally the full moon arose and he put out the lantern hanging it on the wide leather belt he wore around his tunic his stride was great and halfway between the darkness and the dawn he exited the deep woods finally reaching the scrubland of the border he had kept off the main track and now the ground beneath him became more sandy around him great dunes began to arise deep within the pack lara lay sleeping she was warm and felt safe for the first time in months the rhythm of the giants steps lulled her and although she had meant to stay awake she couldnt when she finally did awaken she reached instinctively for the crystal about her neck ethne she whispered softly i am here the guardian of the crystal answered her what will happen now you will simply continue your journey ethne responded it is yet the beginning when will my journey end lara asked when you have completed it ethne told her do not ask foolish questions of me child how will i know when i have completed my journey lara persisted you will know ethne replied and the flame flickered and grew dim again og lara called are we free of the forest yet it seems the air is growing warmer i have thrown off the furs we are already in the desert lara and it is almost dawn i am seeking a place for us to shelter for the day will be hot i believe there is an oasis up ahead remain safe within my pack for a bit longer he advised she took his advice because as long as she remained his passenger he was able to travel faster she had never seen a desert and did not know what to expect but it was certainly getting hotter with each step he took she had never before felt such heat but after the damp winters chill of the forest she could not complain ah there is the oasis up ahead there will be shade and water for us og said or so at least my memory recalls are there people there lara asked him i dont know he answered her he took several more steps and then they were there i am going to lift you out now lara he told her i shall set my pouch down so you may exit carefully he undid the buckles that had secured the pouch to his big body and then he gently set it upon the ground lara stepped forth blinking in the startling daylight she looked up the sky above was a clear bright blue there wasnt a cloud to be seen the sun shone down upon them hot and fierce the trees around them were tall with roughbarked trunks and leafy green fronds they were nothing like the trees she had seen before in either the forest or the city there was also a small pool with a waterfall which she thought amazing in the midst of all this barrenness looking further she espied a stone well at the oasiss center and then turning lara gazed beyond the border of strange trees an endless sea of sand stretched before her there wasnt a living soul to be seen anywhere but for her and og chapter it is both beautiful and frightening lara said softly above her a hawk soared og nodded slowly i have the knowledge of what the desert is from my collective memory he noted but like you i have never before seen it it has great majesty but i sense it can be dangerous i think because of the sun and the heat we would do well to rest here during the day and not travel until the night perhaps we should remain here until we can learn what phase the desert moon is in for it will not be full as the forest moon is now we have food and if the well is not dry we have water too he walked over to the stone edifice and lowered the bucket lara heard a splash as the bucket reached water and watched as og tasted the liquid in the returned bucket is it sweet she asked him aye we are fortunate he told her why is it no one lives here lara wondered aloud the giant shrugged the desert folk wander part of the year and the other part of the year they live at the foot of their princes castles we must find a settlement in the next few days before we run out of food i doubt there are many oases such as these we will not be as fortunate when we leave here perhaps well find a village og or we could walk across the desert into another realm lara suggested brightly beyond the desert is the outlands he told her it is the most dangerous place on hetar with no form of government or laws the people there have loyalty only to themselves or perhaps their clans or tribes you have said yourself that it is very uncivilized i dont want to go there nor should you what if we have no choice lara asked him pray the celestial actuary that we do the giant told her search your memories og if there are giants in other provinces of hetar perhaps there are giant clans in the outlands as well aye there are giants there too but i will not speak of them he replied are you hungry lara you have not eaten since last night are we far enough into this desert not to be caught she asked him we are many leagues from the hall of the head forester he reassured her even if they rode out at sunrise today they could not catch us for several days and we are well into this kingdom we have no papers she said what if we meet a caravan we are a giant and his mistress traveling through the desert og said and there is no caravan this oasis is off the main track now i shall set up my pack as a tent for you to shelter from the sun lest your fair skin be burned we will eat and rest perhaps you would like to cool yourself in the pool by the waterfall as he spoke he emptied out the knapsack in which lara had traveled the previous night several wooden poles had been used to give the pack its shape og removed them and used them to make a shelter he hung laras wineskin and spread the furs tanned side up for a bed i am going to seek what wood i can find and any dried fronds from the trees we will burn them tonight in a fire to keep any beasts away og told his young companion see the ring of stones there others have made fires here the sun was growing hotter lara coaxed og to cease his work and come into the tent he could not stand in it as she could but he was able to crawl in and sit provided he kept his head low lara fed them from her small stash of food and og surprised her with several loaves of bread he had managed to secrete for himself they drank a little of the wine to assuage their thirst in the heat of the day and then lay down to sleep when they awoke it was early evening they were hot and lara felt a headache coming on i cant swim she told og but i can cool myself in that pool come with me and enjoy the water too if i went into that pool he chuckled i fear i would cause all the water in it to flow out but i will certainly soak my feet together they walked to the little pool and lara waded in up to her neck sighing with delight for the water was indeed cold she had earlier removed the extra garments she had worn on their escape and now wore just a fine cotton chemise which would dry quickly enough in the hot desert air the bottom of the pool was soft yellow sand and she scrunched her toes in it happily in her entire life she did not think she had felt so free and she smiled at og who sat on the edge of the pool a look of bliss upon his face as he soaked his feet in the cold water lifting a hairy leg now and again to let the waterfall splash over his feet ankles and shins the hot air dried them swiftly and as night began to fall the air grew first cool and then almost cold they were glad of the furs in the tent they ate the remainder of laras bread and cheese and finished her wine og lit the fire by simply pointing a finger at the kindling and saying fire light how on earth did you do that lara wanted to know all giants have certain abilities he remarked the forest giants can light fires by just pointing and commanding how do you think i heated the water for your daily visits to the bathhouse we must take turns keeping watch lara i will take the first shift and awaken you in several hours why do you need to watch she asked him do you think durga and enda will come after us nay but there are wild animals here in the desert now get some rest lara soon it will be your turn to watch she lay down in the makeshift tent to sleep she had never known such quiet and such peace not even the forest had been so silent she was safe she knew as og sat crosslegged before the fire singing softly to himself laras eyes closed and she slept a dreamless sleep until og gently shook her shoulder to awaken her for the watch drowsily she arose i have built up the fire and there is no wind tonight og said the desert moon is high in the sky awaken me just before it sets he instructed her lara sat by the fire and soon the air was rent by the sound of the giants snores she grinned and then grew serious considering the day she had just lived through at this time the previous night she had been in her chambers in durgas hall now if og was correct in his estimation they were many many leagues away from that hall and from the forest he had told her that each step he took was a full league and he had traveled many hours once they left durgas realm when had they discovered her missing she wondered and what had they done had they discovered og missing yet or just dashed off seeking her knowing durga and enda they had mounted up and with their men gone racing off to find her it would not be until they discovered og missing too that they might realize that lara was with the giant but og had encountered no one since leaving durgas village it would not be known in which direction they fled suddenly lara heard the faintest of rustles in the growth by the pool she stared hard into the darkness is someone there she asked softly but there was no answer and she was surrounded by deep silence again in the sky above her the copper moon was in its first quarter and a shadow of cloud moved swiftly across it she shivered briefly hugging herself with her arms then laughing softly at herself for being foolish she turned back to the warm fire a rat most likely she decided come to drink from the water of the pool in the darkness the man stared quietly at the beautiful maiden she reminded him of a faerie but she could be only part faerie because there was also something very human about her he had seen her but briefly from the air this morning and wondered who was camping at the oasis of zeroun it was well off the beaten track and her giant companion would have to travel almost an entire night to reach a settlement drawing his cloak about him the man became invisible and quickly slipped into the tent where the giant lay snoring bending down he murmured into the large fleshy ear go north tomorrow evening by dawn you will reach safety remember north the great constellation belmair will guide you then he departed the tent and was gone og stirred restlessly but did not awaken lara nodded by the fire half asleep now the shadow gently placed more wood upon the blaze so it would not go out and then disappeared into the darkness lara started awake she had no idea what had roused her but everything seemed to be fine the fire was burning high and she could hear ogs snores coming from their tent she smiled thinking how wonderful it was to be free of enda and durga what foolishness to believe having children of her body could end a curse placed upon them by a faerie queen she had no magic although og said she merely lacked the knowledge of how to use it but if she were interested in this alleged magic who would teach her how she was glad for the fire and surprised that the night had grown very cool after the heat of the day she would not have thought it she watched the quarter moon make its journey across the skies she had now seen three of hetars four moons the pale blue moon of the city and the midlands the light green moon of the forest and finally the coppercolored desert moon she had heard that the coastal moon was a warm butteryellow of course in the outlands one could see all four moons at oncebut each shone a silvery white on that side of hetar the moon before her was now ready to set rising lara went into the tent and wakened og he rose sleepily giving her a warm smile you will sleep again he said we will remain here today and then tonight we will go north i think we will find some sort of settlement to the north crouching he shook out the furs for her how can you travel so far with each step you take lara asked him laying down again your legs are long but certainly not long enough to go a full league with each step that you take og its my magical boots he said i asked durgas grandfather who found me in the forest if i might make myself some boots i was only eight at the time and had been barefoot all of my life i told him my feet grew cold in the winter months and if i lost my feet i should be of no use to him he liked having the only surviving forest giant for his own slave and so he said he would have boots made for me for what would a boy know of making boots i was grown when he finally died and without anyone elses knowledge i then made my own boots according to the knowledge i inherited from my people no one noticed that the boots i wore were different i walk normally except when i tell the boots they must walk a league then my stride lengthens and i can cover great distances he explained why didnt you run away before lara wondered there was no reason to he told her but the forest folk were not kind to you og lara protested nay they were not but they were all i had faerie girl for better or for worse they were the only family i possessed he told her but now you need me you are young lara and you have no idea of the powers within you until you learn how to access those powers and use them wisely i must be there to protect you in my minds eye i remember the faeries of the forest your mother was surely one of them the forest giants were the faeries allies it is my duty to keep you safe for this part of your journey eventually you will not need me but now you do she smiled up at him i want you with me forever og she told him and then closing her eyes she fell asleep she did not see the love he had for her in his pale eyes lara slept until the afternoon og had slept beneath the shade of the palm trees near the pool he woke to see lara entering the water she splashed about calling to him to put his big feet into the water again and cool them he did smiling down at her they ate a loaf of the bread he had taken and an apple each they filled the empty wineskin with cold water from the well og took down the makeshift tent reconstructing the knapsack once again he replaced the furs but this time with the tanned sides up lara had repacked her few possessions in her shawl she would use her cloak tonight if she felt cold ogs remaining loaves and laras apples went into the knapsack along with the skin of water ready og asked her and when she nodded he picked her up and set her back into the knapsack before strapping it on his shoulders once more which way did you say we would go lara called to him north he answered i just have the feeling that we will reach a village of some sort if we travel north tonight by the morrow she wondered aloud mayhap but if not the next day if we have not found a settlement by the time the sun is high he told her i will set up the tent and we will just sleep the day away we have enough water for several days if we are careful og walked across the desert all the long night he used the great star belmair which was always in the northern skies as his guide within the safety of her transport lara did not sleep for she was more than well rested she lay on her back looking up at the black skies with its twinkling stars and then as the stars faded the coppercolored moon as the night began to wane og saw great cliffs rising up from the desert floor ahead of him and at the bottom of the cliffs a settlement of black tents he was vastly relieved lara he called to her we have found some sort of civilization but i would have you remain hidden until i am certain these people are friendly it is not quite dawn yet and i see no one stirring i will sit down and wait he sat down atop a sand dune very well she answered but please dont be long i want to get out of this sack and stretch my legs there seem to be some shepherds stirring he told her i will ask them who is their leader og said the shepherds gazed openmouthed at the giant but they were not afraid it was rare that strangers came into the desert for there was nothing in the desert of any worth no valuable ores or gemstones no fertile fields it was a barren place where to the amazement of the traders and the midland merchants beautiful horses were raised how they did not know nor did they care as long as they might purchase and resell the beasts at a great profit i am og the giant said i am peaceful can you take me to your headman i would ask his permission to pitch my tent among yours i am umar a young man said coming forward my father is headman here i will take you to him og followed umar who introduced him to his father zaki og made his simple request of the headman who asked how will you earn your bread og we are simple folk and have naught to spare for the idle i carry my mistress in the sack on my back og said she is a fine seamstress and i can bear heavy loads for you we ask no charity then pitch your tent on the edge of the settlement zaki told og we can use your strong back do you have a prince og inquired of course zaki said he is called kaliq and his palace is in the cliffs above our settlement he will not mind you joining us he is a good man you are a forest giant i had heard all your kind were dead they are i alone represent my race og said what happened zaki asked curiously og shrugged it was before i was born my mother survived into my childhood but she never spoke on it it made her too sad well and i should think so zaki replied go on then and welcome he said og found a sheltered spot on the edge of the tent village and lifting lara from her place he tipped the pouch out and set up the tent once more the settlement was beginning to stir now og examined the furs and then took one of the fine robes ill trade this for some things we will need he said and hurried off when he returned he had an iron cooking pot several implements for setting the pot up over the fire a large spoon a knife five cushions a piece of cloth and a basket of food and spices for cooking he was very pleased with himself while he had been gone lara had made beds for them with the remaining furs and set their belongings next to each mattress she took the cloth he brought and strung it across the little tent to give the illusion of privacy settled they sat down to dine on bread new cheese and water from the oasis i will now go out and seek work for us og said he returned with mending that the village women didnt wish to do but that needed to be done in just a few days laras reputation as a fine sewer spread she did not venture much from the tent for fear that her beauty would be discovered when she did go out she covered her gilt hair and her face as well the villagers considered the seamstress modest and respectful and fully approved but they were curious as to whether she was young or old and where she had come from since she spoke to no one but her giant servant they could not ask it was very intriguing then one day one of prince kaliqs servants came to laras dwelling bringing with him a pale gray silk robe and a basket of fine threads my master wants to know if you could embroider this garment for him the servant said i can lara replied but it will take time for it is fine work is it for a special occasion is there anything he particularly wants in the design it is for the horse breeding festival in six weeks the servant replied come back in a moonspan lara told the servant og was delighted your reputation for fine work is spreading what will you design on the robe zaki says this festival is a very important one i wish i knew what this prince looks like lara said he will be blueeyed and darkhaired like all the desert people og responded lara laughed i suppose it really doesnt matter she said he will pay well if my work pleases him and we will be comfortable for months we might even purchase a real tent from the tent maker his wife told me he has one that would allow you to stand up instead of always crouching og chuckled yet this old pack of mine has served us well lara it has indeed she agreed lara thought for several days about the embroidery she would do on the princes robe to embroider horses on the garment in so short a time was an impossibility she decided so she embroidered a design on the back of the robe showing the black desert cliffs beneath the copper moon and on the front of the garment she embroidered delicate silver and blue stars in twin bands that ran from neck to hem around the wide cuffs of the robe she stitched a geometric design of black and copper it was elegant and most effective lara was pleased with herself when the servant returned after several weeks for the robe he brought with him an invitation from prince kaliq you are invited to join the festivities lady a litter will come for you tomorrow he said i am a poor woman lara murmured i have no garment that would be suitable and i would not have the prince think i do not honor him but please thank your master for me the servant bowed and departed with the embroidered robe the following morning he reappeared with a packet which he gave to lara my master sends you this he bowed to her the litter will come for you in the midafternoon hour she unwrapped the packet inside was a simple sleeveless roundnecked garment made from an iridescent silk lara held it up stunned you will have to go now og told her they say these shadow princes are magic why are they called shadow princes lara asked him they are rarely seen and are said to have the power of invisibility they slip in and out of the mind easily i am told i need a bath lara said and my hair is filthy ill speak with zaki og said hurrying out why did prince kaliq want to see her lara wondered it could not have been because he liked her embroidery for he had not seen it when the invitation was issued nor had he seen her or had he she recalled the noise that night at the oasis as she sat watch could he have been watching her from the shadows ridiculous she had heard no horses nor were there any footprints in the sand of the oasis other than hers and ogs besides that oasis was leagues away from the settlement he was probably curious because of laras caution in shielding her beauty from the people of the settlement og returned zaki says there is a pool of flowing water within a small cave at the foot of the cliff you are welcome to bathe there and his wife sends you this og handed her a small cake of soap i will stand guard lara that you not be disturbed you had best hurry if your hair is to be dry in time he led her to the cave zaki had showed him the cave was empty but it was filled with a lovely blue light lara slipped into the water expecting it to be cold and gasped with surprise to discover it was quite warm delighted she washed first her long hair and then herself climbing out of the pool she sat naked upon a flat rock and dried her hair and body with a clean piece of cloth she slipped back into her clean chemise and wrapped her hair in the damp drying cloth then she covered her face and hurried from the cave it was wonderful she told og as they moved quickly back to their own tent the water was hot not cold and the light inside is clear and blue you will just have time to dress og told her remember that if you refuse his advances he will allow you to return here and you will not be punished the shadow princes do not force women into their beds it is said they prefer mutual passion their women are all free to come and go as they please the giant reminded her what makes you think he desires me lara said perhaps the invitation is merely a polite one because i embroidered his robe he can know nothing of me or my beauty he is simply curious to see the seamstress og chortled he sent you a gown its just the right size and its lovely its obvious that i am a slender woman even wrapped in my cloak lara said no he knows what you look like i am sure the giant said lara slipped behind the curtain that divided her sleeping space from the rest of their little tent she pulled off the chemise and slipped the iridescent gown on over her head it fit as if it had been made for her her young body glowed through the fabric she could not wear a chemise beneath this garment for the chemise was not cut in the same fashionshe was meant to wear nothing beneath the gown to her surprise a pair of simple sandals had been left next to the gown while she was bathing reaching for her pearwood brush she brushed the tangles from her long hair and then plaited it into a single thick braid the princes litter is here og called to her lara stepped from her private space i suppose i am ready she said you are beautiful he exclaimed this prince will fall in love with you without a doubt he is a fortunate man there was a wistful tone to his voice but she didnt hear it or see the sadness in his mild blue eyes love is an illusion there is nothing more to it than lust or mutual convenience lara said quietly if he desires me and i him we will couple but that is all you have a faeries cold heart og said but one day you will fall in love lara and that heart will grow hot as your human blood warms it you will see i shall try to bring you an especial treat from the princes castle i know how you love sweets dearest og then lara walked outside to the litter chair awaiting her it was not like the grand litter gaius prospero had sent for her it was a simple conveyance of fragrant cypress wood hung with diaphanous pale gold curtains two desert men were its bearers immediately the litter was lifted up and the two bearers seemed to virtually fly over the ground until they reached the foot of the great cliffs an entrance magically appeared opening to allow them through lara was fascinated were the shadow princes faerie folk she hoped she would soon learn the answer inside the cliffs a road led upwards lighted by crystal lamps filled with bright dancing creatures what were they she was going to ask she had to ask and then another door was appearing and opening before them the bearers never broke stride it was as if they knew the way would be made smooth they entered into a tall wide corridor with walls of white marble streaked with gold and lit by similar crystal lamps but that these hung from a high vaulted ceiling the floor beneath their bare feet was great squares of blackandwhite marble at intervals along their route were striped marble columns atop which were great onyx vases filled with a colorful array of bright flowers some of which were unfamiliar to her now on her left an open colonnade appeared and the bearers set the litter down a tanned hand drew the curtains aside and helped her out she hadnt seen him there when the litter had come to a halt but he was certainly there now he was tall and ageless but obviously no boy his eyes were a startling bright blue his shortcropped wavy hair as black as night he was the handsomest man she had ever seen with sharp aquiline features and high cheekbones warm lips touched the back of her small hand you are half faerie he said how charming welcome to shunnar lara thank you my lord are you prince kaliq she asked feeling suddenly shy i am he told her and tucked her hand in his silkcovered arm you are wearing the robe i embroidered lara cried delighted you have great talent with a needle he told her who taught you your mother nay my faerie mother deserted us when i was an infant my grandmother taught me she raised me until i was ten but then the celestial actuary called her home lara said come let me show you shunnar he said he led her over to a balcony between the columns there are the horses we raise below beautiful are they not lara was astounded by the sight within the great desert cliffs was a greater valley and an incredible greensward filled with herds of beautiful horses she looked up at him how is this possible is it magic he laughed must it be magic could it not simply be an aberration of nature is it he shrugged perhaps it has been here as long as we have and how long is that lara asked him since the beginning at least according to the chronological records of our kind prince kaliq told her the forest lords claim to be the oldest clans on hetar she answered him he laughed scornfully how would they know they never venture beyond the boundaries of their trees their pride in their heritage is both overweening and foolish the desert clans have been here as long if not longer he looked down at lara is that where you come from the forest the giant who guards you is a forest creature we had heard they no longer existed they do not but for og lara said your mother was surely a forest faerie prince kaliq said you have the coloring so typical of that race with your golden gilt hair and green eyes are there faeries in the desert lara asked him we call them peries and yes they exist here they are rarely seen however as they prefer their own company to that of other races but we have no giants they always seemed to prefer the forest and the mountains what happened to the forest giants do you know aye the forest folk wiped them out og was in his mothers womb she escaped the slaughter and fled into deep forest where she had her child alone and survived with him for several years then she was caught and killed og was just four they let him live and taught him to serve them as his predecessors had done why did this happen prince kaliq queried lara the giants knew a great secret affecting the forest clans but the forest lords did not want that secret known they slaughtered the giants to protect themselves they allowed og to live because they thought he would not know their secret but he did the giants pass along their entire history and memories to the next generation in the womb og knew it all but he kept his own counsel in order to survive only when he thought me in danger did he consider escaping his cruel masters what is this terrible secret of the forest lords he asked her that will be for og to tell you if he chooses to do so lara answered you do not seem inbred enough to be even part forester the prince remarked where are you from i come from the city and that is all you need know lara said she had so far avoided telling him much of her own history but kaliq was not a man to be denied when his curiosity was aroused tell me he commanded her now it was lara who laughed why is it important to you she countered looking up into his handsome face has your curiosity not already been assuaged by seeing what none in the village have seen that i am young and half faerie and some would call me beautiful he took her face between his two big hands i had seen you before today he told her his lips were dangerously near hers at the oasis as i kept watch in the night she said i thought the rustling in the bushes was a rat come to drink at the pool and yet i felt something more was it you he nodded and gently brushed her lips with his but there were no footprints in the sand and i heard no horse lara told him how did you reach the oasis and for that matter how did you get back here without our seeing you did you hear the scream of a hawk above you that day he asked her he spoke against her mouth his blue eyes engaging her green ones her head still between his hands as he refused to allow her to look away aye she was almost breathless with his touch his jeweled eyes that was i he told her you are a shapeshifter she drew away a little afraid now his hands released her heartshaped face when it pleases me he admitted and that day it pleased me greatly to watch you as you swam in the crystal waters of the oasis of zeroun you have a beautiful body that matches your face are the bruises on your inner thighs gone yet who dared to mark you so cruelly lara turned away from him looking down into the beautiful fertile valley below her hands spread out flat upon the balustrade my father was a mercenary she began a great swordsman who was meant to rise in the world not remain among the lower orders but we were poor and the rules of the crusader knights are quite firm and foolish prince kaliq said quietly what does a mans appearance matter if his talents are legend so your beauty was bartered in exchange for the gold to make your fathers application a reality what happened then i was willing lara told him there was no coin for my dowry and therefore no hope of a marriage for me i was to be sold by the master of the merchants guild into a pleasure house but the headmistress of the pleasure guild would not permit it she said there was already infighting going on as to who would purchase me that patrons had begun arguing over my firstnight rights she said i would cause naught but trouble and she forbade my sale so i was consigned to a taubyl trader rolf fairplay he meant me for a coastal king there were other women with the traders caravan meant for the forest lords one however did not suit them and the head forester was angry then a meanspirited woman in the special consignment told the head forester that there was another slave carried by the trader they demanded to see me and nothing would do but that they purchased me you are not an ordinary slave the prince said you must have cost them a fortune i am surprised they paid it it was my heritage that fascinated them lara murmured and part of my story is wrapped up in ogs tale you know all you need know of me now i am an escaped slave but i am told i cannot be retaken in the desert i am told if i can live free for a year then i am legally free and can return to the city without fear do you want to return he asked her i dont know somehow i think my journey is just beginning my lord lara told him and she turned to face him once again is your curiosity satisfied now prince kaliq may i return to the village of course you may return but i had hoped you would remain to see the breeding of the mares my fellow princes and i have several stallions each is let loose one at a time to choose the mares he will have the stallion drives them off from the main herd and mates with those mares who particularly please him the mares are owned in common by all the mares that are mated are then taken to the stables of their stallion we wait to see if the individual stallions seed has taken if not the mares are released back into the common herd that is how we keep the bloodlines pure lara looked back at the valley below and it was then she saw open balconies similar to the one where she now stood all the palaces are clustered about this valley she asked him yes he replied is there to be a feast she said aye then i will stay i am tired of bread and cheese goats meat and water lara said and may i bring some of your feast back to og she charmed him part of her was so sure and another part of her was so girlish and a third part of her was so mysterious he wanted to know and to examine each bit of her but the prince also knew he would have to have great patience of course there will be more feast than appetites as always your giant may have whatever is left over for himself and i am glad to give it to him what does he like to eat best everything lara laughed the forest folk did not treat him well and fed him badly he will welcome new foods particularly the sweets he too is tired of bread cheese goat meat and water we havent had any wine since we drank the last at the oasis what did you call it the oasis of zeroun once a very learned man made his home there zeroun the wise the prince explained i liked it there lara said i liked the peace and the pool with its waterfall i liked the sun and the trees that did not hide everything but just sheltered us from the sun i think i could live there and be content he smiled at her the desert can be cruel he told her as cruel as men she asked softly he was surprised by her astuteness sometimes he answered his knuckles grazed her cheekbone what a pleasure it is to look at you lara you are so fair you know that i would make love to you kaliq said but i will not unless you wish it as well love is a girlish dream lara told him you wish to copulate with me and satisfy your desires on my body do not hide behind the nebulous word love my lord prince i do not need to be cajoled you are attractive and eventually if it is indeed my choice i may enjoy your passion but not today the shadow prince looked horrified by her blunt words he stepped away from her saying i will have you escorted back to the village lara and then he disappeared into a haze that had suddenly formed around him lara shrugged she had obviously offended him and she was sorry she had enjoyed his company but like all the men she had known since leaving her fathers house the prince was only interested in pleasuring himself with her at least he had not forced her as her forest masters had if he summoned her again she would yield herself to him as a gesture of apology lady your litter awaits a servant at her elbow said lara turned and followed the man to her transport the return trip seemed far quicker than her coming had been she was in front of her small tent again feeling the heat of the sand beneath her sandals she entered the dwelling og turned surprised to see her what has happened he asked i said no and he sent me back lara replied og shook his head was he offended they are not used to being refused these shadow princes it is rumored they are the finest lovers on hetar i wonder who began such a rumor lara said dryly they are the greatest lovers and the forest lords are the oldest and purest clan i am fast learning to believe only that which can be proven she laughed lightly you said they leave the option to their partner og i chose not to lie upon my back and spread my legs for this prince now i would get out of this gown and into something more practical i have a pile of mending to do and we will not be paid unless i sew the giant shook his head lara was behaving in a foolish manner gaining favor with this prince could certainly improve their living conditions her needle and his strong back could not earn them enough to purchase a real tent the villagers were not rich he and lara were just managing to feed themselves with their labor and a system of barter but then he considered that the prince had seen what no one else in the desert had seenhe had seen lara in all her beauty one small rebuff would surely not discourage prince kaliq laras resistance was but a minor setback later as the evening came on a group of the princes servants arrived bearing dishes and platters of the finest foods there was roasted gazelle grape leaves stuffed with meat and rice small flat breads still warm a bowl of thinly sliced cucumbers in yogurt a stone jar of honey a platter of fresh fruits of every kindeven some ogs memory could not identifyalong with a basket of honey cakes and a bowl of sugared almonds and there was wine the feast was set without a word on the floor of the tent and the servants quickly departed come quickly og called to lara she came from her place behind the curtain where she had been sewing in the fading light of the day her mouth opened in surprise as she gazed upon the feast before her where has this come from she asked him it has surely come from the prince og told her there is even wine i had agreed to remain for the feast if i might take home the leftovers for you lara murmured then he became offended at something i said and sent me home what did you say to him og demanded to know his mouth was watering at the smells of the food sit down he gestured at her impatiently we can talk while we eat i did not realize how hungry i was until this all arrived he cut several slices of the roasted gazelle putting it on one of their two wooden plates for her then taking up the haunch of the gazelle he began to eat with gusto lara helped herself to two of the stuffed grape leaves some bread yogurt and fruit then she began to eat surprised at how hungry she was they had been starving especially og and she hadnt even realized it lara chewed slowly lest she get sick with this rich meal prince kaliq had sent them they ate and og listened as lara recounted every moment of her visit to prince kaliq finally when she had finished he said to her of course you offended him the shadow princes believe deeply in love and its many powers by rejecting love and all it stands for you insulted him how can i know of this elusive thing you call love lara demanded of him my innocence was cruelly taken and then my body used over and over again by two brutal men who only sought to plant their seed in me in hopes a child of mine might lift a curse placed upon them a welldeserved curse i might add the forest lords are proud and stupid and cruel do you think they believe in this love i certainly do not love exists og insisted if you know that it is only from your shared memories not from personal experience lara replied cruelly the forest lords and their women were hardly kind to you og but i remember my mother and how she loved me loved me enough to escape the carnage that terrible day that i might be born loved me enough to protect me as long as she might he responded a parents love i understand lara agreed for my father loved me but do not tell me there is a different kind of love between a man and a woman there is only lust og this love the prince believes in does not exist it never has it is an illusion she reached for a honey cake and bit into it with relish some day you will learn differently og told her quietly he put down the gazelle haunch that he had stripped of its meat to the bone and picked a small bunch of grapes from the platter for himself i am grateful for prince kaliqs kindness in sending us this fine meal we must share the honey cakes with zaki and his family some of the fruit too nothing will keep in this heat lara said practically og nodded it cannot hurt us to curry favor with the village headman he agreed but let us eat our fill first please he pleaded lara nodded my sweet tooth is not yet satisfied she told him taking a peach when they had finished however they gathered up the remaining flat bread the bowl with the cucumbers and yogurt the dish with the grape leaves and the one with the honey cakes along with some of the fruit they carried it to zakis tent his family had just sat down to their meal zaki was effusive in his thanks even as his younger children eyed the bounty it is most kind most kind he told them the prince sent the food lara said we could not eat it all and are happy to share it with you who have been so kind to us zaki she bowed to him and then turning departed his dwelling why is she always veiled and muffled in shapeless robes zaki asked og because she is so beautiful that the mere sight of her causes conflict and strife he told the headman she does not wish to be surrounded by contention and so she covers herself to protect those around her og explained will she become the princes woman zaki asked i do not know og replied she does not understand love if she will let him he will teach her zaki responded perhaps og said and then bowing he departed the headmans tent to return to his own he called out to lara behind her curtain as he entered zaki is delighted with the food i believe we may have a place here as long as we desire it but shall we remain forever lara i dont know she replied for now i am content with no demands made upon me but to sew we will get a better tent soon the tent makers daughter is to be married soon and will need a proper gown for the occasion the gown is simple enough but no one can embroider like i can these desert people know nothing of that art you are clever and meant for more than you now have og said good night dearest lara may your dreams be happy ones good night my dear og protector and best friend lara said she curled onto the furs drawing a light coverlet over her it had been an interesting day she wondered if prince kaliq would call her to his presence again he was such a beautiful man with his blue eyes and wavy black hair when he had looked at her she had actually felt a small measure of curiosity might he possess some magic that would put the warmth back into her soul despite ogs blessing her dreams that night were not happy she dreamed of enda and durga ravaging her body and awakened with a gasp trembling so violently that it was some time before she was able to regain her composure were they looking for her would they find her lara reached down for the crystal and saw the flame burning steadily i cant go back she said within her mind do not fear ethnes voice reassured her then why do i dream at the moment men are your greatest fear lara but the forest lords will not venture far from their trees you are safe here why do men always want to possess my body ethne because it is a beautiful body and most men believe in love to love a woman is to possess her body among other things ethne told her what other things that is for you to learn ethnes laughter tinkled knowingly i hate it when you say things like that to me lara grumbled it is all so mysterious and how am i to learn if you will not teach me you must learn from others of your kind both human and faerie ethne told her it is my task only to guide and protect you a shadow prince would be my lover lara told her guardian ahhh ethnes voice grew soft as if she were remembering something wonderful he will give you such pleasure lara the shadow princes are truly the masters of tender passion and love there are none like them anywhere but here how i envy you i said no ethne sighed almost irritably your experience with passion to date has not been pleasant i am the first to admit she said but you must put it behind you i dream of enda and durga of their cruelty and brutality lara said foolish girl why did you not tell me ethne demanded i can rid you of those dreams you must think only of this prince who would love you he will teach you the lessons you must learn in order to move on with your life do you think fate has planned for you to sit sewing in a desert encampment for the rest of your life no lara said chastened you have a great future lara what is it lara asked her excitedly you are not ready yet to know but you will when the time is right ethne replied more of your cryptic enigmas lara muttered ethne chuckled you are forever wanting to run before you have learned how to walk she said enjoy the journey ethne advised the girl learn as much as you can before you reach your destination my child do not waste the opportunities that are being put before you if my fate is already planned i suppose i have no other choice but to go along with it lara murmured there are always choices the stratagem is to choose wisely i would not have chosen durga and enda lara replied again ethne laughed yet you have learned from them my child what have i learned from those two brutality stupidity cruelty you have learned what love is not the guardian of the crystal said softly now go and learn what it can be chapter prince kaliq rode into the village the next afternoon and he directed his horse to the tiny tent shared by lara and og lara sat outside beneath an awning sewing the giant was nowhere to be seen the girl looked up at him he held out his hand come he said imperiously reaching down for her lara stood and let herself be swept up onto the princes horse how masterful you are she teased him mischievously i do not know why i want you he said you look like an old crow in your enveloping black garments and you are ignorant beyond any i have ever known he moved his horse away from the tent and toward the entrance to his palace at the bottom of the cliff you want me because you have seen me without my enveloping garments she told him and you want me because you desire to teach me your ways lara said i am a mystery to you my lord am i not you are not stupid he admitted nay not stupid just ignorant she mocked him and he laughed i will probably fall in love with you he grumbled and you will break my heart lara wont you he guided his mount past the cliffs entry and onto the inner road i told you yesterday my lord that i do not believe in love it does not exist but i am also now informed that for the shadow princes love is paramount if you know that i will break your heart then it is best you not fall in love with me lara advised him love is not a logical emotion it will not obey the science of reason kaliq told her that is the first thing you must learn lara love happens there is no rationale for it you cannot control it or the passions it arouses she was seated before him on his stallion one arm held her gently but firmly against him he wore white silk trousers and an opennecked white silk shirt about his waist a black sash was wrapped and his boots were black leather she found her cheek resting against his bare chest his skin was smooth warm fragrant i dont understand lara told him you speak in riddles it is because you dont understand that i have come for you today he said someone as beautiful as you are lara should not be ignorant of the pleasures of love what happened to you in the forest that you encased your heart in ice i am told daughters born of faerie women have the same cold hearts as their mothers lara said only if they choose to he responded what can you know of faeries my lord you are not one are you nay i am a shadow prince but i had an ancestress who was a peri faerie blood runs in my veins thought not to the extent that it does in yours lara now tell me of the forest and why you enclosed your heart in an icy cold we shall not cease riding until i have learned all surely we are almost there lara said we will not be there until i have learned what i need to know of you the prince said in a stern voice tell me lara looked up into the handsome face and began to speak the trader swore i was meant for a coastal king in order to protect me from the forest lords but they offered him far more than he had hoped to obtain for me he was afraid it was a ruse and so i advised him to accept their offer but refuse to make the trade until we were at the borders separating the desert and the forest they were not pleased but they agreed and so it was done i later learned it was my faerie heritage that fascinated them they wanted to get a child on me to ease or even erase a curse placed on them by maeve the queen of the forest faeries they thought a faerie child born of my loins and their seed would soften her heart against them of course it was madness on their part why did they want a child with faerie blood the forest lords do not mix their blood with that of outsiders kaliq said yesterday i said it was ogs tale to tell but i realize now it is mine too lara told him and so she did beginning with the murder of maeves faerie kinswoman and ending with the slaughter of all the forest giants but for og the giants knew the foresters shameful secret lara continued maeves curse had made it impossible for them to breed children upon their own women stealthily they mated with outsiders giving those children to their wives who claimed them as their own and with each new generation born the blood of the forest lords grew thinner and thinner the foresters allowed og to live because they believed he didnt know their secret she said but he did for giant memory is passed on in the womb he was trained to serve as his people had served the forest giants were known for their gentle natures and kind hearts kaliq said softly they would not have known how to fight back against the foresters if not for og i should not have escaped and would soon be dead lara replied he knew what i did not that no woman with faerie blood will give a child to a man she does not love or at least desires and when he told me i was terrified both the head forester and his younger brother were pumping their seed into me several times daily they were beginning to become suspicious as to why my belly was not growing with a child of theirs they didnt care which one of them fathered the child on me but they wanted that child whom they believed would be their salvation were you a virgin when you came to them he asked her lara nodded that was the other reason i was so expensive and when their bodies joined with yours what did you feel he asked her my body had begun to respond to the younger brother enda but i hated them both lara told him when the head forester would lie with me i would slip away into the deep recesses of my mind it was easier then to bear him prince kaliqs eyes filled with tears at her recitation that you should have suffered so my beautiful lara he said his voice choking please i beg of you let me show you what true passion between two friends can be like i will not lie to you i do desire your body but only because it is such a beautiful body and should be loved as only i can love it he bent and brushed his lips against her mouth you seek me for your pleasure lara said low i seek to give you pleasure he corrected her those cloddish forest creatures know naught of pleasuring a woman of any ilk they know only how to grunt and sweat over a womans body they think nothing of the woman she is a vessel to them in which they hope to grow their seed his blue eyes were stormy with his angry words you are meant to love and be loved and what am i to you my lord prince lara asked quietly a comely woman to be admired caressed and utterly adored he told her i would worship at the shrine of your beauty lara the prince said fervently you want no child of mine then she asked him no he told her quietly i want only you and the pleasure we can give each other lara nothing else i swear they were suddenly at the entrance to the hallway of the palace the stallion stopped and a servant lifted lara down from the saddle as the prince leapt down behind her taking her hand in his he led her into the beautiful corridor she had previously been in the day before will you trust me to teach you the joys of passion he asked her yes she said simply his words had intrigued her was there more to two bodies uniting than just grunting and straining i am curious as to whether what you hint at is real or merely a belief you refuse to give up he laughed you will soon see lara you will soon see but first we shall watch my favorite stallion choose his mares and mate with them did that not happen yesterday she asked him i would not allow it without you he told her i am not suitably garbed to be seen publicly on your balustrade my lord she told him there is time to prepare you he told her come you must be bathed you have i fear the scent of the village goats on your skin and in your hair hair like yours should not even hint of goat he led her quickly from the main corridor down a narrow hallway at the end of which was a great wooden door outside the door a guard stood seeing the prince and lara he turned sharply and flung open the portal so that at no time did they slow their pace a serving woman hurried forward to greet them bowing obsequiously to the prince without even being told she took laras allenveloping garments from her beneath lara was wearing a sleeveless round necked gown of a natural colored linen she had recently made for herself she slipped from her sandals the serving woman next undid the ribbons at laras shoulders and her gown fell to the floor she stepped from it not in the least embarrassed by her nudity you are even lovelier than i had anticipated kaliq told her shedding his own clothing while every bit as tall as the foresters she had known he was far more slender lara saw his skin where the sun touched it was like bronzecolored satin but where the sun could not reach it was like golden cream she thought him beautiful and smiling told him so then we are well matched he replied but i knew it the moment i saw you at the oasis come now and let me wash you he led her into the bath where there were several smooth depressions in the marble floor against a wall water fell from curved spouts in that wall placing her in one of the hollows the prince took up a sponge laden with soft soap and began to wash lara i can wash myself she protested softly but is this not much nicer he said the sponge moved over her chest neck and shoulders then it was swept over her breasts with great care and down her torso kneeling he washed her thighs legs and feet then turning her about sponged her buttocks stood up and did all of her back he set her firmly beneath the curved spout and rinsed the foamy soap from her skin finally drawing her from beneath the water he announced i will now wash your lovely hair and to her surprise he did when he had finished he wrung out the long tresses and pinned them wet atop her head giving her a hard kiss as he did so his hand went to her pubic mound fingering the golden curls i have been denuded there before but in the forest there were no such niceties how would you have me my lord prince lara asked him your curls are charming but i prefer a womans body to be smooth and free of hair but for her head he told her i will go and wash myself the alabaster jar has what you will need and the bath attendant will help you when you are finished we will dress there is no time for massage now but later i will caress your body with scented cream the bath attendant came and there was nothing for lara to do but stand patiently as the woman smoothed the thick paste over her legs mons and beneath her arms within minutes she was being rinsed free of her superfluous hair she stepped from the basin and kaliq was there wrapping her in a towel come we must dry your hair he said and seated her upon a marble bench with another towel he rubbed all the water from her hair and then began to brush it with expert strokes i love your hair he said it is like the finest thistledown only forest faeries have such hair what was your mothers name ilona lara answered she could get used to being bathed and brushed by this handsome man and to her surprise at no time had he made suggestive remarks or touched her in a sensual manner nor had the sight of her even aroused his manhood a slender length of flesh she had discreetly noted then you are i believe maeves granddaughter for maeve had a daughter named ilona she was a rebellious girl for a time but now i understand she remains by her mothers side for maeve is very old and reaching the point where she will fade away into the next world prince kaliq said ilona will be the next queen of the faeries my beauty did you know my mother lara asked him only by reputation he answered her how old are you she queried suddenly curious he laughed i am older than you of course but i am yet young enough to be your lover and teach you of passion delight and desire kaliq responded he began to plait several strands of her long gilt hair but left most of it hanging free when he had finished he stood up come it is time for us to dress so we may view the matings between my stallion and the mares silent servants brought them comfortable white silk kaftans with the necklines embroidered in gold threads golden sandals were provided for their feet when they were garbed he took her hand leading her from the baths down the narrow hallway again and back into the wide open corridor overlooking the green valley where the large herd of mares grazed peacefully in the sunlight there were horses of every colorblack white gray chestnut bay dun sorrel and roan prince kaliq lifted a hand and almost immediately a great white stallion was released into the valley snorting proudly his coalblack mane and tail flying he dashed among the mares who scattered panicstricken the first mare he separated from the herd was a dainty black she stood trembling as the stallion covered her with his large body nuzzling at her neck and breathing heavily when he had finished with her servants raced out to capture the mare and lead her away the stallion seemed tireless he cut one gray two white and three chestnut mares from the herd mounting each as he had the black mare filling them with his foaming seed but he was not yet satisfied he circled the herd again and again looking seeking and then lara saw the delicately built golden mare the stallion saw her too he stopped rearing up on his hind legs as he made quick eye contact with the mare he began to move toward her ignoring the other mares in his desire to reach her the golden mare saw him coming and turning fled the white stallion but he quickly caught up with her pushing her with his velvety muzzle into a corner of the greensward screaming with triumph as he mounted her they could see the stallions great penis as he slowly pushed it into the mare lara was not even certain if she was breathing at that point then the princes arm slipped about her waist his breath soft on her skin she could feel the slim length of his body pressing against her slender frame he nuzzled at her pale hair and to her surprise lara felt a stab of pure desire in her vitals it is exciting to watch isnt it his breath was hot in her ear yes she murmured surprised that she could talk at all she was trembling i could never have imagined anything like it her legs felt weak and instinctively she leaned back against him concentrating on the golden mare now being led away as bored the stallion began to graze in the green grass he kissed the soft nape of her neck he could sense her confusion yet he could also feel her resistance beginning to ease he pressed his advantage for this first time their mating must be swift lest she grow wary again there would be time for the slow drawnout pleasure of passion that he well knew how to give but this first time he must show her that the coming together of a man and a woman was sweet and tender not hard and cruel i shall be the white stallion to your golden mare lara he told her did you not find the mating between those two symbolic his hand undid the neckline of her kaftan baring her two breasts and he began to fondle them gently a womans body is to be treated with tenderness and worshipped he told her low the forest lords thought of a womans body only as a vessel she replied i saw the bruises on you lara tell me they did not beat you he said nay they treated me as well as they knew how to treat a woman for they sought a faerie child of me but their manner was rough as i have said his hands on her were unlike anything she had ever known she sighed realizing that she was actually enjoying his touch watching as her nipples hardened when he teased them he smiled as he sensed her reaction to his hands she had the loveliest breasts they were like small summer fruits round and perfect but not yet quite ripe he caressed them one in each hand now his lips brushed the graceful curve of her neck nuzzling her long hair aside moving down to the soft curve of her shoulder her head fell back against him and her green eyes were closed she sighed again this time more deeply you are not sickened then he asked her she shook her head in the negative i like it lara told him is it always like this my lord prince i will try to make it so especially as you have had such a bad experience with the foresters he told her then his hands fell away from her breasts and he turned her about to face him his lips began to kiss herfirst her mouth which he explored tenderly with his tongue then her face and her eyelids their bodies were touching her breasts against his smooth chest her belly and legs pressed to his warm flesh his arms wrapped about her holding her as close as he could she could feel his manroot stirring and swelling as his desire increased but instead of being repelled more than anything lara wanted her body joined to this mans and she knew he waited for her to tell him so yes she whispered against his mouth he drew her down to the floor and to her surprise there was a soft silken mattress beneath them he turned her onto her stomach i want to mount you like my stallion did he groaned raise your buttocks up for me lara my love and when she did he covered her as his stallion had covered the little golden mare his manroot finding her silken passage and sliding into it remember the beast he murmured in her ear remember his size and feel me growing within you i am the white stallion and you are the sweet golden mare he desires he thrust hard lara cried out but it was not with fear his words excited her she actually could feel him swelling within her and imagined the stallions length and power as he had taken the mare she was the mare and the stallion was driving himself within her body with a fierce rhythm she could feel her own heart beating wildly as she realized that she wanted this man truly wanted him she could hardly breathe with her own excitement she wanted him to go on forever oh my lord she finally managed to cry out his teeth sunk into her neck his haunches contracted and expanded with his efforts he allowed the magic in his veins to guide his manroot as he pleasured the girl beneath him and gained from her the most incredible pleasure he had ever known he groaned knowing it must end soon but not wanting it to until lara cried out again and he recognized the sound as a woman about to reach the apex of her pleasure her head was swirling there were bursts of color behind her closed eyelids within her she felt what she had never experienced before a tightening a quickening a wild burst of tremors that shook her to her very core she sobbed his name once kaliq she felt his juices flooding her and then lara fainted with the emotions he had aroused within her when she finally opened her eyes several minutes later she was lying on her back she raised herself on one elbow he lay next to her his eyes closed they were in the middle of the wide corridor on the mattress that had so mysteriously been there for them what will your servants think lara said softly his blue eyes opened my servants are wise enough to keep their thoughts to themselves he told her you are an incredible creature lara you felt pleasure didnt you it was not like that for you before even when your body responded to the forest lord today you responded body and soul yes she told him it was an amazing experience can it be that way all the time should it be lara wondered reaching up he pulled her down and kissed her mouth a long slow kiss it will always be that way when you and i make love my faerie girl do not call me that lara cried the foresters called me that then i shall never call you that again he promised the mattress she quickly changed the subject he laughed i have some magic although i do not practice my skills as much as i should when i knew we would make love i quickly conjured us a soft place to lie in a most public place she murmured what if someone had come upon us comes upon us she looked anxiously for her kaftan he laughed softly they will not he told her my servants know me well and knew what watching my stallion with the mares in the company of a beautiful girl would lead to this afternoon no one will disturb us i should get back to the village lara said stay with me he said to her i am not ready to give you that much of myself quite yet lara told him honestly i am only beginning to get used to the idea that i am a free woman og says that the foresters can not reclaim me here or ever again if i can manage to keep out of their sight for a full year is that true yes he replied remain with me for a year and i will protect you from them lara you will never give them what they want but i think they would not believe you even if you told them so they are brutish men with little intellect swear you will not fall in love with me she said to him why he demanded smiling at her his hand caressing her face i have told you i do not believe in love but you do and you are a kind man i would not hurt you my lord kaliq lara said quietly the decision is mine to make he told her and who knows i may teach you to love but whether i can or not say you will remain at least a year with me that you may be truly free lara i can teach you many things other than love you would share your magic with me she asked him you should have magic at your disposal lara for you are half faerie he said i think ethne would approve lara replied she held up the thin gold chain and dangled the star crystal before his eyes do you see the flame within it that is ethne my guardian my mother put this chain about my neck my father once told me ask ethne then if maeve is your grandmother the prince advised her if it is so you should meet her before she fades away entirely she has other grandchildren i am sure lara said almost bitterly but no child of ilonas he told her if that ilona is indeed your mother she never bore another child for human or faerie man i will ask ethne lara responded then she arose from the mattress and picked up her kaftan from the floor of the wide corridor if i do not return og will worry she said where are my clothes you are not to wear those ugly garments again he told her i do not want the villagers seeing me as i truly am nor do i wish to be the cause of undue notice lara told him you know that gossip travels on the wind and the north wind will enter the forest now that winter is there if i am seen word might reach enda and durga despite their misgivings they will come into the desert seeking me and if they find me hetarian law or no they will take me back with them i must remain covered and veiled at all times then remain with me and be safe he said what of og i cannot leave him for without him i would have never escaped the forest lara replied he is my friend i will not desert him he may come into the palace and be with you the prince suggested he is not the largest giant i have ever seen i suppose it comes from his mothers time in hiding and a lack of food in his early years he is six cubits tall lara defended og and he has his own magic his boots can go a league with each step he takes nonetheless he is a small giant kaliq said and standing he drew on his own kaftan my palace ceilings will be high enough to sustain him i will send a servant to the village to fetch him what of my sewing lara said the villagers have come to depend upon me yes you have made yourself quite useful to them the prince noted the women will have to do their own mending again i fear there are other things you must learn lara you are intelligent and have a certain wisdom you need to know more about hetar and its peoples if you are to eventually continue on your journey what do you know of my journey lara asked him curious about his words i know nothing of it but that you will remain with me no longer than a year he told her once you can be assured of your safety you will go i see it when i look at you he caressed her cheek again do not look sad lara i am but a stop on your journey we will not waste our time together however there is much i can teach you you asked me how old i was before and i said i was older than you i am much older i have been here since the beginning of time as have all my kind you see no society of women and children among us for there are none there never have been our kind came from the purple shadows and one day we will return into those shadows we share our pleasure with the women to whom we are attracted and who find us congenial we raise and sell our horses keeping to ourselves as much as we can hetar is changing more each day soon the time will come when the people have to choose between the light and the darkness it will not be an easy choice to make but make it they must what has this all to do with me lara queried him i do not know but it does he told her then he clapped his hands together and at once a servant appeared send servants into the village to escort the giant og to the palace see they pack up all his and the lady laras possessions at once my lord the servant said bowing and he hurried off how do you know she demanded he laughed i just do now come i will show you where you will live he brought her to a suite of beautiful rooms that all opened out into a cool green garden my apartment is across the garden he told her we will always be near one another lara how many servants would you like i am capable of taking care of myself she told him you are my chosen he replied you must be served og will serve me lara said no i want og to work with my horses forest giants are extraordinarily good with animals you must have a serving girl and i think i have someone who would do well i bought her off the last taubyl trader who came through several months back she is young and was very frightened but she has learned well my head serving man tells me she will be as much a companion to you as a servant her name is noss noss lara cried that is the girl the foresters would not have yes she will suit me admirably my lord kaliq then i will send her to you he said for now explore your quarters they were conceived with you in mind he turned and was quickly gone in a swirl of his white robes alone lara reached down and raised the crystal to her gaze am i safe with him the flame flickered that is a question to which you already know the answer ethne said ask what it is that you really desire to know from me is maeve queen of the forest faeries my grandmother yes and her daughter ilona the faerie woman who bore me yes why did you not tell me before lara demanded you did not ask and it was not time for you to know until you did ethne replied why ethne gave a watery chuckle because it is she responded do not be smug lara said irritated it ill becomes you i do not know if i like all this mystery and magic that seems to surround me these days why did my life have to become so damned complicated i liked living in the city i liked being nothing more than my fathers daughter now i am not certain what or who i am be patient lara ethnes gentle voice soothed you have a destiny and it must be played out but for now you are safe with the shadow prince he is one of the wisest of them and will impart much knowledge to you learn from him lara she turned and then held out her arms to noss noss how glad i am that you are now safe rolf fairplay kept his promise to me she hugged the young girl i am to be your servant and companion the prince has told me noss said how did you get here lara i cried so hard when i saw you being taken away by the forest lords my eyes got all swollen with the salt of my tears i escaped the forest at winterfest lara said and then she explained all to noss og will be here shortly you will like him i could have never done it without him he is the kindest and gentlest fellow i have ever known now tell me how you have fared since we were last together there is little to tell noss replied we crossed the desert for several days and when we reached this palace the trader brought forth all manner of goods the headman here told rolf fairplay that he need a young serving woman rolf explained he had but one slave very young and inexperienced the headman said he wished to see me and when he had he asked me if i could be content as a servant to his prince he said i would be taught what i needed to knowthat the prince did not beat his servants and i should not be a slave but free rolf protested that i was a slave but the headman smiled and said while he would buy a slave he would free the slave once it became the princes property it was their custom shunnar is a pleasant place lara i have been treated well but until today i have done little when i have spoken to the headman he has simply said that my time had not arrived now i know why it is as if they were waiting for you to come here noss finished perhaps they were lara agreed are you the princes lover noss asked ingenuously yes it would seem i am now lara admitted aloud he is so handsome noss sighed then she grew serious what of the others what happened to them were the forest lords cruel the other five are all with child by their masters lara said truda by the head forester himself his name is durga he and his younger brother enda were my masters they sought to get me with child but faerie women even half faerie women as myself will not give children to men they do not love i did not know that but when og told me i knew i must flee or be slain for my failures how horrible noss exclaimed if i can remain free for a year and a day the forest lords will have no claim on me prince kaliq wishes me to stay with him he says he will keep me safe noss sighed he is so romantic she said sometimes i wish i were old enough and beautiful enough to attract the attention of a man like that you are a very pretty girl noss lara told her but i think if you believe in love you must let it come to you one day it will if i believe in love noss cried everyone believes in love lara i dont was the answer but we must not get into a discussion over it come and help me explore these beautiful rooms that the prince has said are mine they seem even finer than my fathers new house in the garden district together mistress and servant walked throughout the magnificent apartment there was the antechamber where they had greeted one another and a small dining room that opened out on the garden and was off a dayroom there was a little bedchamber and a large bedchamber there was even a private tiled bath with its own small bathing pool the marble floors were covered with beautiful woolen rugs in jeweled tones of ruby sapphire amethyst and emerald sheer pale gold draperies blew in the soft desert air from the windows the furniture was of ebony accented with gold some of a design lara had never seen it was some type of seating and was plush with cushions and pillows the bed in her bedroom was set upon a dais and hanging from a large brass ring in the ceiling were the same pale gold gossamer silks as at the windows the room itself had walls of pale wood painted with flowers and desert animals i have never seen anything so beautiful noss breathed slowly neither have i lara agreed there is a door on my room the younger girl told lara excitedly will you permit me to close it of course lara said remember that you are a free servant and i have a real bed not a pallet i have never had a real bed noss told lara then she walked over to a tall wardrobe and opened its doors inside were all manner of gowns and sandals look noss said to lara excitedly have you ever seen such lovely things it is as if he were expecting you lara he was lara answered her but how had he known unless he knew what her destiny was to be who else lives in this palace noss lara asked the girl only the prince and his servants i have seen others like him though they come in the evening and sometimes dine with him noss said no other women she was curious how could she not be curious sometimes they come and they go but usually when the others are here in the time i have been here there has been no woman living in this palace unless she was a servant as i am how many servants lara probed there is the headman some who cook some who clean some who do the laundry most are older women they have all been kind to me more so than my own family noss revealed then the prince is a solitary man lara noted but for his brother princes yes noss said laaara gracious what is that noise noss cried tis og my giant companion lara replied come quickly before he shouts the palace down she hurried through the apartment and out into the public corridor where she found og standing this is a fine palace and the prince has asked me to help with his mares og said he bent down looking at noss and who is this wee creature this is noss lara answered him the one durga would not have eh og remarked the very same please do not frighten her og she is not used to you as i am lara said the prince has set her to wait upon me aye you need another female to be with og agreed now is it all right with you if i help tend to the princes horses when i was not in the bathhouse at durgas village i kept his horses for him i am good with animals you are not my slave og you are my friend you are free to do what you choose and if the horses please you then yes look after them noss had finally found her voice again i never saw anyone as big as you before she said i am told i am small for a giant but six cubits high there are others far larger than i little girl og responded with a grin well ill tell the prince we are agreed lara when you decide to leave this place if you do i will come with you we are companions eh he chuckled and then turning was gone how did you ever meet him noss wanted to know i have heard little good about giants lara he was held prisoner in durgas village lara said ogs history was too complicated a story for the simple noss we decided to escape together and i could not have done it without him he is a kind and gentle fellow noss and a good friend to me in my time of trial one day i will tell you why the forest lords wanted me and it is not a happy story you have no idea the trap you escaped little one one day i shall tell all of hetar the story of the forest lords and their duplicity but for now i need to bathe and to rest she reentered her apartments the little bath was wonderful pinning up her long hair she washed herself standing in a marble hollow rinsed and then went to soak in the warm scented water she invited noss to share her bath but the girl was still too shy and lara thought how fortunate noss had been to avoid the brief life of a concubine in the forest coming from the pool she wrapped herself in a large drying cloth and went into her bedroom where she found the prince sprawled upon her bed awaiting her you look delicious he told her his blue eyes dancing i have only just washed your wicked lust from my body my lord she said as tempting as i find you lara i but came to ask you to join me at supper noss knows where and she knows the time he arose from the bed and drew her slowly into his strong arms looking down into her face og found you yes did she sound breathless you are content with his arrangements his lips were practically touching hers he will be treated well and housed comfortably and fed enough his appetite is very large for he is a big man lara said her voice now a whisper you have my word on it lara his mouth closed over hers and as she kissed him back she realized that were he not holding her in his arms she could not stand for her legs felt very weak you taste delicious too my love he said softly raising his head to look into her green eyes ethne says you were right lara murmured maeve is my grandmother and her daughter ilona my mother i will arrange for you to meet your grandmother for as i have said she is very very old and will soon fade away entirely the prince said then he kissed her lips lightly one more time and released his hold on her i will see you at the twilight lara fortunately the bed was behind her and as her legs gave way she felt the mattress beneath her buttocks kaliq had the most amazing effect upon her pulling herself all the way onto the bed she fell asleep it had been a day like no other she had ever experienced and there was more to come the prince found noss in the dayroom you will take good care of her he said it was neither a question nor a request yes my lord noss answered him she is my friend more than you realize noss do you know what your fate would have been had you remained in the forest noss shook her head her innocent eyes were wide with her curiosity he had been going to tell her the truth but instead he said they would have worked you until you dropped you would have been cold and hungry most of the time you would have remained a slave and not been made a free girl he patted her cheek you are much better off in my household noss than in the forest oh yes my lord noss said blushing bring lara to the dining hall at the twilight see she is garbed beautifully and her hair dressed to show it to its best advantage my brothers will be dining with us tonight we are celebrating my stallions success today in the mating then the prince swept from the chamber as noss stared admiringly after him lara slept for several hours wrapped in her drying cloth when she awoke to the sound of young noss singing happily she realized it must be near sunset she called out and noss immediately came into the bedchamber smiling and bearing a goblet that she handed to lara she drank and it was delicious what is it it is called frine noss said it is a mixture of wine and fruit juice or juices the headman explained it to me when i first tasted it it tastes different to everyone who drinks it i thought you might be thirsty and there is a jug of it on the table in the dayroom noss said we have not much time you are expected in the dining hall for the banquet at the twilight some of the princes brothers will be there im sure they will bring their women the prince says you will be celebrating the success of his stallion today with the mares lara felt her cheeks grow warm with her hidden thoughts the stallion had indeed had his success i must choose a gown then she said i chose one for you noss said shyly you dont have to wear it of course but i thought it would look beautiful on you let me see lara said noss hurried off to return a moment later with the gown it was the pale pink of a rose and the gossamer fabric which was shot through with silver threads looked as if it had been woven by spiders it was sleeveless and the neckline fell in a graceful drape just beneath her collarbone dropping her drying cloth she let noss slip the gown on over her head it fell in simple elegant folds noss led her over to the wardrobe and tapping one of the doors with a finger said illuminate lara gasped as her reflection appeared in the door what magic is this she asked noss noss shrugged i dont know she admitted but all the wardrobes do it if you tap their doors and say illuminate do you like the gown yes lara admitted are they all like this her body was quite visible through the silky fabric noss nodded some even have cutouts but i thought you would prefer something more modest tonight lara laughed she would have hardly used the word modest in relation to this gown she thought i must do your hair now noss said she sat lara down upon a bench and taking down her hair she began to brush it out then she braided several strands with delicate jeweled chains and looped them up around laras face she brushed the remaining long swath of gilt hair very lightly with oil of night lilies and dusted with gold then she looked with a critical eye at her handiwork she held up a round mirror in a polished silverandgold frame to lara what do you think she asked anxiously do you like it its wonderful lara told her how did you ever learn to do this noss shrugged my mother had beautiful hair i used to play with it and learned that way i guess she grew sad a moment i hope she and my father were able to buy their farm i hope they are happy now so do i lara said softly i am certain they are as happy as my father and susanna are now and look at us two mercenaries daughters what adventures we have had so far eh she laughed but your father is now a crusader knight noss said you did that for him lara you know what happened that is the hard part for me not knowing if it was worth it for my parents i will ask the prince if he can find out for you noss lara said i know you will rest easier if you learn your parents fate then you may follow your own fate without fear my fate is with you noss said then she opened the wardrobe and drew out a box made from motherofpearl that opened to reveal jewelry of all kinds noss selected a pair of thin silver hoops from which hung tiny pink gemstones that sparkled as they moved she affixed them in laras ears there you are ready i will take you to the banqueting hall now it is the twilight and they will all be gathering now you look beautiful lara thanks to you lara responded generously no you are what you are you would be beautiful in a sack and you know it but you are too modest to say so aye lara said but it seems sometimes beauty such as mine is more a curse than a blessing for now it is a blessing noss told her come we must go chapter noss led lara from her apartments down a hallway and out into the grand corridor as they walked along it lara could see the sky above splashed with fading color the blue of night hurrying forth and the three large bright stars known as the triad blazing directly over the valley the corridor finally opened into a great banqueting hall and it was there noss brought her mistress the prince awaits you she said and departed the hall was filled with dining couches upon which lounged handsome men and beautiful women on a dais at the opposite end of the room prince kaliq awaited her she moved gracefully through the maze of seating smiling back at the men and women who nodded in greeting she was more than aware of the admiration of all she almost sighed with relief upon reaching the prince who holding out his hand brought her up onto the dais and introduced her to the others my brothers this is lara daughter of john swiftsword he said hail lara the banqueting hall erupted with the greeting thank you my lords she replied come he said drawing her down onto the dining couch with him a servant handed her a goblet she tasted it just wine you are more beautiful each time i see you he declared softly kissing her ear i can barely restrain my desire for you a single finger ran down her bare arm have you bewitched me lara asked him you arouse in me feelings i do not understand tell me he murmured against the ear he had just kissed you touch me a simple touch and i want to make love with you again lara heard herself saying to him he smiled you do not know it yet lara but you have a great capacity in you for passion i have only just begun to tap the well of your desire you must face your passion and learn how to control it this i will teach you and i will tell you things that no others will tell you what things my lord lara asked him that men are weak and women stronger understand this and no one but you will control your destiny my love he said to her why would you tell me such things she said to prepare you for that destiny lara you will be with me but a short time then you will move on it is written in the stars that shine above hetar what is my destiny she was curious how could she not be he shook his head that is something that has not been revealed to me nor would it i am but a stop on your road nor will you understand until the day comes that you meet your destiny headon it is difficult for me to accept such a thing but to do otherwise would be to betray my own people and bring destruction upon them you speak in riddles lara told him but you are very wise and so i must accept your words my lord kaliq and i must believe i have come to you so that i may learn about love in its many incarnationshow to use it to my advantage how to avoid the pitfalls it can present would you say that is correct he nodded smiling tenderly at her aye and i am glad that you understand my love unfortunately i will fall in love with you which is a luxury i have never allowed myself lara i cannot help it it is unwise of course but now and again one of my brothers does we survive of course but we are never again the same then why do you do it she inquired curious we do not do it deliberately true love just happens sometimes fortune smiles and both people fall in love with each other that is a sweet miracle but mostly it is just a feeling of desire and delightful lust he explained lust and desire can melt quickly away however true love does not she nodded then what i am feeling for you is lust and desire aye but sometimes it is more and you believe you are in love but it is not so he told her it is but a momentary passion that quickly fades this is all very confusing lara said he laughed it is isnt it but trust me to lead you through the maze of emotions that will overcome you while you are mine stop lara answered him with every word you utter i become more befuddled i think i shall just enjoy the moments as i live them a wise decision he answered with a smile the servants now began serving the meal they came to each dining couch beginning with the princes offering platters trays and bowls of food to laras surprise there was fresh fish from the sea and shellfish the prince explained that it was transported by magic each morning to his palace there were roasted meats and poultry bread several cheeses and a bowl of mixed lettuces a large platter of fruits was brought around and another platter of honey cakes their cups were never empty of the potent sweet rich wine the entertainment began with the fruit and cakes to laras surprise og appeared to wrestle with several beefy young men but he won each match to the delight of the onlookers acrobats came to tumble and clown with one another in one corner sat musicians playing upon pipes drums reed instruments bells and cymbals finally came a troupe of lithe dancers in their silks moving rhythmically about the hall to the music lara noticed that as the night wore on the guests were less and less interested in the entertainment several of the women now lay naked or halfnaked while their princes kissed and caressed them then the dancers were gone and only the musicians remained their tunes becoming more and more sensual and urgent she watched wideeyed as one of the princes mounted his woman and began to pleasure her the woman wore a look of utter bliss upon her face then two more princes began to make love to their partners one sitting his companion upon his lap so they faced one another the other entering his lover as she knelt before him her buttocks raised kaliq watched the play of emotions across laras face the banquets always seem to end like this he said in a low voice sometimes my brothers share their women look there he pointed across the room to a dining bench where one woman was receiving her lover between her legs while a second prince pushed his manroot between her lips there are many ways of pleasuring kaliq said to lara he reached up and slid her gown from her shoulders baring her breasts her nipples immediately grew tight as they were revealed their eyes met briefly and lara watched fascinated as he fondled her breasts his dark head bent and he licked at her nipples she felt a shiver of delight ripple down her spine then to her surprise another prince joined them sitting behind her he put an arm around her waist pushed her hair aside with his other hand and began kissing the back of her neck two lovers at the same time in the forest durga and enda had taken turns with her but they had never loved her together at the same time this is my brother lothair kaliq said he has been admiring you all evening lara my love i realize you had not considered such a thing but i would like to share you with him for a short while i long to sheath myself in your lovely body prince lothair murmured in laras ear his two hands were suddenly clasping her breasts as kaliq knelt and pushing laras thighs apart lowered his dark head to lick at the soft insides of her thighs the hands on her breasts were gentle stroking and caressing her until she was weak with enjoyment she felt kaliq opening her up spreading her nether lips his tongue beginning to lick at the sensitive flesh hidden within she whimpered and moved restlessly beneath his touch as lothairs big hands moved over her body tenderly setting it afire is she ready yet brother lothair said not yet kaliq replied remember this is all new to her she needs time to be truly free of her inhibitions his tongue sought the sensitive little nub of flesh that was the core of her womanhood he played with it slowly touching licking coaxing her to release her fears and lara did it was simply too delicious she had never considered two men pleasuring her at the same time but after her initial astonishment she had come to realize she was enjoying their attentions enda and durga had wanted only to satisfy themselves and get a child on her these two princes wanted nothing more than to give her enjoyment she sighed gustily and then moaned as his tongue pushed itself into her sheath oh oh she cried and then the wicked tongue moved itself back to that sensitive bit of flesh teasing it until her juices began to flow oh please lara begged them please she had never before felt such whitehot desire as was now coursing through her veins kaliq raised his dark head from between her milky thighs she is ready he said prince lothair lay lara back upon the dining couch he mounted her his dark eyes burning with undisguised lust he pushed slowly filling her with his manroot kaliq had seated himself behind lara and now held her in a tender embrace as his brother worked the girl to a fever pitch that left lara gasping for breath and so pleasured that she screamed with her complete satisfaction lothair smiled down at her giving her a passionate kiss that left laras head whirling dizzily as he withdrew from her he kissed her hands still smiling and then left them i want more lara begged and kaliq complied covering her body with his entering her moving upon her while she clung to him her nails raking down his long back harder and harder he thrust her legs wrapped about his torso deeper and deeper he pressed his manroot into her burning flesh until she was sobbing with a desire that threatened to overwhelm her and then as suddenly as the storm began it crested and subsided leaving lara weak her beautiful face tearstained her body at last satisfied turning her head she saw that the other princes and their women were now as fully engaged as they had but recently been lothair lay near them on his back a darkhaired girl with strong thighs riding him vigorously her eyes closed with her bliss now kaliq said softly you are beginning to learn and understand passion and there is much more my love much much more but can i survive it she teased him you are half faerie lara and none have a greater capacity for passion than those with faerie blood he told her i am exhausted she said to him then sleep my love he told her here everyone will he told her and come the morning we will all go to the baths and refresh each other he held the cup of wine to her lips drink and you will rest what is in the cup she demanded of him sleep he said with a smile and she drank finding he had spoken the truth when she awoke the golden light of day was filling the skies outside of the banqueting hall and the others about her were beginning to stir kaliq was already awake and rising he led them all to the baths as he had said everyone was naked and lara thought how beautiful the bodies around her were they washed each other in the floor basins each prince with his partner then they entered the bathing pool lounging and chattering about the fine feast of the previous evening and kaliqs hospitality i hope lothair said to lara that your enjoyment was as complete as mine i can see you are young and have little experience but your faerie blood rose to the occasion thank you for sharing yourself with me lara she smiled at him and kissed his cheek not knowing what else to say as each couple departed the bathing pool and left the bath they found servants with their garments awaiting them i must see my guests off kaliq told her go back to your apartments and i will join you for the morning meal ah here is noss to escort you was it a wonderful feast noss asked as they walked along together i have never attended one like it lara admitted what is it like noss wanted to know what is what like not being a virgin noss said how old are you lara demanded twelve almost thirteen there is time enough for you to know such things but now is not that time noss lara told her i will tell you when the time is right i promise true to his word kaliq joined lara for the first meal of the day when they had finished eating noss cleared the remnants away and left them together with a smile kaliq disrobed again inviting lara to do the same they lay together naked on her bed caressing each other and kissing neither of them it seemed could get enough of the other he drank from her lips like a bee gathering honey her fingers brushed over his lean hard body exploring it in a leisurely fashion i have never before she said softly enjoyed learning a mans body he smiled at her i am flattered then to be the recipient of your curiosity you tease me she cried do not you know not what i suffered at the hands of the foresters to be used as a vessel by them to feel desire but at the same time revulsion for them both was horrific ah lara he reassured her if i tease you it is because i care for you put away all thoughts of the foresters and let me love you know that you are safe in my care i will let nothing happen to you my beautiful one he kissed her gently come now and let us take pleasure in one another for we are both ready he lifted her up and sheathed himself in her lovely body groaning as he felt the walls of her passage enclosing him with heated desire ahh she sighed taking him into herself as deeply as he could go shall the mare ride the stallion she taunted if it pleases her he said smiling into her green eyes nay she surprised him by answering this time i would be mastered by you my lord kaliq make me forget make me feel safe in your arms rolling them over so she now lay beneath him he began to thrust himself within her excited body slowly slowly at first making her whimper making her want more then his tempo began to increase and his manroot flashed swiftly back and forth back and forth until lara was sobbing with her pleasure crying out with the satisfaction he could give her she clung to him her body weak and replete with the gratification he had so sweetly given her lara opened her eyes i wanted you to have pleasure too she said i did he assured her the look on your face alone almost brought me to a crisis before my time but my will is strong we finished together i swear it he promised smiling down into her face but now my love the day is well begun and there is much to do come and we will bathe again in your own little bath he arose from the bed drawing her up with him and together they did as he suggested then he left her saying today you begin your education for that is the other part of my task with you master bashkar will come shortly to begin your lessons what have i to learn that you cannot teach me she asked him you must learn about hetar and its history not gossip and old wives tales but the truth what do you know of the outlands for instance that it is a wild place of uncivilized men she answered him and how did it get that way when the rest of hetar is so urbane and right i dont know lara admitted master bashkar will teach you can you read and write at all lara nodded some and i know enough about numbers not to be cheated by the butcher or the baker its a start then he said but there is much more for you lara i can teach you passion and about those who inhabit hetar but master bashkar will teach you everything else trust me you must know as much as you can before you leave me you said you would see that i met my grandmother lara reminded him i always keep my promises he told her master bashkar came he was an old man with a long white beard and long white hair he wore a broad brimmed hat of dark felt with a point and walked with a tall staff that had a face carved into it this is llyr he said to lara to laras surprise the eyes in the face opened and llyr observed her closely she is very beautiful but astoundingly ignorant llyr pronounced your staff talks lara exclaimed you state the obvious llyr replied why would i not speak i have eyes to observe and a mouth not to mention a lean half body i need no more than that i beg your pardon lara said i have never seen anyone like you she has manners and that will count for something llyr murmured to master bashkar now let us see how much she knows precious little i can tell already please sit down lara invited the old man do not mind llyr my child master bashkar said he does have a tendency to speak his mind he comes from an ash tree and they are very frank unlike the oaks and the maples as for the aspen and birch they hardly speak above a whisper oaks are dour and maples chatter too much llyr observed and the palms like those at the village oasis lara asked palms are incredibly flighty creatures llyr said disapprovingly enough talk about your relations master bashkar said sternly i am certainly not related to a palm llyr snapped and then his eyes closed lara could not help but giggle the old man smiled and said now child i must find out what you know for the rest of the day he sat with her asking questions nodding and tching noss brought them food at one point gasping in surprise when llyr demanded cheese and a mug of ale his carved arms reached out from the staff to take the mug noss brought as the shadows began to lengthen over the valley master bashkar finally arose we have much work ahead of us my child and i do not know yet how much time we will have together but never fear we will manage i will be back tomorrow morning at the ninth hour he bowed to her and departed he seems a kind old man noss noted after master bashkar had gone and wise you must sit with me and listen so you may learn too noss can you read or write at all lara asked her what use would i have for reading or writing noss replied each skill you acquire makes you more valuable to your mistress lara told her will you teach me noss said i will well start tomorrow before master bashkar comes lara promised the prince came to join her and they ate their supper in the garden afterwards he made love to her laying her upon her bed naked and spending almost an hour just stroking and kissing her body he rubbed her with sweet oils until her skin tingled then he gave her the flask of oil and told her to rub him her blood grew hotter with each stroke of her palms upon his bronzed flesh but she suddenly realized that she appreciated the subtlety of the fragrant caresses their joining would be thunderous and it was she shuddered with pure desire as he slowly slipped his manroot into her body sighing as kaliq pushed deep his mouth found hers one kiss following another until it seemed as if their kisses had neither beginning nor end she trembled and he withdrew slightly to her protest nay my love he told her you must learn to control your hunger for only then can you control your lover i dont want to control you she gasped i just want pleasure his laughter was soft he kissed her lips again in a tender embrace one day there will be a man you need to control must control else he destroy you so now you practice on me and on the other lovers you will have in your travels lara you must grow stronger with the pleasure not weaker just this once she pleaded no he said now make me desire you more than you desire me my love tighten the muscles of your sheath to embrace my manroot and hold it captive so it cannot release its juices until you are ready for them ahhh thats it she followed his instructions and squeezed him hard he groaned aloud praising her lara was very surprised for she had never considered that a woman could dominate a man in such a fashion fascinated she played with him for some time until he was begging her for the pleasure that fulfillment gave their bodies now she ground out into his ear her nails digging into his shoulders now my lord and she wrapped her legs about him closed her eyes and let the pleasure overtake their bodies you are incredible and a wonderful student he told her afterwards and when he had recovered himself he arose from her bed sleep now my love i will see you on the morrow wait lara cried raising herself on an elbow what of maeve i have sent the message now we must wait and see if she will come he said what if she does not my lord kaliq lara asked then she does not he answered but she will you are her only grandchild your mother must have loved your father very much to refuse to spawn other offspring then why did she leave us lara demanded you must ask her kaliq said and then he left her in the weeks that followed lara never left the palace the village in the desert below was almost forgotten she studied each day with master bashkar noss by her side learning at her own pace each morning before the old man came she instructed noss in her letters and then her writing and finally she taught her how to read noss was surprisingly quick for lara however learning the history of hetar was fascinating she learned that there was a high council of eight that met in the city most of the year two members came from the forest two from the coastal region two from the desert and two from the midlands of which the city was considered a part the council had a single overlord the ruler of each of the provinces would take a turn as council head rotating every three moon cycles and only voting to break a tied vote it was the high councils duty to govern hetar to see that its laws were upheld to make new laws and to keep the outlanders at bay and contained within their borders the council worked with the guild heads to see that their civilization continued to run smoothly she had lived in the city most of her life yet she had never known of the high council why she asked master bashkar are there places of learning in the city or throughout the provinces my child he asked her for the wealthy aye but not for the ordinary people lara said what little i learned i learned from my grandmother who learned it from i know not where it is not necessary to educate a people if you keep them content master bashkar said quietly give them a roof over their heads enough sustenance to keep them from starving free public entertainments perhaps a small reason for living and you do not have to educate them it was not always so on hetar once all children were educated to their full potential in order that they might advance themselves if they chose and be of use to our society but that led to dissension as people began to think for themselves and question their leaders those in power do not like being questioned as those wise ones who instructed the young grew old and unable to teach others took their places but they did not teach as well nor did they teach our history or our great books and poetry mathematics became complex and convoluted the ordinary folk could not understand it but no one taught them the simplicities of mathematical skills or logic but they were kept fed housed and entertained and were encouraged to use their skills at whatever could bring them in a few coins education was no longer encouraged and so finally it was no longer offered to the people what is poetry lara asked him a story in rhyme he told her i am sure you have heard street poetry lara but it is unlikely you have ever heard the great sagas and songs of old that were once taught and recited about the halls at night no she said i have never heard anything like that nor i noss chimed into the conversation there is a great saga that was once told of how the shadow princes of the desert came into being eons ago master bashkar said prince kaliq once told me he had a peri ancestor but he also said his kind had come from the shadows at the beginning of time lara said how can that be before time as we now know it began master bashkar said hetar was a world of clouds and fog the shadow princes came first from those mists they were male spirits and for several generations they mated with the faerie races they found here then the clouds cleared away and the beauty of the planet was visible to all at that time it was discovered there were others on hetar as well the forest lords descended from tree spirits and banded with the midland folk who came from the earth spirits the people from the coastal region had their origins in the sea they built the city at the center of it all and became civilized but what of the shadow princes lara asked the faerie women they had mated with bore only sons discovering this hidden valley they chose the desert as their realm master bashkar continued but soon it was feared there would not be room for all the offspring they were producing for they were a fertile race it was then the princes decided if the faeries would grant them long life and the same ability to reproduce only when they chose they would remain in the desert joining the high council as a part of hetar keeping clear of all dissension yet trading with the others and welcoming them when they came women were no longer necessary to their society nor were children the shadow princes are a selfish race kind but selfish and so it has been for many centuries now and again new members are chosen for the council that the others are not made uncomfortable by their longevity and neverchanging appearance they take women they admire for their pleasure but they always return them to their families with enough wealth to satisfy those families but what if the women fall in love with their princes lara asked then they are returned with broken hearts it is not wise to love a shadow prince lara and they try to be careful in their choices he said how came you here she wondered i am an outlander a member of the devyn clan he explained our society is very different from that of hetar the clan families keep mostly to themselves i have never met an outlander lara told him you would not have he told her with a smile we are despised by those who call themselves hetarians they are repulsed by our ways for we refused to allow ourselves to conform to their way of thinking or their social order they wear a cloak of civilization proudly but beneath their veneer they are more savage than the outlanders did the prince not tell me your father sold you into carnal bondage that he might advance himself and his new family it is barbaric and would not happen in the outlands no lara cried you do not understand my father is a great swordsman but without the means to advance himself into the crusader knights he was doomed to remain in the quarter my baby brother would have had no future at all nor would i for there was no coin for my dowry he had nothing of value but for me the monies gaius prospero paid for me allowed my father to dress himself properly to obtain new weapons and fine armor we knew he would win his tournament matches if his application could just be accepted but it would not have been unless he appeared worthy my father is a good man master bashkar and i was proud to be able to aid him his great skills with his weapon should have made him more than worthy lara men should be judged by what they can do and for no other reason master bashkar said a fine appearance will not aid him on the battlefield my child you were the treasure your faerie mother gave him in return for his love yet he used you badly my father did not desert me master bashkar if my mother had remained with us could not her faerie magic have aided my father to gain his goal sooner but she did not i was but a few months old when she left us for another lover she loved you my child did she not put that chain and star crystal about your neck to keep you safe from harm a faerie woman who gives a mortal man a child does not leave them without great cause lara was more confused than she had ever been as she listened to master bashkars words her whole life she had been told of how thoughtless and cruel ilona had been how she had ensorcelled her father as a youth given the lovestruck boy a half faerie child and then recklessly left him to satisfy her carnal faerie nature thereby breaking his heart had not her grandmother ina said it often enough and her father had never disagreed indeed he spoke of ilona as little as possible and when he did the look in his eyes was painful to see when she had been naughty as a child ina had often warned her she must not allow her mothers wicked faerie nature to overcome her now however she was being asked to embrace that nature and unable to help herself she was and whats more she found she liked that part of her that was faerie but still she could not reconcile herself to a faerie mother who cared so little for her that she deserted her she would never forgive ilona and her father was a good man no matter what master bashkar said the master was an old man and he did not understand the complexities of life in the city the winter passed and spring came to the desert for the first time kaliq took lara from the palace the rains had come for a brief time to the sands and the desert was abloom with a carpet of flowers lara was amazed by them as they rode forth how can this be she asked him he shrugged it is an aberration of nature he told her they will be gone in a few days and then the sands will stretch golden again for as far as the eye can see each year at this time the flowers come into bloom when they begin to die we will gather the fading blossoms to make potions and medicines from their seeds and petals when they returned to the palace within the cliffs lara was suddenly aware of how stifling it was in comparison to the great desert the urge to leave the shadow princes was suddenly tugging at her she forced it back she must remain the year and a day to be truly free and where else would she go that she could be as safe og was more than content working with the princes horses he had friends among the other servants who were not intimidated by his size she rarely saw him now but in passing but she had her lessons with master bashkar and she had noss and kaliq instructed her each night in the arts of passion lara enjoyed his lessons best of all the months passed and then one day when she had been within the shadow realm for almost a year the grandmother she had never known maeve queen of the forest faeries arrived in kaliqs dining hall one evening in her usual puff of lavender mist she was barely visible yet seeing her the shadow princes came to their feet and bowed low kaliq came forward to lead her to a seat he put a goblet of wine in her hand she drank from it and her image strengthened she was a beautiful creature even in her decline lara could but imagine what she had been like in her prime maeve was tall and gracefully slender she had silver hair like spun sugar that billowed gently about her nowthin face her pale green eyes were alert and sharp sweeping about the room and taking in all a oncefull mouth was now thin with age but there was a sweetness to it her nose was straight and in perfect proportion to the rest of her face she gave the impression of great fragility but lara sensed it was actually great strength maeve was garbed in elegant garments of forestgreen and gold brocade a golden torque about her slim neck as lara stared at her grandmother her features faded slightly but when the faerie queen drank again from the goblet in her beringed hand the image was restored it grew even stronger when she spoke to him why have you summoned me kaliq of the shadow realm i have that which you have longed for most great maeve he said i have your granddaughter lara only child of your daughter ilona maeves glance swept the hall at his words and when they reached lara a strangely sweet smile lit her aristocratic features lara she breathed the word and stood then unable to remain upon her feet she sat down heavily upon the bench holding out her hand to the girl unable to resist the soft call lara arose and came to kneel by the faerie queens side i am here grandmother she said a wave of tenderness swept over her maeve reached out and caressed laras face her touch was like being brushed by butterfly wings the girl thought the delicate hand fingered laras gilt hair then her fingers tilted the girls face upward and maeve stared into laras green eyes lara felt as if a bolt of lightning had struck her she immediately felt the bond of kinship with the faerie ilonas child maeve said then looking away from her granddaughter she turned her gaze again on kaliq how she demanded the shadow prince recited laras tale and maeve nodded again and again as he spoke he concluded by saying i have sheltered her and taught her since she came great maeve i know she will not remain with me for much longer but i know how much you have longed to know her i am glad you have come i must summon my daughter maeve responded she must see her child no lara cried i do not want to see her how can i ever forgive her for leaving us grandmother forgive me if i hurt you for i hold no ill will toward you but i cannot see she who broke my fathers heart when she deserted him for another lover the faerie queens image flickered and dimmed slightly she quickly downed the contents of her cup and was restored to their sight your mother did not leave your father for another man lara that is but what she told him so he should not attempt to dissuade her from her fate again your mother has always been my chosen she will become queen of the forest faeries when i am finally faded away my time grows short now i needed her back in my own kingdom that she might learn her duties she could no longer live in both your fathers world and ours it was her duty to return and your mother has always known how to do her duty no matter how painful several times she came to see you but neither your father nor your fathers mother would permit her access to you they said it was better for you that seeing you and then departing again would but confuse a child ilona finally accepted their wishes though it pained her greatly were you not told this when you were grown lara the girl shook her head slowly my father rarely spoke of my mother she said it was my grandmother ina who told me of my heritage and slandered your mother in the process i have not a doubt maeve said in dark tones im sure she never meant to lara attempted to protect her fathers dead mother who had raised her so lovingly maeve sniffed in disbelief but said nothing further her granddaughter had been deliberately misled into believing that her faerie kin did not love her it was intolerable and so very human you look exactly like your mother she remarked and your mother must see you i shall summon her now you will treat her with kindness lara for she has suffered too she loved your father still loves him if the truth be known he took another wife two years ago lara said i have a half brother his love of her then was not as constant as hers for him maeve murmured scornfully but then i warned her that humans are a feckless lot if you dislike humans so then why bother to remain here or summon my mother if she is used to the idea that i am gone from her life why wound her if you love her lara said angrily she stared defiantly at the beautiful old faerie queen maeve laughed that temper you possess girl is both human and faerie i do not dislike humans lara indeed some of my favorite lovers were humans and i spawned seven half faerie children in my day your mother however was born of my union with a faerie lord called tiburon who was my chosen mate he has long faded away into the next life but you should know who your grandfather was she turned to kaliq i am not strong enough to reach out to ilona will you do it for me he nodded and then he poured more wine into her goblet drink queen maeve and i will bring your daughter to you i suspect you will need a certain amount of strength for the meeting shortly to take place between ilona and your granddaughter listen but do not involve yourself in their affairs lest you shorten what time you have remaining here maeve reached out again to lara taking the girls face between her hands i have not lied to you lara what i have said is the truth be kind to your mother if you have any care for your faerie heritage remember that ilona gave you life and while she could not be with you she gave you ethne to watch over you i am sorry the crystal guardian could not prevent your time with the forest lords my granddaughter i had heard you had no other grandchildren but me lara responded yet you have had other children have they not wed and taken mates my other children five sons and two daughters were killed in the war that ensued between the forest faeries and the forest lords following the murder of the unfortunate nixa they fired the portion of the woodland where we had our halls because they were angry at the curse i placed upon them your mother was born in the time after we had retreated deep into the forest where we could not be found by those violent men if i had given them a child lara said could it have reversed the curse maeve laughed scornfully not even i could reverse that curse i was very angry the curse was strong and irrevocable what madness possessed them to believe that they might reverse it by getting offspring on half faerie girls i do not know yet you had to pass through their world and treat with them for it is your fate everyone keeps saying it is my fate to do this and to do that but i do not understand at all lara grumbled what is this fate you all prate about i cannot tell you lara for your fate is yours to unravel as you go through life maeve said you may change that fate or not but it must proceed in an orderly manner that is the will of the celestial actuary lara shook her head i do not understand at all she replied it is not the hour for you to understand maeve answered her but in time you will i charted your stars the night you were born for i was present at your birth and even then much was hidden from me you have a destiny lara and it is for greatness that much i know that much i can share with you another clap of thunder sounded in the banqueting hall and ilona appeared in a mist of royal purple not looking at anyone else she hurried to her mothers side everyone was astounded at how much she resembled her daughter what is it mother that you have had me summoned she asked maeve raised a slender hand and pointed at lara with a thin finger ilona turned and stared surprise and shock suffused her features she could not speak at first she was hardpressed to even believe the evidence of her own eyes this was her daughter this was lara but how greetings mother lara finally broke the spell it has been some time since we last met there was an edge of irony in the girls voice ilona heard it and bit her lip what could she possibly say to the daughter she had left behind sixteen years ago you are beautiful they claim i am your image and i will admit that seeing you is like peering into a looking glass lara replied it has been both a blessing and a curse to bear this beauty and yet be half human mother it would have been easier had you been there i could not be ilona cried then reaching out for laras hand she transported them into a private place away from the hall i will not speak with you of these things amid a crowd of strangers lara i did not leave you willingly grandmother says it was because you could not live in both worlds any longer lara replied then why did you not take me with you your father begged me to leave you with him lara i could not refuse him i loved john i always have loved him ilona said and i came back several times to see how you grew but ina would not allow it she said you must be raised to live in the world in which they inhabited and not dwell upon things faerie finally she asked me not to return at all and your father agreed i was defeated he has a wife and son now lara said cruelly does he ilona murmured and he is a crusader knight she continued then his wife brought him the riches he needed to gain that goal oh i am glad ilona cried i offered him faerie gold but he would not take it your father is a very proud man but you know that my father sold me into slavery to gain his goal but do not be angered i agreed to it mother there was nothing else for me as we were always poor no man would have me without a dowry portion despite my beauty in fact my faerie beauty frightened many the master of the merchants purchased me and meant to resell me into one of the citys pleasure houses but my beauty caused dissension among the pleasure mistresses so i was consigned to a taubyl trader and the head forester and his brother paid a small fortune for me because they believed the child of a half faerie girl would free them from maeves curse poor fools knowing naught of my faerie heritage i did not realize that because i hated them their seed would not flourish in my womb how did you learn of it ilona asked quietly her daughters recitation was so bitter and she could see lara was angry og the forest giant told me it was he who aided me to escape he now takes care of the princes horses lara said i had thought the forest giants were extinct ilona said softly we did not learn of their massacre until after it had happened he was in his mothers womb she fled only to be caught several years later when they slew her lara replied the foresters do not know that giant memory is passed on in the womb they did not want the shame of maeves curse made public no they would not ilona said the foresters know nothing outside of their own world nor do they want to know i am sorry for what has happened according to my grandmother it is my fate my destiny lara responded sharply she blames my father but i do not nay you shouldnt i know that your father loves you and did what he believed was best for you he might however have called upon me and i would have aided him he might have asked for my help i would have given it and surely he knew that but your father was ever stubborn yet had he really considered you at all he could have called upon me after all you are my child too i am the one who carried you beneath my heart until your birth and it was he who drove me away if he had but asked it could have been easier then catching herself she said but john was always an overproud man tell me of his wife susanna is a good woman she was kind to me and we were friends but i think she was jealous that you had first captured my fathers heart lara said and i was a reminder of you at least my grandmother was not there to remind her constantly of how i resemble you ina is dead then ilona did not sound griefstricken several years now yes your fathers sword skills of course helped him win his matches at tournament time ilona said so now he lives well with a new wife and a son his daughter his old life in the quarter is behind him and you have begun your journey lara it will not be an easy one i fear she reached out and touched the girls face do not be angry with me my daughter i have never stopped loving you and i left ethne to protect you as best she might her powers are very limited however as you have learned what of my powers lara wanted to know do i have any do you want them ilona said yes i want them because i never again want to be at any mans mercy mother i am not afraid of this journey this destiny you all prattle about but i must be as wellequipped as any soldier if i am to survive and triumph ilona waved her hand and two goblets appeared floating in the air before the women the faerie reached out and taking a goblet offered it to lara let us sit and talk more ilona said and there was a bench in the mist where they had stood speaking she drew her daughter down to sit beside her tell me which of the shadow princes is your host prince kaliq lara said what has he taught you so far to enjoy passion to control it so i remain the dominant lara said i lost my virginity to enda brother of the head forester while easier than durga he was still a beast i despised them both but with kaliq it is different i think i may even love him a little she admitted do not love him more than a little ilona warned but she smiled at her daughter unable to help herself lara smiled back feeling a sudden rush of warmth for this beautiful faerie who had given her life and kaliq has brought me master bashkar from whom i have learned the history of hetar as well as its great literature and poetry excellent ilona said now there remains but one thing for you to learn what is that mother lara was curious you must be taught how to fight to protect yourself when you have learned to defend yourself you will be ready to move on and you must ilona said you have a a destiny a fate i know i know but what is it lara asked ilona sighed what little i know i cannot tell you my daughter you may change your fate slightly now and again as you move along lifes path if i speak on it i could spoil it have i not already done you enough harm it was then lara began to weep softly i missed you she sobbed i needed you why did you go i was torn between two worlds lara as my mothers only surviving child i was chosen to follow after her as queen your father could not understand that a womans duty is every bit as important as a mans it was the only time he and i ever fought with one another i offered to take him with me into my mothers kingdom but he would not go as proud as he was as dutybound he had his own fate to follow too and he would not change it to permit me to follow mine there was no choice but to separate and so we did i wanted you with me he begged i leave you in the end i realized it was better for both you and john that you stay perhaps i should not have listened to his pleas perhaps i should have taken you with me but i did not even faeries make mistakes lara will you forgive me her lovely green eyes scanned her daughters face yes lara said simply her whole life she had wanted her mother what a fool she would be to turn her away now she embraced ilona and kissed her cheek then she sighed we will begin anew mother now you have cleverly avoided telling me of any powers i might have but you must i beg you ilona laughed very well she agreed i can teach you how to draw people and objects to you i can teach you to shift your shape as does your prince i can show you potions and lotions of interest to the human world i know now how to be queen i shall remain with you for a short time it cannot make up for the years we were separated but it will give us an opportunity to know one another better will that suit you daughter yes lara responded enthusiastically yes it will and she laughed happily ilona laughed too and then she said we must return to prince kaliqs banqueting hall his heart would be quite broken if he thought i had taken you off forever besides i must return my mother to her own home shortly she is so weak and soon she will be faded away entirely she can barely transport herself any longer and coming here tonight took a great deal out of her i am so glad that i had the opportunity to meet her lara said will i see her again mother if you wish i know it would please her greatly ilona said she waved a graceful hand and they were returned to the princes banqueting hall where maeve eagerly awaited them smiling happily to see her daughter and her granddaughter reconciled and reunited at long last now she could fade away in peace chapter lara bid her grandmother the great maeve farewell i will see you again she promised the old faerie maeve shook her head nay my sweet child you will not i came tonight because kaliq said you were with him and out of the great friendship i have always had for the shadow princes but i am too weak to come again then i will come to you lara said nay i will not allow you in the forest lara the foresters have sought for a hundred years in their feeble attempts to find me we have eluded them for all that time but i know there could come a time when they might discover us i would not want you there to be retaken into bondage i will never revoke the curse i placed upon them they were ever an arrogant people and for centuries we overlooked their bad behavior in order to keep the peace between us until nixa was murdered a foolish faerie woman to be sure but she did not deserve to die the way she did i will be free soon of the foresters claim lara said do you think my child that they will heed the law they will not especially if they find you in their realm i have seen you now and you have been reunited with your mother which was my desire i shall fade away happily lara but to lose you when i have only just found you she protested maeve smiled it was never meant that i be a part of your destiny lara now give me a kiss dear girl it is time for me to go lara put her arms about the old faerie woman and hugged her noticing that it was almost like hugging the air she kissed maeves cheeks several times goodbye grandmother and thank you she felt the tears beginning to roll down her cheeks reaching out maeve brushed the tears away and then before laras eyes she disappeared in a cloud of pale smoke goodbye lara her reedy voice echoed softly you have made her very happy ilona said to her daughter in a few weeks she will fade away completely and i will be the new queen of the forest faeries i will have to return then and so we have little time together i know that faeries live for several centuries but if i am your only child mother who will follow you lara asked ilona ilona sighed once my mother has faded and i am crowned i must take a mate who will sire a child on me son or daughter it does not matter as long as i have an heir to follow the forest faeries have been ruled since the beginning of time by our family because you are halfhuman you are not eligible to follow me lara our line must remain only faerie she explained you preserve your purity as the forest lords once did and continue to pretend they are doing lara remarked with a small smile i suppose we do ilona replied i never thought of it that way but if faerie blood becomes too thin the magic disappears as well we are pleased to mate with humans but my heir must be all faerie do you have someone in mind lara asked her mother curious ilona nodded his name is thanos he has been my faithful suitor for many years since before i knew your father he has been patient in his waiting she smiled we are friends as well as lovers now i will make him my consort not your king lara was surprised if he were king he would take precedence over me ilona said nay he will not be king learn from me my daughter you were taught by your grandmother ina a good but foolish woman to be subservient to menfolk that is the way of it in the world of hetar in the faerie world women are the equals of their men and ofttimes their superior let no man tell you that you must give way to him if you choose not to you do not have to give way in love or war or anything else lara this is your first lesson will you teach your daughter faerie ways then ilona kaliq asked hearing her words he smiled to see them together so beautiful so alike yes prince i will and i will beg hospitality from you for a short time as well ilona replied who is your best warrior lothair kaliq said i want him to begin teaching lara how to use a bow a sword and a staff ilona told him she must have the ability to defend herself in this world her path will take her to dangerous places i will provide her with the staff myself i hope it is like master bashkars staff llyr lara said with a smile it is always scolding and complaining but when llyr praises you you know you have done not just well but very well aye it is a staff with a spirit it is called verica and when it speaks it gives you the advantage of surprise against your enemies ilona told her daughter but first you will learn to fight with just a plain pole so that you come to depend on yourself alone and not another prince kaliq can tell you that warring is a hard business whether you war for a cause within a great army or simply for yourself against the world i will inform lothair of your wishes my lady ilona and it will be done the prince told her in the weeks that followed lara had scarcely any time at all to herself the days were taken up with lessons from master bashkar in the mornings and from lothair in the afternoons lara invited noss to join her in learning the martial arts as well as her other studies and noss to everyones surprise turned out to be an archer of the first rank usually such skills are faerie ilona noted lara preferred the broadsword and the staff and soon excelled with both each evening mother and daughter would forswear the hall and ilona would teach lara how to make certain potions how to bring objects to her when she extended her hand and most important of all how to change her shape this was the faerie skill that most fascinated lara and the first time she was successful at it she was astounded to find herself in the shape of a cat ilona laughed as the small yellow feline jumped nervously is that what you meant to be daughter she asked yes the cat replied i just didnt think i could really do it change back ilona said and lara stood once again before her mother excellent you have a good strong mind daughter now become a bird what kind lara asked a songbird ilona suggested lara contemplated a nightingale aral go she said and becoming the bird she flew about the garden before lighting again upon a marble bench and saying lara return mother this is amazing can anyone do it nay ilona told her this is your faerie blood that now sings in your veins how long can i remain in a different shape lara asked her as long as you choose ilona said but allow few to know you are capable of this magic lara and only those you completely trust just kaliq for now lara replied ilona laughed i will not ask why she said but your secret is safe with the prince that same night a faerie man appeared suddenly in prince kaliqs hall as they dined thanos ilona was immediately on her feet the faerie man tall and handsome with golden hair and bright blue eyes bowed to her and then knelt greetings queen ilona he said i have come to bring you home for queen maeve is near gone and will not last the night you must be there to claim your heritage as all queens and kings before you have been his gaze went to lara and his lips twitched in a small smile ilona nodded then she turned embracing her daughter i must go now lara the celestial actuary keep you safe in your journey when you need me you have but to ask ethne she will find me mother i beg one final boon of you lara said let me be there when you take thanos for your consort ilona shook her head nay your grandmother is right we must keep you safe from the foresters you cannot come into the woodlands again while they seek you seek me they are seeking me lara was astounded almost a year had passed since her escape why would they bother after all this time because they still believe a faeries child can help them break maeves curse on them and they have not found another to take your place ilona told lara you must soon leave shunnar my daughter lara turned to kaliq you knew only recently he replied i will explain later my love thanos had now risen to his feet he put a proprietary arm about ilona we must go he said in a low urgent voice ilona pushed his arm away giving him a sharp look then she embraced her daughter a final time i will give thanos a son she whispered to lara i want no other daughter for you are everything i could ever have desired in a female child i ask your forgiveness for the years we have been apart you have it mother lara said generously and kissed ilonas cheek the faerie woman reached out and touched the girls face in a tender gesture then she was gone in a puff of deep purple smoke and the faerie man a surprised look upon his handsome face quickly followed her in a deep lavender essence of his own lara laughed softly she will be a grand queen she remarked and he her king kaliq asked curious she will not make him king but merely her consort lara answered the women of your family seem to be independent creatures kaliq said do you desire to be an independent woman also my love i must be lara told him for if i am not i shall be conquered by those who seek to break my spirit i shall never allow that to happen kaliq and you would not want it either my lord would you nay i would not he said then he led her back to the dining couch and they returned to their meal you have become a stronger woman in your months here at shunnar lara but you will soon have to leave me your fate lies beyond our desert kingdom but the skills we have taught you and those your mother has taught you will serve you well and help you to survive i must ask og if he will travel with me lara said you may take noss as well she would be heartbroken if you left her behind kaliq told her i will give her the choice my lord for noss is yet a fearful creature here at shunnar she would be safe and cared for but with me who knows the adventures i will encounter og is of more value to me noss has gained confidence with her abilities as an archer the prince noted she could be a valuable traveling companion he reached out and ran a finger from her shoulder down her arm she smiled seductively at him the meal is not yet over my lord it will be soon and you are the sweet i desire above all the nights when you have remained closeted with your mother have been difficult for me he told her and soon you will be gone from me lara few women have i truly cared for in my long lifetime but when you leave me my love my heart will be most sore he leaned forward and brushed her lips with his ah kaliq my prince she replied were it not for you i should not know how sweet the loving between a man and a woman can be for that i shall always be grateful and she kissed him back gently you will always have a part of my heart and you will remain in my memory until my spirit fades away entirely like my faerie relatives lara told him with a sweet smile let us make love here and now among the others as we have previously done my lord her words seemed to echo throughout the banqueting hall she was suddenly surrounded by the other princely guests kaliq held her out to them and they drew her gown away from her her long lovely gilt hair was unbound to be admired by them all the princes caressed her with soft hands and admiring glances they covered her body with gentle kisses until she grew weak and her legs gave way beneath her but kaliq held her in a firm grip as their tongues bathed her body touching her intimately and mouths suckled upon her breasts she was enveloped in the most incredible cloud of sensation when they finally lay her back upon the dining couch and kaliq covered her body with his own entering her in a single smooth action two of the princes pulled her legs up and over her shoulders to allow her lover the deepest penetration of her body they murmured encouragement and when her eyes began to glaze with her rising passion the last thing lara saw clearly was their smiling faces she had never felt more loved or cherished in all her life and then she cried out with her fulfillment as kaliq groaned with satisfaction and she remembered nothing more except the thundering of her heart and the feeling of total and utter bliss that seemed to go on and on and on when she finally awoke she was in her own bed kaliq sleeping by her side she wondered how long they had been there turning her head she saw that it was still night outside and suddenly she remembered the words that had chilled her bones earlier durga and enda were looking for her would she ever be free of them she would die before she let them take her again but at least now she was no longer a helpless girl she could fight them with sword and staff she could fly away from them as a bird if she had to or better yet she could take a cats form and claw their eyes out of their big heads she actually shuddered with the pleasure her thoughts gave her you are awake kaliqs voice broke into her musings did you enjoy the evening i know my brothers have said your pleasure in your own passion gave them great joy what happened after i fainted away she asked him you didnt faint my love you simply moved onto another plane of existence each of my brothers had his delight of you in one way or another when we had finished you pleasured them between your legs with your mouth with your delicate little hands they said no woman human or faerie had ever given them such enjoyment he told her why can i not remember it she wondered aloud you may one day he said your senses were very heightened and i suspect they overwhelmed part of you although you were very vocal in your appreciation of their talents and they were most flattered he chuckled you have a great capacity for passion lara as much as any fullblooded faerie woman i brought you from the banqueting hall and bathed you myself so you would not awaken with the scent of desire fulfilled in your nostrils he explained it was as if i were saying goodbye to them all she said you were he replied in your time remaining here at shunnar you will see only me and of course you will see lothair for your lessons your mother left you a gift he will present you with today for he says you are more than ready now it is still the middle of the night go back to sleep he kissed the top of her head no i want to know how you know that durga and enda are still seeking me lara said to him they entered the desert two days ago lara i received word yesterday it will take them at least another week to reach shunnar they have not the advantage of ogs magical boots and creatures of habit that these foresters are they did not leave their home to come this way until after their winterfest you have now been gone from them for more than the required time the law allows an escaped slave you are free now go to sleep then why do they insist on pursuing me she demanded your mother told you the answer to that question he replied i must remain to face them lara said i cannot continue to have them racing behind me like hunting dogs on the scent of the prey and this is the best and safest place for me to face them down my lord it is he agreed now go to sleep lara you may not recall all of your vigorous activity this evening but you body does and it needs to rest if you are to be strong and face your enemies aye my lord she agreed with a small chuckle and she snuggled against his shoulder you have taken good care of me kaliq my prince i am grateful you should be he teased her who else could have opened your world for you and taught you how to love so well you deliciously naughty creature only you my lord prince only you lara replied and she kissed his lips to sleep you bold wench i hear and obey she said and effortlessly fell back into an easy slumber the following morning kaliq decided he would take the shape of a desert hawk in order to see the progress the foresters were making as they crossed the desert toward shunnar lara wanted to join him but he refused to allow it you have not yet held a different shape for a long period of time i shall be gone the whole day how can i learn if you will not allow me to accompany you she demanded you could fall from the sky and be injured or killed no if you wish to practice shifting you will do it here where you are safe lara trust me in this decision have you spoken with og yet no she said disappointed then a quick smile lit her face i could be a mare amongst the other mares couldnt i aye the valley is a good place to practice your shapeshifting you dont have to be an animal or a bird lara you might be a piece of the rock walls enclosing the valley it would certainly be a safe choice he suggested then he took her in his arms i would let you come with me if i thought it safe for you my love your time with me is almost at an end and i want to spend it all with you but today i cannot she nodded but lara did understand his decision was really in her best interest i shall study my lessons speak with og and practice being a rock she told him with a wry smile he laughed and giving her a kiss was quickly gone noss brought her the morning meal and then together the two young women went to await master bashkars arrival then lara told noss of the impending arrival of the forest lords noss grew pale but said nothing at first i must soon leave shunnar lara went on will you come with me you do not have to if you feel safer here among the shadow princes but i should like your company will the giant come noss asked i hope so but like you the choice will be his lara responded will it be dangerous noss wanted to know probably lara answered her where are you going noss queried i dont know lara replied i just know it is time for me to leave shunnar and both my mother and the prince were in agreement but he loves you noss cried aye he does but he also knows my destiny is not here in fact he knows it far more than i certainly do they all tell me that when i reach my destination i will know it its a bit exasperating to have people speaking in such deep riddles and hardly reassuring to those i would choose as companions lara concluded noss laughed to her surprise i will gladly come with you shunnar is a place of refuge as the shadow princes meant it to be but i would go mad if i had to spend the rest of my life here without you surely i must have a destiny too and now that i am capable of defending myself i am not so afraid dear lara first however i must face durga and enda they must understand that the curse cannot be lifted as my grandmother is now dead they must know that a faerie woman will not give a child to a man she doesnt love they must be made to face the reality of their situation and cease the pretense of their blood purity ill just wait in the next chamber while you have that conversation noss said good day my young ladies master bashkar entered the chamber where they studied each day he set several scrolls down on the table he used today we shall learn about the coastal kings they are the true aristocrats of hetar they are richer than the midland merchants for they sail our hetarian seas in search of adventure and wealth they are a great tall people with blond or red hair in various shades their eyes are all light colored they keep much to themselves but it is said they are wellspoken welleducated and clever a most unique society indeed have you been to the sea lara asked him never the old man said but i have heard that the waters of it spread farther than the eye can see which i find amazing with whom do they trade she asked him everyone the taubyls who carry their luxury goods across our world the midland merchants the outlanders whom they even welcome into their palaces and villages master bashkar said they are certainly brave men perhaps the outlanders are not as bad as we have been told lara suggested master bashkar looked at her strangely then said they can be fierce i hope that you never have to meet up with them but if you do you will be prepared he unrolled one of the scrolls now this is the land of the coastal kings the only one of the four provinces of hetar to even have a coastline outlanders possess the remainder of it alas why is the coastland so valuable lara asked him because it offers an outlet to the rest of our world hetar is growing my child the population increases daily they need new lands to house the people new natural resources that can surely be found in the outlands gold precious gemstones some in hetar have traveled the outlands it is a place of great beauty with wide grasslands and great mountains but alas it is controlled by the clan families of outlanders and the coastal kings protect them refusing access by either land or sea but the coastal province is the smallest of our states one day hetar shall have to force the kings aside and invade the outlands if they are to gain its land and its resources master bashkar said but you are an outlander lara noted you would advocate this against your own people i do not think that is right and i am surprised for i have thought you a most wise man master bashkar no outlander believes in loyalty except perhaps to his own clan lara he explained because i wished to travel i was driven from the devyn by my own father who had expected me to become a great bard as he was it was many years ago but had not one of the coastal kings taken me into his care and educated me i do not know what would have happened to me my only loyalty is to myself and so should your loyalty be to yourself first and always now we have strayed from our subject the coast is responsible for most of the luxury goods made available to hetar while they trade with the outlands for some of it they do harvest the sea around them for fish and pearls and they mine salt from the sea for all of hetar lara half listened as the old man droned on she did not agree with him about loyalties yes she must be loyal to herself but what of those around her whom she loved what of noss and og poor old fellow lara thought he has probably never had a peaceful moment in all his life for fear of letting his guard down then suddenly she felt a hand slip into hers and looking up her eyes met nosss in total understanding that afternoon they attended their class with lothair they worked with him in a large open chamber just off the valley floor noss practiced with her bow on an open terrace just beyond the columns for since she was so good at it it had been decided that it would be her only weapon except the dagger but noss had proved herself with the small blade too being agile and quick she ceased her practice briefly to watch lara and lothair as they fought with blunted broadswords lothair was a good swordsman but lara had obviously inherited her fathers knack with the weapon she blocked her opponents moves swiftly and easily anticipating his every move lothair was grinning obviously well pleased why do you grin like some loon lara demanded her blade slamming against his to prevent him bruising her because you have become so good at this he chuckled i am my fathers daughter lara said i agree john swiftsword would be proud of you lothair said attempting to block but being hindered by her faster blade you are it seems good at everything and he leered wickedly at her how sweet you were in my arms last night how could you notice was it not for a brief time she teased him he laughed aloud aye he admitted i cannot i fear resist your charms then he put down his sword it is enough for today lara practice is all i can do for you now i have nothing more to teach you nothing at all she grinned i am disappointed my lord he laughed again put your sword down wench and come see what your mother has left you he set his own weapon aside now and walked across the large chamber curious lara lay her own weapon down and joined him the shadow prince reached into the corner and drew forth a beautifully carved staff of ashwood he handed it to lara your mother promised you this i believe he said lara took the staff in her two hands she ran her hand down the smooth polished wood she turned the rod in her hands until she was looking into the carved face on the staff it was a long face with a long nose a narrow mouth and beneath that mouth a long curl of beard the eyes in the face were closed greetings verica lara said softly the eyes opened changing the face from peaceful to fierce greetings lara verica answered her back your mother queen ilona has asked me to serve you she says you now have the proper skills to use me therefore i pledge you my loyalty i am grateful for it and i thank you lara replied verica closed his eyes again lara knew the staff spirits usually slept or at least pretended to sleep when they were not needed she was dying to try her new staff but she realized now was not the time i have a gift for you too lothair said then he brought forth a beautiful scabbard containing a broadsword this is now yours i had it made for you when i saw how good you were becoming with the weapon he handed lara the scabbard taking it from him she slowly drew the sword from the scabbard and almost immediately heard a beautiful female voice declare in song i am andraste and i sing of victory lothair laughed at the startled look on laras face but to her credit she did not drop the sword i had a victory spirit forged into the weapon he said do you like her she was made especially for you to fit your hand to be the correct weight lara examined the blade its a beautiful weapon lothair but i would prefer to win based on my own skills and not through magic andraste cannot be carried by someone lacking in the ability to be victorious he explained her desire for victory enhances your skills in the hands of someone less talented she could not function lara thank you my lord lara said softly do all the shadow princes have such kind hearts it is our weakness which is why we live as we do isolated from the rest of hetar he replied you will keep our secret lara always she responded with a small smile lara come quick noss called putting the broadsword back in its scabbard lara laid it aside and with lothair went out on the terrace noss was pointing upwards looking up they saw a desert hawk but the bird was flying erratically without even a single word between them both lothair and lara shifted their shapes before nosss startled eyes the two eagles one slightly smaller than the other rose up from the terrace flying directly to the obviously injured hawk settling themselves on either side of the hawk one wing each supporting the injured creature their other wings catching the air currents in order to glide they descended toward the terrace while noss watched openmouthed touching down upon the warm tiles the three birds immediately resumed their human shape prince kaliq was bleeding from a wound to his left arm what happened lothair said damned foresters kaliq swore one of them could not resist shooting at me they enter the desert without our permission and then they hunt when they know none but the shadow princes is allowed to hunt here for men who adhere to their own customs so religiously they have no difficulty in ignoring the customs of others noss get a basin and some rags lara said then she carefully examined kaliqs wound and pronounced it is not serious my lord nor is it deep you were but grazed as the arrow passed by you noss came quickly with the waterfilled basin rags and the herbs needed to poultice the wound she held the ewer as lara quickly cleaned kaliqs injured arm the arrow had as she had suspected pierced the skin but slightly as it passed its target the hawk had obviously swerved avoiding serious damage or death the wound was neither deep nor dangerous but it would be painful for a few days she bandaged him enclosing a packet of herbs within the cloth and then announced you will live small comfort he grumbled i saw who did it and when he stands before me he will suffer my wrath now do you understand why i did not allow you to accompany me lara i have much practice as the desert hawk you do not as i agreed with you this morning my lord lara told him gently and then took his other arm come you must rest the day alone has surely been tiring you will tell us about it when you have slept and allowed the healing to begin she led him away you and lara turned into birds noss said to prince lothair he nodded smiling faintly i did not realize she possessed faerie magic i would expect it of you princes but not of lara noss said did it frighten you he asked noss thought a moment and then she said nay but i was surprised he nodded will you still accompany her knowing this he asked of course noss never hesitated in her reply she is my friend lothair nodded again and then he said you should know that both the staff left for her by her mother and the sword i have had made for her possess spirits of great strength the staff is verica the broadsword andraste will you be afraid noss thought again a long moment no she told him but tell me my lord does my bow or my dagger have a spirit lothair laughed nay little one they are but a bow and a dagger thank the celestial actuary noss breathed lara is used to such things for she is partly faerie but i am just an ordinary girl lothair laughed again and then he said not really so ordinary any longer noss now run along and see if lara needs your help putting my brother to bed so he may heal he will be very difficult for he does not like to be sick i will go at once my lord noss replied and she set her bow and quiver aside before hurrying off kaliq was surprised to find himself in a weakened condition but lara and noss remained with him for two days as he healed he was both furious and vengeful by turns much of his anger stemmed from the treatment lara had received at the hands of the forest lords she knew but the insolence exhibited by the foresters in entering the desert realm without permission and then attacking a desert creature knowing it was forbidden burned deep within the shadow prince but on the third day he seemed stronger and more himself again did you speak with og he asked her there was no time she answered him nor time to be a rock he said with a small smile only time to be an eagle she told him thank you lara he said your instincts were perfect in the situation she shook her head looking back i am astounded at what i did my lord as lothair and i rose up to help you i thought only of one thingbringing you safe home he did not speak a word to me we just acted in concert you were in danger and needed our help we gave it as best we could you did well my love he praised her my mother left me a staff it is called verica and lothair had a broadsword made for me with a strong spirit called andraste she told him did you know he was making the weapon for me kaliq aye he asked my permission first for you are my lover lara and he would never offend either of us i thought you would be pleased and you are i can see do the forest lords know how to enter shunnar lara asked him no they must wait below in the village until we acknowledge them and have them brought to us and prince kaliq smiled a wicked smile how short are their tempers very lara said smiling back two days he inquired of her three she responded with a grin they will suffer with the heat as they wait and if they are rude to the villagers they will suffer more zaki will allow no disrespect of his people as you well know how long before they are here two days if they continue at the pace they were traveling they were riding lemaxes not horses however lemaxes are used to the desert and travel it well but they are not swift still horses would not have survived he said too bad they did not travel by horse then lara muttered darkly go and find og kaliq said you must settle your travel arrangements soon lara you will leave when this matter with the forest lords is settled between you so soon she said surprised he nodded go my love and speak with the giant now she left him and finding her way through the corridors and down the staircases of the palace arrived at kaliqs stables which were located at the bottom of the cliffs opening out onto the green valley she found og whom she had not seen but in passing since she had come to shunnar over a year ago there had never been any time and now she felt guilty he was brushing a small golden colt in a wide stall lara he smiled warmly at her you will be going soon then come and sit with me here on the hay and we will visit for a while he pushed the colt away does everyone know this but me she asked him hugging him as he bent down to greet her will you come with me no og said i am happy here at shunnar the prince has put me in charge of his stables now and when i desire it a wife will be found for me among the desert peoples zaki has promised it i am a small giant and there are some large girls among zakis people i am respected and earn my own living now he says i am quite a good catch og chuckled i am so glad for you lara told him honestly you go to the village then as often as i can og told her i enjoy the company of zakis people the prince has promised when i take a wife i will have my own quarters within the palace where i may bring a wife and raise children for now i have been content to sleep in the loft above he explained where will you go she shrugged i dont know yet where the wind takes me i suppose alone nay noss is coming with me she has become quite a good archer i seem to have my fathers talents and i have become fairly proficient with the staff my mother gave me one called verica prince lothair has given me a sword andraste i am not afraid as i was when we escaped the forest though durga and enda come this way even as i speak they think to reclaim me but we are free now dear og a year and a day have passed the law of hetar is on our side now not theirs lara said triumphantly when they learn your bloodline they will want you even more granddaughter of maeve og answered her did you know lara asked him i suspected it when i learned your mothers name he said but what good was the knowledge to either of us then it could only have made your life worse i learned long ago how to keep secrets lara i will stand by your side when the foresters arrive they are dense men but they have surely realized when i went missing too that we had effected our escape together they will not want me back for even if i do not tell them i know their secret i know enough to shame them should i speak they must say aloud before witnesses that i am now free that i may live the rest of my life without fear for myself my wife or my children i met maeve lara told him did you he was impressed she was fading and has since disappeared entirely ilona is now queen of the forest faeries maeve told me she would never lift the curse and no one else could the foresters are doomed whether they admit it or not the purity of their blood is almost extinct lara said quietly durga will never accept it og said he has no choice lara replied i will send for you when the foresters arrive og be ready then taking up his big hand she kissed it and wrapping her arms about his thick neck she kissed his rough cheek be happy dear og you deserve it she stood up i must return now kaliq was slightly injured and i am nursing him what happened the giant asked and lara quickly explained he taught you to shapeshift my mother taught me she was here a few weeks and passed on certain faerie magic to me so i will be safe in my travels lara explained i must go now and with a wave of her hand she hurried from the stables leaving the giant behind will og come kaliq asked her when she returned to him lara shook her head you knew as much didnt you she said yes but it was not for me to tell you he replied it is better this way for wherever you go lara you want to travel discreetly and even a small giant six cubits high could attract unwanted attention to you there are going to be times when you dont want attention i feel the pull of something kaliq she told him what is it your destiny he said but i cannot go until you are healed she said nor until durga and enda understand i will not be returning to them i cannot imagine how i am going to be able to convince them she sighed and it is my problem isnt it the law of hetar is on your side lara a slave who remains free for a year and a day is no longer a slave he reminded her and any slave seeking refuge in the desert cannot be taken back they have no rights to you my love i suspect they will not see it that way lara remarked she was right of course two days later durga enda and a party of six other foresters arrived at the cliffs hiding the valley of the shadow princes they were informed by zaki that they would have to wait until prince kaliq and his brothers were willing to see them zaki had been warned that these men of the forests had short tempers and so were to be fed watered and avoided until it was time to admit them to the presence of the princes and at the end of three days durga and his companions were growing restless and angry not until the fourth morning did zaki greet them the princes have agreed to see you this afternoon my lords he said when it is time i will bring you to them he bowed youve known the way to them all along durga exploded of course i know the way to my lords palace zaki responded and you have allowed us to remain here roasting in your wicked weather for three days durga snarled his face was burned with the sun and he had grown angrier with each minute they had been forced to wait do you know who i am you are the lord durga the head forester zaki said in irritated tones but it would not have mattered who you were if my lord was not ready to see you then he was not ready to see you nor were the others i will return at the appointed hour calm yourself brother enda said softly this is not the forest nor are we the masters here remember why we are here we are here for lara and we will regain her tonight each man of us here will mount and seed her she will give us a faerie child durga we will make her and we will keep using her until she does we are close to our goal now do not despair brother you think this shadow prince will release her to us willingly durga snapped that is why we went to the magistrates court in the city brother how many have lost slaves to these desert men over the years and certainly none as expensive as lara the magistrate was yet angry that the head mistress of the pleasure guild had forbade her sale to any of the pleasure houses he owns one himself and had hoped to have her she would have made him a fortune he told me that when we were finished with her he would purchase her from us not for what we paid but for at least half by agreeing we have managed to circumvent the law of the land brother we cannot sell her to anyone for she will surely learn our secret if we allow her to live and if she escaped once she can again durga replied og helped her enda said remember brother they both disappeared at winterfest they had to go together and they must be here for they are nowhere else we have searched over this year the giant may remain here if he chooses for he has been gone more than a year and a day but lara must be returned to us and the law is on our side durga remember that zaki came at the appointed hour and telling the head foresters men they must remain behind listened to durgas longwinded protest and then said i have my orders my lord you and your brother no one else will you come or shall i return to my prince and tell him you have refused his invitation their hospitality is legend enda murmured i have never heard of them murdering a guest come brother grumbling durga followed zaki when they reached the cliffs entrance they were offered horses to ride mounting they followed zaki up the wide winding path until they reached the entry to the colonnaded corridor they dismounted and now followed zaki on foot gaping at the tall marble columns peering wideeyed over the balustrade into the great green valley below here the breezes blew cooler than in the village then zaki led them into a great room where kaliq awaited them by his side were both lara and og lara was clad in leather trousers and a silken shirt a jeweled leather belt encompassed her narrow waist i told you she was here durga said triumphantly first i am going to beat her we were too soft on her last time she needs to know who her master is enda look at how proudly the bitch stands soon very soon she will beg for our mercy greet the prince brother enda hissed the sight of lara more beautiful than he recalled set his pulses racing he could scarcely wait to put his manroot into her again he wanted to punish her too but in a far different fashion than his brother hail kaliq prince of the shadows durga said kaliq nodded in acknowledgement but did not speak you have my property and i want it back durga spoke boldly kaliq now stood up from his chair which had been set upon a raised dais lara has been gone from your tender care more than a year and a day head forester she is free now under hetarian law i have gone to the courts durga responded angrily the magistrate has ordered that such a law cannot apply to a slave of such great value the giant is free but lara belongs to us he waved a parchment at the prince kaliq laughed scornfully and how can i be certain the paper you waggle before me is genuine durga of the forest do you doubt my word the head foresters face grew florid why should i believe a man who would attempt to circumvent our hetarian laws the prince demanded the law says a slave free for a year and a day remains free yet you come with your paper to tell me otherwise do you take me for a fool durga of the forest i know you paid a small fortune for lara i think you seek to regain her in a most unlawful manner durga glanced at the shadow prince his slow wits digesting his words finally he said look at the paper yourself my lord he shoved the parchment toward kaliq look and see if i lie i will restrain my outrage at your questions for i can understand you but wish to retain this valuable slave for yourself and i cannot blame you the princes elegant hand reached out to take the proffered deed he glanced at it in a bored cursory fashion and then let it drop from his fingers if there is an actual magistrate of this name and he actually signed such a breach of our laws i can but wonder how much you paid him durga of the forest kaliq murmured insultingly do youdo youdare to accuse us of bribery durga spluttered his face bright red now with his anger aye the prince replied but mostly i accuse you of stupidity in believing that you could invade our kingdom attempt to thwart our laws and believe we would let you do it durgas hand went to his dagger he was almost foaming at the mouth and shook off endas restraining hand i know your secret ogs deep voice suddenly spoke durga paled then he said i do not know to what you refer og aye you do og said descending from the dais where he had been standing i know of the curse maeve placed upon your people you cannot durga replied you were not even born then giant memory is exchanged in the womb durga of the forest our memories were our history and my mother passed them all on to me before my birth i know it makes no difference durga cried lara will change all that that is why we must have her back she will help us regain ourselves nay i will not now it was lara who spoke the daughters of faerie women inherit certain traits from their mothers like faeries they give no children to those they do not love since i despise you both i will never give either of you a child any of you my lord durga and my grandmother swore on her fading that she would never remove the curse from you nor could anyone else durga looked stunned it was his brother who now spoke your grandmother maeve was my grandmother although until recently i did not know it lara said durga began to moan we had maeves own kin beneath us in our beds and yet we could get no child on her brother then his small eyes turned on lara come back with us and we will make you a queen he pleaded all thoughts of violence against her gone from his head give us sons to free us from your grandmothers curse faerie girl even if i were willing and i am not it could not be maeve said it before her fading the curse can never be lifted your purity is gone my lords your father was but half forester and your blood is thinned by a quarter more you live a lie and no faerie will ever help you could not help you and it is all your own fault if your grandfather had but punished those who killed the faerie woman nixa if he had returned her torque willingly thereby preventing his own pregnant wifes death maeve would have forgiven the sin angry as she was but your grandfathers pride was overwhelming he is responsible for the destruction of your race durga whose head had fallen to his chest with her first words now looked up his eyes had become enflamed with his desperation and madness you will return with us faerie girl and you will give us the children we need to restore our race he snarled reaching out for her you will come back a deep feral sound arose from ogs throat he would have moved forward but that lara stayed him with her hand the girl is ours enda said attempting to sound reasonable surely you can understand that my lord prince we have the magistrates order and the shadow princes are men who respect the law and keep order themselves among the desert folk you bribed the magistrate i have not a doubt kaliq replied in amused tones what did you promise him in return lara when you had finished with her your brother would not allow lara to live or do you not understand that my lord enda at that durga leapt forward his big clumsy hands stretching out for lara the girl stepped back but a pace her arm reaching up to draw her broadsword from the scabbard on her back she found herself filled to bursting with a ferocious anger this beast of a man would not have her she would never again be victimized by the head forester durga or any of his clan then to even her own surprise she jumped forward and with a single stroke decapitated the head forester as the sword sang loudly i am andraste i sing of victory and i drink the blood of the unjust durgas head rolled across the marble floor his eyes wide his mouth open in complete and utter shock crimson blood spurted from his severed neck and flowed over the marble floors the head settled at endas booted feet he looked down and then up again his eyes were filled with fear as he stared at lara a hesitant hand went to his own weapon but kaliq quickly spoke lara tells me you paid thirty thousand pieces of gold for her i will give it to you and ten thousand more in blood money for your brothers death under the law lara was legally free of you several days ago you have attempted to regain her by fraudulent means we both know it my lord enda take the gold and leave shunnar if i must bring this unfortunate matter to the attention of the high council how do you think they would rule laras destiny is not with you nor is it even with me i regret to say and it occurs to me that if your brother had no son then it is you who are now the head forester did durga have a son a small smile played about the princes mouth no just daughters enda had now found his voice again and lied easily to the shadow prince the bitch truda had whelped a boy but he was weak and had been sickly since his birth his brother had beaten truda badly for it as he blamed the woman no one would consider it odd if the boy died suddenly and no one would be sorry to have truda gone from their midst she had been a troublemaker from the very beginning durga was dead of his own stupidity enda would tell no one how his brother died he would say durga had a fit when he could not regain lara of course there was the matter of his brothers head and body being separated then we shall consider this matter settled between us and between lara and your family the prince purred if you would like we will bury your brother his body would decay too badly if you attempted to take it with you back to your forest realm enda nodded had the prince read his mind he wondered uncomfortably when i have the gold in my possession he said and then his eyes went to lara if only he could have gotten a son on her he thought regretfully but he had understood her words let me kill him too my lord kaliq lara said and was pleased to see the forester grow pale beneath his sunburnt skin kaliq laughed so my love the warriors blood now sings in your veins but nay we will not start a war over you as flattering as i am certain you would find it hetar must remain at peace for now soon enough the clouds will gather very well lara agreed she smiled at enda i will not kill you though it is tempting my lord enda and your neck is not quite as thick as your brothers was to her surprise he answered her i am sorry you could not love me lara even though i understand what you have said is the truth the purity of the foresters blood is a thing gone yet i would have liked to have had a son by you go home my lord she told him be thankful that my lord kaliq has stayed my hand never again will anyone use me for their own advantage she bent picking up durgas head by its hair she stared into his face briefly saying as she handed it to enda and take this with you he recoiled forcing back the bile that rose in his throat as he was forced to stare into his brothers dead face his legs felt weak and he slipped on the bloody floor lara my love do put the head down we will dispose of it you really are frightening the new head forester my lord enda he now directed his speech to the forester zaki will lead you back to the village where you will find the gold already waiting for you use the lemax your brother rode to carry it you will depart this evening our moon is now full and you will find traveling at night is more comfortable in the desert i bid you a safe journey enda nodded bowed and turned about to follow the headman his last glimpse of lara caused an icy shiver to ripple down his spine she was industriously cleaning his brothers blood from her sword once he wanted nothing more than to possess her totally now he prayed to the celestial actuary that he never had to see her again chapter i cannot believe that i killed him lara said afterward as they ate their evening meal in the private garden that separated their individual quarters i dont know what happened but i was suddenly filled with an anger such as i have never known my lord blood lust he said dryly and now perhaps you are beginning to understand lara in your life you have been a good daughter then you were to be a pleasure woman but that is not the destiny fate meant for you to follow it is not written that your beauty be used just for the gratification of others you are meant to be strong to lead but women are subservient my lord it has always been that way she replied not everywhere he told her only in the provinces she looked puzzled and he further explained in the provinces women have been kept obeisant for a reason it is believed women cause disorder for they are known to question protest and dispute if permitted men however accept what is told them if it is told to them by someone they respect and trust the high council wants no difficulties they want peace they want industry and trade to continue as they always have they want profit and profit does not necessarily come with social change the high council wants everyone to keep their place and those who are allowed up the social ladder come only in the prescribed way as did your father but change is coming lara it must come if hetar is to survive the old ways are coming to an end and you are to be part of that change i hear your words my lord but they make no sense to me i dont even know where i will go when i leave shunnar but i know i must go lara said i sense my time with you is coming to an end kaliq part of me is saddened by that knowledge yet part of me looks forward to leaving this peaceful haven you have provided me these past months i cannot hide away from the world forever i find to my surprise that i am curious to see all the wonders in all the lands master bashkar has described i feel i am changing once again it is both a little frightening and yet very exciting she was very confused by everything that had happened today she had taken a life and yet she felt absolutely no guilt over durgas death indeed she felt a strange pride in her skills at removing his head in a single swift stroke i wish lothair had been there lara said aloud kaliq laughed knowing what she had been thinking yes he acknowledged he would have been very proud of you and of himself too i think he has been your instructor but your skills he tells me come to you naturally he says he has but refined them durgas death was a far more merciful one than he deserved you say change is coming to hetar tell me i beg of you lara pleaded he shook his head you have a destiny to live out my love you must follow your own path not one that is set out for you you will make errors lara for that is part of the learning process but you will survive that much i will tell you and you will triumph but where am i going her look was distraught pick a direction my love you do not want to go back for the forest lies in that direction so the midlands and the city are forbidden to you for now you can go toward the sea or you can enter the outlands one way will serve to interrupt your journey the other will bring you closer to your fate he told her think carefully before you choose he took her small hand in his comforting her confusion must i decide tonight she asked him yes he said for tomorrow you will be gone lara gasped so soon oh please my lord a few more days with you no he said your time here with me is over lara so think on it for a few more minutes and then tell me would you like noss to make the decision with you she nodded it is her destiny too lara said and called for her friend to come and join them the prince explained the dilemma then rising said i will leave you to discuss what you will do call me when you have decided and i will return he bent and kissed laras lips softly choose carefully he repeated then he was gone we go tomorrow lara told noss but where to the sea or to the outlands i do not know what to do if were free cant we go back to the city and live with your father i will be your servant lara i loved the city and to live in luxury in the garden district would be wonderful she sighed we cannot go back noss we need to go forward but which direction shall we take did not master bashkar say that the coastal kings are the true aristocrats of hetar yet kaliq says one way will interrupt my journey while the other will move it forward i think to go into another of hetars provinces might put a halt to this destiny they all seem to believe i have while we have never been there either of us it is still a place of civilization and order everything they tell us the outlands is not but the outlands are an unknown for us lara noss noted if we are to be safe should we not go to the sea noss both you and i can well defend ourselves lara replied i heard what you did in the reception hall today noss half whispered i do not think i could kill anyone lara i think you were very brave i was never going to be free until durga was dead lara said he would not or he could not understand that no woman with faerie blood can be made to give a child to a man she does not love he was determined to have me back he could not be reasoned with and i had no other choice but to slay him and when i did andraste sang that she drank the blood of the unjust did not enda protest noss asked lara laughed i think he was too frightened to and then the prince reminded him that if durga had no male heirs enda was now the head forester kaliq gave him the thirty thousand pieces of gold the brothers had paid for me and additional blood money for durga now noss laughed then you are truly free lara i am so glad tomorrow we will leave shunnar for the outlands lara said in sure tones to remain within our orderly civilization is not my way noss the outlands are where i need to be she touched the crystal about her neck ethne do i choose well the flame within the crystal flickered and she heard ethne say but a single word to her aye lara looked at noss you can stay if you are afraid i would understand no noss said we have been bound together since we traveled in the caravan of rolf fairplay i sense it aye i am afraid but where you go lara i will follow that it would seem is my destiny and so it was that they found themselves the following morning bidding the prince and og a final farewell kaliq had not touched lara as a lover that last night i must learn to live without you he said quietly and she realized she understood in the morning he brought her a pair of soft mediumbrown leather trousers lined in silk a naturalcolored silk shirt with wide sleeves and a v neckline as well as a pair of fine brown leather boots with a matching vest he brushed her hair himself braiding it into a single plait and covering her shining head with a dark green kerchief last he strapped her sword and scabbard across her chest and back do not he advised her seriously allow your beauty to detract from your journey dress plainly keep your hair hidden from strangers as much as you can lest they realize you have faerie blood and be afraid unnecessarily you are capable of defending yourself and you must do so if you are threatened act immediately as you did with durga you are not afraid are you i am not she said and yet i am you have taught me the difference between passion and lust you have taught me to enjoy and revel in my pleasure as well as that of my lover lothair has taught me weaponry master bashkar has taught me about hetar so that i am no longer woefully ignorant of our land knowing that my mother did not leave me willingly and that she loves me has both strengthened and gladdened my heart although i am saddened by my fathers portion in the deception that kept us apart still he did what he believed best i thought i was ready before yesterday when durga came yet at the moment i slew him i realized that i had not really been free to move forward i want no one protecting me thinking for me i want to live my own life on my own terms she put her arms about the princes neck my time with you kaliq has given me all of this and for that i thank you she kissed his cheek and then drew away smiling at him now i must go he nodded there is one thing i was not permitted to give you lara that privilege belongs to another i was not allowed to give you my love but one day you will meet the man who will i hope you are able to love him back and having said those words the shadow prince led lara and noss down to the stables he had quietly secreted her pearwood brush in the pocket of his robes but within her pack she would find a delicately made gold one to replace it in the stables og awaited them holding two horses lara was mounted upon a small golden stallion with a creamy mane and tail noss upon a white mare with a black mane and tail each of the animals had full saddle and water bags then to laras surprise og took the reins of the two horses she looked to the prince for an explanation your decision necessitates you depart a different way from that which you came he said og will set you on the right path the horses are my gift to you and noss may the celestial actuary guide you well and keep you both safe prince kaliq said then he bowed to them and og led them from the stables lara looked quickly back but kaliq had disappeared into the shadows as was his custom she turned to look ahead and was surprised to see og leading them out into the valley the horses increased their speed but he easily kept up she looked up and was amazed by the height of the great gray stone cliffs surrounding the valley from the balustrade of the palace they had not seemed so very tall before them the herds of mares many now with their foals scattered as og shooed them out of the way the valley was far wider than she had thought lara decided finally they reached the other side and og began to lead the horses parallel to the steep face of the rock then he stopped we are here he said where lara asked searching the cliff for an opening og grinned here he repeated and with a wave of his hand an opening appeared in the dark rock how on earth did you do that she demanded of him the prince taught me not only am i in charge of his stables i am his gatekeeper as well each of the shadow princes has a gatekeeper whose duty it is to offer admittance to the valley it is a magic skill rarely used however now listen to me lara you will enter a tunnel through this opening it is welllit and safe each torch you pass will dim itself as you and noss go by for the only way open to you is forward when you exit the tunnel it will close behind you you will be in the outlands then your packs contain clothing food and water there are no valuables to be stolen your sword is on your back and you know how to use it verica rides in his own leather holder by your right hand noss you carry your bow and quiver on your person your dagger is at your waist you too know how to use your weapons be always watchful and trust no one but yourselves the outlands are not the provinces he handed each of them a small leather bag that jingled not enough to draw attention but it will get you by lara you will find a gold piece sewn into each of your vest pockets may the celestial actuary keep you safe my dear friend lara leaned forward and standing in her stirrups stood to kiss his cheek be happy dear og i owe you my life and one day i hope to repay the debt she said do not make me weep like a child he groused at her you owe me naught we saved each other i am proud to have played a part in your life lara go now and he slapped the rump of the golden horse who moved forward into the tunnel the white horse behind him when lara turned to look back the cliff wall had already closed behind them for a brief moment she felt the stirrings of panic then taking a deep breath she turned her face forward they rode for a time in silence the only sound in their ears that of the horses hooves on the smooth rock pathway they traveled behind them each torch they passed hissed out with a snap as og had said they would it was eerie and yet they both felt safe finally noss spoke how much farther do you think it is she wondered i dont know lara replied but at least here i know were safe who knows what will happen when we exit into the outlands are you afraid noss a little the girl admitted but i suppose id be a fool if i werent she concluded with a small chuckle i wonder what well find and if we want to get back to the provinces how will we ever find our way lara shrugged i dont know she admitted and they both grew silent again the passage went on and on for what seemed a very long time but the horses plodded on surefooted and steady in their pace finally they saw the tiniest pinpoint of daylight up ahead it grew larger and brighter as they moved toward it revealing itself at last as an opening at the end of the tunnel they stopped and stared as one and then lara drew a deep noisy breath and they forged forward into the daylight behind them the last torch dimmed and the opening in the rock wall closed with a soft rumble lara didnt dare to turn about for she was afraid that she would cry if she did and she suspected that noss would too this was no time for histrionics they stared ahead before them a green plain stretched as far as the eye could see in the distance they saw a range of hazy purple mountains lying on the horizon but there was no sign of civilization the land was more beautiful than anything else she had ever seen lara thought pristine untouched which way do we go noss whispered stunned by what her eyes beheld straight ahead lara answered and her laughter echoed in the clear air there has to be someone or something to be found eventually she spurred the golden stallion into a gallop they had been penned up in that tunnel forever it seemed she heard nosss white mare coming behind her and laughed again as the wind hit her face and the tiny tendrils of hair escaping from her bandana blew about her face it was wonderful she had never felt so free in all of her days or more at home she was startled to realize at last the horses slowed to a stop looking back lara saw the cliffs had vanished and realized the magic that had been involved in bringing her into the outlands noss was openmouthed the cliffs lara where did they go she managed to stammer we have not ridden that far for the mountains are still a forever ways away prince kaliq has performed a great magical feat for us lara said i do not know how but we are obviously just where we are meant to be noss she laughed again isnt it wonderful its big noss observed very big where are the farms a village or two where are the people and the herds i can see naught but this plain all around us and a stream of water lara said pointing to the animals feet she loosed the reins so her beast might drink i must name my horse for og did not tell me what to call him said lara the horse raised his head and turning said to her i already have a name mistress i am dasras it means handsome and as you will have noted i am very handsome the mare is sakari she also has the ability to speak but she is shy lara was speechless for a moment but then she said thank you dasras noss did you hear your mare is sakari we thank you both for carrying us so safely refresh yourselves while you may for we shall travel onward until dark the stallion turned back to his drinking the mare joining him a horse that talks i never knew a horse that talked noss exclaimed i rather like the idea as long as sakari and i are together i will have someone to chat with lara isnt that nice she looked quite pleased lara refrained from giggling are you ready to move on she asked we may have to camp in the open tonight but as they moved on the plain that had seemed to go on forever began to roll gently and they discovered it was not as flat as they had thought as the day wore on and the sun began slowly to sink lara searched for a place they might shelter for the night finally ahead of them she saw a pleasant grove of trees with another narrow stream flowing through it she led them to it and dismounting said i think we should be safe here we have seen neither man nor beast all day noss said nervously what will the night bring should we light a fire to keep away savage beasts yet a fire could draw bandits to us if we had a better shelter lara said we could avoid a fire but dasras and sakari must be protected well make a small fire others have camped here before us noss see the little ring of blackened stones and the bits of burned fuel let us look for some wood but we will not start our fire until near dark do not unload us dasras said the weight we carry is not heavy and if you must depart quickly you do not want to lose your few precious supplies and set your staff in the ground with a view of the plain that he may watch for us we will graze at our leisure just beyond the trees you offer good advice for one so young lara replied my father was a great campaigner with the shadow princes long ago he has taught me all that i know the stallion answered lara pulled verica from his place on her saddle wake up she said to him and his eyes flashed open you must keep watch for us this night verica she drove the staff into the ground on the edge of the trees are we looking for anything in particular verica asked dryly savage animals hostile riders lara replied a small smile tugging at her lips in other words it is up to me to save you from disaster verica said exactly lara agreed now grinning we have to light a fire which will serve to keep the fourfooted beasts away but not necessarily the twofooted ones verica chuckled as lara turned away to gather firewood she and noss set up a conical pile within the ring of stones the sky was now aflame with the sunset and the darkness came quickly afterward surprising them there had been virtually no twilight using the faerie magic her mother had taught her lara pointed to the stone enclosure and said fire light immediately a flame sprang up within the cone low lara commanded it and the fire burned low well dont that beat flint stone and dried grass noss said admiringly ill call the horses lara said we had best see what we have in those packs to feed us she whistled for dasras and sakari who trotted back into their encampment rifling through the saddlebags she drew forth a carefully wrapped packet opening it she exclaimed faerie bread whats faerie bread noss asked taking the piece handed her and looking at it suspiciously she sniffed at it it will satisfy your hunger lara said ilona had introduced her to faerie bread take a bite of it lara told her noss bit into the chunk and suddenly a beatific smile lit her face its good she said have just a little bit of it we have no way of knowing how long our stores must last when they had finished eating lara said i will keep watch for part of the night and you will keep watch the rest of it she walked over to dasras and pulled a heavy cloak from behind her saddle theres one for you with sakari she told noss the early watch or the late watch she asked her companion the early noss said when shall i awaken you lara looked up into the sky above them to see the triad risen perhaps an hour now she pointed it out to noss when it reaches the midheavens wake me unless of course you need me before then i will noss replied and watched as lara lay down near their little fire and rolled herself in her cloak lara was soon asleep and noss sitting by the fire thought how peaceful the night was too peaceful not the sound of an insect or a night bird getting up she walked to where verica stood guard it is so quiet she said to him yes he said nothing stirs neither man nor beast do not fear noss for my eyes can see through the darkness and for now there is nothing dangerous to be seen noss walked back to the fire the horses were grazing peacefully within her sight she sighed traveling with rolf fairplay had been very different than this then on the horizon a new moon rose the pale blue of the midlands shortly thereafter a second moon in its first quarter stage arose and it was the light green forest moon it was followed by the full copper moon of the desert and lastly a butteryellow waning moon noss was astounded she considered waking lara but then she realized that lara would see it when she awoke her shortly with the light of all four moons most of the stars had disappeared but the triad still shone brightly to nosss relief she could have never imagined the adventures she was going to have and they had only just begun noss roused lara at the appointed time now sleepy but remembering to point out the four moons of hetar lara was refreshed from the several hours of sleep she had had she went into the shelter of the trees to relieve herself then she sought out dasras and took a water bag from her saddle she drank replaced the bag gave the stallion a pat and went to sit by the fire master bashkar had told her that in the outlands the four moons of hetar could all be seen three of them she knew of course but the butteryellow quarter moon was new to her this then would be the moon that shone over the coastal province once all four moons were risen completely their colors faded gradually away and they turned silvery white the third moon was setting on its horizon as the skies brightened in shades of pink both deep and light pale lavender orange and gold above the vibrant colors the sky grew bright blue the birds began to twitter and then the blazing red sun burst over the horizon lara stood stretched and then went to wake noss they ate their faerie bread and drank from the clear stream refilling the little they had taken from the water bags the day before lara drew verica from the earth thanking him for his night watch she brushed the dirt from the bottom of the staff replacing it in its holder on her saddle lara ordered the fire out and they departed the grove that had served as their shelter the vast rolling plain stretched on ahead of them they rode at a leisurely pace not wanting to tire the horses when they had no idea where they were going at midmorning they heard first faintly and then more distinctly the sound of many horses behind them lara turned she could see a group of riders in the distance behind them what will we do noss half sobbed we have no place to hide calm yourself lara chided the girl if we run these riders will think we have something of value or something to conceal we will continue on as we have been they will either pass us by or inquire to our destination i will speak for us do you understand you are so brave noss said i should be but i am not lara laughed to herself right now i am terrified she thought yet i must appear calm and in control of myself and the situation i must remember what kaliq said i have a destiny if that destiny were to be killed easily and at a young age the forest lords would have done it i have not come into the outlands to be murdered they pressed onward and eventually the riders behind them caught up to them and they found themselves surrounded lara and noss sat straight in their saddles eyes ahead they rode for a time within the group of horsemen all were silent and then the horse next to laras reached out to bite dasras control your mount she snapped at the animals rider you ride a stallion as do i was the reply yes lara said it is unusual for a woman to ride a stallion her companion remarked and particularly so little a woman dasras and i suit each other lara answered him boldly the man next to her laughed i am vartan of clan fiacre he said and you are very beautiful as well as very brave you did not flee my riders though you knew we were behind you i am lara daughter of swiftsword and why would i run this is noss my companion she turned her head to look at him he was a big man and tall his long black hair was pulled back and held by a leather thong his face was oval in shape his cheekbones high his mouth long and narrow his gaze engaged her most directly clear and light blue and filled with both amusement and frank curiosity you are two little girls on rather good horses all alone on the plain he said should you not be afraid laras green eyes never left his as she spoke the sword on my back is andraste it is not there for decoration i know well how to use it and we have killed before andraste and i noss and i are travelers from the city we carry nothing of value in our packs you are free to search them he laughed again where are you bound for lara daughter of swiftsword i dont know she told him we have never been in the outlands before and all we know of it is that it is uncivilized or so we have been told hetar he sneered so smug in the assurance of its civilized ways it is all hetar she told him the high council doesnt consider it so he said for them hetar is the four neat and tidy provinces of the midlands the forest the desert and the coastal regions we are the outlands filled with ignorant savages unable to live by the rule of law i curse their law it has nothing to do with me lara replied i departed the city over two years ago i cannot go back why where are you going she asked him ignoring his question our encampment he answered her and then to the village of camdene he told her would you like to travel with us not all those you meet out here on the plain will be friendly lara daughter of swiftsword i should appreciate your company lara answered him but you need not be friendly my lord vartan just companionable he nodded and tonight you will tell me how you came to be in the outlands around the fire she agreed and perhaps you will tell me what you do out here on this lonely land we rode all day yesterday without seeing man nor beast you camped in the grove of drem we stopped to water our horses there earlier you were fortunate to find it for there is not another like it for miles he told her i have never seen so much open land lara told him it is beautiful and frightening all at once aye he agreed your high council would like to annex some of these lands if they dared the outlands are rich in land and other resources they are greedy to possess the provinces grow more and more crowded what do you do here she asked him we live free he said and then he amended it some farm many tend to their herds our villages are like villages everywhere the fiacre have more villages than any other clan in the outlands i rule the fiacre will we reach your village today lara asked him nay not until tomorrow he said we were told strangers had entered our lands and came out several days ago to find them you are the only ones we have found so far he said we cannot be those you seek lara said we only entered the outlands yesterday from the desert kingdom that cannot be he said the border between us and the shadow princes is at least three days away we came through a tunnel in the cliffs lara said what cliffs he asked puzzled she laughed softly they have made some magic i suspect she told him in the desert where the great cliffs rise the shadow princes have their palaces if you are a guest in these palaces you will discover a wonderful valley between the cliffs where the princes raise their horses yesterday noss and i were led across that valley from prince kaliqs palace we entered a tunnel and traveled for several hours before we reached its end which opened out onto your plain after we had ridden for a time across your land i looked back but the cliffs from which we had exited were gone why have you come here vartan wondered i dont know yet i just know that given the choice of the coastal province or the outlands my instinct told me to come here lara explained have you magic he asked her some she said lightly but nothing powerful of which i am aware i can light a fire without flint and stone she gave him a small smile a very useful magic for a traveler he told her returning the smile have you magic she asked him some he said not elucidating further and then vartan chuckled at her delicately raised eyebrow i shapeshift he said fiacre is a word for eagle and i take the form of my clans badge sometimes each leader of the fiacre is given this gift it is generally useful indeed she said dryly but did not reveal her own proclivities to him not yet why did you simply not seek for these intruders as the eagle lara asked him i had no chance most do not know of the ability i possess they would be afraid vartan told her shall we keep it our little secret lara daughter of swiftsword you appear to be a girl who can keep secrets now it was lara who laughed i can and i do she agreed noss pushed her mare closer to laras stallion there is a man who keeps looking at me as if i am his next meal she murmured vartan heard her and looked quickly about him tis liam little girl and i will tell him he is frightening you he is a good fellow with a soft heart who would not harm a flea but he is obviously taken with you the lord of the fiacre chuckled and dropped back a few paces to speak with the redhaired man who gazed so intently at noss when he rejoined lara and her companion he said liam would like to know if you are married young noss tis not a question a man of the fiacre asks casually noss is only thirteen and a half lara said quietly she is a virgin she is too young for any man and she must want the man who weds her one day vartan nodded i will explain all of this to liam but noss he directed his question to her might you allow him to become a friend he will not i swear to you harm a hair of your head noss looked to lara questioningly should i if you wish it i see no reason to deny yourself the company of a fine young man lara replied but he must treat you with respect she warned i will see he does vartan replied and then dropped back again to speak with the redhaired liam who listened and then grinned happily noss blushed when the young man looked to her again lowering her head shyly as liam moved his horse up next to sakari vartan rejoined lara and the two rode ahead a ways how old are you he demanded of her and are you a virgin too i am sixteen and i have experienced the giving and taking of pleasures she told him how old are you and are you experienced she countered i have lived twentyeight years and i am considered experienced by those with whom i share a bed he replied and his blue eyes met her gaze you should know i am half faerie lara told him if your people fear magic then they fear my mothers people you would not be wise to involve yourself with a woman like me i have i am told a destiny to live out my lord vartan perhaps i am that destiny he suggested lara laughed an interesting excuse for attempted seduction she remarked he grinned engagingly at her i think i am falling in love with you lara daughter of swiftsword he told her you are a fraud my lord vartan for we have only just met lara reminded him have you never heard of love at first sight he asked her i do not believe in love my lord lara answered him you do not have to cajole me with sweet words my lord vartan if i remain among the fiacre long enough and we become friends then i will gladly share my body with you lara promised him but be warned that even half faerie women do not give children to those they do not love now he said i am even more curious to learn your story lara daughter of swiftsword he told her tonight she promised we will speak together as the triad blazes overhead they rode the day long stopping only briefly to water their horses lara dug into her pouch and pulled out a piece of faerie bread to share with noss who was all rosy with blushes from her ride with the fiacre liam you are too young to be seduced lara warned noss do not let his sweet words or stolen kisses overcome your innate common sense he is very polite noss half whispered then he is indeed a dangerous man lara cautioned remember that unlike me you can conceive a child in your belly noss do you desire to be a mother at your young age think carefully before you let him insinuate himself between your legs i should have to leave you behind and we do not know these people they are considered savages by those in the city they do not seem very savage to me noss noted nay and i do not believe they are they simply wish to live their lives in a different manner than those who call themselves hetarians lara said i like this freedom that they have noss said softly so do i lara agreed but i want to know more about the outlanders and sheltering with lord vartan for a short while is a good way to learn about them they reached the encampment a small circle of tents in the center of the circle a fire was prepared and ready to light when vartan looked to lara she shook her head in the negative there was no reason to reveal her skills to others right now she dismounted noting that her buttocks felt sorer today than they had yesterday how i would love a hot bath she said to no one in particular tomorrow in my house we will bathe together vartan said coming up next to her come and i will show you and noss to my tent you will sleep there tonight while i sleep outside keeping watch you need not keep watch lara told him i will set verica my staff at the entrance of your tent and he will watch over us the sword has magic the staff has magic vartan noted what else about you is magic lara daughter of swiftsword the horses talk she told him her green eyes dancing with mirth none of this is my doing my lord vartan i swear it these things were given to me by prince kaliq and his people to help keep me safe lara finished almost laughing vartan of the fiacre did laugh at these admissions he had not lied when he told her he was falling in love with her he knew it in his heart from the moment he had laid eyes on her but he also knew this was a strong woman but could the lord of the fiacre follow in the wake of a half faerie woman even if he loved her he did not know the answer to these questions yet they remained the night at the encampment they did not eat faerie bread but rather feasted on broiled rabbits the fiacre clansmen had caught along the way there was real bread and cheese and even wine and after the others had all gone to bed lara and vartan sat by the fire beneath the triad and the four silvery moons of hetar as she told him her tale he was fascinated repelled and angered by her recitation how could your father he began but she hushed him a man must be worthy to be a crusader knight she said i was my fathers only asset his assets should have been his battle skills his honesty and his loyalty vartan said it is not the way of hetar a mans appearance is allimportant my lord lara replied if he could not look the part what good his skills and ethics vartan shrugged indeed was all he could think of to reply he listened again scorning the foolish futility of the forest lords at paying thirty thousand pieces of gold for lara in the belief she could remove the curse placed upon them by maeve and then they came to shunnar to reclaim you with a false document what kind of a magistrate would give them such a parchment one whom they paid well lara replied commerce is the way of hetar if a man does not line his pockets when he can he will die poor vartan shook his head wealth is better i will agree but a mans wealth should be gained honestly not through schemes and trickery a man thought too honest will be considered a fool she replied and yet his words were giving her pause for thought were there other ways than those she had been taught she suspected she would learn them in her journeying lara finally found her bed curling up next to noss who was sleeping soundly but her sleep was a restless one and the dawn came swiftly she found herself dozing in her saddle as they rode along the next day when they stopped to water the horses dasras scolded her softly in his deep voice what is the matter with you mistress i did not sleep well last night she told him and you were late to bed as well dasras murmured is it the fiacre lord who disturbs your rest why would vartan disturb my rest lara muttered you had better drink while you can well be going again very quickly she didnt want to discuss vartan dasras lowered his head and drank it was almost sunset when they reached the village of camdene is there an inn or resting place for travelers lara asked vartan he looked slightly scandalized by her words you are my guest lara daughter of swiftsword he said my mother keeps my house she would be very angry with me if i allowed you and noss to rest your heads elsewhere you have no wife no mate lara inquired bluntly i am responsible for my people and the fiacre are a large clan seven villages belong to us as well as much land i have no time for a wife my younger brother adon took a wife several months ago her name is elin my mother is bera to laras surprise the village looked very prosperous it very much resembled the villages in the midlands but it was better kept to laras eye each cottage sat upon a neat square of land with a garden both before it and behind the street of shops they traversed showed windows filled with goods these people did not appear to be savages at all the men with them dropped away each going to his own home at the far end of the village on a gentle green rise sat a large stone house toward which they rode the house was long and built to fit into the surrounding landscape it would have been difficult to distinguish from a distance it nestled so closely into the land they had but reached the house when the front door opened and a woman stepped forth vartan what did you find he slid from his horse and embraced the woman two little girls all alone on the plain mother i brought them home bera looked lara and noss over with a sharp and critical eye they do not appear particularly helpless to me my son she said who are they and from where do they come she was a big woman like her son with the same light blue eyes that is not the welcome i would expect for lara daughter of swiftsword and her companion noss mother vartan gently chided his parent she is faerie bera said suspiciously aye mistress my mother was indeed faerie lara quickly spoke but she did not raise me i was raised by my father who was a mercenary and my grandmother ina while i have some small magic about me i mean no harm to any if you would not shelter noss and me i will understand and seek your inn bera laughed at laras words and she is proud she looks delicate but she is made of iron i can now see welcome lara daughter of swiftsword and her companion noss come in come in she ushered them into the house leading them into the great hall you handled her well vartan murmured low i can see now why you are not yet wed lara said dryly in low tones i am not wed because until now i had not yet met the woman i wanted for my mate he responded well pleased to see her blush you have arrived just in time for the evening meal bera said we eat simply but there is always plenty immediately servants began entering the hall bearing steaming bowls and platters sit sit bera invited them noticing that her son put lara at his right hand at last she thought was it possible dared she to hope then she restrained herself only time would tell laras eyes widened at beras idea of a simple meal there was fresh broiled salmon with herbs a roasted goose a large joint of beef and a rabbit pie with the flakiest crust she had ever tasted there were bowls of peas onions in cream butter and pepper tiny carrots in butter and honey dusted with nutmeg there was bread a large crock of sweet newly churned butter and a wheel of hard yellow cheese and when she thought the meal was over bowls of peaches and sweet cherries were brought to the table along with crisp little sugar wafers they drank goblets of ale and it was the best lara had ever tasted again she wondered why outlanders were called savages you have another son i am told lara said to bera when the food had finally been cleared away aye but hes wed now and has his own home bera said tis just vartan and his old mother in this great house that cries out for grandchildren vartan laughed be patient mother he said i have only just found the one nosss eyes widened and she looked to lara whose cheeks were again pink a minstrel entered the hall and seating himself by the great fireplace began to sing songs lara had never before heard they were songs of bravery and daring of battles she had never known and warriors whose names were most unfamiliar then he sang of love unrequited but true and a hero who died of a broken heart bera smiled and nodded with the pleasure the music gave her a large greyhound sat with his head in her lap eyes closed and she stroked him gently as the minstrel played his music wrapping them all in a blanket of sweetness when the musician finally ceased his efforts bera arose come she beckoned lara and noss i will show you to your sleeping spaces she led them upstairs to a smaller hall with another fireplace assigning them beds that were tucked into the stone walls on either side of the fire these were the preferred sleeping spaces for honored guests there is water for washing she pointed good night but she did not go to her own chamber she returned downstairs to find her son still by the fire tell me everything she demanded sitting next to him she is the one he said and then he shared with his mother everything lara had told him the previous evening bera nodded when he had finished but if the shadow princes say she has a destiny they do not mean only as the wife of an outlander leader there is more but what more and she must be willing for she has told you herself that faerie women do not give children to those they do not love pleasures she will share with you but you must have her heart vartan if she favors her faerie blood it is unlikely she has a heart to give you but if she favors her human side her heart is there for you to win have i your blessing mother vartan asked bera you do my instincts have never failed me yet my son lara is a good woman and could make you a good wife if she chooses to be but you cannot force her decision woo her and we shall see bera advised liam was taken with her little companion noss but lara says the girl is too young yet vartan told his mother she seems shy and retiring the other bera noted but she could prove formidable if she fell in love as all women can be i am pleased that liam shows signs of wanting to settle down i have feared for your cousin almost as much as i have feared for you i will tell my sister asta in the morning she will be pleased she arose from her place go to bed my son you have traveled long and hard the last few days i am yet concerned you found naught but lara and her friend but perhaps that was the plan of the celestial actuary the plain is vast and yet you found her yes i see the fine hand of the celestial actuary in this she bent and kissed his cheek good night vartan raising his dark head he kissed her back good night mother then turning back to the hearth he stared into the fires dancing flames lara how could this have all happened in such a short time he questioned himself but he knew he was in love never before had he felt this way and his emotions lacked common sense and reason which was what many said love was like she said she had a destiny but was he part of that destiny only time would give him the answer to that query vartan rose and sought out his own bed but his sleep was a restless and troubled one chapter lara slept surprisingly well in vartans house she awoke at first light and washed her face and hands she very much wanted a bath and wondered if such a thing could be obtained she would ask bera perhaps there was a bathhouse in the village as the forest folk had had from her pack she drew a simple gown of pale green with short sleeves a draped neckline and a twisted rope belt of gold silk she brushed her gilt hair out braiding it into a single thick plait and slipped her feet into her sandals then she poked noss wake up sleepyhead she said im going down to the hall hurry and join me noss grumbled something unintelligible the hall was already busy with servants cleaning and sweeping seeing lara bera came forward smiling i thought surely a girl from the city and especially one who had spent her time in the palace of a shadow prince would sleep late come and eat with me vartan will join us shortly he is in the stables speaking with the grooms the two horses you and your companion rode have frightened them and they refuse to care for them now dasras my stallion can be very outspoken on occasion lara explained nosss mare sakari is usually quieter they are a gift from prince kaliq who was my lover did he want you to leave him bera asked softly no but he understood i have a destiny lara replied i feel so foolish saying that but it is what everyone has told me i honestly have no idea of what they mean at all but my mother and grandmother said it and so does ethne my crystal guardian who is your mother bera questioned the beautiful girl yes beautiful and yet lara had not seemed so when she arrived with vartan yesterday now however in that feminine gown with her hair revealed she was a different girl my mother is ilona who with my grandmother maeves death became the new queen of the forest faeries my father is human he was a simple mercenary but now rides as a crusader knight i am sure vartan has told you the rest of my tale he has bera answered i stand in awe of you my child you have suffered much survived it all and seem strong in spite of it i suspect you do have a destiny to fulfill but what has it to do with the outlands lara shook her head as i have said i do not know given a choice between the outlands and the coastal province i chose to come here every instinct i possess insisted but had not vartan and his men found us we would still be wandering out on the plain the celestial actuary always leads us to where we should be bera said good morning vartan strode into his hall and going to his mother kissed her cheek he then turned to lara his blue eyes widening in surprise youre beautiful he exclaimed very beautiful he added a blessing and a curse both lara responded with a small smile did i not seem beautiful to you out on the plain she teased him you seemed a pretty girl he replied slowly and perhaps a bit formidable with that sword on your back you claim to know how to use but nothing more yet this morning in my hall you are so beautiful it hurts my eyes just to look at you lara daughter of swiftsword to her surprise lara felt her cheeks grow warm with his admiration perhaps she said i should wear my leather garments all the time then lest i be held responsible for blinding you my lord vartan and then she smiled at him i understand my horses have frightened your servants i must apologize to you as you have been so kind to us a badtempered stable boy was rough with sakari and dasras objected in the most strenuous terms vartan replied with an answering smile he was quite right too and the lad has been admonished i explained to my servants that your horses were magical and they were to be treated with the utmost care i then asked dasras not to frighten those caring for him again all is well now would you like to ride out with me after the morning meal i am going to spend the next few days visiting my other villages your company would be most welcome lara considered refusing him but then she nodded her agreement i should like that my lord nothing was beckoning her onward today and she was interested to learn if all of his villages were as prosperous and wellmaintained why did the high council of hetar insist on saying that outlanders were uncivilized barbarians was vartan the exception to the rule she needed to know the answers to her many questions and she wasnt going to learn them sitting in vartans hall with his mother noss came sleepily into the hall just as the servants were bringing in the meal as they ate bera engaged her in conversation noss became more lively as the hot food and cold cider helped her to awaken fully and when bera invited her to spend the day with her noss looked eagerly to lara may i she said of course i am riding out with lord vartan but there is no necessity for you to come noss remain with bera you do not enjoy being ahorse as much as i do and we will be traveling on soon enough do you know how to weave bera asked noss yes my mother taught me noss replied and then she and vartans mother entered into a discussion of threads and designs my mother has her eye on noss for my cousin liam vartan said softly the redhaired man who was so taken with her aye the very same vartan said noss is still a girl and i have said it before you must dissuade your mother and your cousin lara told him i will not have noss forced to the marriage bed when she is so very young no one in my care is ever forced to anything vartan replied i am not a savage like those among whom you were raised lara daughter of swiftsword liam simply wants his honorable intentions known so that when the time comes noss will consider him for a husband we will not be with you for more than a day or two lara said where do you go he asked her i dont know she said irritably have you a desire to leave us so quickly he demanded of her no she admitted but that is not the point my lord vartan you have a destiny he said taking her small hand in his large one i know that lara daughter of swiftsword and i will not stand in the way of that destiny but until destiny calls to you again why not remain here where you are safe you are confusing me lara cried low then go and change from this clinging gown that reveals the sweet swell of your breasts and hips put on your leather garments and strap andraste to your back so we may ride out together i have told noss we will be gone two nights and she is not to fear she is safe with my mother why will we be gone two nights lara asked him a bit breathlessly his eyes had all but devoured her when he had spoken to her of her gown i have six villages to visit i ride out once each moon cycle to make certain all is well to hold court if necessary to mediate any disputes vartan explained i am lord of the fiacre and it is my duty to care for and watch over my people i will change lara told him and rising from the table she left the hall i will await you in the stable yard he called after her lara returned to the small hall where she and noss had slept the night before the house seen from afar had not appeared to be more than a single story but on closer inspection lara realized part of its main level was underground and the roof over the great hall peaked one side of the building had a second story entering her chamber she stripped the gown off dressing herself again in her riding garments and pulling on her boots she bound her head in the green cloth and returned downstairs hurrying out into the stable yard where vartan awaited her with dasras good morning lara said rubbing his velvety muzzle dasras snorted and his dark eyes twinkled at her i have explained to sakari that we will be away for a few days but that noss is here vartan said i didnt want her frightened again he boosted lara into the saddle dasras turned his head slightly most thoughtful my lord he said vartan nodded his acknowledgement to the great stallion and mounted his own horse they rode from the stable yard together and out into the morning sunlight villagers greeted them as they passed by and again lara noted camdenes neat prosperity we go first to orlege he said if there are no difficulties there we can move on to leax and scur today are all your villages so comfortable lara asked him how do you live the fiacres prosperity comes from the land vartan explained we have vast herds of cattle each of our clan families has its own way of earning a livelihood how many clan families are there lara asked him eight including the fiacre the tormod and the piaras live in the north they mine deep within the earth for gems and precious metals but they also husband their lands carefully so it is not destroyed the aghy possess great herds of horses the felans wealth comes from sheep the gitta are known for their especial strength but they also farm the blathma are growers of grains and flowers the devyn are the smallest of our clan families they are the poets the bards the musicians of the outlands the minstrel in the hall last night was a devyn where is your governing body located she asked him each clan governs itself he told her what if there is a dispute between clan families she persisted that is what our high council is for my lord have you no high council disputes between the clans are rare lara why would there be the boundaries separating our lands have been set for eons the clans intermarry if they wish we are all prosperous the tormod and piaras supply us with the metals and gems from which we fashion our ornaments we supply them with what they need in return ours is an uncomplicated way of life and we are happy but there must be a system of governance my lord lara insisted how are your clan families ruled who decides upon the rulers each clan has a chieftain he began each village has a headman who is responsible to the chieftain when a chieftain dies or chooses no longer to rule his successor is chosen by the elders of the clan family both men and women generally they pick a chieftain from the same family grouping but their choice is based upon the man who is best suited to take the responsibility of the clan upon his shoulders my uncle was the previous chieftain liams father why did they not choose liam she asked he was younger in years than i was and he did not want to be chieftain my grandfather was the chieftain before liams sire the elders knowing this then chose me i have ruled the fiacre for five years now they had left the village of camdene well behind and now rode at a leisurely pace over the rolling green plain in the sky above them a hawk soared and seeing it lara could not help but wonder if it was kaliq but then she put the thought from her head she was a very long way from the desert of the shadow princes kaliq was her past she cast a surreptitious look at vartan from beneath her lashes as they rode he was a handsome man in a roughhewn sort of way she considered what it might be like to share her body with him and her cheeks grew hot finally ahead of them they saw another grouping of cottages it was not as big a village as camdene but it appeared every bit as prosperous this is orlege he told her i have a dispute to settle here today one of the village men lost his wife and wishes to have another but his neighbors will not match any of their daughters with him i must learn why and then settle the problem vartan was greeted warmly by the villagers of orlege he was led into the headmans house and seated at the small high board in the little hall lara stood quietly at the side of the room observing all the headman scully brought forth the complainant to state his case pol was a man in his sixth decade he had been widowed for a year and wished to take a new wife but he complained to his lord the villagers of orlege would not offer him their marriageable daughters that he might choose he begged his lord to help him find a wife to take care of him in his old age next the headman spoke for the villagers pol was an old man no young girl wanted to be shackled to an old man she wanted a vigorous husband who would give her children that she not be ashamed at the well when she went to draw water and no father in orlege would force his daughter to be pols wife he was an ordinary man with only a small holding he could barely work any longer i must think on this vartan said bring me something to drink he looked to lara and beckoned her to him when she stood by his side he said what would you do in a case like this lara daughter of swiftsword ask the headman if there is a widow who would be willing to have pol for a husband she replied if he has no children to care for him it is unlikely he will have them at his age he does not need a young wife he needs a housekeeper a cook and a companion what could he possibly give a young wife but unhappiness a clever solution lara daughter of swiftsword vartan said he drank from the cup placed by his left hand and then shared the draught with lara how easy she felt with this man lara thought to herself their acquaintance was hardly a lengthy one and yet she felt completely comfortable with vartan of the fiacre when he had finished his drink lara moved discreetly away again to the side of the hall and watched while vartan settled the issue between pol and his fellow villagers first he drew scully the headman aside and spoke with him for several minutes in low tones scully listened nodded and finally smiled the headman signaled another man murmured to him the second man went off into the crowd of villagers speaking with several women finally he led three of them forward both scully and vartan spoke with them and then vartan called for silence pol of orlege you seek a wife to care for you in your old age is this correct yes my lord then choose from among these three fine widows women of good reputation with experience in keeping a husband happy vartan said no father will give you his young daughter no young girl wants a graybeard for a mate in this i concur you seek a companion who will keep you comfortable and wellfed here stand three all eminently suited to your needs and all willing to have you you must choose from among them if you would remarry pol looked the three women over and finally said i choose corliss corliss you are willing vartan asked i am my lord the plump widow said then come forward and be joined vartan said and when the two stood before him he said marriage between a man and a woman is sacred in the eyes of the celestial actuary it is the husbands duty to provide for his mate it is the wifes duty to care for her mate are you pol willing to provide for corliss and treat her with dignity and kindness i am my lord pol said and you corliss will you care for pol treating him with respect and kindness i will my lord the widow replied then it is done and you are considered husband and wife in the eyes of the celestial actuary vartan concluded he drew a coin from his vest pocket and gave it to the bride for luck he told her and kissed her cheek then he shook pols hand thank you my lord the newly wed man said then he and his new bride left the hall chattering busily about where they would now live a grand solution my lord to a difficult problem scully said grinning broadly do not thank me but rather my companion lara daughter of swiftsword vartan said graciously she is my guest at camdene the headman looked at lara admiringly thank you my lady he said it was common sense lara told him but sometimes it takes an outsider to see the path through the woods she smiled at him they left orlege and traveled on to leax vartans next village again lara found it a pretty and thriving place along the path they traveled fat cattle grazed on the grass of the plain there were no problems in leax that required vartans attention and so they moved quickly on to the next village scur which sat by a swiftly flowing brook the headman there evin was concerned because in the last few days the fish that populated the brook were turning up dead he had forbidden anyone to eat the fish but was worried that if the fish were dying the water could be tainted where does the brook flow from vartan asked the north my lord in the mountains of the piaras and tormod clans evin answered i shall send someone north to investigate vartan promised the village has another well yes my lord it comes from an underground spring not connected with the brook evin said continue to keep people from the brook and the fish until we learn what is happening vartan said you will remain the night my lord evin bowed when he offered the invitation we will vartan said jovially this is lara daughter of swiftsword who is my guest at camdene you are from hetar evin said we are all from hetar lara told him they do not think it he replied then they are fools lara remarked and i have little tolerance for fools the sun set quickly as was its habit here in the outlands evins wife invited them to her table clucking and fussing as the meal was brought forth vartan praised her menu and she beamed well pleased shortly after their meal in the headmans little hall the lord of the fiacre and his companion were shown to a bedchamber and bid goodnight lara looked about her there was one bed where will you sleep she asked vartan the bed or the floor we will share the bed he said in matteroffact tones i have not offered my body to you my lord vartan lara said tartly i have not asked for it he replied his tone amused then one of us must sleep upon the floor she told him why the bed is large enough for two he replied evin and his wife have honored us by giving us their chamber to sleep in lara daughter of swiftsword i will take the floor then lara said and pulled a coverlet from the bed he snatched the coverlet back with one hand reaching for her with the other then tossing the coverlet onto the bed he took her chin between his thumb and his forefinger even as he pressed her slender form against his hard one and looked down into her lovely face do you think i lured you out to one of my distant villages to seduce you lara daughter of swiftsword do you believe i am the kind of man who would share my body with you for the first time in a borrowed bed in an underlings house his blue eyes stared fiercely into her green ones if i had desired nothing more than to bed you i could have done it that first day we met out on the plain when we finally decide to share pleasure with each other lara daughter of swiftsword it will be because we both want it despite what your hetarian teachers have taught you i am not a savage bent on rapine and pillage now get into that bed which i fully intend sharing with you the nights grow cold in late summer on the plain then tipping her face up he kissed her a slow hard kiss and releasing her from his grasp shoved her toward the bed meekly lara complied with his request but she couldnt resist saying i just wanted you to understand that i am not some common pleasure woman my lord vartan no he replied wryly you could not be called common and you have a destiny to fulfill then climbing into the bed he turned his back to her arrogant he was the most arrogant man she had ever met lara fumed to herself then she reached down to finger the crystal star that hung between her breasts in hopes of calming her righteous indignation he is very masterful ethne said i like him i have a destiny whatever it is and i shall fulfill it lara returned irritably perhaps he is part of that destiny ethne replied for why else have you been brought to the outlands and why have you been set so neatly into his world do not allow your pride to deter you remember that the shadow prince taught you to be patient and to consider each situation carefully before acting you seem to lose all reason with this man my child is it possible you are falling in love faerie women do not really love lara replied you know that you are but half faerie ethne reminded her there is much that is human about you lara do not deny either part of your heritage and faerie women do fall in love your own mother fell so in love with your father that until she had to she would not take another mate or have another child will she birth a child for thanos ethne and if she does will you leave me lara asked the guardian of the crystal you will have a brother in the next spring lara but i will never leave you i am the guardian your mother gave you and i will always be with you my child now go to sleep the man by your side is already in deep slumber the flame within the crystal flickered and dimmed to the tiniest golden dot lara lay silent but wakeful vartan was sleeping soundly she considered her earlier words and now felt like a fool why had she been so sure he wanted to share pleasure with her he had made no suggestive overtures she realized to her dismay that she did not trust most men her own father had sold her into slavery to advance himself and she had been willing because she saw no other way and she loved him now she wondered if he had ever really loved her or if her striking resemblance to her mother had but added soreness to his broken heart but he had been a good father when he was there she had no complaints he had never beaten her but her experience with the forest lords had been distasteful at best she had become hard lara realized in order to survive their brutality and stupidity yet og had been kind to her and without him she would have never escaped the forest and kaliq had been gentle patient and generous to her he had taught her the meaning of passion but there had to be more to the relationship between a man and a woman than just pleasure for the body was that what this love people talked about was in the morning evins wife fed them a hearty breakfast of porridge eggs and ham with fresh bread she wrapped slices of bread and meat in a cloth giving it to lara for it would be afternoon before they reached doane the next village they rode the long morning stopping briefly to eat again evins wife had not only packed meat and bread but there was cheese and two pears as well they sat in the grass while the horses grazed placidly within their sight vartan asked lara to tell him about her life in the city she was surprised by his curiosity but complied nonetheless he listened with open interest and as she came to the end of her recitation he handed her a piece of pear the juice drizzled down her chin as she bit into it and she was startled when he leaned forward to lick the nectar from her skin you are bold my lord she said quietly i will always think of you as tasting of pears he said as quietly what is it you want of me vartan of the fiacre everything he answered her i cannot give it to you you can and you will one day he replied with an assurance that amazed her we should go she said rising to her feet and whistling for dasras shall i save the other pear for tonight if it pleases you to do so she replied feeling her cheeks grow warm as she pulled herself back into her saddle vartan smiled up into her eyes but said nothing more in midafternoon they reached doane another flourishing village they remained but a brief while as all was in order next they came to calum village where again the lord of the fiacre was greeted warmly and there was no difficulty to be had the last village was rivalen and they reached it just before dark to be greeted by sholeh the headwoman my lord she came forward smiling a bigboned woman with dark red hair that hung to her broad hips welcome i did not know if you would come today we had heard that you were villaging vartan slid from his stallion and wrapped an arm about sholeh each time i see you my girl you are more of an armful he kissed her cheek noisily sholeh laughed heartily away with you i already have enough children to raise and care for my lord her glance swung to lara and who is this dainty beauty you travel with vartan lord of the fiacre she is faerie or i miss my guess she is lara daughter of swiftsword and only half faerie vartan lifted lara from her saddle eventually i will make her my wife eventually i will slice you in two lara snapped sholeh laughed again and flung an arm about laras shoulders i am going to like you lara daughter of swiftsword she said the key to a successful mating is to never let the man have the advantage come in to my hall you are most welcome and she led the way her arm still about lara the hall into which she led them was large with a great peaked roof there was a large stone fireplace burning with fragrant woods they had no sooner been seated at the high board than the servants began to hurry forth with the meal lara was surprised for it was a generous offering there was salmon and trout from the river that flowed through the village of rivalen there was beef ham duck capon and a rabbit stew there were braised lettuces asparagus fresh breads butter and cheeses of several kinds and there was frine and ale both sholeh is a member of my family vartan explained seeing laras surprise we are cousins she is the widow of the former headman here when he died the villagers asked that she be put in charge over them she is a woman lara said puzzled she is a competent woman vartan replied do not women hold positions of responsibility in hetar not really lara said they are always responsible to men for their actions the pleasure mistresses for instance do not own the houses over which they preside those are always owned by a magnate and magnates are always men who manages the pleasure houses then sholeh asked having overheard their conversation the pleasure mistresses do that is their duty lara replied so these women handle all the daily business of the pleasure houses they make certain the girls are happy and healthy they order the proper foods wines and other supplies and yet they are subordinate to those who own the houses and collect the profits eh sholeh concluded i dont think i like that it is our way lara explained are you not responsible for rivalen and its people to lord vartan it is different sholeh said rivalen is mine it is part of the fiacre clan family holdings and vartan its overlord is responsible for our protection in the event of war i give him my allegiance but i am a free woman with my own lands i have never heard of such a thing before lara said i like it much better than the way it is done in the city again she thought that these outlanders were not barbarians in any sense but perhaps the fiacre was different from the other clan families perhaps they were the exception sholehs hall was filled to capacity she was the mother of seven sons and two daughters all of whom lived with her and she had twentytwo grandchildren as well the dogs snuffled beneath the tables hoping for scraps two cats one a large marmalade and the other an equally large black lay headtohead before the fire there was much goodnatured bickering back and forth but no one fought and again she was aware of how very respected vartan was several of sholehs grandsons wrestled barechested for their lords amusement there was an old devyn in the hall who entertained them in a reedy voice but his fingers on his instrument were yet sure and the music was sweeter than any lara had heard before she did not notice until afterward that vartan had taken her hand beneath the table and when she did realize it lara had no inclination to pull away finally the hall began to empty vartan leaned over and murmured a few words to his cousin sholeh arose i will show you to your chamber she said you must share for my house is full to bursting at the seams come and she led them up a narrow flight of stone stairs to a small bedchamber with a large bed good night she told them they slept again backtoback hiptohip in their travel garments without their boots lara did not protest this night for to do so would have been ridiculous she slept quickly and easily not knowing that he at first did not instead he lay simply looking at her he had waited his entire lifetime for this girl until lara had come into his view he had never been in love had never desired a woman for his wife he knew his mother worried that something might happen to him and he would die without heirs liam did not want the lordship of the fiacre he had made that very plain to the elders when his father had died and vartan knew his younger brother adon while ambitious for power was not suited to the responsibility of the lordship and then he had seen lara he wanted her for his wife he wanted children of her body he wanted to be her destiny but she was so intense about it he did not think she would see it his way lara clearly believed although she had never said it in so many words that she had something great to accomplish he sighed well maybe she did but it did not stop him from wanting her when she awoke lara found vartan gone from her side she was surprised but remembering they had reached rivalen just before dark she realized that he was probably conducting the business of his lordship she could see it was late by the angle of the sun coming through the small window she lay quietly her body sore from all the riding she had done since leaving the desert it felt good just to be still suddenly the door to the chamber opened to admit a serving girl carrying a tray my mistress thought you might be awake and the meal is long over in the hall the girl said putting the tray down on the empty side of the bed where is the lord lara asked in the hall holding court lady there is a shameful case to be heard the daughter of the blacksmith had her virginity taken from her by force the villain is a man she refused when she chose another now she is ruined and it is unlikely her chosen will have her but she will not have the villain and has wept for days over it the servant girl gossiped has the lord ruled yet lara asked the girl nay the case has not even begun for the girl will not stop weeping and the lord will not begin the case until she does the servant said she is a foolish creature tell the lord i will be down to join him quickly lara said snatching up a small loaf from the tray and tearing it into pieces as the serving girl hurried out there was butter in a small crock and lara scooped some out with her thumb and spread it on the bread there was a hardboiled egg and a mug of cider she ate it all then washed herself in the basin of water that had been left on the wide stone sill of the chambers narrow window she rebraided her hair pulled on her boots and went downstairs the hall was crowded with probably every inhabitant of rivalen lara worked her way to the side of the hall up near the high board where vartan and sholeh were seated her gaze took in the people just below the board an older man and woman a sobbing girl two younger men one in chains this hearing must begin for my journey home is a long one vartan finally said impatiently can you not stop your daughters weeping my lord i apologize but she is devastated by what has happened look at her eyes swollen with her grief the victims father said we must begin sholeh snapped be silent kele the girl howled louder to everyones irritation lara moved from her place going to kele and put an arm about her i know your grief for i was used once as you were she said crying will solve nothing now is the time for vengeance and only the lord can give it to you kele but he will go if you cannot regain control of yourself will you allow your attacker to remain unpunished the girls tears began to abate who are you she asked i am lara daughter of swiftsword the crusader knight and ilona queen of the forest faeries the men who robbed me of my virginity were forest lords cruel and brutal men who held me captive for months but i escaped them and the taint of their actions to pursue my greater destiny now you have the opportunity to change your destiny you can pine away over something that was not your fault or you can take your revenge on the man who stole what was not his to take the lord is here to help you but you must stop weeping the shame is not yours kele choose what you will do but choose now will you stay with me until it is over kele asked i will lara answered her and wiped the tears from the girls face with the heel of her palm tell the lord what you want kele stood straight looking up at vartan and said i ask for your justice my lord vartan i have been terribly wronged tell me vartan said in a kindly voice kele drew a long deep breath to calm her beating heart and then she began i had two suitors my lord my father asked which i preferred and i chose key we have known each other our whole lives and spoken often in secret of marriage so my father agreed and the betrothal was celebrated but lonn my other suitor would not accept it he followed me wherever i would go harassing me to change my mind finally i told him by the village well that i would not have him ever even if i had to die an old maid then key will not have you either he told me there were witnesses to it my lord a murmur arose from the spectators and vartan said you will have your chance to tell me he promised them go on now kele what happened next the next day my cousin and i went to pick berries on the hillside lonn came upon us and told my cousin to leave he threatened her with his dagger and she fled back to the village to raise the alarm by the time my father came it was too late the girl said it is not enough kele i need to know exactly what lonn did vartan said i am sorry but the accusation must come directly from you his victim the young girl shuddered be brave lara said her arm tightening about kele he ripped my gown half off kele began and tears began slipping down her face again but she continued bravely on he threw me to the ground he fell upon me forcing my legs apart with his knee he pushed his manroot into me and though i screamed and begged him not to do it he raped me my lord and when he did he ruined my chances for marriage with key if she wants a husband ill have her lonn said boldly a grin upon his face kele turned and looked directly at him i would die first she said you have ruined my life but i would die before i took you as my husband thank you vartan said you have been a brave lass sit now and i will hear from the others involved in this matter keles parents spoke yes key and lonn had sought kele for a wife they did not like lonn but they left the decision to their daughter who chose wisely since the horrific incident they had kept their daughter confined seeing no one the next witnesses were those women who had been at the village well when lonn had been told in no uncertain terms by kele that she would not have him you are certain she was firm in her intent sholeh asked she was not flirting with him as young girls will do no lady the witness an older woman said she could not have made it any plainer but he kept harassing her finally a group of us chased him away for poor kele was frightened and trembling who knew that he would violate the poor lass she shook a fist at lonn curse you no decent woman will have you now may your line die out forever you are a monster when did the violation occur vartan asked almost a month ago my lord keles mother said has the lass had her flow since he continued the mother nodded blushing it is possible then that lonn has done no permanent damage vartan said where is the betrothed here my lord a pleasantfaced young man stepped forward do you wish to sever the betrothal key of rivalen vartan asked no but they have not let me see her since it happened my lord i have not been able to comfort her or tell her that i love her no matter he said in anguished tones we are to be wed at the harvest our cottage stands ready and waiting for us he turned to the girl i love you kele tell me you yet love me oh key i love you too but my parents said you would not have me now and that i had brought this shame upon myself by going berrying with my cousin instead of within a group of girls where i would have been safe they said i was foolish and had doomed myself to a lifetime of misery kele sobbed key went to the girls side and raising her up enfolded her in his arms he glared at her parents you told her these things without consulting with me i love kele and i intend wedding her at the harvest as we have been planning for months all i want is justice from the lord you will not keep my betrothed wife from me again then it is settled but for the matter of punishment for lonn vartan said he looked at the accused we have heard from everyone in this matter but you what have you to say for yourself lonn of rivalen i wanted her he replied and when she shamed me before the village i had my revenge on her he leered at the lovers do you want to know how she screamed when i thrust into her key and struggled it was glorious you do not deny your guilt then vartan said a look of revulsion on his face no will you repent of your crime and make amends to kele vartan asked no why should i the little bitch got what she deserved lara felt andraste quivering within its scabbard as it lay across her back then i condemn you to death for your crime vartan said the sentence will be carried out immediately let me lara cried out stepping forward a gasp arose from those in the hall but a small smile flitted across vartans face he had meant to carry out the sentence himself but she had said she was capable of killing now he would see if she merely boasted or spoke truth very well lara daughter of swiftsword he is yours and you will execute the sentence take him outside and make him dig his grave in the hillside first he stood do you think she can do it sholeh asked rising from her seat she says she has killed before and if she fails i am here come cousin and let us see this matter through he stepped down from the dais saying to kele and key you must witness the execution my young lovers for only then will you be free of this tragedy and able to move on with your lives sholehs hall emptied as the villagers lonn tightly in their grasp moved toward the hillside just beyond the village once there the condemned man had his hands unshackled but not his ankles he was given a spade and began to dig he did so singing bawdy songs and laughing almost maniacally as he dug finally the grave was done he looked at lara and licked his lips leeringly i should like to have you beneath me just once faerie girl he said and he rubbed his crotch with a dirty hand ill bet youd scream and struggle nicely for me lara eyes grew cold she slipped andraste from its scabbard and the blade hummed quite audibly she looked at the condemned man and a small smile touched her lips nay tis you who will scream and struggle for me she told him then she looked to vartan my lord put him on his knees the lord said dispassionately and at that moment lonn felt icy fear pour over him certain the faerie girl had bewitched him else he would never be afraid but he was he shrieked like a maiden and struggled against his captors as they forced him to his knees but he would not bow his head lara raised her sword and he watched in disbelief as the blade swung toward him he heard the sword singing even as it began to slice his head from his shoulders i am andraste and i drink the blood of evil men lonns severed head fell into the newly dug grave there was a long deep silence and then the villagers cheered loudly as lara wiped his blood from her sword on the slain mans tunic and sheathed it neatly in its scabbard she looked to vartan questioningly he nodded his approval then with the tip of his boot he kicked lonns body into the grave to join his head whatever worldly goods he had will be given to kele in reparation the lord said now i must leave you for the ride back to camdene is a long one he turned to sholeh give the betrothed pair this from me on their wedding day he told her slipping a gold coin into her hand did the monster have kin none sholeh said good none to seek vengeance or cause difficulty over this unfortunate incident vartan said you were serious last night when you said you meant to marry her sholeh asked him very serious vartan answered listen to me cousin the headwoman said she does have a destiny and not an ordinary one i saw it today in my hall when she calmed kele i saw it when she offered to be lonns executioner and then slew him without fear or remorse i do not know why she has come to the outlands but if she will wed you remember that even her marriage a love for you or the children she gives you will not prevent her from following her destiny when she knows the time is right you must understand that or she will break your heart vartan sholeh warned him you are the first man i loved and it would pain me to see you harmed in any way cousin he nodded i know what you say to me is truth sholeh but i too have a destiny and she is already mounted upon her stallion the horse talks by the way as does the staff she carried he chuckled at his cousins surprised look a horse and a staff that talk and a sword that sings sholeh shook her head there is much magic about lara has she bewitched you then there is no faerie magic in my feelings cousin i saw her and my heart was gone from me he explained she was raised in the city by her all too human father she did not know her mother until recently she has little practical magic about her but i believe she is blest by the faerie kingdom and protected by the magic of the shadow prince who sheltered her educated her and saw she had these weapons sholeh shook her head all these years you have been sought after by our most eligible women but none caught your heartstrings until this faerie girl came into your view i have to believe it is your fate vartan may the celestial actuary help you she kissed his rough cheek thank you for your judgment in this dreadful matter i will speak with keles parents who are to my mind a pair of fools but the lovers are at last reunited and the villain dispatched ride safely cousin he kissed her back and then turning mounted his own horse we have a long ride ahead of us lara daughter of swiftsword he said we will probably not reach camdene until after dark but there will be at least one moon to guide us i overstepped my bounds lara said as they rode off when i came forward so boldly to offer you my services but the man was despicable my lord i ask your pardon how many have you killed before lonn he asked her just one durga the head forester who was foolish enough to follow me to shunnar the palace of prince kaliq my protector and friend i slew him without mercy for he had shown me none lara said vartan nodded it is andraste lara said the sword makes me brave and it will not kill the just i believe but only the evildoers lothair the shadow prince made it and gave it to me verica my staff is my mothers gift and dasras is kaliqs gift to me they are all i need to meet my destiny my lord vartan when i return with you to camdene i must make my plans to leave you i do not believe it is time for you to leave me yet lara daughter of swiftsword he told her but we will speak on it tomorrow if you like he must not make her feel that he was constraining her but he knew in his heart that he could not let her go yes she agreed i would value your advice for i think you wise my lord and i am just beginning to learn this business of living lara told him and together they returned to camdene chapter if you have no destination in mind bera said then why leave us now since the day your father proposed selling you to finance his ambitions you have always known when to go and where but now you admit you do not know the outlands lara daughter of swiftsword can be a dangerous place for those unfamiliar with it good fortune has put you in our keeping remain with us until you know where it is you must go and why it is so tempting lara conceded slowly with a sigh she had to admit she felt very comfortable here in vartans hall and she liked the people of the fiacre who were industrious and filled with humor and the joy of living where was she going and why the urge to travel to seek had suddenly left her she fingered her crystal but ethne was silent it is my decision to make lara reflected mine alone the summer is at an end autumn will soon come and then winter winter is a bad time not to have a safe place especially here on the plains bera continued say you will stay and then come the spring you will see how you feel noss would like to remain wouldnt you my child noss nodded with a small smile in the few days lara had been away with vartan something had changed noss i love it here noss said i have never felt more at home anywhere in my life lara then i suppose it is settled lara answered her young companion with a smile we will remain until i am called to take the road to my destiny once again bera chuckled this is good she said i have always wanted daughters the autumn was a busy time for the fiacre the last of the grain was harvested gleaned and stored in stone granaries food animals were slaughtered butchered and hung in a stone building where once weekly a butcher would carve portions for each family in camdene the men hunted deer for venison and geese and ducks which were hung in each houses larder the last of the vegetables were taken from the gardens and stored in a cold cellar repairs were made to homes barns and other buildings the plains turned shades of gold and brown the leaves on the trees turned red purple orange and gold they had been with the fiacre all summer the days were growing shorter with each passing sunrise twilight seemed to come sooner and then the cool nights vartans hall was a place of warmth and friendliness and lara continued to see how respected and genuinely loved the leader of the fiacre was she was beginning to look at him with new eyes he was not a sophisticated man but neither was he a simple one unlike the forest lords he accepted his responsibilities as an honorable duty and not a privilege she quickly learned he enjoyed teasing those of whom he was particularly fond and he was working very hard at drawing her into the society of the fiacre especially his own family each evening they would play a game called herder using a wooden board and beautifully carved figures two herders and a group of cattle the object of the game was to gather as many cattle as one could when all the cattle on the board were herded into a players designated corner the herder with the most beasts was declared the winner at first lara did not understand the strategy of the game and vartan while explaining how to play also taunted her unmercifully but she swiftly realized his purpose was to discommode her comprehending his design she began to tease him back even as she became quite skilled at the game itself one evening vartan realized his pupil had become a very good player indeed she said i shall trounce you quite severely tonight my cocky lord and she captured the bull in his herd you cheated he exclaimed surprised i dont have to cheat with you lara mocked him now that i have deciphered your game plan you are easy to beat you always play the same way vartan you have no skill at intrigue i fear and she laughed as she took one of his cows there are half a dozen ways to play this game but you practice only one but one way is enough if you can win he said as he took the last cow on the board and then he grinned at her you each have the same number of beasts bera declared as she counted but i think lara must be proclaimed the winner for she possesses the bulls from both herds what will you have for your forfeit my clever girl i had not thought of it lara said slowly i should have had a kiss vartan chuckled then so shall i lara decided boldly and standing she leaned across the game board to give him a brief kiss but vartan quickly captured the back of her head with his hand holding the girl firmly in his embrace until lara was able to pull free sputtering with outrage it will soon be time for the gathering bera announced attempting to defuse the situation what is that lara responded still glaring at her antagonist she wanted to strike out at him for publicly discommoding her in such a fashion but she knew that bera was trying to keep the peace there is a holy place out on the plain two days journey from camdene each year after the harvest as many as can come from each of the clan families gather together to celebrate the years end and welcome in the new year each clan is always represented by someone it is the only time we come together as a single entity bera explained the rest of the year we keep to our own boundaries and to our own families there is a meeting held between clan leaders then as well and a fair where we barter goods and livestock the blathma bring apples and pears the felan sheep the aghy horses and of course we bring cattle to trade or sell the gitta grow vegetables we do not but that we enjoy and of course the piaras and the tormod come with their beautiful jewelry the devyn will be there to entertain us all and some bargain for homes for the winter its a lovely time and then we all return home to await the winter months bera concluded and matches are arranged at that time noss interjected excitedly you are too young to be married lara said i am not noss cried i am almost fourteen and liam wants me for his wife lara was silent for a long moment and then sighing she said this is what you really want you realize if you wed him you will have his mother in the house aye it is noss replied i am grateful to you that your sacrifice saved me from the forest lords and i was content to leave shunnar with you and travel into the outlands but my destiny is here and with liam i will be fourteen in spring and i want to marry then i am a simple girl there is no greatness in me as there is in you lara then you shall marry noss lara replied to her friend it is a very good match for a poor mercenarys daughter from the city i love him noss declared passionately lara shrugged she still believed there was no such thing as love but let noss have her sweet dreams i am glad she said with a smile he will get a good wife in you noss bera reached out to take laras hand in hers their eyes met and the older woman nodded you are doing the right thing she said softly i hope so lara replied she seems so young to me that is because your life since leaving the city has been the more difficult one you had little choice but to leave your girlhood behind the forest lords refusal to have noss saved her the shadow princes freed her and protected her your kindness and friendship have been her salvation now she is where she belongs at last my nephew is besotted with her and will be a good husband it seems so simple for her lara said almost sadly there is love for you if you would but have it bera said pointedly lara smiled a small rueful smile what of my destiny she replied none of us can escape our destiny bera said wisely it will find you when the time is right lara would you not be happy until then she arose from her place i am going to bed now my bones long for the comfort of my featherbed good night ill come with you noss spoke up she stood and bending kissed laras cheek i know you love me and want me safe the girl said i am safe with liam thank you for your permission to wed him you are the sister i never had and i am glad for it go along lara said almost impatiently and yes we are now sisters arent we i am glad for it too thinking herself alone now lara stared into the flames she had lost og who preferred to remain in the desert tending to the horses belonging to the shadow princes she would soon lose noss who was in love and wanted to be a wife was she meant to continue her journey alone it was a frightening thought but for now at least she would remain at camdene when the spring came the urge to move on would certainly rise in her again but now the days grew shorter the nights longer the air colder it was only natural that she wanted to bide awhile with the fiacre she smiled to herself she was like a beast seeking a warm nest and going to ground for the winter i have never before seen that particular smile vartan said as he came to sit by her side what are you thinking he put an arm about her waist drawing her closer i was thinking how like a rabbit or a fox i am looking for a winter refuge she told him and he laughed so you consider my hall a winter refuge do you he teased her well it is lara replied i can think of none better i can he said quietly where she asked him my bed he responded she stiffened briefly but then she relaxed against him you want to take pleasure with me she said i want you for my wife he answered her and when my destiny calls to me again vartan then what will you let me go or will you exercise your rights as my lord and master keeping me forcibly by your side she turned to look up into his attractive face her hand caressed his cheek if you desire my body my lord then have it i am ready to share it with you but ask no more of me for i cannot give it to you i must follow my destiny wherever it may lead me please try to understand that i do he replied i understand far better than you think lara for you are my destiny you are she for whom i have waited my entire life the woman i would have ride by my side in the hard days that are coming hard days lara asked what do you mean the devyn are more than poets and minstrels they carry news and messages between the clan territories while the fiacre have been involved in the harvest and planning for the gathering there have been devyn in our hall they tell me that hetar has begun to encroach upon the lands belonging to the piaras and the tormod those lands are rich in precious metals and gems and the hetarians have grown greedy they have enslaved many to toil in the mines and open new ones they have sent their crusader knights to steal these lands and to keep order over the oppressed when my fellow chieftains meet at the gathering we must decide how to respond to this subtle act of war hetar cannot be allowed to steal what is not theirs there has been no war between hetar and the outlanders for centuries lara said slowly what can have made them do this he shrugged hetar has always considered itself a perfect world far superior to those of us in the outlands their society is carefully set and while advancement is possible it is only so by following certain rules as your own father did hetar has laws that are legal but not necessarily just hetar is ruled by pride and by the desire for profit and more profit for the first time in the history of the outlands we will have to band together to stop this invasion or none of us will be safe and our clans our ways will not survive and the magical beings who share our world will have to become involved they will not be able to help themselves for there is power involved here as well as wealth lara felt a shiver run down her spine then she said come my lord and let me soothe you for i can see that your concerns are very great let me come into your bed and give you pleasure that you may forget these difficulties if for only a short while you will share your body with me because i have told you of the threat to our very way of being he laughed there is still much sweetness in you lara for all you have endured he bent and kissed her mouth slowly feeling her lips soften beneath his before we taste pleasure together i must tell you that i have entrapped you my beautiful lara you say you will not be my wife for you fear i will not allow you to follow your destiny but when your destiny calls i will not prevent you from heeding that call and i will probably ride by your side if i can for i love you but you are already my wife under the few laws that the fiacre have for you have lain with me two nights and there are witnesses to it my cousin sholeh and the headman evin and his wife that is not fair she cried i will not be bound to any man but one of my own choosing i refuse to accept such a thing my lord it is not worthy of you besides all we did was sleep next to one another there was no pleasure taken nor given my mother said you would be angry but what else was i to do you are the most difficult woman i have ever encountered lara men have used you cruelly used you as they would have used a breeding animal and you have accepted it yet i would honor you as my mate and you scorn me his blue eyes were troubled lara stood abruptly when i escaped the forest lords i swore i would never again be used by any man at shunnar prince kaliq educated me to make my own decisions one night in his hall i willingly shared myself with all of his fellow princes and it was glorious for i wanted it i belong to no one but to me vartan if you would be my husband my mate then you must acknowledge that not just with words but by your deeds i do not know if you can do that for all your scorn of hetarians you are much like them in your need for order and discipline i am in love with you lara whatever i must do i will do but say you will accept your place by my side as my wife he said she shrugged i wish i could feel love for you my lord she told him sadly you will one day he told her i promise you that you cannot know that lara replied you wish it but you cannot be certain that what you say will come into being vartan i do not want to hurt you would you shame me before my people he asked quietly i have only resorted to trickery out of my desperation you could have had my body if you had but asked lara responded i am not averse to sharing pleasure with you but i must be free a wife cannot be free vartan she put her hand on his arm in a gesture of comfort your body tempts me larai would be a liar if i denied it but it is your heart i want you say faerie women have no hearts yet you are but half faerie and as you have told me yourself your mother cared so much for your human father that she would not wed again until your grandmother faded away and as queen she needed to sire a faerie heir i think you do have a heart but you are fearful of giving it because you do not want to be hurt i will never hurt you my love never and if the time comes that you feel compelled to leave me i will release you though it breaks my own very human heart to do so accept me as your mate lara and know that i truly love you something within her softened it was a feeling such as she had never before experienced was it possible she could actually care for this man and could she trust him to keep his word she realized her hand still rested on his arm she could feel the muscle beneath his shirt they were strong arms in a moment of very human weakness she realized they were arms in which she could hide and sometimes even she needed a safe place with a sigh she looked up into his anxious blue eyes very well then i will accept my place by your side as long as you understand that if i say i must go then i must lara replied he picked her up and swung her about his big hands meeting as they spanned her tiny waist i adore you he told her grinning happily put me down you great fool it has been months since i have known the pleasure of a manroot inside me and i long for it vartan my lord he set her upon her feet again and taking her face between his hands began to kiss her his mouth was hot and eager his kisses touched her mouth her eyelids her face and lara stood quietly enjoying them he sat down in his big chair by the fire loosening his garments to reveal his manroot she looked at it admiringly easing her gown off to stand naked before him his eyes devoured her and she smiled at him her hand reached out to touch him he was hard and his skin warm i have never seen a manroot so large lara said stroking the pillar of flesh the forest lords were big men but not like this and your shadow princes he was reaching out for her skilled and wellmade but not like you lara admitted she bent and kissed the ruby head of it then climbed onto his lap reaching out he began to fondle her breasts while she caressed his manhood he groaned as her delicate hands reached beneath him to fondle his seed sac she gasped when he pinched her nipples leaning forward to lick at the soft twin mounds he unplaited her thick gilt hair and spread it about them like a curtain then lifting her he slowly slowly impaled her upon his manroot until he was fully sheathed lara sighed deeply as their two bodies were joined so neatly and easily she wrapped her slender arms about his neck whispering to him you fit me perfectly my lord more perfectly than any other because our bodies were created for each other he told her then he said you must ride me now lara like the great horsewoman i know you to be ride me and give us both the joy we know awaits us she began slowly rising and falling until he was moaning with delight then she moved faster and faster until finally he cried out and she felt his love juices flooding her to her surprise however he remained hard and when he had recovered slightly he stood still buried deep inside her lara clung to him as he walked across the hall to the high board laying her upon the great rectangle of the table he took the dominant position and she trembled with excitement he moved as she had slowly and deliberately at first and then more quickly until they were both lost in a whitehot passion that when it peaked left them both weak and exhausted as his juices flooded her a second time there were no words to be said he gathered her up in his arms and carried her to his chamber behind the hall it was there lara awoke several hours later to find herself in his embrace when she attempted to slip from his arms he growled a sleepy no and his arms tightened about her i must go she whispered nay we will share the lords chamber from now on noss will bring your possessions in the morning i must clean the high board before anyone finds our juices all over it she said the servants will clean it he said go back to sleep lara my love obediently she closed her eyes her fingers going to her crystal as she began to grow sleepy again she was vartans mate his wife yet he had promised he would not stop her from following her destiny she knew he meant what he said when he said it but the proof would come when that moment arrived in the meantime he was a good man and a passionate loverthe coming winter would not prove dull but first there was the gathering to attend she was concerned by the news he had shared with her this evening she suspected that bera did not know it yet and was bera aware of the union between her son and lara still more questions she awoke with his lips on hers his big body covering her as he entered her slowly vartan she chided him amused by his great lust for her i cannot resist you he admitted i could spend the next six months in this bed with you my lara she squeezed his manroot as it filled her and he cried out she licked his ear her tongue tracing the whorl of flesh pushing into the cavity to tickle him murmuring to him what she thought of his masculine attributes and what she wanted him to do to her you are a wicked faerie wench he told her as she wrapped her legs about him i will pleasure you more than you have ever been pleasured before lara my love actions she said softly speak louder than words my lord vartan in reply he pulled her two arms above her head holding her wrists firmly in one hand then he began a slow deep deliberate thrusting again and again and yet again he pushed into her body with a leisurely measured cadence shortly laras green eyes widened with surprise as she found herself responding to him strongly she had known great pleasure with her shadow prince but it had been an elegant pleasure the feelings she now felt were wild and uncontrollable she gasped in shock for she had never imagined passion could go so deep or be so fierce she struggled against him but he gently mastered her forcing her to his will yet loving her so sweetly that she found herself weeping he kissed and licked the salty tears from her face let go lara my love trust me enough to let go and when she did his great desire for her burst forth leaving them both breathless and weak satisfied he drew her into his arms kissing her face his big hand smoothing her hair we are fated to love each other lara daughter of swiftsword he told her quietly i am yours and you are mine she burrowed deeper into his arms what had just happened to her she could not believe that she had released herself to him so freely it was all very confusing and as her tears subsided she found herself falling asleep once again he smiled to himself his hand still stroking her soft gilt hair in all his life he had never felt so happy he would need her in the days ahead this difficulty with the piaras and the tormod clans would not be easily solved and he worried about the other clan families as well throughout the centuries past they had found that keeping to themselves for most of the year was what kept them from fighting among one another but if hetar had been bold enough to invade the piaras and tormod territories what was to prevent them from moving deeper into the outlands it was very troubling when lara awoke again vartan had left her side and noss was bustling about the chamber putting her few possessions away in a small painted trunk good morning lara said smiling at her young friend tis more like afternoon noss grinned back i had heard he was a mighty lover he has obviously exhausted you you know not of what you speak lara replied irritated they say you are his wife noss answered not in the least intimidated are you and how did that happen they have some law or other that says if you spend two nights with a man you are his wife lara said while we were visiting his villages we had no choice but to share a bed but that is all we did and we never even got out of our clothing until last night noss giggled holding up laras gown which she had retrieved from the floor of the hall there are hard times coming to the outlands lara responded i shared pleasures with him to soothe him then he told me of this law of theirs but i shall go when my destiny calls me again noss and vartan knows it but you are his wife noss repeated i suppose i am even if i was ignorant of these laws of the fiacre lara agreed i dont know why our people call them lawless barbarians perhaps because outlanders are not like hetarians noss suggested lara nodded then she said i need a bath i stink of horse of man and of womans lustful nature have you discovered if they have a bathhouse no noss said then how do they keep clean lara demanded they bathe in their houses in small round tubs noss replied then have a tub brought and hot water too lara commanded it has been too many days since i bathed my skin is beginning to itch she climbed from her bed heedless of her nudity and stretched where is vartan he has been out since just after sunrise overseeing the last of the winter preparations we leave for the gathering in the morning bera says ill go get your tub but cover yourself for i doubt your husband wants his serving men seeing you in all your halfling glory noss told lara halfling what is a halfling lara asked half one thing half another bera says you are a halfling half faerie half hetarian she is very happy you are vartans wife she says you are strong where he is weak she says you will be the making of him for she has always thought he could be a great leader of the fiacre they are the largest of the clan families you know then turning noss hurried from the bedchamber to fetch a tub for lara lara looked about for something to cover her nakedness opening the little painted trunk where she had seen noss store her things she drew out a chemise and slipped it on noss was just full of information lara mused comfortable in safety she had become friendly and full of gossip beraor was it liamhad worked a magic of her own on the girl love it was said changed people if she believed in love she might believe that was true the tub was brought and lara was amused by its small size well it was all they had and she was grateful to be able to bathe herself when the tub was filled lara disrobed again washing first her body and then her long hair noss had brought her a small hard cake of soap with a faint fragrance of wildflowers it lathered well and lara was grateful for it wrapping herself in the drying cloth she began to towel her golden hair she sought for her hairbrush smiling as she pulled kaliqs gift from the trunk it was beautiful the prince had obviously kept her simple pearwood brush and replaced it with this gold one with fine boars bristles the top of the brush bore a single heart and twining around it and down its handle was a vine of delicate flowers there were several leaded windows set together in the chamber wall with a window seat built in beneath them lara sat before one of the open windows and began to brush out her long hair as it dried in the gentle breeze of the sunny autumn afternoon the silken stuff flew like a banner from the window riding in from the fields vartan could see it and felt a surge of contentment well up within him his wife he thought happily his wife was awaiting him her hair dry lara dressed herself in one of her two simple gowns pale green to match her eyes then she went out into the hall as vartan entered it he immediately enfolded her in his embrace and kissed her mouth tenderly lara smiled up at him she could not help it and she realized that she was happy for the first time in a very long while not relieved at escaping the forest lords or protected by kaliq but deeply happy was this what love was she wondered you are beautiful and you smell delicious he said still holding her of course i am beautiful she agreed looking up into his face and i have finally had a bath but your tub is so tiny it is no bigger than the one i shared with my stepmother back in the quarter i shall have a larger one made for you he promised make it big enough for two she suggested softly his slow smile reached all the way to his eyes a hand caressed her buttocks suggestively we leave tomorrow for the gathering he told her so noss has told me lara returned i fear i shall shame you vartan for i have but two gowns and they are more suited to the palace of the shadow princes than to the outlands on an autumn day i am sorry would you prefer i remain behind wife have you not looked in your trunk he asked her the little painted one aye i saw noss storing my things there lara said the large one lara he replied that is not yours she was surprised nay it is yours and it is filled with the garments of a chieftains wife he said my mother and her women sewed quite diligently while we were away in the villages and i have this for you he pulled a wide heavy gold ring from his tunic and pushed it onto the third finger of her left hand the finger that connected directly to her heart i want everyone at the gathering to know you are my mate lara daughter of swiftsword lara looked at the ring in surprise it was red gold a very rare ore and it was simplicity itself a plain band that when she looked at it brought tears to her eyes the meal is served beras voice broke into the moment vartan took her hand in his and raising it to his lips kissed it tenderly then he led her to the high board where bera was already seated and awaiting them she smiled at them both her own eyes misty are you content with this then lara daughter of swiftsword she asked it would appear i have no choice for the deed is done is it not lara asked vartans mother it is bera agreed amiably and poured frine into their goblets if he is the man his father was you will not be unhappy lara actually blushed she suspected that the son surpassed the father for she had never known the kind of ecstasy that she had shared with vartan what happened to your husband she asked the older woman he was trampled when a bolt of lightning stampeded a small herd of cattle he was overseeing bera replied vartan was ten when it happened and adon two my younger son does not remember his father mores the pity when shall i meet your brother my lord lara asked her husband he and his wife live down in the village vartan said tomorrow before we begin the trek to the gathering they will come for we travel as a family the hall was full that night with vartans men and as the meal concluded he arose from his place drawing lara up with him expectant faces turned to look toward the high board and the room grew very quiet this is my bride vartan told them this lady lara some of you were with me when we found her wandering lost upon the plain she has accompanied me to the villages and shown me her wisdom in resolving an unhappy situation at rivalen if you honor me you will pledge your loyalty to her now immediately the men in the hall arose and cried all hail lara daughter of swiftsword wife to vartan lord of the fiacre and then they came forward one by one to kneel before her as she stood before the high board where vartan had led her each man put his hands into her small ones and pledged his loyalty lara thanked each man by the name her husband whispered into her ear she was surprised by his actions in the back of her mind had lingered the thought that perhaps he was saying she was his wife so he might cajole her into sharing her body with him but now with each loyalty pledged to her she saw that he had not been playing a game with her lara daughter of swiftsword was truly wife to vartan of the fiacre but what of her destiny she sensed that there was something yet unfinished yet it would seem her destiny was here with the fiacre for now had not ethne approved of her actions so far never had her guardian argued against what had happened for now all was as it should be but what of the future when the last of the men had pledged to her vartan led her back to the high board you have done well he praised her softly despite your youth you are a woman of stature in the city i would have had a great bridal celebration she teased him you have shared a bed with me and called it a wedding party it is our way he told her even pol and corliss were joined formally in the presence of their fellow villagers lara said but under our laws a man and woman who share a bed for two nights are husband and wife he reminded her did you plan to wed me she asked him aye i did but i did not choose to spend months bringing you around my love so i took advantage of fiacre law you do not seem too angry with me over it he gave her a winning grin lara was forced to laugh vartan was a very charming man i have not decided yet if i am angry at you or not she told him i hunger for you again my love he murmured i want you naked and crying out with your pleasure beneath me i want to fill you full with my passion he dropped a kiss on her shoulder tell me you want that too vartan pleaded with her yes lara heard herself say without hesitation she arose and giving both noss and bera a kiss upon their cheek she left the high board without another word vartan remained for several more minutes speaking with his captains about the trek that would begin tomorrow then he too retreated to the chamber behind the hall bera arose and beckoned noss to come along to bed the girl obeyed smiling shyly at liam as they passed which caused the big man to develop a foolish look upon his face as he stared after noss in the morning they departed for the gathering and as they traveled along the way they were joined by members of each village not all the fiacre came to the gathering it was necessary to leave men behind to defend the villages and new mothers and the elderly frequently remained behind as well vartans younger brother adon and his wife elin had come to the hall that morning and pledged their loyalty to lara although she sensed it was done out of duty and nothing else adon was a handsome young man with auburn hair and deeper blue eyes than his sibling his wife elin was a tall thin girl with a look of discontent about her she stared at lara boldly finally asking they say you are faerie did you bewitch him adon had the grace to look embarrassed by his wifes query but he did not scold her over it i am half faerie lara replied and it was vartan who bewitched me oh elins hair was a dirty blond and she looked enviously at laras beautiful tresses how do you get your hair that color i was born with it my faerie mother has hair this color lara told her oh elin said no more taking his brother aside adon said is it possible you are enchanted vartan perhaps the faerie should be killed to protect you to protect the fiacre i am not ensorcelled brother and it was i who pursued lara let there be no talk of murder faerie or otherwise i should not like to have to kill you it would distress our good mother he clapped the younger man on the back be glad for me adon i am happy really truly happy as lara stood by her stallion she murmured in dasrass ear no talking you will frighten many if you do we will speak together when i think it prudent i have warned noss to caution sakari as well the stallion nodded his head did they tell you i am now wed to the lord he tricked me but i am content for now and you will have a warm barn for the winter lara rubbed the animals muzzle good dasras said softly that no one else hear him lara chuckled and mounted the horse they rode a full two days and in late afternoon of the second day arrived at the gathering place which sat on the open plain tall columns stood in a circle within which all discussions concerning the clan families would be held each clan family had a separate section in which to set up their camp the fairgrounds and the place for animals and trading was in the very center of the locus the devyn were already there for it was their task to direct the other clan families the fiacre being the largest of them was given the choicest site the men set up their tents and the chieftains pavilion a pen was erected for the cattle to be sold before dark the felan arrived driving their sheep they were followed by the blathma who brought milled grain flowers tubers and bulbs and the gitta who came with finely milled flour baskets of beautiful vegetables pots of jams conserves and savory relishes their encampments were set up and the clan families began visiting back and forth still to come were the aghy the horse lords there was concern among the chieftains as to whether the tormod and the piaras would come under the circumstances vartan proudly introduced lara to his contemporaries and their wives shes hetarian said rendor of the felan she is faerie said floren of the blathma i am both lara answered them i have a destiny that has taken me to the forest lords the shadow princes and now to the outlands do you not think it odd she came to you now torin of the gitta demanded he glared at lara suspiciously what if she is a spy sent among us i am no spy lara told him i was sold into slavery by my own father almost two years ago i escaped and have been wandering ever since if you doubt my honesty then speak with kaliq of the shadow princes he knows my tale you have but to call to him and he will come you have gained yourself a most beautiful wife rendor of the felan said clapping vartan on the back heartily welcome lara daughter of swiftsword wife of vartan of the fiacre i thank you my lord lara responded prettily and the suspicions of both floren of the blathma and torin of the gitta were allayed they grinned and kissed the bride vigorously leaving lara laughing and covered with blushes at their enthusiasm afterward in the privacy of their pavilion vartan told his family how his new wife had stood boldly forth before his fellow chieftains and won them over i hope they do not think your wife too bold brother vartan elin murmured eyes lowered as she embroidered a piece of cloth in an oval frame our chieftains admire strong women and a chieftain needs a strong wife bera spoke up she did not particularly like her younger sons wife elin was a sly girl and was always encouraging adon to some new foolishness perhaps she would change with the advent of a child bera considered hopefully in the meantime she had a fine daughterinlaw in lara and she would not allow anyone to offend her i hardly consider speaking out to defend myself being bold elin you were not there so you are not fit to judge lara said she already recognized an enemy in elin elins lips pressed together in an expression of disapproval and she gave her husband an arch look but she said nothing further in midmorning of the following day the aghy led by their chieftain roan arrived with a fine herd of horses the aghy were the second largest of the clan families as soon as their encampment was set up and their animals corralled vartan took lara to meet the aghy roan was as tall as vartan with a head of flaming red hair and eyes so deep blue they appeared almost black his gaze swept over lara admiringly my bride lara vartan said with a grin keep your hands to yourself roan of the aghy i would hate to cut them off for how then would you ride your fine horses i would trap my mare between my thighs and guide her thusly roan replied wickedly and he burst into laughter flinging his arms about vartan to embrace him vartan was laughing too welcome to the gathering old friend any sign of the tormod or piaras yet roan asked vartan shook his head nay not yet but they do have the farthest distance to come and his eyes strayed to the purple mountains beyond the plain we can wait another day or two for them roan said the weather is perfect as it always is for the gathering and the longer we linger the more horses ill sell he chuckled he swung his gaze to lara do you ride lady i do she said i have a sweet young mare who would suit you admirably roan told her vartan began to chortle and when roan looked questioningly at him he said to lara go and fetch dasras so that the chieftain of the aghy may see your mount at once my lord lara told him with a grin and she hurried off when she returned she was mounted upon the great golden stallion with the creamy mane and tail roans mouth dropped open with his surprise he looked dasras over with a keen eye there is only one place where horses like this are raised only the shadow princes breed animals so fine he is magnificent vartan your praise should go to my wife for he is hers roan vartan replied the horse lord looked up at lara again lady whatever you desire i will give you if you will sell me this animal he is not for sale and never will be lara told him he was a gift to me from prince kaliq he has magic and is part of my destiny i can well believe he has magic roan said but imagine the colts he could sire and think of the price they would bring i cannot be content unless you sell him to me i would even share the profits with you he ran an admiring hand over the horse dasras drew away from the horse lord my mistress has already told you that i am not for sale my lord he growled in his deep voice roans eyes widened he talks but he is not supposed to frighten people lara scolded dasras the stallion turned his head to meet her look this man has a determined will my lady he must understand that i am indeed magic and your words are not those of some dewyeyed maiden dasras now turned to the horse lord my mistress has a destiny lord roan and i am part of it we cannot be separated the horse lord nodded yes he said i understand but should you ever long for some pretty little mares dasras chuckled richly bowing his head to touch his foreleg i shall certainly remember your most kind offer my lord roan does everyone know he talks roan asked lara we have tried to keep his talents discreet she answered with a small smile and then turning dasras rode back to the enclosure where the fiacre horses were stabled she is not one of us roan said nay she is a halfling hetarian and faerie vartan said how in the name of the celestial actuary did you ever find such a woman to wed roan wanted to know i found her wandering lost on the plain although she insisted she was not lost vartan said she and her companion noss had been with the shadow princes she comes from the city where her father sold her into slavery to advance his position how typically hetarian roan replied scornfully they will sell anything they have of value to gain more what are we going to do about this incursion they have made into the outlands vartan i do not think we can make any decisions until we have heard from the tormod and the piaras it is their territory that has been compromised according to the devyn but whatever they may say to us we cannot allow the hetarians to eat away at our territory this is but the first incursion a test of our wills they think because we have no centralized government that we can eventually be subjugated if we do not stop them at the beginning it will be harder to stop them later on i fear roan nodded in agreement perhaps he said it is time for us to form a stronger union than we have had we meet but once yearly here at the gathering given what is happening we may have to form a council of some sort to handle problems like this immediately instead of waiting for the gathering the devyn who visited me said that the hetarians came into the outlands in late winter it is now midautumn the one in my hall did not know how long they had been in the outlands why did not petruso of the piaras or imre of the tormod send to us for help vartan wondered you know how proud the mountain clans are roan replied we shall have to wait and see if they come to the gathering three days later the chieftains they had been awaiting rode into the gathering there were no women or children with them and but few riders traveled by their side the yearly council was called for immediately and the clan families gathered together within the ring of stone columns vartan as head of the largest clan family called for order and when all was finally quiet he said we call upon imre of the tormod or petruso of the piaras to speak to us now which of you will tell us what is happening in the mountains the tales brought to us by the devyn are disconcerting and never before has a clan family come to the gathering without its women and children i will speak for the tormod and the piaras imre said stepping forward he was a tall sinewy man whose ashbrown hair was streaked with silver his gray eyes swept the gathering just before spring hetar invaded us coming into our villages with their crusader knights we were shocked especially as they treated us as if we were savages they slew our elders they penned our women and children into enclosures like animals they separated our young women putting them into my house where they use them for their pleasure our young boys are being forced into the mines at too young an age new mines are being opened every month they do not restore the land as we always have our mountain valleys are becoming a wasteland they poison the waters with their refuse why did you not send to us for help vartan asked imre this action was a clear violation of the ancient treaties that separate hetar and the outlands we were so shocked at first by what had happened imre said that we lost the advantage petruso and i did manage to meet we agreed that we had to escape and reach the gathering if we could not reach you before it took weeks of planning vartan the crusader knights are a cruel foe and they were always on the watch for several of our young men attempted to flee they were caught and brutally tortured in our public squares before being killed our people were forced to watch and they grew afraid these few men who accompanied us did so at great risk and we had to steal the horses we rode we were pursued in the mountains but as soon as we managed to reach the plain our captors fell back and let us go they could not afford to be caught so deep in the outlands when our identities are learned it is certain our families will suffer we did discuss it with them and our women agreed we must make the effort and find help many of the women listening had begun to weep as imre spoke vartan turned to petruso what have you to say old friend he asked he can no longer speak imre said when he protested that hetar was violating a centuriesold treaty the crusader knights cut out his tongue petruso opened his mouth to show his fellow chieftains the stump of what had once been a most active appendage the chieftains all paled with this knowledge hetar wants the ores and the gems is that correct vartan said aye imre said and petruso nodded vigorously then we will have to drive the hetarians from the mountains and kill as many as we can to make our point most clear vartan said hetar must not be allowed to violate our borders or be encouraged by our lack of action to push further into the outlands aye those gathered in the stone ring cried with one voice winter is upon us floren of the blathma said we cannot fight a mountain war in the winter and when the spring comes who will tend to the fields if we are fighting can we not send a delegation to the hetarians and negotiate this misunderstanding they have always been a most civilized people surely they are open to reason he was a plump man with a perpetually worried expression on his face but he grew the most beautiful flowers in the outlands if hetar comes into your lands floren they will lay waste to your fields and send the daughters of whom you are so proud into the pleasure houses of the city imre said bitterly hetar did not negotiate with us they violated our boundaries and murdered our people this is no small misunderstanding this is an act of war we have risked much to come to the gathering and ask for your help he stood proudly looking around at his fellow clan family chieftains if we do not put a stop to this aggression roan of the aghy said hetar will push further into the outlands perhaps it is just the ores and gemstones that they want torin of the gitta said hopefully it is the only real thing of value in the outlands lara stood up she didnt know if she should but she did your lands are the most valuable possession you have my lords she told them the farmers in the midlands have no acreage left into which they may expand their farms they cannot grow enough crops to feed the people the city is overcrowded and people need a place to go they have begun to encroach on the forest i know my people first hetar will steal the wealth in your mountains and then they will come to steal your beautiful lands my wife knows well of what she speaks vartan said because she is a hetarian a voice among the crowd cried out yes i was born hetarian lara said which is why i know the minds of those who rule that land you must listen to me never have i known such beauty as is here in the outlands never have i been treated better than here among the fiacre the people of hetar are taught to believe you are savages but you are not i have come to love your ways if hetar invades the outlands you will all lose your way of life many of you will be enslaved as the tormod and the piaras have already been enslaved you must listen to me for i have known both ways and yours are better i believe her rendor of the felan said so do i accius of the devyn agreed we must put a stop to hetar now we cannot wait until the spring how many more people among the two clan families will die if we wait even a few months we must strike now there will be snows in the mountains before we can assemble an army and march there blathma protested it is the end of october and your fields lie fallow and will lie fallow for the next several months rendor of the felan said with a wolfish smile i know you blathma and you wish to spend the winter as you always do safe and snug in your warm house planning new gardens and dreaming of the spring to come but there will be no spring for many of the piaras and the tormod unless we come to their aid now we have no other choice there are always choices blathma cried the only other choice is to wait for hetar to come to you lara told him and they will but when the crusader knights come lord blathma your choices will be gone forever hetar will drive the outlanders from their lands and repopulate them with their own kind you will be strangers in your own land where will you go what will you do my lords when hetar has taken away your home perhaps gitta of the torin said they will share the land with us mayhap lara agreed in the beginning but as their population grows again and hetarian law takes over here the people of the outlands will be squeezed out you must remain separate from them as you have always done or you will be destroyed let us take the night my lords to think on this accius of the devyn said reasonably in the morning we will meet again and decide what course of action we must take to protect ourselves and to free the piaras and the tormod from the harsh captivity they now bear aye the other clan chieftains said with one voice the council adjourned usually the evenings of the gathering were meant for feasting and merriment but tonight no one felt content to eat and dance everyone began to return to their own encampments lara walked hand in hand with vartan i could not help but speak up she said i hope i did not embarrass you my lord but suddenly i know what my destiny is vartan and you must not laugh he stopped and smiling down at her took her face between his two hands and what is your destiny my beautiful halfling wife my destiny is to save the outlands lara said seriously kaliq knew it which was why he said i had chosen well when i decided to come to the outlands he could not tell me of course you are certain your destiny is to help us vartan said slowly of course it was all beginning to make sense now she was a halfling a woman with certain powers she had important friends and a mother who was a queen you must listen to me when i advise you my lord lara told him and you must not prevent me from doing certain things vartan what things he kissed the tip of her nose releasing her face from his gentle grip what do you plan you must know your enemy and quickly imre speaks from his anguish but he tells us nothing of the crusader knights how many of them are there how and where are they transporting the riches they are stealing from the mountains who made the decision to invade the tormod and the piaras but most important just how far is the high council of hetar willing to go in this endeavor or can they be forced out of the mountains if we resist them these are the things you must know my lord lara told him seriously but how can we learn all these things vartan asked her i must think on it lara said quietly but i will find the answers for you i vow it this is my destiny this is what brought me to the outlands it is i suspect but the beginning vartan replied your destiny lara i think is much bigger than just this difficulty with hetar and the crystal hanging between her breasts began to glow brightly in response chapter she lay on the bed they had made from furs in a corner of their pavilion beside her vartan slept content with the passion they had shared earlier but lara could not sleep finally she arose and slipped from the tent the night was dark and above her three of hetars four moons glowed silver in the sky she had not shapeshifted in many weeks could she even still do it lara thought of a young eagle and silently said the words aral go she felt herself soar upwards wings flapping softly catching a whorl of current in the air she rose higher and higher above the encampment it was wonderful it was amazing she knew she dared not remain aloft for too long already the horizon was beginning to grow light at its edges but she could do it she could really do it but she would need more than the ability to shapeshift to help the outlanders she needed magic and she knew exactly where that magic was to be found with kaliq of the shadow princes but not now she guided herself back down to the ground near their pavilion again lara return she murmured and regained her own shape smiling she walked back into the tent and lay down by her husbands side where were you vartan asked her softly seeing if i could still shapeshift she whispered back go back to sleep vartan i will tell you on the morrow i am hungry now he told her hungry you ate like a pig at the evening meal lara exclaimed hungry for my faerie wifes delicious body he said with a wicked grin we have no privacy vartan she fretted your mother your brother his wife and noss sleep just beyond our curtain we will be as quiet as mice you are never quiet she teased him but she wanted him now every bit as much as she knew he wanted her if you do not remove your night robe i will tear it from you he threatened lara quickly pulled the gown from her slender form i will find a way to repay you for this she threatened half laughing oh wife i hope so and he pulled her into his arms his hands caressing her eagerly punish me with your kisses lara his mouth took hers in a searing embrace she lost herself in his arms when he had satisfied himself with her mouth he laid her back upon their camp bed and began to kiss every inch of her flesh not only with his lips but with his tongue as well he suckled for a time on each of her breasts covering her mouth with his big hand to still her cries of delight his blue eyes blazing down into her green ones he brushed over her belly licking and breathing on the quivering flesh as he went his fingers played between her nether lips teasing her until she was drenched with her excitement when he slowly and deliberately put those fingers in his mouth sucking on them she almost swooned kaliq and his brothers had loved her with exquisite delicacy but vartan loved her with a fierce passion that set her afire with longing such as she had never known suddenly eager to return some of the pleasure he was giving her she pushed him onto his back and straddled him her fingertips brushed over his hard flesh and putting one hand over his mouth she pinched one of his nipples teasingly with the other his big body jerked in surprise but he did not unseat her two can play at the same game husband she whispered in his ear licking it slowly and nipping at the lobe lara slithered down his long torso kissing and licking as she went her sweetly rounded buttocks filled his sight now and again she would nip at him but he restrained his cries his excitement however was an entirely different thing and when her hand reached out to enclose his burgeoning manroot he stuffed his fist in his mouth to silence himself lara squeezed hard on the pillar of flesh in her hand then she bent to let her tongue encircle its blazing tip from which the tiniest milky bead slipped forth she lapped at it then releasing the manroot took him into her mouth even as she felt him move beneath her raising himself that he might taste her secret flesh with his own tongue she suckled on him but as she did her attentions were diverted by the sweet heat that his mouth on her was engendering lara bit her lip until it bled to keep from screaming let me go she heard vartan growl low and when she did he pulled himself from beneath her still keeping her on her knees and bent before him in a gesture of utter submission his hands clamped themselves about her hips and lara felt him enter her in a single smooth motion he remained still within her swelling more until he filled her tightly she had never felt a manroot with such incredible intensity he was hot and hard within her pleasure sheath she shuddered with pure delight then gaining a small mastery of herself she squeezed him several times until he began to move slowly within her body lara thought she would die with the sweetness she was experiencing he moved in a leisurely fashion drawing himself out almost to the tip of his manroot and then plunging back with great deliberation until he was fully encased by her hot flesh i love you he murmured low against her ear i will never love another woman except you lara my beautiful faerie wife then why do you kill me she sobbed back she felt aflame with her desire a desire he seemed in no great hurry to satisfy in response he began to move faster and faster and faster until sensing her impending crisis he forced her into their pillows that her cries of pleasure be silenced as her ripe body shuddered with release when she was finally still he released his grip on her lara turned over and looked up at him in wonder i have never before been loved quite like that she whispered to him vartan smiled a small smile at her pleased by her words then he wrapped her in his embrace and they were both shortly asleep again in the morning she told him of the flight she had taken in the night kaliq can help us lara said each province has two members on the high council he can find out who ordered the incursion into the outlands and if the council is involved it would be a form of betrayal for him wouldnt it vartan asked no the shadow princes are very isolated from the rest of hetar they are feared for their magic but as no one wants their desert they are left to themselves kaliq and his brothers have little tolerance for those in the city who make the laws they are more allied with the faerie world than with hetar he will help us you must take the shape of a bird then to reach him vartan said i took the shape of an eagle last night i felt strong and secure as i flew lara told him the eagle is the talisman of the fiacre as i told you on the day we first met i can take its shape as well vartan said i fear to allow you to fly alone let me come with you lara my wife my life and my love if you come you will see that kaliq loves me and you will be jealous she replied i do not want you ever imagining what was between this prince and me i do not need to see him to know that vartan answered her you are an incredibly beautiful woman wife i cannot be jealous of your prince for he was forced to give you up you are mine for an eternity lara daughter of swiftsword he put his arms about her i must attend the council today but we will depart tomorrow if i leave my brother in charge it will please him and perhaps his wife will stop her harping what of liam she asked liam never wanted the position and will understand why i do what i do he shall be the only one who knows where we go liam knows how to keep secrets vartan said quietly i would go with you to the council today lara told him let me sit at your right hand to listen and advise yes he agreed your position as the wife of the fiacre chieftain must be enforced and acknowledged here at the gathering have sholeh join us as well lara suggested that way my presence does not seem so obvious she is a headwoman and she is your kin how does one so young have such wisdom he asked her lara shrugged i suppose it is instinct and i have always had it he chuckled we must eat for the council will last all day with floren dithering and attempting to avoid the inevitable while gitta vacillates between florens logic and ours these growers of crops are reluctant to go to war i have never faced a war but i learned from my fathers tales that war is a futile pursuit which no one really wins yet there are times when it seems the only way to settle a dispute is to go to war sometimes men cannot be reasoned with and only a good bloodletting will bring them to their senses the day we met you said hetar would eventually invade these lands but i do not think you believed it would be in your lifetime vartan i am sorry that it is so am i he answered her and then he began to dress lara followed suit then they left their small curtained shelter and came into the larger portion of the pavilion where bera and noss had a morning meal ready for them adon and elin were already at table adon did not bother looking up but elins gaze was sharp lara stared directly at her until elin turned away a flush upon her cheeks and her mouth in a thin tight line feed us well my mother for we will be the day long in the council i suspect vartan said jovially noss have you eaten at her nod he continued go and tell my cousin sholeh that i will expect her at the council to advise me brother elin burst out should women be at council is that not a mans province women are not meant to govern we are too frail i fear perhaps you are dear elin vartan responded but there are some women as strong as their men and in some cases stronger he chuckled at her shocked look my wife shall sit at my right hand today a womans opinion is necessary to any and all decisions that the council makes we are not hetar scorning womens wisdom if we go to war many women and children will be left behind to care for the land for the elders to cope with the daily business of living but some of our women will fight by our side i should be at your right hand adon said angrily why do you always choose others over me he demanded do you want to sit around all day in debate little brother vartan asked of course not adon said but you might at least have asked me by your actions you say to the fiacre that you do not trust me i dont vartan remarked bluntly you are too greedy for power that you cannot possibly handle you are shorttempered and shortersighted adon but you are my brother and i do love you now cease your carping so i may eat in peace the younger man opened his mouth to protest but bera said sharply adon you have always loved him more than you love me adon muttered glaring at her only my sweet elin understands he took his wifes hand bera snorted but held her peace and served the meal sholeh arrived just as they were finishing she hugged bera and lara nodding to adon and elin with a small smile their meal concluded the two went off into a corner of the great tent where they sat down whispering and nodding she looked to vartan who shrugged with a small smile and drank down the contents of his goblet the trio departed for the council to be joined by liam they took their seats immediately the wisdom of the celestial actuary was invoked and almost at once floren presented his argument for arbitration again sholeh stood up when he had finished before anyone else could speak and will you floren of the blathma lead the delegation to the invaders of the piaras and the tormod she asked sharply or will you expect someone else to go and plead your case for you i am not a diplomat floren blustered neither are any of us sholeh said we are a simple people who prefer a simple life we have managed to live in peace for centuries respecting each other and our individual borders we have no standing armies no crusader knights to protect us from invaders we are considerate of the land that nurtures us and we esteem it we are nothing at all like hetarians whose passion is for status wealth and power they have always scorned the outlands but now they suddenly desire its riches first it will be the ores and gems of the piaras and the tormod next it will be for your land and mine they will bring their laws and their ethics or lack thereof into our outlands and we will lose our identities what makes you think that men who would invade anothers lands and cruelly enslave the population can be reasoned with floren we must try he replied if only to save ourselves from a war you are already at war lara told the chieftain of the blathma she is right roan of the aghy said and only the devyn stand between you floren and the invaders the devyn will sing of this time in our history and they will fight will you let the smallest of our clan families do what you will not he stood tall his red hair like a beacon staring out at his fellow chieftains are the blathma as weak and frail as the flowers they grow we are not cowards floren cried his hand going to his dagger then fight roan roared there is no bargaining with murderous thieves we have not yet decided upon a course of action rendor of the felan said quietly sit down now roan and take your hand from your belt floren let us discuss this reasonably as we have always discussed matters of importance between us vartan now stood up the times are changing my brothers my friends and we must change with the times else we be left behind but if we are to control our own destiny we cannot wait for hetar to come further into the outlands we must form a central government something we have never before done and we need to speak with one voice in the past we didnt care that the hetarians considered our outlands a barbaric place we had little if any contact with them but as the years have passed they have grown to believe what were once merely words they truly believe that we are savages and therefore of little account they will wrest this land from us if we do not stop them he turned to floren i wish negotiation were possible but it is not we must strike these invaders hard we must strike them now much blood will be spilled the lives of those we know and love will be lost but many more lives will be sacrificed unless we stop hetar now look on the bright side floren if we can crush the invaders before spring comes youll be home in time to plow your fertile fields a ripple of laughter echoed around the stone edifice at vartans words and a small smile even crossed florens plump face we must put it to a vote gitta of the torin said and the other chieftains nodded may i consider it unanimous vartan asked gazing about the council they all looked to floren who nodded slowly saying i will hold you to your timeline vartan i have seeds from two plants i crossed and i want them planted next year so i may see if the flower is as beautiful as i suspect it will be there was more laughter what of a permanent council rendor of the felan asked lara stood now with your permission my lords i will tell you of the high council of hetar she began the high council consists of eight members two from each province they are rotated regularly that no member from any province can be bribed for his vote the man from each province considered the most important takes his turn as head of the council again that honor is rotated but in this case every third moon cycle the council head votes only when a tie must be broken that is how hetar is governed my lords it is a simple form of government rendor of the felan noted and still open to corruption as all governments are roan of the aghy said all of us are open to corruption roan we need to speak with one voice to hetar vartan replied if we do not they could divide and conquer us perhaps accius of the devyn suggested we would do better to drive the hetarians from the piaras and the tormod regions first and then revisit this matter of a more formal government for our peoples i would put vartan of the fiacre forth as our warlord and roan of the aghy as his second in command i will agree rendor of the felan said and i imre torin and accius said petruso they asked the now mute leader of the piaras and he nodded in agreement drawing his sword and waving it in the air petruso says that while he can no longer speak he can still fight imre told them petruso nodded enthusiastically and made several stabbing motions with his weapon to the cheers of his companions such a shame sholeh murmured to lara he had the most beautiful singing voice as good as a devyn and he always entertained us at the gathering i never knew hetarians could be so cruel lara replied i was sold into slavery so that my father could have his chance to become a crusader knight he was a renowned warrior but had not the means to join the tournament until i was sold were not his skills enough sholeh asked surprised nay lara said they were not a man who becomes a crusader knight must look as if he belongs among them i hope my father is not among those who have invaded the outlands i do not know what i would do if i found myself facetoface with him in a battle then you mean to go with vartan sholeh asked aye i do lara told her i could not sit home at camdene waiting for word i am skilled with sword and staff i must go with him i am meant to fight this battle do you love my cousin sholeh said i do not believe in love lara told her i respect vartan and i admire him i gladly share my body with him is that not enough for a man i do not think it is sholeh answered lara it is the best i have to give lara replied you will love him one day sholeh told her with a smile come let us leave the council now they will discuss how many warriors each of them should give some saying because they have less land they should send fewer men it is the kind of argument that would drive a sensible woman mad they must send a large army lara said the larger the force the more impressed hetar will be and we must win the first battle sholeh that means we must have the advantage over them to begin with and i know just how to gain it how sholeh asked her lara shook her head i will tell you after it is done but not before vartan and i have already talked about it tomorrow you must see that adon and his wife are kept busy so busy that they do not wonder where my husband and i have gotten to can you do that include noss and bera as well you will need an excuse for your absence sholeh said we will be planning for the war with the other chieftains and my husband wishes my advice as i have been raised in hetar and know them best you do not call yourself hetarian sholeh noted hetar is all of our world but if it must remain divided lara replied then i am of the outlands for that is where my heart is i realized it the moment noss and i exited the cave in the cliff into the plain it stretched before me and i knew immediately that i had come home sholeh smiled at the answer well pleased vartan had taken a good wife that night she came with several of her children and grandchildren she invited bera noss adon and elin to join her the following day in preparing a special feast for the next night no one can ready a hot pit like you adon she praised her younger cousin and elins sauces for the roasted meats and poultry are without equal she turned to noss you could learn from elin my child she said you have not asked lara elin noted my wife will be with me in the war council vartan replied smoothly as she has lived much of her life in hetar her advice is invaluable sholeh knew that beforehand elin mayhap she has been sent by hetar to mislead us adon said softly you are a fool adon lara said and then she turned to bera they had the same father sometimes i wonder bera replied dryly why is it that my words are never considered seriously adon demanded because his mother said you do not consider your words first my son later as they lay amid the furs that made up their bed vartan made plans with his wife we must leave just before the dawn when we are least likely to be seen how long do you think we will be gone a day two days lara shook her head the magic of the shadow princes brought noss and me through the cliff tunnel to the outlands when we looked back those same cliffs were gone or at least so distant that we could not possibly have traveled that far from them in a single day tonight i will put my mind to reaching out to kaliq we will leave before dawn as you suggest and see what happens my husband then her hand went to the crystal does ethne agree he teased her ethne has been silent of late lara admitted he reached out for her but she pushed him away and he looked at her surprised we must conserve our strength for the journey ahead vartan she counseled him wisely and with a sigh he nodded giving her a chaste kiss then turning away from her he fell quickly asleep say something she whispered to ethne rely on your instincts the flame flickered and banked low lara then called out to kaliq and hoped that he heard her i need your counsel kaliq come to me finally she slept in the dim light before the dawn two eagles rose up from the encampment of the gathering and flew toward the desert the birds soared in silence throughout the morning but as the sun reached the midway point in the heavens lara saw a great tree ahead of them it stood alone amid the plain and was covered with golden leaves vartan she called to her husband as he flew by her side we must descend to the ground beneath that tree the two eagles dropped down until their clawed feet touched the ground below and they uttered the words that restored them to human shape under the tree a table had been set for three there was a joint of meat bread cheese fruit and a jug of wine lara laughed delighted kaliq where are you dear friend and immediately the shadow prince stepped seemingly from inside the great tree lara he said taking her in his arms and kissing her forehead it is good to see you again releasing her he turned immediately to her companion and you will be vartan of the fiacre i am kaliq of the shadow princes why have you sought me may we sit down and refresh ourselves lara said gently i am sorry the prince apologized you have traveled a long way this morning and you must return to your gathering by nightfall eat drink and we will talk the two men stared at one another kaliq tall darkhaired and bronzed from the sun of his desert his lightcolored eyes in vivid contrast vartan tall darkhaired and bronzed from the winds of the plains his blue eyes suspicious as he frankly examined the man who had been his wifes lover and was yet her friend thank you for coming to meet us lara told kaliq and in such elegant fashion does the tree belong here or is it one of your delicious illusions you see how well she knows me vartan the prince said with a smile you were right to make her your wife but be warned this small difficulty you now face is but the beginning of her destiny vartans jaw tightened but before he might respond the prince spoke again do not be angry with me for knowing what you cannot even lara does not know she must follow her instincts kaliq said and do not be jealous of me vartan i had to let her go now how may i help you they sat down at the table beneath the tree and while vartan spoke lara served them food and poured frine from the jug the devyn brought word to me that our mountain clan families had been invaded but only at our gathering did we learn the seriousness of what is happening my lord prince vartan began the leaders of both families managed to escape that they might reach us but it took them months to effect this escape the crusader knights have killed innocents and are pillaging the land hetar has violated a centuriesold treaty between us we must drive them out of the purple mountains before winter and we have little time to do so each day we wait they entrench themselves deeper into the piaras and tormod territories and their people suffer greatly what do you want of me kaliq asked we need to learn lara broke into the conversation if the high council has approved this incursion my lord prince and if so why two of your like sit on that council they would know and we must know even now my lord vartan is assembling a mighty army to go to our clan families aid but the crusader knights are a fierce foe and many will be killed before this is settled i do not know if the high council approved this incursion into the outlands lara the prince told her i will seek the answer to that question but i do know the men who invaded the territories of the piaras and the tormod are not crusader knights the crusader knights are noble in their thoughts hearts and deeds they fight only to keep hetar safe from harm there is no danger from your clan families to hetar and they know this and crusader knights would not enslave a people and carry on a commercial enterprise this smells to me of the merchants guild and your old friend gaius prospero kaliq said it could very well be that the council is in ignorance of what is happening in the purple mountains or it might be that some of them have been bribed to look the other way but our representatives would know that i would learn who the head of the high council was late last autumn or in early winter lara told him kaliq chortled it is not a wager i should put money on lara for again i will bet that it was gaius prospero he would have been able to bribe everyone but our princes and perhaps the coastal kings depending on who sat on the council then the felan have land along the sea vartan said the gentle hills along the coast are perfect for their sheep they have always lived in harmony with the coastal kings they allow them to put in for water and fish in the seas off their shoreline i believe that rendor has friends among the coastal kings even ones allies are open to the right bribe kaliq said then why should we trust you vartan demanded we do not know you kaliq laughed you do not vartan of the fiacre but lara does and she trusts my brothers and me do you not lara suddenly she was swept back to that night when kaliq had shared his passion for her with the other shadow princes she almost blushed with the memory of the delights they had all enjoyed for she had eventually remembered then in a burst of clarity she realized the lesson they had taught her that night trust she had trusted them not to harm her and they had not they had instead offered her pleasures such as she had never before imagined yes she answered him in a strong voice and their eyes met briefly then she turned to her husband i do trust the princes vartan and so should you he had not missed the silent byplay between his wife and prince kaliq and he swallowed down his jealousy had she not warned him he would be jealous and had he not strongly insisted that he would not he could not fail her and shame her before this prince if you trust the shadow princes lara my love and my life then i shall trust them too the faintest of smiles brushed kaliqs lips and he nodded with respect to the clan chieftain of the fiacre he was worthy of lara the prince thought then he said i will learn immediately what it is you need to know if you will wait for me here i will return before sunset he waved his hand and the table with its chairs and dishes disappeared in its place was a reclining couch large enough for two a small table by its side bearing a decanter and two small goblets that is not subtle at all kaliq lara scolded him with a giggle we cannot wait my lord vartan said if we do not begin our return journey now we will not be back in time for the evening feasting it is when we all come together and speak take your pleasure while i seek out the answers you need the prince said i will see you are returned to the gathering place in time then stepping back he seemed to disappear into the bark of the huge tree we cannot wait vartan repeated his magic will put us back where we should be at the proper time lara said please trust him vartan i know you said you do but i also know you said it for my sake and kaliq knows it as well both of us realize your hesitation stems from your jealousy she took his hand and led him to the reclining couch will you deny us the pleasure of this moment when we are alone and have a bit of privacy she undid her gown and let it fall to the grass beneath her sandals her beautiful naked body glowed in the sunlight of the midautumn afternoon after last night i long to be between your strong thighs my husband i ache to be filled again with your manroot come into my arms my lord she began to undress him and a slow smile lit up his face damn the handsome shadow prince who had once known the pleasure of his wifes passion lara was his alone her soft words and gentle hands were arousing him he gladly gave in to her blandishments and helped her so that shortly they stood nude arms about each other her hands slipped down his long back to cup and caress his tight buttocks her fingers brushed over his hot length running beneath it to fondle the sac holding his seed he growled deep in his throat and his mouth found hers in a searing kiss lara sighed at the touch of his lips on hers sighed again as those lips traveled first over her face then blazed a fiery trail down the slender column of her neck his big hands enclosed her waist lifting her up to kiss the shadowed valley between her breasts he licked at her nipples and her eyes closed in anticipation his mouth closed over first one breast and then the other suckling at them hungrily she clung to him eager for what was to come as he lay her upon the large reclining couch but today he surprised her she lay spread open to him but he did not immediately fit himself between her legs instead he sat upon the couch next to her and drizzled a bit of frine onto her torso then lowering his head he began to lick it up his tongue moving frantically to keep up with the individual droplets running across her body soon the liquid was all gone and vartan moved to kneel between her limbs his busy tongue moved lower until it was pushing between her nether lips until he found that delicate nub of flesh that gave such delight when properly encouraged he touched it lightly with just the tip of his tongue then he began flicking at that fleshy kernel until lara was whimpering and her slender body trembled with excitement and she cried out it was a sound of satisfaction that caused him to smile he was as hard as rock and without further ado he covered her body with his and entered her ahhh lara half sobbed as his manroot filled her oh my lord yes and yes again and yet again she wrapped her legs about his hips her arms clung tightly to him her entire body was atingle with their joining her fingers kneaded his broad shoulders she tried not to scratch him but he laughed softly in her ear mark me with your claws my love he encouraged her he could feel himself swelling inside of her feel the muscles of her love sheath embracing him he groaned as her nails raked down his back enjoying the slight stinging pain which but added to his excitement he began to move on her lara sobbed with the pleasure they were sharing her head began to spin and starbursts in a thousand rainbow hues burst behind her closed eyes every part of her felt alive with his love she could feel her nipples pressing against him as he crushed her breasts against his chest she savored the great length of him as he thrust again and again into her molten core and then she sensed the coming storm of passion that would leave them both weak and satisfied it exploded within them simultaneously and they cried out together with one voice afterward they lay quietly in each others arms the soft late afternoon breeze brushing over their damp bodies finally vartan spoke you know that i love you lara yes she answered nothing more can you not say it my wife i do not believe in love she replied i have said it before why does it now come as a surprise to you i have a faerie womans cold heart vartan but i will tell you that i have never before experienced the kind of pleasure that we share never not with any man and i respect you as lord of the fiacre and as my husband it must be enough for it is all that i can give lara slipped from his arms and standing up began to dress you had best put your clothing back on my husband kaliq said he would be back in late afternoon is it that you dont want to embarrass him with my magnificence he teased her precisely she agreed with a little smile he chuckled and then rising proceeded to dress they sat back down on the reclining couch and sipped frine from the goblets kaliq had left the sun was beginning to slip down the smooth silken sheet of the blue sky when the shadow prince stepped from the great tree to rejoin them i have word for you he told them seating himself between lara and vartan tell us lara said i was correct when i said that it was not crusader knights the invaders are mercenaries in the pay of gaius prospero who convinced a majority of the high council to pursue this small encroachment into the outlands the mercenary guild needed work they were becoming restless being so idle and beginning to cause trouble in the city nor did they enjoy paying bribes to their leaders for the small assignments that were coming their way the midlands and the forest lords voted for the breach in the treaty my fellow princes and the coastal kings voted against it but as we suspected the greedy master of merchants was council head at that time and he voted for the incursion they have taken much ore from the piaras and the tormod so far there is talk in the council of annexing these territories because of the lack of resistance from the outlanders hetar does not understand your ways and so it believes that you are weak you will have to strike these invaders hard and cause them much harm in order to discourage them from moving further into the outlands a winter war will be cruel for all involved vartan noted but it must be done we have no other choice we can help you kaliq said quietly if you will allow it how lara asked we have the ability to control the weather if necessary usually we allow nature to have its way for that is best but it will be more difficult for your army to fight in the snows and bitter cold such winter weather will not touch the tormod and the piaras this year we will keep the worst of winter from the territories involved in this dispute and the coastal kings have agreed to close their lands to the rest of hetar that you may not be attacked from another direction and can be certain your women and children are safe in your villages kaliq told them and in return vartan asked the prince nothing kaliq replied one day we may need a favor from you and when that day comes i am certain that you will render it to us in kind lord vartan he held out his hand to vartan who gripped it in return lara placed her own dainty hand upon the locked hands of the two men we are agreed then the shadow prince said and now i must return you to the gathering before you are missed lara knows how to contact me fight well my friend and drive hetar back within its own borders then he made a fluid motion with his free hand and seemed to dissolve before their very eyes blinking in surprise they found themselves back in vartans pavilion there you are bera said i wondered where you had gotten to it is almost time for the feasting i have never known a longer day than this one with elin droning on about how important the freshness of ingredients for her sauces is if they did not taste so good i vow i would strangle the wench no matter she is adons wife and he was no better as he explained the intricacies of choosing just the right wood for his fire pit where were you we met with kaliq of the shadow princes and learned much of what is behind this invasion vartan replied i will tell you after i have met with the other leaders and set a time to speak on it he said to his mother then turning he left the pavilion how is this possible bera gasped there has been much magic this day and there is more of it to come lara told her softly but it has been good magic bera the outland is not alone in this fight what would we have done without you my child bera said you are truly a blessing to us lara daughter of swiftsword wife of vartan it is my destiny lara returned with a small smile and bera chuckled come help me bring food to the feasting table she said and together the two women carried the bowls the platters and the assorted dishes adding them to what was already there from the other clan families the great array of food and drink was quickly consumed as early evening turned into night and the stars twinkled above them and then the four moons of hetar rose each in its quarter phase this night the copper desert moon shone full and bright a good omen lara thought it was the last night of the gathering the bonfires that had sprung up at sunset to usher out the old year and welcome in the new blazed high as it grew later and later more of the clan families departed for their own tents but vartan kept his wife by his side until they and the other clan leaders were alone it is time to speak vartan said why is your wife here in a war council torin of the gitta demanded because without her we would have no hope vartan said she will be the savior of the outlands and her voice is my voice you will obey it always torin now hear me today lara and i met with kaliq of the shadow princes we have learned that the incursion into the piaras and tormod territories is an expedition to test our strength and determination the midland merchants led by the master of their guild are behind it along with the mercenary guild those who invaded you are not crusader knights but mercenaries this scheme was concocted by gaius prospero the master of the merchants the ores and gems stolen from the piaras and the tormod have been added to his own treasury his wealth makes him a powerful man and he heads the hetarian high council the merchants and the forest lords voted to test our determination while the shadow princes and the coastal kings voted to maintain our ancient treaty the tie was broken by gaius prospero himself as he of course meant it to be if only imre and petruso had reached us soonerbut they did not now we must drive the mercenaries from their lands with the winter coming floren of the blathma reminded them dourly we have allies among hetar vartan said the shadow princes will hold back the winter from the mountain territories this will allow us to invade without fear of cold and snow the coastal kings will not allow any from the other provinces into their bailiwick until this matter has been settled rendor has made good friends which will work to our advantage now we will not have to worry about being attacked from another direction but most important we shall have the element of surprise for over half a year has passed since hetar pushed into tormod and piaras at this point i am sure hetar believes we will do nothing but if we do not take back these territories then gaius prospero is planning to annex them who will they come after next he looked about the devyn are the easiest target and then blathma will fall and so on how can we be certain that the shadow princes and the coastal kings will aid us roan of the aghy wanted to know can we trust this kaliq why does he offer to help us vartan what does he want nothing for now but he has said that one day they will come to us for a favor and it is then we must repay them for their aid vartan said he has also said we must raise a mighty army in order to impress hetar lara told the chieftains what does it matter the size of the army if we can beat them roan wanted to know he ran an impatient hand through his bright red hair you must understand that hetarians are impressed by wealth strength status and its like lara explained if you beat them with a small army they will say it was a fluke and they will attempt to come at you again piaras and tormod will forever be open to invasions more people will be killed if you beat them with a great army then they will feel they have been fairly bested and in all likelihood the ancient treaty will be once again honored she shrugged i can explain it no better in order to win against hetar you must impress them first and to do that you will have to kill many of the mercenaries and send their bodies back to the city as a warning for a long moment there was a deep silence among the chieftains then rendor of the felan spoke i understand what you say but it amazes me that so delicate a female can speak so dispassionately about taking life for females are lifegivers he looked at vartan your wife is the most beautiful woman i have ever seen and yet she has it seems the heart of a warrior it is not my heart that should concern you rendor of the felan but rather your own how many men will you pledge to this battle lara asked him bluntly he laughed every whole man among my clan from fourteen to sixty will fight for the outlands he promised we are shepherds at heart but we know well how to defend our flocks be they sheep or people lara of the fiacre wife to vartan daughter of swiftsword rendor answered her we would expect no less vartan said what of the rest of you every horseman in my clan will fight roan of the aghy said we are few in number accius of the devyn said but we will contribute in our own way some of our bards will go into the villages of the piaras and the tormod ostensibly to entertain the invaders but they will pass the word to the people that their leaders have reached their brethren and that a mighty army comes we will ready them to rise up against their captors and we will fight those who cannot fight will sing you into battle and if necessary into the realm of the celestial actuary thank you my old friend vartan said the nobility of the devyn is well known among the outlands our fields are put to bed for the winter now torin of the gitta spoke up if the shadow princes say our villages will be safe then only women children and the elderly will be left behind to care for our lands all who can fight among us will come he turned to look to his fellow agrarian floren of the blathma the plump farmer sighed i can do no less than torin he said reluctantly you are certain our villages will be safe from harm he asked of lara kaliq of the shadow princes has said it and i have never known him to lie lara replied they are honorable men and the oldest among the inhabitants of this world we all share she explained then it is settled vartan said take your people home my brothers and then return here to the gathering place in ten days time by that time we will have a plan readied to punish these hetarians who have invaded our lands i know i speak for petruso as well as myself when i thank you imre of the tormod said for the sake of our peoples i only wish we had gotten to you sooner do not thank us until you are back safe in your own house with your wife by your side imre many will die in this undertaking but there will be more grief in hetar than in the outlands when this is finished vartan said fiercely early the next morning before the sun was even up the clan families dispersed from the gathering place imre petruso and their men went with vartans clan for they dared not return to their own homes yet on the day following their arrival in camdene vartan dispatched riders to each of his villages issuing a call to arms every fiacre clansman between the ages of fourteen and sixty was expected to answer that call if he was physically able the villages and the herds would be looked after by the elderly the women and the children any woman able to fight was invited to come as well although it was not mandated that women answer the chieftains call still several came from each village and were put into sholehs care lara it was agreed would fight by her husbands side i will come too noss said bravely you do not like discord lara reminded her friend and companion this will be terrible dearest remain behind with bera elin and liams mother no noss replied while you will fight with andraste i am a better archer than you why did i carry the long bow the prince gave me on my back from the desert kingdom if i was not to use it and what better use than in the defense of our homeland and sakari tells me she like dasras was trained for battle she is eager and i feel safe with her i but ask one thing of you lara let me wed with liam now lara sighed in her eyes noss was yet a child but in truth she was not lara still saw noss as the frightened girl who the foresters had refused to accept as a breeding slave because she was too young but two years had passed and noss was no longer that youngster she had small firm breasts and a way of tossing her head that bespoke someone on the verge of womanhood liam loved her what if he was among those killed in the coming winter war could she forgive herself if she forbade noss even a brief happiness i will have vartan speak to liam she said and her heart swelled at the look of happiness that engulfed nosss pretty face tears spilled down that face thank you noss said softly and she hugged lara hard i was so afraid you would make us wait and what if he doesnt come back she sniffled or i dont have you spoken to him about coming with us yet lara asked yes and while he is not pleased he has consented for he knows that i must go with you how could i not you must not think you owe me because the forest lords did not want you and took me instead that was part of my destiny noss as unpleasant as it was lara said if you would prefer to remain behind i will not think you craven nay it is not that i feel i must do this just as you feel your destiny so strongly noss responded i sense no impending doom about me i shall come home to camdene again with my liam when this is all over lara very well then i shall be glad for your company as always lara told her no time was wasted in the matter of liam of the fiacre and noss of hetarthe marriage was performed that same night in vartans hall liams mother asta was pleased with her new daughterinlaws sweet nature and equally pleased that noss would go with her husband to fight by his side mayhap she said the ordinary hetarian is not as bad as we have always supposed they were noss might have been born here in the outlands did i not know otherwise but when this winter war is over and done with i shall have grandchildren at last she laughed heartily i am pleased with this marriage vartan gave the bride and groom two days to hide away by themselves be back in my hall on the third morning he said after the brief respite the wedding offered them lara and vartan became engrossed in planning how they would attack and triumph over hetars invasion of the tormod and piaras lands all the outlanders were trained in the arts of war though they had not been forced to use that tuition in centuries their greatest advantage was that neither had the hetarians for there had been peace between the two cultures for years the great crusader knights were an army never used it was the mercenaries who fought in the small squabbles between the lawabiding citizens and the bandits who roamed all the provinces but no one in the outlands could remember a great battle being fought they learned from imre that the householders in each village had been forced to take in their oppressors those forced to toil in the mines now were kept in barracks they had been forced to build themselves and the barracks were enclosed by high wooden fences the old women were sent into these enclosures to cook for the miners and wash their clothing the women left behind in the cottages caring for their young children were more often than not forced to offer pleasures to the men now living in their homes the young girls as imre had told them were confined in his house and forced to act as pleasure women for those men in charge and for important visitors from the city old men who could work at tilling the fields that fed these clan families were left in peace any who were unfit and showed no signs of recovering were slain without mercy they are clever vartan said to the circle of men around him in his hall they inhabit every house which makes it difficult to mount an attack why must a battle be noisy and heroic lara said is not the victory the same even if the battle is a quiet one what do you mean vartan asked her death is inevitable in war but if we can keep all knowledge of our coming from the hetarians if we can get word to all in each village before we attack do you not think they will rise up to aid us we will move stealthily from village to village until the tormod and piaras regions are free of the invaders in each village we will spare one among the enemy and they will drive the wagons of hetarian dead back to the city to the very door of gaius prosperos beautiful house in the golden district the men gathered around her nodded and smiles wreathed their faces some outlanders for whatever reasons will have cooperated with the enemy vartan said wisely they must be rooted out and slain as a warning to any who would betray their own kind this will be difficult but we must be hard again there was agreement i would send a traitor from each village with the wagons they will hardly be welcome and they will not be able to come back execution is a quick death exile is a long one there is no place in the city for strangers she told them they will suffer bitterly before they finally die is it your destiny to destroy the world that spawned you my lady lara imre asked her politely is hetar doomed my destiny for now is to be vartans wife and to ride with you in what is a just and righteous cause what is to come i do not know my lord imre i am but half faerie she smiled at him her green eyes twinkling will your faerie kin come to our aid if you ask he wondered we do not need them in this endeavor my lord imre the clan families of the outlands are strong because they are pure of heart lara told them vartan put an arm about lara you have all heard my wife he said now we must decide how to execute our plans that all be in place when we meet with the others at the gathering place in a few days speak now and let me hear your voices chapter the armies of the clan families convened in late autumn lara was very pleased to see how large a force had been gathered and how impressively they were caparisoned when word got back to the city the high council would be very impressed the flags flown by each clan family were different the eagle was embroidered upon the purple and gold banner of the fiacre a white horse galloped across the blue and gold banner of the aghy the felan flew a banner of sky blue with a black and gray wolf upon it the devyns red flag was decorated with a golden harp the gittas flag was green with sheaves of grain the blathmas green with multicolored flowers the tormod flew a banner of silver that twinkled with gemstones the piarass flag was coal black with gold and silver lines running through it it had been decided that each clan family would free a single village but for the last two each individual army would move off to secure its designated village before joining together for the assault on the two villages of the tormod and piaras left to be freed the devyn would send their bards into the villages beforehand singing in the ancient language of the outlands before both they and the hetarians spoke a single tongue all outlanders were taught the old speech in their schooling and many of their songs were sung in it we are less apt to be seen if we travel singly vartan told them beware of mercenary scouts send your own ahead of you we will lose fewer of our own men if we maintain the element of surprise kill all the enemy but the one chosen to drive the cart we will all meet in the mountains at the crystalline falls and move out from there even with less than half a days light left the clan families departed the gathering place their trumpeters and banners hidden until the moment of triumph to come the desert moon was waning but the butteryellow moon of the coastal region lit the way for vartans army until they finally stopped to rest themselves and the horses none of the other clan families was visible to them what if the mercenaries have posted a watchtower on the mountains lara asked her husband that could ruin all of our carefully laid plans i will take the eagles form and fly ahead in the morning vartan said nay you must lead your army husband lara told him nor do you want it known that you shapeshift it must remain your secret and it cannot if you disappear from the head of your troop yet nothing will be thought if i disappear and then return suddenly i am the fiacre chieftains halfling wife lara said with a chuckle i possess faerie magic but what if you are seen he worried by whom an eagle seen flying in the mountains will not be thought unusual my lord she reassured him he nodded then go with the dawn my love and my life but return to me safely he kissed her brow his blue eyes filled with his love for her i will husband lara told him and when the dark began to retreat from the autumn skies over the plains the next day a small golden eagle soared above the sleeping encampment of the fiacre the birds speed was swift and by late morning it cruised among the peaks of the purple mountains eyes sharply viewing the landscape below she was pleased to find that there were no sentries outposts posted on the heights obviously the mercenaries felt safe which seemed rather careless to lara did the men who had escaped them not concern them or were they so arrogant as to believe that any outlanders who came upon them could be easily beaten satisfied that their plan would hold lara turned and flew back spying vartan and his troop as they traveled across the grasslands she circled above them calling and her husband looked up lara realized that perhaps now was the time to display some of her small magic to her husbands people it would put them in fear or awe of her and one day she might need that advantage she flew down to the riders alighting upon her own saddle as dasras cantered along lara return she said and was immediately restored to her human form she reached out for her reins knees gripping her stallions heaving sides laughing at vartan as she did around her she heard the gasps of surprise and low murmurs her husband chuckled that was well done and you are now completely established as a magical creature vartan told her it may be of help to us one day that they are convinced of my powers and perhaps even a little afraid husband lara told him liam rode up coming between them noss did not tell me you can shapeshift he said admiringly you have frightened many of those who ride with us especially adon he chortled wickedly i suspect that is a good thing lara told liam if i should ever have to act for vartan i do not want to waste my time arguing with him he is i fear a man who has but to open his mouth and i find i am annoyed liam laughed i know he agreed we are blood kin and i do not know another of our family like him he is greedy for his brothers place lara said astutely he shall never have it liam said the elders would not approve it what did you learn vartan asked his wife not enjoying the conversation between lara and liam there are no sentry posts in the mountains or even around the villages lara said it seems rather feckless to me but they are obviously convinced they are secure in their conquest considering that imre and petruso escaped with several of their men i would think they would be watching but they are not she turned to imre who had now ridden up to listen and said was your land always so bleak lord imre there are great open gashes in the landscape and filth pouring into your streams and lakes many trees have been felled and left lying no imre of the tormod answered lara we have always cherished the land and each time we close a mine we restore the land by planting trees and seeding new growth floren can tell you for we have purchased many trees and flowering plants from him we love our land and are grateful for the bounty it provides us but these hetarians only desire its wealth they do not care that they are poisoning our waterwater which flows into the hills and plains of our land the stream in one of my villages had contaminated water vartan said the headman brought it to my attention when we visited recently there you see imre replied they will destroy us all if we do not stop them now and before we managed to flee they had begun cutting the trees on the mountain for its lumber there is a great need for lumber to build in the city i have heard it said but they do not replace the trees and the mountains need trees to keep them from collapsing if a mountain fell it could tumble into our streams or destroy our villages it has been our custom that whenever we cut a tree we replant a tree hetar has done much damage perhaps you might take your complaint to the high court of hetar and demand reparations for the damage lara suggested it would be a waste of time vartan told his wife hetarians consider us savages we would be at a great disadvantage in your court better we simply drive them from the tormod and piaras so we may begin the business of repairing the land before the damage spreads any further into the outlands they stopped to rest until moonrise then they continued on their way the mountains were drawing closer with every step their mounts traveled the following midday they were close enough so that they stopped in a small grove of trees hiding themselves cautiously lara shapeshifted once again flying ahead to see if anything had changed but it had not there was no one to see their approach at moonrise they moved forward once more finally entering the mountains they rode singlefile along narrow trails amid thick forest heading toward the crystalline falls which they hoped to reach by midmorning as they rode along lara felt a prickle slide down her back they were being watched but not by human eyes there were faeries in these woods she felt something light upon her shoulder and turned her head to see a tiny girl smiling at her iridescent wings fluttering hail lara daughter of queen ilona the faerie said i have been sent by my queen to ask if we may help you speak to me as you would to ethne within your mind those riding with you can neither see or hear me my words and presence are for you you are a different tribe from that of my mother lara noted forest faeries come in all sizes the tiny creature chuckled my name is esme i have taken a birds form to fly above these mountains and learn of any threats lara said have my eyes missed any danger esme lara asked they are very arrogant people esme replied they expect no resistance from the outlands but several escaped lara said were they not concerned by that those sent to capture them could not and lied to their masters that they had killed imre and his band and thrown their bodies into the river at the crystalline falls they were believed how might you best help us lara asked we have been friends with the tormod and the piaras forever esme replied we know the devyn will enter the villages first we shall be there to aid them these poor people are frightened especially having been told that their leaders deserted them and were then killed the truth will revive their courage they will be ready when your armies come we will also warn the devyn of the traitors among the tormod and the piaras for we know who they are her smile twinkled at lara if you need me just ask ethne and she will call me esme said thank you so much lara replied and the tiny faerie was as quickly gone as she had come did you see that tiny bird with the iridescent wings at your shoulder vartan asked lara you must have for you turned and stared at it for the longest time what you saw as a bird was actually one of the forest faeries who live here my mother sent her she has confirmed what i believed truethe hetarians are secure in their conquest of these lands lara explained will the faeries help us he inquired esme for that is her name says her kind have been friends with the tormod and the piaras forever they will go into the villages with the devyn bards and spread word that we are coming to release them from their bondage she says those pursuing imre petruso and their men returned to their masters and claimed they had killed them the people were beaten down by such terrible news the knowledge that their leaders are alive will hearten them greatly when we reach the falls i will tell imre and petruso vartan said then he reached out to caress her cheek you are a blessing to the outlands lara daughter of swiftsword he told her she smiled so you have previously said husband but i am not necessarily a blessing vartan it is just that i hate injustice and what has happened here is unjust they arrived at the crystalline falls in late afternoon lara had never seen their like it was beautiful the waters fell in a silvery sheet from the heights above the torrent dropped into a round rock pool made its way over a much lower bed of rocks into a river that flowed down and through the mountains the clear liquid in the pool had so far remained untouched by the impurities the hetarians were creating the banks about the pool were soft with moss the trees soared most now bare of their leaves they were the first to arrive and made their camp without a fire lara went to greet the spirit of the falls requesting sanctuary for the outlander armies by moonrise however all the other clan armies had reached the crystalline falls in a tent lit by a single lamp the clan chieftains and their lieutenants gathered to discuss their next move their relief when vartan told them of the faeries who would aid them was almost palpable these were not men and women for whom fighting came easily vartan also told them that the devyn bards had already been dispatched into the villages and that tomorrow the quest to free their fellow outlanders would begin imre explained that they were less than a days march from most of the villages he laid out a parchment map on the tents single table showing them where they now were and how each clan family could reach their assigned villages after you have liberated your village imre said you will go here he pointed these are the singing caves we will all meet there and continue on to the final two villages we must take each of you will be given a copy of this map to guide you your individual paths are marked in your clan color remember vartan said to them all the mercenaries but one are to be killed you can show no mercy for hetar has showed no mercy if we are to make them honor the treaties signed between us centuries ago we must impress them with our determination so that this never happens again are we agreed he looked about the tent at the nodding heads our cause is just vartan said the celestial actuary will be with us may the celestial actuary have mercy on the souls of our victims lara told them wars are always said to be just for one reason or another and the celestial actuarys name is always invoked with righteous piety by warriors about to go into battle she sighed sadly pity those we must kill to make our point my lords remember lady lord roan said that it was hetar and not the outlands who began this trouble aye and i am shamed by it as well as saddened lara replied my innocence when i left the city was as much of mind as body my loyalties however are with the outlands roan of the aghy not hetar i did not doubt it lady the horse lord replied i merely meant to point out that if pity is to be extended it should first be offered to the tormod and the piaras lara bowed politely i stand corrected my lord she said graciously he smiled wryly at her and returned the bow not having expected such a courteous reply he could see vartan was irritated with him but then vartan was hopelessly in love with his beautiful halfling wife and apt to be a bit of a fool over her lara moved into the shadows of the tent briefly returning with a tray of goblets let us drink to our success my friends she said offering the goblets about each man and woman in the tent took up a goblet and raised it as they looked to vartan and lara who murmured softly in her husbands ear to justice vartan toasted and to the men and women of the outlands who believe so strongly in it to justice and to the outlands came the enthusiastic reply we will all depart at the same hour vartan told them that the element of surprise work against all our enemies make certain none escape you to warn the last two villages in the hour before the dawn the clan families were assembled and slowly moved out the fiacre in one direction the aghy in another and so forth within a very short time lara could see no one but those with whom she rode she reached down and caught her crystal star between her thumb and first finger her heart beat very rapidly and her belly was filled with cramps that rolled rhythmically through it like a melody i am here she heard ethnes voice say do not be afraid fight well if need be and you will live to see another day my child what do you mean if need be she asked her guardian you will see soon enough ethne replied now strengthen yourself body and soul lara daughter of swiftsword and look ahead to what is to come ethnes flame flickered and then died to a miniscule point of light within the crystal they rode through the autumn forest the sky above them was beginning to lighten but they could see that the day would be a grey one without the warmth of the sun on their backs petruso rode with them for their objective was one of the three piaras villages suddenly the nowsilent chieftain raised his hand calling for a stop he turned to vartan and pointed through the bare trees vartan moved his horse slowly through the thinning woodlands and saw they were atop a small hill below them lay the village it was silent which the fiacre chieftain thought odd though early it still should have been bustling with the activity of a new day his blue eyes carefully scanned the settlement and then he saw it in the center of the village square a large farm cart piled high with bodies a shudder shook his large frame had they been betrayed were the bodies those of the villagers he backed his horse up to where petruso lara and liam awaited him there is a wagon in the square filled with dead he told them petruso grew pale he pointed to himself several times vigorously vartan understood and shook his head i dont know have we been betrayed and if so by whom nay lara said suddenly ethne told me to fight well this day but then she qualified it by saying if need be when i asked her what she meant she said i should see we must go into the village at once i think petrusos people made brave by the songs of the devyn last night have slain their captors they hide now awaiting the arrival of their saviors but still in fear of the mercenaries vartan nodded she is right he agreed he raised his hand to signal his troops forward he called to them and his wife at his side led the forces of the fiacre down the hill into the village petruso was off his mount almost immediately he ran to the cart examined its contents and then began to laugh waving his sword into the air with glee people of the village vartan called out your lord petruso has come home to free you this day you shall rejoice come forth and welcome your lord home for the longest moment all was quiet and then a door opened and another and another as the people of the village poured forth to greet their saviors petruso began to weep both with happiness and with sadness as they came forth the villagers were as gaunt as wraiths their cheeks hollow their eyes sorrowful but they stumbled from their dwellings crying joyfully surrounding petruso touching him kissing his hands where is the devyn bard vartan called over the noisy greetings here my lord a tall slender man a harp upon his back came forward i am adrik of the devyn he said bowing politely to the lord of the fiacre what happened here vartan asked i came as i was instructed the hetarians were surprised to see me until i explained i was a bard a singer of songs a teller of tales who traveled the outlands as they seem to have a similar tradition they were not suspicious of me i suggested they allow me to perform for their workers pretending i thought all here was as it should be they agreed and a great fire was made and set ablaze in the village square the workers crowded about the fences penning them in the mercenaries came with the women of the village making a great show of fondling and kissing them before their husbands and sons who were helpless to do anything other than look away and so i first explained to the hetarians each song i would sing before i sang it then i would sing in our ancient language not the song but the message we had agreed upon i warned the listeners not to reveal their joy before their captors lest the mercenaries realize i was not telling them ancient tales of the outlands and while i sang the faeries whispered in the ears of the leaders the names of the traitors so that they might kill them in the night the village men broke out of their enclosure quietly killing any mercenary in their path they entered their houses one by one and killed the intruders there when they reached the cottage where i was housed i explained to them that one must be left alive to drive the cart of dead bodies from each village back to the city as a warning and so one mercenary in that last cottage was spared they have imprisoned him in the cellar adrik the devyn bard bowed with the conclusion of his tale petrusos eyes shone with pride at the story he tried to speak but only grunts and garbled sounds emerged he wept with his frustration lara laid a comforting hand upon his shoulder i believe i know what you would say my lord will you permit me to speak for you petruso nodded eagerly and taking laras hands in his kissed them in thanks be silent vartans voice boomed lara daughter of swiftsword wife to vartan chief of the fiacre will speak to you in the lord petrusos name heed her voice his fierce glance swept the square and all its inhabitants seated upon her stallion dasras lara look out over the crowd and began to speak lord petruso would have you know how glad he is to be among you again he regrets the sorrow you were caused by being told of his death this lie was perpetrated by his pursuers who when they could not capture him deceived their masters rather than admit the truth it has been to our advantage that they did however for in their arrogance the enemy posted no sentries he escaped with lord imre of the tormod and several others in order to reach the gathering that they might gain the aid of their fellow clan families and so we have come the fiacre the aghy the blathma the felan the gitta and the devyn are all here to free the piaras and the tormod to force hetar to honor the treaty signed so long ago between us we will not relent until the mercenaries are sent from our lands never to return lara looked to petruso as dasras moved restlessly beneath her the lord of the piaras nodded and then he kissed laras hands again she smiled a radiant smile at him and then turned to her husband will you tell them of our plans my lord as we stand here in your village square vartans voice boomed the other villages in the tormod and piaras are now being retaken but for two that is why no mercenary can be allowed to escape tomorrow we will strike at fulksburg the lord imres own village to take it back restore your lives as best you can where is your headman he must regain his position as we need to move on to fulksburg the headman was killed by the mercenaries a voice in the crowd said then it is your duty to choose another before the sun sets vartan counseled them your village cannot remain without a governor we leave you now for we take fulksburg tomorrow he turned to petruso will you remain the chief of the piaras shook his head vigorously in the negative vartan smiled i thought not you would be with us to the end eh petruso and vartan laughed heartily if i were you i would want to be here too they rode on now following the trail on the map marked with their clan color arriving at the singing caves by early afternoon the caves were so named for when the winds swept through them it sounded as if a choir was singing the winds from different directions each sounding quite different the other clan families were already awaiting them and all had the same tale to tell the villages they had been assigned to storm had either already been retaken by their inhabitants made brave by the knowledge the devyn imparted or the villages had risen up in revolt when their saviors had entered them ready for battle there had been no deaths among any of the clan families but there were minor injuries imres own village fulksburg would not be so easy for it was larger as was quartum petrusos home village which is the softer target vartan asked imre and petruso as they sat in council after the evening meal we have been fortunate so far but such luck cannot last i do not believe we can take two more days in this endeavor we cannot be sure that none escaped the villages retaken today to warn these last two targets they must both be dealt with on the morrow my lords i agree roan of the aghy said let us split our forces half will attack fulksburg and half quartum quartum is more a market town said accius of the devyn both piaras and tormod trade there its only mine is one that has always yielded us exquisite gems he turned to imre what think you is it an easier target than fulksburg perhaps and perhaps not imre said slowly he looked to vartan it has more streets than fulksburg and those streets wind vartans next question was for accius we will march early but what we do must be based upon more knowledge than we have can your people scout the two villages and meet us along our route i shall dispatch them immediately accius replied some of us have an ability that others do not we can see in the dark it is an inheritance from a faerie ancestor long ago i shall gather my night seekers and send them out vartan said if we must split our forces roan of the aghy will lead the blathma and the gitta i will ride with the felan and the devyn will that suit you all he gazed about the circle where they all sat and his companions nodded again then it is settled accius at first light your scouts must meet us at the crossroads where the road divides the paths for fulksburg and quartum it is then we will decide if we fight as one force or as two the council dispersed each chieftain returning to his own clan family lara watched as several devyn warriors slipped from the caves she sat quietly as the fires burned down to small flames and hot coals the caves sang the softest lullaby as the winds from the west were light tomorrow there would be a battle and she would be in the thick of it her belly roiled with the certainty should she be afraid she wondered aye only a fool would not be afraid but that fear would not keep her from doing what must be done she had always loved her homeland she had always been proud of hetar its laws its civility its order to be hetarian was to be the best now she realized it was but a counterfeit hiding the deceit and rot that was growing within hetars heart and soul a sanctimonious hypocrisy that would spread like a virulent contagion into the outlands if they did not stop it now but could they it would be but a temporary accomplishment if hetar wanted the outlands if they needed them they would come againand next time they would send the crusader knights for they would consider the safety of hetar now at stake if hetar wanted these lands they would tell whatever lies they needed to in order to rouse the people and bring them beneath the banner of war it had been a very long time since hetar had fought a real war but the carts of bodies would be held up to prove the savagery and lawlessness of the outlanders the mercenary ranks would once again be filled with innocents eager to share in the glory this war would bring to hetar lara shivered what is it vartan said coming to sit by her side i am seeing the future she told him it is terrifying this little war we fight is but a temporary solution hetar will come again i fear then what can we do he asked her sometimes vartans innocence was endearing but at other times she worried over it just what we are doing lara answered him there is no other way what will happen in the end he said i dont know lara replied perhaps a new world will come of this all i just dont know my husband come to bed he said you must rest if only a little he stood up drawing her with him and when they lay together beneath the fur coverlet he put his arms about her that is nice lara said and suddenly weary beyond all she slept in his embrace in the misty predawn hour they rode forth from the singing caves the air was now completely still and oddly warm for late autumn they came out of the forest and traveled along a hardpacked wide dirt road at the crossroads they were met by the devyn scouts who had gone out the night before the news was both good and bad accius listened to his men and then he said the hetarians have deserted quartum and joined with their fellows at fulksburg obviously one or more escaped from the other villages and hurried to warn the mercenaries in those two villages it was decided that quartum with its narrow streets was too dangerous a place to be caught and so they have decided to make a stand at fulksburg they may have sent someone to the city as well lara said our victory today must be a decisive one my lords they may even come out to meet us so much the better vartan declared he turned to face the assembled clansmen we fight as one brothers and sisters quartum has been deserted and the hetarians await us at fulksburg a great cheer arose as weapons were raised and the horses danced and snorted nervously at the noise dasras turned his head and spoke to lara i will protect you as best i can mistress concentrate on using andraste and leave me to guide myself i will keep us from danger best that way you may have your head lara answered him and i thank you she reached down to touch her crystal fight well lara you will be protected she heard ethne say they moved out along the road to fulksburg and the skies turned bright blue above them as the sun crept over the horizon lara wondered how many of them would live to see the sunset and then on the flat mountain plain ahead of them they saw the hetarian mercenaries awaiting them the outlanders stopped their ranks opened and the carts from the five retaken villages piled high with the dead and driven by a single survivor from each particular village rumbled forth to be displayed to the enemy in hopes of disheartening them a groan arose from the mercenary ranks then a single man rode forth from the hetarian forces he drew his horse to a halt halfway between the warring parties and waited without hesitation vartan rode out to meet him when he had reached the mercenary he said i am vartan lord of the fiacre i am odar of the mercenary guild i have come to offer a truce vartan laughed you offer us a truce there can be no truce you invaded the outlands in defiance of an ancient treaty that has kept the peace between our peoples for centuries you enslaved the tormod and the piaras you have committed murder and rapine now we have come to take back what is ours we have already regained all the villages but this one now we will regain fulksburg and because we are not the savages you seem to believe we will return your bodies to your masters in the city as a warning to keep to the treaty in future i propose a solution to a battle odar said we will each send a champion out and whichever wins shall gain these territories your people shall not be slain nor shall ours just one man from each side and the matter will be settled again vartan laughed you obviously do not understand odar of the mercenary guild we will not cede one inch of our lands to hetar not now not ever return to your troops and say a prayer to the celestial actuary that you will die well this day then the lord of the fiacre turned his horse about and rejoined his fellow clansmen what did they want lara asked anxiously when her husband rode up next to her she had to let vartan rule but he did not know hetar as she did first they offered a truce and when i refused they suggested one man from each side fight it out and winner take all vartan said no roan half shouted i told them no that we would not give up any of our lands vartan explained prepare the troops we are ready for battle lara you and noss must remain behind here on this little rise i know your willingness to fight but i want you safe no she said quietly and andraste began to vibrate against her back i am protected and not afraid now if you force me to stay vartan i will leave you what transpires today is part of my destiny a most important part you must trust to that he closed his eyes for a long moment then opening them he nodded very well lara i swore to you that i should never stand in the way of your destiny and i will keep my promise even though i am afraid for you do not be vartan i swear to you that i am better protected than any here today i will see todays sunset and tomorrows sunrise as well ethne help me she called out in her mind help me to take his fear away else he be killed in his concern for me put your hand on his forehead just for a moment ethne replied you alone are capable of removing his fears the magic in you grows stronger with each passing day lara reached out and placed a hand against her husbands forehead you will not fear for me vartan you will know i am protected and worry only about yourself she told him quietly to his complete surprise vartan suddenly felt the weight that had sat upon him rise up and disappear his mouth dropped open with amazement lara laughed softly it is time my lord she said what did you do he demanded of her i banished your fears my lord did i not she replied aye most thoroughly he admitted can you do the same for me lady roan of the aghy asked her with a grin i do not have to for you are fearless my lord lara returned with a small smile like me you love no oneexcept perhaps yourself she amended he laughed aloud and then the battle horns began to sound from the enemy side lead the second charge vartan ordered roan who nodded and then the battle for the outlands began in earnest as the armies from both sides charged each other the thunder of horses hooves arose into the morning air the clash of weapons quickly mingled with the cries of the wounded and dying the outlanders were ruthless in their pursuit of the hetarians soon the battlefield ran red with blood and it was difficult not to slip or fall steam from both animal and human ascended from sweating bodies noss and several of the other archers remained on the rise their deadly arrows singing in the morning air as they sought and found the invaders easily slaying them as the hetarians began to fall in greater numbers it became easier to fight on foot lara slipped from dasras and with him at her back she fought off the mercenaries who seeing she was a female thought her easy prey and with each soldier who engaged lara andraste began to sing louder and louder sending terror into the hearts of those who would die that day i am andraste the sword sang in its rich voice and i drink the blood of the unjust the blood of the invader the blood of the wicked lara felt strangely exhilarated as she fought how odd the thought twisted through her consciousness that a girl meant for passion and pleasure should become a warrior but then suddenly a man engaged her in battle and to her shock she recognized him although he did not at first recognize her with deliberate fierceness she forced him to his knees he struggled to arise but could not and she saw the terror in his eyes as he realized he was but a hairs breadth away from death yield to me wilmot son of mistress mildred lara cried yield to me and live continue to fight and despite my love for your mother i will slay you the mans sword blade fell away from andraste who are you that you know my name he asked her confused i am lara daughter of john swiftsword she answered him surprise lit his face his sword dropped from his hand he didnt know if he believed her but he could fight no more i yield he said wearily as around him the last of the hetarians met their just fate and the battlefield grew silent she took a strip of leather from her saddle and bound his hands before him then mounting dasras she led him through the battlefield and up the small rise that the outlanders had held at the beginning of the engagement the survivors were even now gathering there well at least one of us thought to save a hetarian to drive the last wagon roan chortled he was covered with dirt and sweat and blood and had a rather nasty gash on his thigh that had cut through his leather trousers who is he vartan said no one of importance ill wager rendor of the felan remarked scornfully his name is wilmot and he is the son of the woman whose hovel was next to my fathers mistress mildred was my grandmothers friend and she was always good to me when i recognized him i spared his life for her sake for she has no one else they would give his hovel to another leaving her homeless lara explained in hetar if you have no family and no means there is no provision made for you the elderly are considered to have outlived their usefulness which is why they must rely upon their family to survive lara replied if you cannot contribute to society you are deemed worthless it is their way vartan it is a poor reward for those who have given what they could her husband said looking to wilmot when you return to the city mercenary tell your mother of my wifes kindness and tell her should you die and leave her destitute mistress mildred will be welcomed by the fiacre clan and in vartans house there is always a place by the fire for the old ones among us he turned away from the prisoner how many of our own have we lost he asked his fellow chieftains surprisingly few roan answered seven from among my people five each from the felan and the gitta the blathma are either incredibly fortunate or better fighters than i had thought for they have lost only two and floren has not a mark on him although i am told he broke two swords in his enthusiasm blood is an excellent fertilizer floren said calmly four of the fiacre are lost and noss sustained a small wound when her bow string broke vartan said accius only one of our people accius replied we may be poets but our swordsmen are the finest in the outlands blades and verse are our twin passions he chuckled imre and petruso they have survived vartan asked looking about we have imre replied we are anxious to go into fulksburg and tell the people that we have prevailed and quartum must be notified as well you two go ahead vartan suggested we must load at least two more wagons and they must begin their journey today back to the city the sooner the high council receives our message the better it will be for us all imre and petruso rode toward the village and the clansmen began to fill first one cart and then another with the dead bodies all weapons leather breastplates and helmets however were removed from the bodies they would be divided among the victors wilmot sat stunned as he watched the activity going on around him he was still very frightened and couldnt believe he would really escape these outlanders unharmed he began to weep softly in his fear and relief seeing it lara dismounted dasras and came to sit next to him you need have no fear wilmot you are safe now are you thirsty or hungry nay wilmot was silent for a short moment and then he burst out how came you to be among these barbarians lara daughter of sir john swiftsword were you not meant for a great pleasure house in the city that was the rumor rumors are not always truth lara said to him the head mistress of the guild of pleasure women told gaius prospero that i was too beautiful and she would not permit me to be sold into any of the citys pleasure houses that i was already causing much dissension by the very possibility i might soon be a pleasure woman so i was sent from the city with the taubyl trader rolf fairplay lara began and then she continued on explaining her stay with the forest lords how she had escaped them her sojourn with the shadow princes and her arrival in the outlands she did not however mention her faerie mother or the relationship they now had and i discovered that these people are nothing like it is said in the city lara told wilmot they simply prefer a less complicated way of life they are orderly and live by their own laws but how do they live he asked we were always told they were bandits and thieves who preyed on travelers lara laughed the fiacre the largest of the clan families raise cattle the aghy horses the felan sheep the blathma and the gitta are farmers the devyn are poets and bards the two clan families whose lands you invaded are miners of ore and gems they trade back and forth amongst each other taking only what they need from the land and restoring the land where it is necessary did you not see the beauty of the countryside before your greedy masters began destroying it do you not know why the piaras and the tormod were invaded gaius prospero the master of the merchants was behind it we were told these people violated hetars borders raping and killing innocents wilmot said confiscating their lands was to be their punishment and by expanding our own borders we would protect hetar lara shook her head wilmot these clan families live in peace each within its own borders meeting only once yearly at a time called the gathering the only roads in the outlands are here in the mountains they have been made so the carts from the mines might traverse the land easily are you aware that when the clan chieftain of the piaras protested hetars invasion they cut his tongue out that the women of the villages have been used as pleasure women their young daughters saved for those among you who lead is this our vaunted hetarian civilization and justice wilmot he looked at her both sadness and confusion in his gaze i have known you all your life until you left us lara daughter of sir john swiftsword he finally said i did not know you for a liar but what you say is so hard for me to comprehend when you came into these mountains wilmot were you attacked no your mercenary force swept down on the surprised villages capturing them and forcing the people into bondage did you find the village in which you stayed barbaric or rough were those people savage to your eye or were they civilized their homes far better than the hovels in the quarter you and i have known i will admit to being surprised wilmot said but when i remarked on it my captain said it was because they had stolen the furnishings from hetarian homes yet i had never seen their like before neither in the quarter nor the marketplaces because your captain lied wilmot perhaps he did not know and said what he believed to be true lara said but all you have been told of the outlands is untrue and you came here of your own free will he asked her i did along with the young daughter of another mercenary who was sold into slavery her name is noss and she was the archer who remained here on the rise shooting with such great skill at your mercenaries her husband would not permit her to enter the heart of the fray lara said the outlanders accepted you readily he asked her they did and the clan lord of the fiacre made me his wife she told wilmot where did you learn to fight as you did today he inquired i was taught by the shadow princes they say i have a destiny lara answered he nodded i think they must be right then pausing a brief moment he said to her what will happen to me now lara daughter of sir john swiftsword we have allowed a survivor from each village we took lara explained you are to drive the carts of bodies back to the city this is our message to the high council they must abide by the ancient treaties we will not allow our lands to be invaded by hetar if they understand this the peace between us will be restored you must tell the high council that the outlanders are not barbarians they simply wish to be left alone in peace as it has always been the high council how could i gain their ear i am a mercenary and not even one of rank he said two of the provinces voted against breaking the peace lara told him seek out the coastal kings or the shadow princes she advised he looked surprised how can you know this lara smiled wickedly we have friends she replied tell whoever you speak with that lara daughter of sir john swiftsword and wife of vartan lord of the fiacre sent you they will hear you out gaius prospero cannot be allowed to use the council to his own advantage ever again shall i attempt to speak with your father wilmot asked her tell him i am well and happy lara responded would he care she wondered and tell your mother i send her my regards i hope she is well she misses your family he admitted you and your brother in particular she will be happy to learn that all has turned out well for you vartan joined them it is time he said to wilmot some of us will escort you to the border separating the outlands and hetar you must reach the city and there may be those who for their own purposes seek to stop you or even take your life wilmot for the sake of your people the truth must be known and spread throughout hetar my lord i am frankly fearful for my life now wilmot said gaius prospero is a powerful man if he would engineer a war with the outlands then it is likely there will be war there was a rumor in the city before we left softly spoken but heard by many ears that gaius prospero would be called upon by the high council to become emperor of hetar for the first time in memory life has grown difficult for hetar when times are difficult the people clamor for change in hopes that change will bring prosperity once again if what you say is so lara noted then you will be safe for gaius prospero will use the seven wagons of dead to his own advantage yet we have no choice but to send them vartan replied i know lara responded the five survivors from the other villages were now led forth and boosted up on their wagon seats wilmot climbing into the first wagon they moved off horsemen of the aghy riding on either side of the wagons the winter war was over once imre and petruso were settled in their fiefdoms again once the other clan families had donated supplies to get them on through the winter life could again return to what it had been before hetar had been foolish enough to invade the piaras and the tormod yet why lara thought silently to herself did she sense that this was but the beginning chapter gaius prospero a perfumed handkerchief pressed to his nose stared unbelieving at the seven reeking carts piled high with their dead the stench was unbelievable and he wondered that the drivers of these horrific wagons could stand it but they sat stoic and unmoving upon the benches of their transports holloweyed and gaunt and staring at him as if he were responsible why have you brought your burdens to me he demanded aloud because we were told to bring them to you my lord the man on the first wagon spoke up actually we thought to drive them up to the door of your fine home but the guards would not allow us inside they sent for you instead how could this have happened gaius prospero said as if to himself they are uncivilized barbarians they are not even united under one government but live a tribal life they are savages bandits wilmot held his tongue as he listened to the master of the merchants ruminations he was good at holding his tongue it aided in his survival all these years but he had been in the outlands long enough to learn that while the society there was different from that of hetar it was not the uncivilized place the government wanted them to believe it was he wondered if the outlands were not perhaps more civilized than hetar in a way how did this happen gaius prospero demanded to know the armies of the outlands overcame us and obviously knowing they were coming the villagers rose up against us wilmot said succinctly the other men nodded in their agreement what else was there to say and why did you six survive was gaius prosperos next query it was decided beforehand to spare one man from each village to drive the wagons wilmot answered there were seven villages and there are seven carts the master of the merchants noted sharply why are there but six of you the mercenaries from quartum joined those at fulksburg to make a stand one man from the other villages had escaped the outlanders and had come to warn us wilmot reported they were too many for us they fight well all were slain but me because you were the best of the mercenary fighters gaius prospero said sarcastically rolling his eyes in disbelief i have fought in the ranks of the mercenaries for over thirty years my lord but i was spared because the last warrior i fought in combat that day was someone known to me that is why i survived at fulksburg wilmot said in hard tones who could you possibly have known among the outlander warriors gaius prospero demanded in a suspicious voice how could an ordinary mercenary know someone with that kind of authority give me his name it was the wife of the armys general who spared me my lord wilmot replied he was frankly enjoying having this man who would be emperor squeeze the information from him bit by bit his conversation with lara had opened his eyes to things he had been avoiding for several years now you fought with a woman and lost gaius prosperos tone was derisive the wife of lord vartan is a great warrior my lord there were enough woman warriors among the outlanders to be noticed they are fiercer than their men who are the best fighters i have ever encountered wilmot said and how came you to know the wife of this lord the master of the merchants asked was she one of those used as a pleasure woman by our forces nay my lord wilmot forced his face to remain impassive then who was she gaius prospero almost shouted she is lara daughter of sir john swiftsword my lord wilmot said her family lived next to mine when she was growing up recognizing me she spared me for my mothers sake my mother and her grandmother were good friends and my mother was always kind to the family he was curious to see what gaius prospero would say now he waited what the look on gaius prosperos face was a study in amazement you are mistaken you must be my cousin the taubyl trader sold her to the head forester for a pleasure woman though they do not as a rule cohabit with those not of their blood he was so taken with her beauty he could not resist my cousin said the forester paid a fortune for her she escaped the forest lords wilmot said with the aid of a forest giant they fled to the desert and from there lara went to the outlands where lord vartan saw her and wed her she is greatly respected among the outlanders and she is a great warrior how did such an exquisite creature meant only for pleasure and passion become a warrior gaius prospero wondered aloud the shadow princes gave her the skills along with a sword that sings as she fights wilmot told him she is a power now to be reckoned with my lord the master of the merchants considered a moment and then he said the high council must be convened at once to decide upon the disposal of these bodies take your carts to the edge of the city and wait for our instructions then turning away from wilmot and his companions gaius prospero hurried back into the safety of the golden district a waiting cart took him back to his home entering it he called for his secretary jonah and told him of the conversation he had just had you must not allow this fellow to speak with the high council my lord jonah said there are those among them who did not approve this little expedition into the outlands these carts of dead will become a platform for them to use against you you must take the advantage while you can but how gaius prospero said by publicly disseminating the fact that our good men are dead slaughtered by a barbarian force who grow stronger each day and may soon be bold enough to attack hetar itself threatening the very foundations of our world we will shout down anyone who attempts to declare it is our fault for invading the outlands in the first place soon the real truth will be forgotten and with time and repetition the tale we choose will become the real truth we will rouse the people against the outlands and those who have stood against us in the high council will be silenced they will have to join us in our fight or be declared traitors to hetar jonah smiled a cold smile there is much acreage in the outlands for the taking gaius prospero considered slowly and their mines have brought us incredible wealth in these last few months i am sorry to lose them even temporarily and the outlanders are strong my lord you can build your own private army with some by allowing them to retain their own properties within their villages the rest of them will fill the slave markets of hetar making labor cheaper and our profits greater jonah chuckled the more powerful gaius prospero became the more powerful he became the richer his master became the richer he was he had already purchased his own freedom from the master of the merchants while agreeing to remain with him if the impossible dream could be gained and gaius prospero became hetars emperor jonah knew he could convince his master to make him his prime minister and he would gain a lordship he had already chosen a motto for himself make haste slowly he forced the smile back from his lips what of lara he asked would she not make you a magnificent empress my lord jonah did not like the lady vilia whose eye was too sharp the lady vilia was far more intelligent than her husband and could not be manipulated as could gaius prospero she would have to be put aside when their plans came to fruition the master of the merchants eyes glowed you know how difficult it was for me to let her go dont you jonah you are the only one who knows that how very much i wanted her i watched her in the bath through my peephole as tania bathed her had her virginity combined with her beauty not made her such a valuable commodity i should have taken her before i sold her if her exquisite faerie beauty has not been destroyed she will make me a perfect empress when the time comes women like that but grow better with each passing day my lord jonah soothed his master encouraging the fantasy but he wondered about the truth of her warriors skills if it were true would she not prove a dangerous opponent lara in their brief acquaintance had showed him an intelligence rarely found in women if it were now combined with faerie magic she could prove deadly but let gaius prospero have his dream there were other beautiful women with whom to tempt the master of the merchants when the right moment came first things first and the first thing was to deflect the blame for the loss of the mercenary force sent into the outlands but jonah was not quite as quick as he should have been with his scheming wilmot had driven his cart through the city his companions behind him until they had passed back through the main gates and parked their vehicles wilmot jumped down from the bench on his wagon his posterior was numb with soreness he did not know the men who had traveled with him they were new to the mercenaries but he suspected if he gave an order they would obey it they looked tired and dispirited easily manipulated remain here he said i must go quickly to the quarter and reassure my old mother that i am safe he told them they nodded two of them were already falling asleep upon their wagons their heads nodding in weariness hurrying back through the main city gates wilmot made his way to the small council quarter like all the other exclusive quarters it was gated and guarded wilmot sighed he knew his appearance would count against him with the guards but then he recognized one of the men at the entry an elderly mercenary no longer fit for serious fighting who had managed to obtain duty as a guardsmen walking up to him he greeted the old man sim it is wilmot i have just returned from the outlands i recognize you sim responded and the two men shook hands i heard it ended badly well it would have wouldnt it aye it ended worse than badly wilmot said listen i must see one of the council a shadow prince or a coastal king it makes no difference but i have a message for them from the outlands and there are some who would stop me is this treason sim said low ill have no part of treason wilmot it isnt treason i swear it wilmot said the shadow princes and the coastal kings voted against the incursion last year gaius prospero was council head then and his vote tipped the balance that led to the troubles every man but the six of us saved to drive the death carts died because of the greed some of our leaders encouraged sim my message comes to those who advised peace from those who would have the ancient treaties restored if that is treason i will fall on my own sword for wanting it prince lothair is in right now sim said softly his apartment is in the rear of the building on the top floor overlooking the gardens go and the old guardsman deliberately turned his head away so that he did not see wilmot enter the residence where the council members lived the mercenary was very nervous more so even than prior to battle he had never seen a shadow prince before let alone met one he climbed the stairs to the top of the building and knocked upon the door it opened immediately and he was ushered into prince lothairs presence by a rather ordinarylooking manservant wilmot bowed most politely to the prince who was garbed in shimmering dark silk robes what message does lara send me he asked wilmot the mercenarys mouth fell open with his surprise but then he closed it these men from the desert were magic everyone knew that my lord you know that hetar entered the outlands late last year our mercenary forces were told to put the native population beneath their heel for they had raided hetar beyond their borders killing looting and raping we were to make all ablebodied males toil in the mines for us the ores and the gems were to be sent back to the city the elderly among the barbarians were to be slain the woman and children ours to do with as we chose those who sent us lied my lord prince yes i know lothair said quietly when the other lords of the outlands learned of this incursion into their lands they came and they slew all but six of us we were sent back to the city driving carts filled with our dead we were to take them to gaius prospero and we did he ordered us back outside the gates while a council is called to decide what to do my life was spared by lara daughter of sir john swiftsword and now wife to vartan lord of the fiacre wilmot continued i knew her as a child and she spared me she said for the sake of my elderly mother the lords in the outlands send this message to the high council restore the ancient treaty between our two lands and there will be peace between us as there was before this incursion they have repaid in kind the suffering that the piaras and tormod clan families endured during this illegal and unjust occupation you and your allies on the high council are warned to beware gaius prospero and his ambitions wilmot bowed again that is all my lord prince he started to back out of the room but lothair raised a hand nay remain wilmot you must come with me to the high council and repeat to my fellow councilors what you have told me the shadow prince said gaius prospero will have me slain for it my lord wilmot said i will be called traitor and my mother will be sent from our hovel to wander homeless and helpless did not lara offer your mother sanctuary wilmot howhow did you know that my lord prince the mercenary was astounded lothair smiled but did not answer i can see your mother is taken to safety wilmot today within the hour then you will be free to speak the truth before the council will you trust me how do you know lara wilmot asked i am he who taught her to fight lothair said with a small smile i trust you then my lord prince the mercenary replied she fought with skill and with great honor he shook his head wonderingly i would never have thought a girl so fair would become so fierce yet she is more beautiful than when i last saw her before she left the city over two years ago ferocity is a quality that can apply to both pleasure and battle prince lothair replied now sit down and i will bring your mother to you he waved his hand while murmuring several unintelligible words and there was a flash of light when it had faded mistress mildred stood in the center of the room looking quite confused mother wilmot was on his feet to reassure her then he quickly explained the situation that had saved his life and returned him to the city you must go to the outlands to lara mother for your life both of our lives will be in danger when i have spoken the truth before the high council the guild of mercenaries was lied to not that that would have disturbed our captains some of whom may have known we invaded and abused a peaceful people and we have paid for it with our lives i must speak the truth but i cannot until i know you are safe will they kill you mistress mildred wanted to know perhaps wilmot said their sole rationale has become profit as the merchants themselves i know for a fact that a portion of the ores and gems mined in the outlands was given to our guild in exchange for our service once each month we were permitted to take a single small gem for our pay but the captains took more they will be loath to have their greed and corruption uncovered and may well try to have me killed then i would just as soon die too my son you are all i have the old lady said i do not know these outlands which are said to be barbaric why would lara welcome me if she is all you have said then she is a great lady now she does not want to be bothered with a homeless old woman my son no i will remain here the mercenary looked distraught perhaps another solution the prince said would you be content to live in the house of sir john swiftsword mistress mildred you should be in the city and privy to all the gossip that this national problem will engender and wilmot could visit you well mistress mildred said slowly aye i could be content in the garden district if they would have me but perhaps susanna has become too grand for her old neighbor from the quarter my lord i will inquire mistress but for now you will remain in the sanctuary of my home with your son the prince said he had offered this remedy to calm the old woman but he had no intention of following through it was too dangerous for laras family the door to the chamber where they spoke now opened and a man similar in appearance to prince lothair entered i heard we had visitors he said with a smile this is my brother eskil lothair told his guests and then he introduced wilmot and mistress mildred to his companion prince he serves with me on the high council now lothair clapped his hands and the manservant was immediately there take our guests to their rooms he instructed the man i will see you both for the evening meal you will be safe here with me when they had gone he explained the situation to eskil once he has spoken before the high council they will no longer be safe in the city eskil said i worry less about gaius prospero than i do his secretary the ubiquitous jonah he walks within a cloud of ambition gaius prospero is merely greedy for anything his pudgy beringed fingers can grasp gold power beautiful women gemstones food good wine nay gaius prospero doesnt frighten me but jonah is a dangerous man but he must move carefully or lose everything lothair responded we yet have time to put a stop to this expansion especially now that the outlanders have given hetars forces such a thorough beating gaius prospero will be eager to place blame on anyone but himself for this debacle it is up to us to see he accepts the responsibility of defeat as well as the profits of success he will go to the people eskil said and fill their minds with confusion we must reach them with the truth first and have them place the blame where it belongson the thick shoulders of the master of the merchants lothair suggested with a wry smile we will need help eskil said i will call upon laras kin the forest faeries lothair answered do not interfere with her destiny brother eskil said i will not lothair promised but do you want to see an emperor ruling hetar an emperor named gaius prospero the faeries will unravel the confusion in the minds of the people that the others will attempt to sow you know that if the people are vocal enough the high council will heed them if only to save themselves it is only when the people become so tired with the games played by their politicians that men like gaius prospero can prevail we both know that change is coming to hetar but the time is not quite right but if we allow gaius prospero to interfere in what must be who knows what damage he might cause we must consider all aspects of this situation eskil nodded nonetheless we must get wilmot and his mother to safety after he has spoken i would not put it past our adversary to attempt an assassination in the garden district john swiftsword or a member of his family could be harmed we cannot have that lothair either they go to the outlands or they come to us in the desert there is no other way and they must understand that wilmot will and he will make the decision lothair said a knock at the door and a messenger entered bowing a meeting of the high council has been called for this evening my lords at the sunset hour we will be there and our thanks lothair replied that was quick eskil said when the messenger had departed go and listen to see if gaius prospero knows if wilmot is missing lothair said i will call ilona to gain her help eskil nodded and disappeared into a shadowy form that was quickly gone lothair went to a cabinet and took out a round green crystal sitting down he held the crystal between his hands and said ilona queen of the forest i call on you for your aid come to me now the room was silent and then there was a puff of purple smoke and ilona was there what is it you want prince lothair sit oh queen and i will tell you he said do not dawdle old friend thanos my mate frets if i am gone too long and my son still sucks at my breast lothair quickly sketched out the situation for ilona finishing with his request for aid how can i help you must set the tiniest of your faeries on the shoulders of the people so that when they are told the lies that gaius prospero would have them believe they will not believe we must keep him from gaining too much power i will honor your request lothair how fares my daughter ilona asked well i am told she is wife to vartan of the fiacre she has become a great warrior and is respected by his people lothair said has she given him a child ilona asked not yet to my knowledge the prince answered then she does not love him the queen of the forest faeries said sadly or she does not believe the time is right for a child lothair replied perhaps ilona considered thoughtfully she is human as well as faerie the times are unstable and lara has always had excellent instincts i will go now lothair my faeries will aid you then ilona was gone in another puff of purple smoke an amazing creature the prince thought and while she had never known her mother until recently lara was very much like her he called his manservant and gave orders that wilmot and his mother be fed a good supper tender our regrets and tell wilmot i will come for him when it is time yes my lord prince the servant responded and bring me something to eat and some wine it will be a long night just before the time came for the meeting of the high council eskil returned gaius prospero does not know wilmot is gone from his cart he thinks the mercenary a stupid man who will blindly obey he has spent the last hour arguing with his wife who does not trust jonahknowledge we might use to our advantage eskil said with a wicked smile the lady vilia is a power to be reckoned with i think i think her love for her husband could be her downfall lothair noted one must be totally ruthless when dealing with a man like jonah ah wilmot he said to the mercenary who had entered the room you are well fed i hope and your mother settled for the night yes my lord thank you i did not tell her that the council meeting was tonight for she would fret wilmot said you must make a choice and make it now lothair said after the meeting of the high council i will transport you both from the city your mothers presence in the home of sir john swiftsword could endanger him and his family i will send you to either vartans hall in the outlands or to my palace in the desert you will both be completely safe in either place we will go to your palace my lord prince the warm dry air will be good for my mothers old bones and winter is setting into the outlands now wilmot responded lothair nodded your mother will awaken there then and you will go to sleep there this very night he promised it is little enough i can do to repay you for your bravery tonight gaius prospero will once he is over his shock attack you and the story you tell but we will defend you wilmot he is not head of the high council right now only the representative from the midlands it is our good fortune that one of the coastal kings now sits at the councils head and two of his brothers are on the council with luck we may be able to put an end to gaius prosperos ambitions at least for the interim come now we must go stand between my brother and me and we will be transported wilmot put himself between lothair and eskil he wasnt as frightened now as he had been earlier these were good men though they might have great magic but he closed his eyes we are here lothair said softly wilmot opened his eyes and gazed with amazement about the council chamber never had he thought to see it the room was round there were eight carved wooden chairs with high backs set upon a marble dais encircling the room they were arranged in twos in the center of the chamber was a round piece of marble upon which a ninth chair had been placed it swiveled about so that its occupant could face whoever was speaking feel free to look about you lothair murmured you are not yet visible to the members of the council nor will you be until it is time for you to speak the fellow next to gaius prospero is squire dareh the lord of the midlands next to them are the two forest lords now serving in the council they are lord albern and lord everard on the other side of the foresters are the coastal kings delphinus and pelias the council head is archeron ah he is here we will begin wilmot looked down at his hands he could see them he pinched his arm and jumped with the sensation unable to help himself he looked directly at gaius prospero and made a face but while the master of the merchants appeared to be looking directly at him he gave no indication that he had seen wilmot he was indeed invisible at once gaius prospero was on his feet i beg to be recognized he said sit down gaius prospero king archeron said rising i have something to say before you begin what will undoubtedly be a lengthy diatribe filled with impassioned rhetoric that in the end will amount to nothing but as your fellow council members we will be obliged to listen to you first however i will speak in my capacity as current head of this council he stood waiting as the master of the merchants took his seat again then he began almost a year ago to this very day my lords my fellow kings and the shadow princes advised you against a most dangerous course of action at the urging of the midlands and the forest provinces you chose to break the ancient treaty between hetar and the outlands and you gaius prospero as then head of this high council tipped the balance so hetar invaded a portion of the outlands murdered raped and enslaved the people you found there then you stole from their mines transporting much wealth back here to the city today we see the results of our foolishness seven carts containing the bodies of every mercenary we sent into the outlands have been returned to the city over five hundred men whose women and children will now be driven from their homes for the guild of mercenaries cares only for the families of those who give it service what is to happen to these women and children they must be housed and fed it is only right as their men gave their lives for hetar did you gaius prospero consider this when you sent those men into danger for the sake of profit and where is that profit it has not filled the public coffers to my knowledge or am i mistaken we will need funds to care for the dispossessed gaius prospero the master of the merchants jumped to his feet he was surprisingly agile for a man of his girth and years you cannot blame me for this tragedy king archeron he declared put the blame where it belongs with the barbarians of the outlands if they had not begun raiding into hetar it would not have been necessary to annex some of their territory are you suggesting that we should have stood idly by while this happened the outlanders never raided into hetar you fabricated that tale as an excuse to steal their riches king archeron said do you call me liar then gaius prospero blustered yes the word hung heavy within the council chamber unlike you gaius prospero who bleat and blow about a people you know not the coastal kings do know the outlanders our land borders that of the felan clan they are shepherds gaius prospero not raiders they gladly share their beaches and water supply with us and they trade with us the other clans raise horses cattle grain vegetables fruit and flowers one of the clans is made up of poets and bards the territories you attempted to annex not so much for hetar but for yourself were that of the mining clans they took from the earth only what they needed and they always restored the land in which they worked you came in and scarred their land while you stole its riches it will take the mountain clans years to repair the damage you have done he turned now to address the rest of the council do you know what was done to the clan families in the purple mountains their elderly were all slain because it was decided they were not useful and could not be fed the men and boys were all put to work in the mines and those who could not or would not work were slain as well the women and girls were used and abused by the invaders this kind of behavior is not our way my lords hetar has always been proud of its civility now history will remember this time as a time of dishonor and all because of one mans greed my lord king prince lothair had stood up that he might be granted the right to address the high council speak prince king archeron said it is no secret that my brothers and i opposed the invasion of the outlands today there came to me one of the survivors among the mercenaries to tell me his story and bring me a message from the lords of the outlands may he speak a liar a coward gaius prospero cried why else would he have survived the dreadful massacre that took our brave citizens from us do not listen to his words my lords they are false and filled with guile thus spoke the snake lothair murmured i would hear what this man has to say king archeron said and the other council members nodded although some less vigorously than others step forward wilmot the prince invited and the mercenary was suddenly visible to them all what magic is this demanded squire dareh of the midlands the kind sir that has kept wilmot safe from murder the prince answered you may speak to us wilmot king archeron said in a quiet voice my lords wilmot began i thank you for hearing me the reason my few comrades and i survived was that we fought to the end we were then chosen to be spared in order to drive these carts to the city i bring you a message from the lords of the outlands they did not begin this war but it is their hope that it is now ended that the ancient treaty between hetar and the outlands can be restored and what of reparations gaius prospero said angrily they are willing to accept the lives of those they slew as recompense wilmot replied he struggled to maintain a passive face for he knew that was not at all what the master of the merchants had meant by his question gaius prospero grew purple in the face he sputtered but no words came out this is most generous of the outlanders in light of the damage done to them king archeron said his blue eyes twinkling then he grew serious tell me of the occupation that we understand better wilmot it was hard all you have spoken is true my lord some of the people went mad with the slaughter of their elders and so they also were slain the loveliest of the young girls were imprisoned in the largest house in each village there our captains lived and these girls were made their pleasure women many were virgins others young wives the ordinary men were billeted in the village houses they used the wives and daughters for their pleasure did you king archeron asked wilmot shook his head i could not my lord what pleasure is there to be gained from a woman who is not willing i am too old a soldier to change my ways though i be mocked for it from the moment we invaded these villages i was wary my lords the people are not savages but people of dignity they live simply but well they are governed by a clan chieftain and each village has a headman or headwoman it is not hetar but neither is it uncivilized how is it king archeron asked that you were chosen to be saved i fought a warrior who spared me my lord wilmot said a woman he was beaten by a woman gaius prospero shrieked a woman the coastal king was intrigued yes my lord lara daughter of sir john swiftsword has become a great warrior wilmot answered she is a slave my lord albern the forest lord said she belonged to enda our head forester she murdered his brother and escaped that is not so lothair said you have been misinformed lara did indeed escape the forest lords and lived among the shadow princes for over a year it was then that enda and his brother durga came with a false document to attempt to reclaim her in clear violation of hetarian law we exposed their deception and when they attempted to force her to come with them lara defended herself resulting in durgas death although we did not have to do so we repaid enda the monies he had used to purchase lara and we paid a bounty for durgas death the forest lords have no claim on her this warrior woman spared you wilmot why archeron asked her father was once a mercenary his hovel was next to that of my mother and me i knew her all her life until she was sold into slavery so that her father might have his chance at becoming a crusader knight her sacrifice was not in vain she spared me for the kindnesses my mother had done her archeron nodded with his understanding and she has become a person of importance among the outlanders he asked she is the wife of their most important clan chieftain my lord he is vartan of the fiacre lara is half faerie my lords and she has it appeared to me gained faerie magic in her time away from hetar lothair what do you know of this king archeron asked she is the daughter of ilona queen of the forest faeries and john swiftsword she never knew her mother until she was with us we reunited them and ilona has indeed taught her child of magic it is as much a part of her heritage as her humanity who taught her to fight archeron probed further i did lothair answered him proudly i had a sword forged for her and imbued with my own magic her mother gave her a staff that possesses a soul kaliq the prince with whom she stayed gave her a fine horse trained for battle and a serving girl with a horse her destiny and that of hetars is entwined my lords you speak mumbo jumbo gaius prospero sneered lara is beautiful but not important what do you mean to do about the outlands they have stained their hands with our blood our dead cry out for vengeance the dead cry out for peace delphinus of the coastal kings said aye eskil the shadow prince agreed if the outlanders are willing to accept a restoration of the treaty then we are wise to accept it you men of the desert are always eager to avoid danger the forest lord everard scoffed and you men of the forest blow hot though you be cold lothair said you have no secrets that can be hid from the shadow princes my lord beware lest i reveal them to hetar do you understand me my lords albern and everard the two forest lords grew pale and were suddenly silent gaius prosperos ears almost visibly perked a secret a secret of such power that it could quiet the most contentious among them he must remember to tell jonah jonah could learn what was hidden that could frighten the foresters then he would have power over them i think king archeron said that we have heard all we need to hear it is my opinion that we accept the most generous terms offered us by the outlanders how do each of you vote dareh squire of the midlands ayeand do not frown at me gaius prospero this was an illadvised venture we cannot afford a fullscale war at least at this time the squire said gaius prospero nay the master of the merchants said with illdisguised anger albern and everard of the forest lords we will abstain from the vote my lord albern said and everard nodded in agreement abstain gaius prospero almost shrieked you were eager enough last year the two forest lords ignored him king delphinus aye king pelias aye prince eskil aye prince lothair aye the vote is five ayes one nay and two abstentions a majority votes that we accept the outlanders offer now will you agree to burying our dead with discretion the high council members all agreed though gaius prospero was reluctant and will you agree that the guild of mercenaries must be made to care for the women and children left behind they cannot force them from the hovels or deny them a daily ration the guild must rebuild its ranks gaius prospero protested where are these new men and their families to live you will cause riots if you do not give them what they have always had many new to the ranks will be men alone have the guild assign them to hovels the women in residence can care for them if a man comes with a family then place two widows with their children in one hovel and give the other hovel to the newcomer king archeron said it is not that difficult a situation to manage gaius prospero and you will go to the guild to explain it all after all you are partly responsible for what has happened even if you wont admit to it now if no one has anything else to say in the matter i will call for the vote the vote was taken and it was unanimous for while he feared the mercenary guilds outrage gaius prospero feared more being called unsympathetic by the people things had not gone at all as he and jonah had planned tonight he needed time to think time to consider his other options time to speak with his clever jonah he would go to his favorite pleasure house to his favorite pleasure woman the fair anora would know just how to soothe him she would calm his fears with her sweetness and her sexual skills he had been bad and he needed anoras whip on his bottom he needed her initial disapproval and then finally her approval when she permitted him to have her body he would not go home to the carping vilia who claimed she loved him he did not want her love he wanted anoras sweet abuse he always felt so much better after she had punished him her whip was good for his manroot the high council is dismissed king archeron said i will give the order for the mercenaries to be buried come wilmot lothair said and he wrapped his dark cloak about the man i will take you to a place of safety now your mother is already there he was not really afraid but once again wilmot closed his eyes and when a moment later the prince said they had arrived he opened them he was standing in a small comfortable room his mother was sleeping peacefully in the bed you are in my palace lothair said and you will be well taken care of here your chamber is next to your mothers my servants will see you have everything you need you are free to wander in our valley of horses you will meet og the forest giant who aided lara in her escape from the forest lordsyour news of her will be of interest to him when my time in the city is done i will return here and we will talk further you are a man used to work and so we must decide what you will do thank you my lord lothair wilmot said gratefully nay thank you the shadow prince replied i had expected a worse fight tonight but archeron was more than wellinformed the squire is a decent fellow at heart i could see he thought of his own folk when you spoke as for the forest lords we know their secret and that is how we will keep them in line from now on but without your testimony we might not have had so easy a time did lara really kill the head foresters brother wilmot asked curiously yes she did it was her first kill and we were proud she found the courage durga was the head forester then not his brother enda but when this younger brother was reminded that durgas death meant his own elevation he began to feel less aggravated about the head at his feet lothair chuckled then with a wave of his hand he transported himself back to his apartment in the city where eskil was waiting for him the other shadow prince was lounging with a rather large goblet of wine in his elegant hand they are safe and he smiled when lothair nodded helping himself to wine and sprawling upon another couch i followed gaius prospero to a pleasure house eskil said the people in the streets have been roused against him it seems he chuckled they cried out insults at him and shook their fists i think he will be busy restoring his reputation for some time and we need not worry we must always worry lothair said gaius prospero will be concerned with his good name but jonah will be considering ways to advance his masters career and so advance his own he is more the enemy than the fat merchant lordling my brother who will send word to the outlands eskil asked i will speak with king archeron tomorrow they must send a delegation to the outlands but to whom they have no central government and we do not want to insult any of these clan family chieftains archeron is the current head of the council it must be his decision but i suppose if they want we can go to discover the best way of handling this matter for them tomorrow but now i need sleep i have done much magic today then rest my brother for we will probably be in the thick of it tomorrow i suspect we must work swiftly lest gaius prospero try to subvert our will the people will keep the master of the merchants busy for the interim lothair said with a smile it will be a difficult winter here in the city and they will blame him for it too then drinking his wine down he sought his bed gaius prospero was so distraught by what had happened and by the peoples disfavor as he had ridden through the streets after the council meeting that he remained two days at his favorite pleasure house when he finally arrived home he learned that his wife had taken their children and gone to their country house it is better my lord jonah said we have work to do have you any idea of what has happened i lost complete control of the high council the squire voted against me why he has suddenly gained a conscience i do not know gaius prospero said irritably and the coastal kings were more than wellinformed jonah they knew everything and so did those damned shadow princes and the people cry out against me as if i was responsible for the deaths of our mercenaries but i did not kill them the outlanders killed them if anything good at all came out of this it is that i have learned the forest lords have a great secret and the shadow princes know it i want to know it jonah if the outlands are out of my reach for now perhaps the forest realm is not there has always been too much of it in my opinion if i can learn this secret then perhaps i can control the forest lords indeed my lord you could jonah murmured his facile brain contemplating the possibilities there were trees to be cut and turned into lumber for the booming building trade they would harvest the trees on the edge of the forest first which would open up more land for the midland farmers the squire would stop complaining about the incursion the city was beginning to make into his midlands and they could regain his trustand more importantly one hundred percent of the midlands vote in the high council so much to do jonah thought and then he recalled the motto he would take one day make haste slowly he smiled and then remembering where he was he said perhaps my lord we acted too hastily in beginning our annexation of the outlands let us consider our other alternatives what of the people gaius prospero wanted to know we will soothe them but not quite yet allow them the opportunity to express their anger then at the midwinter festival you will release some foodstuffs from your warehouses you will recall the festival was established long ago to help take peoples minds off the gloom and scarcity of the season this generous gesture on your part will go a long way to easing the tensions now between you and our citizens you must go to the guild of mercenaries for me gaius prospero said of course my lord jonah responded smoothly tell me what the council desires done and i will speak with them i could not do without you jonah gaius prospero said of course you could my lord the secretary flattered all i have learned i have learned from you and you are the most respected man in hetar gaius prospero smiled well pleased i am arent i he agreed if vilia is not here then perhaps i shall return to anoras arms for another day or two you have enough to keep you busy do you not indeed my lord i do jonah agreed his clever mind already pondered the opportunities presenting themselves with this new turn of events chapter i will go to the outlands archeron the current head of the high council told his brothers delphinus and pelias my term of office ends with the next moon cycle let lothair transport you pelias said i do not trust gaius prospero in general but right now he suffers from the peoples displeasure and may try to seek revenge on those he feels have wronged him i understand a mob attempted to storm the golden district yesterday they were shouting his name combined with some most unfavorable epithets they seem to be holding him entirely responsible for what happened to the mercenaries the crusader knights were called out to keep order for the guild of mercenaries would not their ranks are weakened and they must house and feed the widows and orphans of those killed in the outlands they are not happy about it they can afford it delphinus responded they received a fair portion of gaius prosperos thievery but i agree with pelias let lothair use his magic to send you home very well archeron replied he was a tall handsome man with wavy silver hair and eyes the color of aquamarines he disliked the city and would not mind avoiding a long trek through the winter landscape back to his own province where winter came only gently winter in the province of the coastal kings was a short season when the rains arrived on fair days the sun sparkled on the sea making it almost seem like a basket of the finest sapphires aquamarines and emeralds had been tipped among the waves with whom will you speak in the outlands pelias asked it would seem that the one they call lord vartan is their leader this lack of a centralized government in the outlands makes it difficult to know how to deal with them but i shall ask lord rendor of the felan for his counsel will you go to this lord vartan pelias wondered i do not know archeron replied it is rendor who must guide us in this matter so we do not offend the outlanders in our attempts to make peace again it would be so much easier to deal with them if we were cognizant of their customs but hetar has never before wanted to deal with them pelias said it has always been considered they were barbarians and best left alone yet we knew differently didnt we delphinus said archeron grimaced aye we did and so i suspect did the shadow princes yet there was never any need for us to share our knowledge was there how could we have imagined that any among us would attempt to invade the outlands we underestimated gaius prospero and his colossal greed something is changing in our world my brothers we have been too prosperous i fear and now the balance is tilting the other way there are more beggars in the streets now than ever before in my memory there are too many mercenaries and not enough work for them the farmers of the midlands seem unable to feed us as generously as they once did their land is worn out and the cost of our foodstuffs is rising yet the farmers see no new profits when the people grow unhappy and hungry they also become restless they begin to huddle with one another and talk on matters they do not fully understand eventually some among them will decide that our way of governing is responsible for their misery they will revolt against that government and whether they triumph or do not triumph matters not at all many will be killed which will relieve some of the problem for there will be fewer mouths to feed the damage wherever it is will have to be repaired so there will be work to be had a new government for good or evil will arise and prosperity will eventually return to put our world once again in balance he signed may the celestial actuary have mercy upon us my brothers you will be home shortly archeron pelias attempted to soothe him this has been a difficult time for us all once you walk along the golden sands by the sea and feel the clean wind on your face it will seem less distressing aye but the problem will still be there archeron said it will not go away hetars way of life the outlands way of lifeit is all changing i will speak with prince lothair delphinus said and hurried off the shadow prince was more than happy to take archeron home especially when he heard of the dark mood that had descended upon the coastal king his words frighten me delphinus admitted to the prince he has lived longer than any of us and we revere his wisdom sometimes he sees things as i believe he does now is this a vision of what the future of hetar is to be he is correct that things are changing lothair said but do not be afraid king delphinus everything changes eventually sometimes the change is so swift we do not really notice it and at other times the change is so slow that we can see it coming and we are afraid change whether for good or evil cannot be stopped i fear you feel it too delphinus cried lothair smiled and nodded when archeron is ready to travel come to me he told the coastal king i will transport him a few days later delphinus bid archeron farewell the high council was now in recess for the winter but it was necessary for the general council members to remain until their replacements came in the spring only the head of the council might leave back home in his spacious palace by the sea king archeron rested but the necessity of contacting the outland chieftains weighed upon him he sent a messenger to rendor of the felan asking that they meet in two days time on the seaside border between their two kingdoms there would not be time for the messenger to return and so archeron in the company of his son and heir arcas set off in hopes of meeting rendor at the designated spot to their relief he was there the two men both of whom knew rendor well embraced the outlander warmly inviting him to join them beneath a blueandgold striped awning that had been set up upon the beach there were chairs and servants who brought wine to the three men i have always enjoyed this air of elegance you bring with you rendor chuckled as he took a sip of the excellent wine we outlanders are a simple folk not so simple archeron replied that you did not destroy your enemy successfully and with flair the high council while shocked was most impressed by those seven carts of dead driven into the city by their gaunt and holloweyed drivers rendor chuckled wolfishly but then he grew serious it was unwise of hetar to invade our lands he said i hope they understood the message we sent to them they did and would return to the boundaries of the ancient treaties rendor archeron said quietly i have come to ask how we should approach the various clans and their chieftains we would not offend your lords and add to the problem the offense was in your attempt to annex a portion of our lands rendor answered but we have had our revenge and now wish to return to the way it was between us we have formed our own governing council because of this incident it is obvious to us that we can no longer live quite as separately from hetar as we have in the past the lady lara has convinced us of that though some would resist your high council needs to be able to speak to us as one when problems like this arise when was this council formed archeron asked rendor after the battle the clan chieftains met at fulksburg before we departed for our own lands the council is made up of our eight chieftains vartan of the fiacre was elected its head he remains in office until he chooses to step down or we vote to replace him which is unlikely his clan is the largest and vartan is both fair and wise with a beautiful faerie wife i am told arcas murmured the lady lara is a halfling rendor said quietly her wisdom is as much admired as her beauty and she is a competent warrior i have heard archeron said rendor grinned that sword of hers would frighten a demon he told the two kings it sings in a voice that goes from low to high as she battles and when it is time for the kill andraste sings of drinking the blood of the unjust and the evil a man could die of fright facing that ferocious sword and looking at that delicate beauty wielding it you would not expect her skill with a weapon she has a killers instinct arcas asked nay my lord not at all but her heart cries out for justice rendor said can you take a message to vartan from our high council archeron asked the felan chieftain if it is possible i should like to meet with him and apologize for the actions of our people against yours might he come to your hall or should i go to his i think my lord that he might enjoy seeing the coastal province i will ask but i will also offer him the option of having you come to him rendor said thank you old friend archeron said now please tell me you did not lose many men in that battle at fulksburg but five rendor said our losses were all minimal unlike those of hetar arcas and archeron laughed the outlander was enjoying his victory and they did not blame him if it had been theirs they would have done the same the three men finally parted and rendor rode back to his own home the next morning he dispatched a messenger to camdene relaying all that had been said at that meeting rendor hoped vartan would come to his coastal lands that he might meet with the hetarians he knew that vartan had never met any hetarians but for his beautiful wife and young noss if he was to lead the outlanders it was time that he did to his pleasure vartan agreed and he and lara returned with the felan messenger the two men greeted each other warmly and then rendor bowed with respect to lara whose beautiful golden gilt head bowed in return so the hetarians wish to return to life as it was vartan said with a grin aye although until you meet with king archeron you will not have the full tale which i suspect is an interesting one rendor replied he was as i wrote you willing to come to you at camdene do you wish him to come here to my village or will you go to him at his seaside palace i have been once and it is both amazing and glorious i think it is time i began to familiarize myself with hetar vartan said slowly he turned to lara what think you my life i have never been to the coastal province it is said the coastal kings are the true aristocrats of hetar lara said slowly i am curious to meet them but this decision should be yours my husband she looked to rendor you have become friends with these men i am told what think you of them i like them rendor answered they are a people filled with wisdom and honor we were cautious with each other at first but our friendship has bloomed into a true one i believe they are trustworthy and they did vote not to invade us last year that in itself speaks well of them vartan replied how do they live have they villages as we have and how many kings are there must i treat with each or have they a high king they are all it would seem of one family long ago it was decided that the head of each family branch would be called king that there be no quarrelling over the title each king leads a clan family much like ours the oldest of them in this case king archeron is recognized as the ultimate authority should disputes arise each family has a palace built into the cliffs by the sea these palaces are spread out to house all members of each family but i would not call them villages in our sense where does their wealth come from vartan wanted to know no one knows rendor replied they are as mysterious a people as are the shadow princes some say they may even be related by an ancient bloodline they have some magic but not as much as the shadow princes vartan considered and then he said i should like to see these palaces and i think my going to king archeron shows a respect for his position good manners is highly appreciated by these people rendor responded i will go with you husband lara told him of course he agreed though you have never been in the coastal province you are hetarianborn and will advise me to the best of your ability i know lara smiled and nodded to her husband he could not guess how much her knowledge of her own people would help him i would bathe she told rendor have you the means for it i have brought a special garment given to me by my shadow prince that i will wear i have told you how much the hetarians value appearance these coastal kings know of my background they know i was a humble mercenarys daughter and later a slave but they also know that my mother is a queen among her own people and that my skills were honed in the company of the shadow princes i cannot go with you looking like a warrior or a simple woman you would display your beauty before these kings vartan said an edge to his voice his look was hard lara shook her head have i not told you before that you must not be jealous husband he flushed i cannot help it he admitted low but you must she said you swore to me that you would not impede my destiny vartan and i warned you that my destiny would sometimes take me from you i must treat with these people in my own way if you are to succeed husband do not love me so much else i break your heart lara warned him softly my wife will see you have your bath rendor said jovially i have sent a message to king archeron that you are coming to meet with him vartan we will depart on the morrow for his palace it is but a days travel should we not wait for his permission vartan asked nay i told him i would send word when it was decided how you two would meet by tomorrow evening you will be welcomed into king archerons palace i will come with you i always enjoy the company of these hetarians lara enjoyed the bath which rendors wife rahil provided for her guest she poured a small bit of scented oil into the hot water pinning up her hair so it would not get wet rahil sniffed appreciatively as the perfumed steam arose from the water seeing her lara said do you like it here she handed the small vial to the woman i think a woman should always have something lovely to enjoy my thanks rahil said smiling then she added i have never seen anyone as beautiful as you lady you are careful to hide it in your warrior womans garments but here in your bath as the celestial actuary created you i see how dangerous a burden that beauty is for you to bear will you display it before the coastal kings i must for my legend precedes me lara told her as she washed herself like all hetarians they will be impressed with vartan for having such a wife because of your good husband they have already begun to make friends among the outlands now we must obtain them as allies for if i remember gaius prosperos passion for profit his incursion into the tormod and the piaras is but the beginning of our troubles she stood and wrapped herself in the drying sheet rahil handed her you think hetar will attack us again rahil said wideeyed yes i do lara replied i will know more after we have spoken with the coastal kings and i have heard the story of the carts entering the city that was a very powerful lesson people in the street ordinary citizens in the city saw those carts with their dead more families than not have blood kin among the guild of mercenaries and those among the dead with others dependent upon them for their daily bread would have those family members wives children parents left now without a home or a means of support they would lose their homes rahil was aghast there are only so many hovels and they must be kept for those who give service to the guild lara said and they call us barbaric rendors wife said angrily lara slipped into a simple gown and braided up her hair again i have found the outlands more civilized than the city she said quietly now how may i help you with the supper my servants are welltrained and have it all in hand rahil said but you could pour the frine she was impressed by the fact that lara had offered to help she might be a great lady but her human side was mannerly after the meal vartan and lara were taken to their host and hostesss own chamber when vartan protested rahil told him it was an honor for the felan that the new head councillor and his wife would sleep there then bowing she left them vartan cautious by nature threw the bolt on the door and turning about found that his wife had shed her garment he smiled a slow smile you mean to palliate me wife she smiled back holding out her hand to him yes she said he pulled his own garments off dropping them upon the floor when the coastal kings smile at you i will want to kill them i know she replied when they gaze upon your beauty and desire it for themselves i will hate them for it he told her you will she agreed amiably when i see in their eyes the image of the dreams they will have of coupling with you i she put her hand over his mouth but you are the only man i desire vartan she told him they cannot have me if i do not wish it and i do not she stood before him and pressed herself against him even as she took his sinewy arms and wrapped them about her i desire you and you alone my husband but you do not love me he said looking down into her small upturned face you know i do not believe in love she replied then how will you give me the son i desire of you he asked seriously he could feel every inch of her delicious flesh as it pressed against him seductively i know that faerie women do not give children to those they do not love i am only half faerie she responded softly her pointed tongue encircling the shape of his ear teasingly do you not want me husband his length was hard it throbbed between them witch he groaned yes he wanted her more at this moment than he had ever wanted her but it was always that way each time they lay together no matter how much he took of her no matter how much she gave of herself it was never enough for vartan he wondered if it ever would be he wanted to hear her tell him that she loved him but it would seem along with her faerie beauty she had inherited a cold faerie heart nonetheless he could not resist her i love you lara he told her and then he picked her up and laid her upon the bed that awaited them his big hand caressed her small heartshaped face his mouth taking hers in a passionate kiss his long fingers tangled in the soft golden hair with its gilt highlights so soft he thought as their mouths drank of one another everything he touched was soft and smooth and yet beneath it she was like iron he rolled onto his back drawing her atop him as one kiss blended into another and another then she drew away from him and sitting up began to caress his broad smooth chest with her hands her emerald eyes gazed into his meltingly and he felt weak but for his manroot which raged pinned beneath her round buttocks reaching up he began to play with her breasts and when he teased at her nipples she teased at his in exchange pinching them lightly bending to lick at them he lifted her up and impaled her slowly upon his manroot with a deep sigh she sank down enveloping him within her body taking him deep into her heated flesh leaning back and sighing again ride me he growled at her feeling her thighs close against him as she steadied herself with her hands tightening her sheath around him as she pressed and released pressed and released until he began to make whimpering sounds for she was not yet ready to allow him his fulfillment raising herself she leaned forward so he might have the pleasure of her breasts his mouth closed about a nipple and he sucked on her hard until lara began to feel the tension building she leaned further forward burying her head in the space between his shoulder and his neck she felt his hands closing about her rounded buttocks kneading them as she thrust and thrust and thrust against him finally unable to endure any more of her sweet torture vartan turned them so that lara now lay beneath him he thrust and withdrew thrust and withdrew until it was she who now whimpered he was so attuned to her that he could sense her impending crisis and held himself back until they could attain pleasure together and then the heat enveloped them both they were filled with their passion and finally collapsed from their delightful efforts without another word falling into a peaceful sleep but lara before she closed her eyes touched the crystal she always wore as if seeking a reassurance from ethne that she would not allow herself to find with vartan in the morning she awoke before he did and she wondered if perhaps these feelings of protectiveness toward her husband and the yearning she had for his touch were not perhaps the beginnings of that so human emotion known as love she was not all faerie after all and if she had hardened her heart against love was it possible she had done it in order to survive what she must in order that she reach her destiny she was weary she realized of the knowledge she carried she suddenly had a great yearning to be just a simple woman to carry her husbands child within her body to birth that child and care for it stirring vartan drew her into his arms and she laid her head against his heart what are you thinking he asked her softly womans thoughts husband thoughts best kept to myself for now lara told him she wanted to spend the rest of the day in his arms and not be bothered by anyone but they had a long ride ahead of them give me a child my life he said softly to her and he kissed the hand on his chest a beautiful little girl like her mother in time i will give you a child vartan i promise you but now we must meet with the coastal kings and settle this matter between the outlands and hetar lara said he groaned today i am not of a mind to be diplomatic he said neither am i she agreed but we must do our duty and when we have made this fragile peace we will go back to camdene and settle in for the long winter and on the dark mornings we shall not get up at all but lie in each others arms and make love the whole day long and you will give me a child he repeated i will give you a son husband who will one day lead the fiacre as you now lead it lara told him and a daughter he reminded her first a son she said and then she climbed from the bed to wash the excess of their nights passion from her skin she would not meet the hetarians with the scent of lust on her body after she had bathed she donned a simple gown it was white and the skirt was fashioned in tiny pleats from her waist to her ankle there was a golden cord twisted about the waist that had tassels at each of the two ends the bodice was draped from its soft rounded neckline and the sleeves were full and floated to just below her elbow about her neck the golden chain with the crystal glittered she brushed her hair out so that it sat like a mantle about her he watched her dress fascinated i have never seen that gown before he said how were you able to carry it with us lara smiled at him kaliq gave it to me it is magic and made to fit within this small coffer she said holding out her hand to him in it lay a round wooden peach perfectly represented and polished so that the wood glowed with its natural beauty the gown can be anything i wish it to be in this instance the coastal kings wish to see the woman who was so beautiful that the head mistress of the guild of pleasure women would not allow her to be purchased the taubyl trader who took me from the city meant me for one of the coastal kings i am sure that rolf fairplay told them the story now i am indeed jealous vartan said as he arose from the bed and began to wash himself but having a wife whose wardrobe can be carried in a hollow wooden fruit is indeed a great advantage lara laughed our love play has improved your mood she told him he grinned back as he began to pull on his clothing it has he agreed the inhabitants of rendors hall could not help but gaze in wonder at the halfling wife of vartan of the fiacre but they were also a bit afraid she had not looked so beautiful the night before it seemed to them her magic was now quite obvious when they had refreshed themselves at rendors board they prepared to depart the horses were brought from the stables as rendor approached his own mount laras stallion dasras put a leg forward and bowed his head politely your hospitality was exceptional my lord of the felan the stallion said i offer you my thanks rendor bowed in return i am grateful it met with your approval he replied then he said to lara as he helped her into her saddle i do not think i shall ever get used to hearing that beast of yours speak with a mans tongue lady lara laughed his speech is a comfort to me she said adjusting her skirt which was hiked to her thigh she patted dasras lovingly we are friends you know shaking his head rendor mounted his own horse it is a short ride to the sea and then we shall ride along the beach until we reach the coastal kings have you ever seen the sea lady i know vartan has not for he has never before enjoyed the hospitality of my house i think it will amaze you with its vastness and its beauty though it was winter the air was very mild and the sun warmed their shoulders as they rode they rode first through grassy meadows filled with sheep shepherds and dogs who loped along with them for short distances some barking one irritating animal kept snapping at dasrass heels until the great beast stopped dead in its tracks the stallion turned his head and looked down at the yapping dog go home he said in a firm voice and stamped a single hoof the dog stood stockstill for a moment and then turning ran yelping back to his master dogs dasras said scornfully are more trouble than they are worth give me an elegant feline to keep me company in my stall cats are far better companions i assure you they laughed at the incident and moved on finally reaching the grassy bluffs overlooking a wide sandy beach that seemed to stretch for miles in both directions the horses slowly picked their way down the narrow path rendor leading lara behind him and vartan bringing up the rear there was no need for menatarms to ride with them here in the outlands gaining the beach lara brought dasras to a brief halt and stared in amazement the waters seemed to go on forever where did they end she wondered frothy white waves rolled in from the blue sea racing up the sand and then withdrawing the sound never ceased but it was pleasant and soon she did not notice it at all screeching birds hung in the air above both beach and sea what are they she asked rendor they are beautiful look how they soar and dive they are called seabirds nothing more he told her they rode on down the beach which seemed to go on forever stopping when the sun reached the highest point in the heavens to rest the horses eat and drink pouring water from their own water bags into shallow pans they carried for their animals why can they not drink from the sea lara asked rendor taste it he told her and she bent down to dip her fingers in the wave that came up to brush her bare feet its salty she exclaimed it is he agreed the sea is where the outlands obtains its salt the coastal kings supply hetar with it as well they collect sea water in great vats and dry it until only the salt remains after their short respite they rode on for the winters day was short as the sun began to sink toward the horizon rendor pointed ahead and said look we have almost reached the palace of king archeron my friends it is that close to your borders vartan asked we came over the border over two hours ago rendor said but there was no border station lara remarked we do not need it rendor responded we know where the border is the coastal kings keep to their side of it and we to ours it is easier that way we keep to the same standards as in the outlands he explained the rest of hetar may have border stations and guards but here along the coastland we think it unnecessary they heard music and looking ahead they saw a small procession coming out to meet them it was made up of young men and women wearing draped fabrics and flowers they danced and played upon lyre flute cymbals and drums as they came forward to meet their guests and lead them to the kings palace the travelers rode up from the beach their escort dancing and making music as they came and there upon a great marble terrace archeron waited to greet them on a lower terrace they dismounted and their horses were led away together vartan rendor and lara walked to meet the greatest of the coastal kings who stood with his son arcas by his side archeron came forward and took vartans hands in his own thank you for coming he said as their gazes met it would not have been possible to refuse your gracious invitation vartan answered i have a responsibility to the clan families of the outlands then you will accept a restoration of the old treaty archeron said if hetar accepts a restoration of our original borders vartan replied with a small smile it does archeron replied i shall notify the high council immediately then he drew his companion forth this is my son arcas our family will be his responsibility one day and if he lives to be as old as i am he will find himself with the responsibility of all the coastal province my lord arcas bowed to vartan but his eyes were fixed on lara you admire my wife vartan said in a deceptively bland tone i have never seen anyone so beautiful arcas replied candidly my lords you embarrass me with your words lara told them then ignoring them both she turned to archeron you are a man of peace king archeron and i am glad for it one day hetar will realize it as well and be grateful he took her small hand and tucked it into his arm come lara wife of vartan and i will show you my palace we have prepared a banquet in your honor together they walked across the terrace toward the white marble building its goldleafed domes and its slender soaring towers were now both bathed in the blazing colors of the sunset your palace is every bit as impressive as that of the shadow princes lara told her escort i remember seeing gaius prosperos home for the first time and thinking there could be nothing grander then i came to the desert but this she turned her green gaze sweeping back to the beach and the great sea beyond it what magnificence then she turned again and smiled up at him the interior of the palace was light and bright king archeron brought them to a banqueting hall where the members of his court awaited them their eyes went immediately to lara admiring her fair beauty so similar to that of the coastal people and yet so different vartan was taken aback for never before had he known such luxury but lara standing by archeron drew her husband to her side and slipped her hand into his isnt it beautiful she murmured to him i could not have imagined that people live this way he replied low this is my wife alina archeron said drawing forward a woman with silver hair like her husbands but eyes of lavender lady vartan said with a bow i must admit to being overwhelmed by such luxury we outlanders are simple folk the lady alina smiled sweetly i am frequently overcome by the luxury myself lord vartan she told him her eyes twinkling i was not born into the noble families of the coast my father was a fisherman our great extended family has those of both high and low station yet at the heirs bridechoosing ceremony i was the one to catch my acherons eye although i have been wed to my husband for over thirty years i am still amazed by such wealth come sit by me on the dining couch she invited him thank you vartan replied hesitant but then he felt a gentle nudge from lara and so he sat what is a bridechoosing ceremony alina smiled as she explained when a young man in our society reaches the age of eighteen years each natal day thereafter is marked by a special ceremony in which eligible maidens are displayed before him he knows instinctively which one is his mate sometimes he finds her in that first ceremony sometimes he must wait several years if that is the case the same maidens are never brought before him twice in this way we keep our bloodlines strong because the same families do not intermarry over and again it seems a wise custom vartan said may i ask when the king chose you he was twenty the year i came before him in the bride choosing she answered smiling fondly in her husbands direction lara sat with the king but on a single dining couch at archerons right hand sat arcas who immediately engaged lara in conversation while his father was involved with his duties as host rolf fairplay was right he said softly you are the most beautiful woman in all of hetar i would have paid what the head forester paid for you and more you would have wasted your monies my lord lara replied it is said i have a destiny to fulfill i would have run away from you as i did the forest lords it is not meant that i be a slave you would not have been he declared passionately i should have freed you the morning after our first night together you are not meant to be the wife of a crude outlander chieftain you are meant to live in a palace and be showered with all manner of luxuries lara laughed if that were so my lord arcas then i should be exactly where you describe but i am not am i prince kaliq gave me the freedom to choose where i would go when i left him i chose the outlands because that is where my instincts told me i should go she reached for her goblet and sipped delicately at the wine are your instincts never wrong he asked her as he ran a single finger from her elbow to her hand and his violet eyes met hers no she told him coldly have you any idea of how insulting you are being my lord arcas for now my destiny is in the outlands with vartan of the fiacre it will not remain there i understand that but i also know that you will not be a part of that destiny other than in a peripheral fashion i am sorry it is obvious you have always gotten everything that you desired as a child but you are a man now and lara turned away from the kings son he stared at her surprised no one had ever spoken to him in so blunt a fashion a trumpet sounded and archeron leaned over to tell lara i have a surprise for you my lady i hope it will please you he pointed to the doors of the banqueting hall laras green eyes widened with pleasure seeing the new arrivals as they came forth from the cloud of purple mist she arose to greet her mother ilona who came into the hall in the company of her mate thanos running forward she embraced ilona to the faerie queens delight come and meet my husband mother she said vartan was already on his feet wishing desperately that he was clothed in something more elegant but he owned nothing elegant the company here was much too rich for him he was eager to leave and return home to camdene lara brought her mother to him he took his motherinlaws hand in his and kissed it i am pleased we have this opportunity to meet queen ilona he said ilona looked the outlander over carefully her green eyes assessing him physically and peering deep into his heart to see if he truly loved her daughter what she saw pleased her but it also worried her vartan did indeed love laraperhaps too much still it was not yet time let the outlander have his happiness while he could i am pleased to meet you vartan of the fiacre ilona replied this is my mate thanos the father of my son cirilo laras baby brother thanos a courtly faerie man bowed politely are you pleased with my surprise archeron asked lara very much so she answered it has been some time since i last saw my mother i am happy then to have engineered this reunion archeron replied another dining bench was brought and the faerie queen and her mate reclined upon it as the meal was now served there were all manner of creatures from the sea some broiled in delicate wines and served upon beds of greenery with lemon slices red clawed creatures that had been boiled in their shells and served with drawn butter small rounds of succulent flesh set in dainty shells in a delicious cream sauce neither lara nor vartan had ever seen their like they carefully watched how their hosts ate these foods and followed suit there were silver baskets upon the table piled high with fresh breads kept warm by means of heated stones and bejeweled silver bowls of newly churned butter vartan particularly enjoyed the red shelled creatures cracking them open to extract the meat dipping it into the drawn butter he ate heartily lara leaned over to speak with her mother i do not know what to do she said softly to ilona the faerie queen did not ask about what she simply said what does your heart tell you daughter lara sighed i do not think i have ever heard my heart speak i have been told i have a faeries cold heart but you are human as well as faerie daughter ilona replied and faeries do not always have cold hearts lara that is a choice we make so we may protect ourselves in a world where magic is more often feared than not my heart was warm for your father you were born of the love i had still have for john swiftsword i sense i will need a cold heart for what is to come mother lara said it is not time ilona answered i tell you this though i probably should not but i cannot bear to see you so indecisive and unhappy as you wait to meet your destiny lara i honored your fathers request and kept from you as a child although i knew your fate i have done little for you but this i can do you have time my daughter these next few years are yours to do with as you please have the child you desire to give vartan it will comfort him when you must leave him let yourself love him but when that moment comes lara said you will do your duty my daughter because you were bred to do it whether you knew it or not as a leader you must know when to show mercy as well as strength if your heart is always cold how can you i have looked into vartans soul from the moment he laid eyes upon you lara daughter of swiftsword was his life he adores you and to refuse to accept such homage such passion would be foolish revel in it return it you will not be the weaker for it but rather stronger for unconditional love builds strength in those who will accept it and you will need all of your strength for the road ahead tears slipped down laras beautiful face i have wanted to love him she admitted but i feared to do so would weaken me ilona reached out and gently brushed the tears from her daughters cheeks no love does not weaken if my love for your father had weakened me i should not have been able to leave him to return to the duties i owed my mother and my faerie kin her green eyes suddenly twinkled i can see that vartan is much man no faerie girl would waste him do you love thanos lara asked her mother candidly in my own fashion ilona said but not like i loved john swiftsword i took thanos as a mate because it was necessary to produce an heir or heiress to follow in my footsteps i left that choice up to fate and birthed a son your brother cirilo will be the first king the forest faeries have had in three generations thanos understands for he had courted me for many years before i agreed to have him as my mate i do love vartan though i have never admitted it before even to myself i feared it would weaken me but as i think on it i realize his love does make me strong lara said i have felt like i was living on the edge of a sword mother it is a relief to know i may become a simple woman if only for a short time do not lose your skills ilona warned practice each day with both andraste and verica until your belly swells ride dasras regularly so his skills too may remain sharp remember this is but a respite for you lara when you are finally called you must be ready i am here for you kaliq and the shadow princes also do not hesitate to seek our advice when you need it outside the large windows of the coastal kings banqueting hall the creamy yellow moon of the province was shining down on the waters of the sea inside the feasting continued until very late and then the guests were shown to their chambers the bedchamber where lara and vartan would sleep was luxurious and yet deceptively simple in its elegance a great round window gave them a view of the sea a bed draped in diaphanous curtains of turquoise silk awaited them before the fireplace opposite the window was a large bathing tub filled with hot water and scented with freesia ill smell like a girl vartan protested as his wife began to slowly remove his clothing youll smell delicious she teased him as she unbuttoned the horn buttons on his leather vest and laid it aside her supple fingers undid the laces of his shirt pushing it off his shoulders her palms smoothing over his broad smooth chest just like a flower and ill be a little bumblebee coming to gather your honey lara stood on her toes and whispered buzz buzz in his ear then she pulled the shirt completely off wife he said husband she countered as she unfastened his leather trousers pushing them over his slender hips her hands now moving to caress his taut buttocks as she pressed herself against him seductively vartan grinned he could not remember lara ever seducing him in so bold a manner and quite frankly he liked it reaching out he unfastened her gown letting it fall to the floor then he lifted her from the pile of soft fabric her hands reached out to fondle him she raised her head up to gaze into his eyes and he kissed her softly at first and then as his arms closed about her and her arms slipped up about his neck their kisses became fiery demanding one blending into another until they were weak with passion they fell upon the bed bodies intertwined and she caught his face between her hands tonight husband we make a child lara told him a small smile upon her lips faerie women only give children to those they love he groaned and began the thrusting rhythm that would eventually lead to their mutual satisfaction yes she told him say it he demanded of her his loins afire with his hunger for her say it she laughed say what she teased him as she wrapped her legs about his torso he thrust harder and harder his manroot seeming to swell more as he pushed himself deep into the soft hot morass of her sex say it he groaned through gritted teeth say that you love me you faerie witch i love you lara told him and then the world exploded around them and in them as their pleasure reached its first heights i love you she told him as it peaked a second and final time and then as they lay together sated she said it a third time i love you vartan of the fiacre and i always will no matter where my destiny takes me but for now i am yours alone for now he was instantly alert because i love you does not mean i can deny my destiny when it is time lara said quietly i have never hidden this from you vartan i know you have hoped but while my time is not yet the day will come when i must leave you to fulfill that destiny she kissed his mouth tenderly we must take what we can and while we can my love how can you be so brave when my heart is breaking at the thought of ever losing you you are my life he said to her you will never lose me vartan i may go away but i will always love you lara told him do not think of that distant tomorrow my lord and my love think of the here and now think of the life we are meant to share of the child i will bear you from this love that has grown between us he sighed it was a deep almost painful sound we have time he asked her you are certain we have time so my mother says and i would never dispute the word of a faerie queen lara told him a small smile crept over his face then wife vartan told her we had best make the most of that time and his arms wrapped about her and his mouth found hers and lara wished that their time together would go on forever even though she knew better could happiness slow time she didnt know but she could hope bertrice small
