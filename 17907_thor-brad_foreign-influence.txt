brad thor foreign influence the ninth book in the scot harvath series for mark and ellen larue two of the most dedicated patriots i know thank you for everything you do for our great nation he who does not punish evil commands it to be done leonardo davinci prologue inner mongolia the strategic military outpost was such a closely guarded secret it didnt even have a name only a numbersite it sat in a rugged windswept valley far away from cities and centers of industry its architecture was minimalist a cross between a highend refugee camp and a lowrent university tents trailers and a handful of cheap concrete buildings made up its campus the only outward signs of modernity were the pizza hut burger king and subway mobile restaurant trailers which made up the outposts food court it was just after three am when the attack began lightweight predator sraw missile systems took out the fortified entry control point along with the watchtowers mortar rounds blanketed the campus obliterating key infrastructure and force protection targets when the heavily armed assault teams breached the perimeter the outpost was in complete chaos the welltrained soldiers tasked with s security were no match for the men who now overran their positions dressed in black with specialized night vision goggles and suppressed weapons the professional combatants appeared only long enough to engage each soldier with an economy of surgically placed rounds before slipping back into the darkness often before their victims lifeless bodies had even hit the ground at the main concrete structure a detachment from the assault team used a shaped charge to blow open the fortified door as they rushed in they heard the highpitched whine followed by the thump of a limited emp device being detonated it was part of s emergency protocol meant to destroy the facilitys data the men in black though didnt care their superiors already had a copy with night vision goggles impervious to electromagnetic pulse the men swept through the rest of the building making sure they killed every occupant from there they moved on and cleared two more buildings while their teammates took care of the remaining tents trailers and concrete structures fifteen minutes later three helicopters landed and the team was extracted as they lifted off and disappeared back into the inkblack sky not a single member of military outpost had been left alive london a man in a blue linen blazer pushed away the hand of his subordinate i know how it works he said placing the tiny bud into his ear and activating the video on the smart phone his liverspotted hands cradled the chrome device in his lap as he watched the scenes from mongolia it had been the most expensive and dangerous undertaking of his life though his club was actually a haven for members of the espionage community he also sensed the presence of some of historys greatest sociopolitical figures around him at this moment had he looked up to see the smiling ghosts of lenin stalin marx or mao he wouldnt have been surprised great men who change the world shared a bond that transcended time and he was on the verge of becoming just that a great man who would change the world though they were alone in the clubs library he kept his voice low were confident that all of their data was destroyed the subordinate nodded we have the only copy that remains and the personnel everyone associated with the program has been terminated the chinese have gone berserk trying to figure out what happened they have no idea who hit them excellent said the man in the linen blazer lets keep it that way now what about our network the network is fully intact and ready to go operational this was an incredible moment the man thought as he plucked the bud from his ear he removed the sim card from the phone and handed the device back to the subordinate i want you to initiate stage one as soon as possible so i have your permission to activate the network then you do and whatever happens dont lose sight of the bigger picture chicago alison taylor hadnt planned on going out drinking after work but it was a gorgeous summer night the sales presentation was pretty much complete and everybody else in her department was going it was supposed to be only one drink at rl but as things often go one drink led to another and then another the party worked its way south hitting pops shaws the roof bar atop the wit hotel and finally some seedy dive bar just west of the loop before any of them knew it it was four am and their presentation was in less than five hours to counteract the heavy volume of alcohol they had consumed someone had suggested the nearby pharmacy for charcoal tablets and caffeinated beverages but the idea was put on the back burner when they noticed that the tiny burger joint across the street was still serving theres nothing like grease to absorb the alcohol molecules in your system one of them said after cheeseburgers and fries they conducted an unsuccessful search of the pharmacy for charcoal pills loaded up on energy drinks and then headed for the subway since two of the women lived in the suburbs alison invited them to stay at her apartment where they could borrow clothes and head into work with her in a few hours the fact that one of the women was five inches shorter and the other seventyfive pounds heavier was lost on all of them in their drunken state they spent the subway ride cursing the bright lights of the train compartment downing red bull and wondering how much sleep they could grab at alisons before having to leave for the office at division street they stumbled up the steps from the blue line platform and out onto the sidewalk where they began to head east it was in the crosswalk at milwaukee avenue that the unthinkable happened a taxicab came flying around the corner and slammed into alison her friends watched in horror as she was tossed into the air and then landed headfirst fifteen feet away all of it had happened so suddenly everyone was in shock as the taxicab sped away into the night neither of alisons friends had even gotten its number the only thing they would be able to remember was the color of the vehicle and that its driver appeared to be middle eastern chapter basque pyrenees spain six days later in a sixteenthcentury farmhouse a dwarf known to intelligence agencies across the globe only as the troll lay bleeding to death as his house burned down around him he had made a very serious mistake but it wasnt until he had pulled his hands away from his throat and had seen the blood that he had realized just how serious there was no excuse he should have known better the woman had been too attractive too perfect too much his type she had described herself as an erotic gourmand with predilections ranging from troilism to chrematistophilia but it was her fetish for peculiar body shapes particularly dwarfismknown as morphophiliathat had convinced him they were perfect for each other and that he had to have her precisely because she had seemed too good to be true he had checked her out thoroughly when satisfied that she was legitimate and after having admonished the director of the academy as it was referred to for not having brought her to his attention sooner he arranged for her to be flown first class to bilbao there he had a car meet her at the airport and take her to the train station where she traveled southeast into the pyrenees from the moment her feet touched the ground in spain he had had her watched the nature of his business demanded that he be extremely cautious she had been advised to bring nothing but her passport and the clothes on her back he had requested her sizes in advance and assured the academy that he would provide everything that she would need when her train arrived in the sleepy mountain village another car was waiting the driver was professional and kept to himself as he made his way to the next transit point occasionally though the drivers eyes wandered to the rearview mirror to steal glimpses of her incredible beauty after dropping her off at a nondescript trailhead the car retreated down the rutted dirt road and disappeared two large men on horseback appeared from the thick forest of trees leading another horse behind them they each carried knives in their boots and sawedoff shotguns in short leather scabbards forward of their saddles after checking the woman for weapons they helped her atop her mount and led her up into the mountains the party rode for almost two hours and not much was said the men had been instructed not to make small talk with their charge finally they arrived at the farmhouse the men galloped off with the horses and she was left alone outside the little stone structure pushing open the front door she saw a long wooden table covered with a fine linen tablecloth upon it was set a myriad of gourmet dishes champagne sat in a sterling silver bucket a riot of exotic flowers exploded from a large crystal vase and sitting at the head of the table was the troll he was flanked by his two everpresent companionsa pair of white caucasian ovcharkas named argos and draco standing over fortyone inches at the shoulder and weighing over two hundred pounds each the giant animals had been the dogs of choice for the russian military and former east german border patrol they were exceedingly fast possessed a powerful urge to defend and could be absolutely vicious when the situation called for it they made perfect guardians for a man who stood just under three feet tall and had very powerful enemiesmany of whom were also his clients what the man lacked in height he more than made up for in charm and intelligence he had a sweet face with deep warm eyes he proved himself to be a perfect gentleman and his guest was more than happy to provide what he was paying for through intense carnal rituals such as the etruscan butterfly and erotic entrainment she took him to new heights of ecstasy they engaged in acts of sexual pursuit forbidden by even the most permissive of ancient societies for the two of them nothing was offlimits in fact the more outrageous or dangerous the act the more willing she was to indulge in it she surrendered herself completely infusing him with the greatest aphrodisiac of all and the antidote to his greatest insecurity power a devotee of erotophonophilia he twice pushed her right up to the very brink of death itself only to bring her back at the last possible second holding her life in his hands was an incredible feeling it made him feel like a god little did he know that she was slowly disarming him when they werent having sex they engaged in conversations of such intellectual depth that he felt he had finally met his equal though he knew he shouldnt he fantasized that their relationship might lead to something more he knew it was foolish but no woman had ever stirred such deep emotion inside him he tried to remind himself that this was nothing more than a business relationship but in his heart he still hoped gradually he was overcome when he realized that there was little if anything at all this woman could ask of him that he wouldnt do he knew she had conquered him and she knew it too her first request concerned his dogs the same two dogs that were never away from his side not even when he took her to his bed there was no need for her to make up excuses as to why she wanted the dogs removed the more rough their sex the more agitated the dogs became even the dwarf had to admit that his dogs were ruining the mood so into the hallway they went with the dogs safely at bay the woman didnt attack not right away she was an artist and true artists never rush their craft for her masterpiece to be complete she needed his total trust and so she led him on a bit longer after two nights of making love without the dogs in the room the time was finally right and the woman was ready she had saved her most erotic sexually charged game for last the little man wore a neatly kept beard he was fastidious about it and trimmed it with a pair of scissors daily to maintain the beard at his neck and cheeks he used an oldfashioned straight razor it was highly polished with an ivory handle she enjoyed watching him use it it reminded her of being a little girl and watching her father and she told him so it was the only truth about herself that she ever revealed this time she held out her hand for the razor he was hesitant it only lasted a fraction of a second but it was long enough for her to notice i want you to shave me she purred opening the razor and handing it back to him as she stroked herself as the dwarf obliged her the woman writhed in ecstasy atop his crisp white sheets despite the size of his hands they were surprisingly strong as was the rest of him he performed the delicate act with surgical precision when it became his turn he propped two pillows against the headboard and leaned back unlike some of the more unusual games she had instigated he had heard of this one before but had never trusted anyone enough to do it of course the game could be played with a disposable razor but that would have defeated the purpose the excitement came from the danger withdrawing the polished blade from the bowl of warm water she struck a coy smile as she began to hum the largo al factotum aria from the barber of seville and ran the razor back and forth along a towel as if it were a strop sweeping her long chestnut hair behind her neck she bent down and kissed him on the mouth allowing her heavy bare breasts to briefly brush against his chest then she began to shave him the pleasure was indescribable his senses were on fire as waves of sexual electricity pulsed through his body he licked his lips as he closed his eyes and arched his back that was when she struck chapter rome italy two days later professor tony carafano smiled as the last of his students two sophomores from the university of texas shuffled into the breakfast room of the twostar hotel romano and sat down good morning ladies he said as he removed his glasses and placed them next to his cappuccino carafano was a charming man in his early fifties he had gray hair and a large aquiline nose a feature he enjoyed pointing out which was not only the preraphaelite ideal of male beauty but which also placed him above the other summer abroad professors because he really had been born with a nose for art from assisi perugia and cortona to orvieto siena and the hilltop town of coricano tony carafano had used his sense of humor to baptize his students in italian art history he believed that when they were having a good time they learned more he also believed that if you were traveling throughout the country by bus with twenty strangers for six weeks the quicker you could get them all laughing the more enjoyable the trip would be he only had one rule no matter how late the students stayed out the night before they all had to be back by breakfast they were good kids sweet kidsthe kind of kids that parents had a right to be proud of none of them had broken his one and only rule the fact that they hadnt showed respect and it was mutual this was the best summer group he had ever had the pleasure of teaching and as much as his colleagues complained about the future of america these young men and women proved that america s future was bright quite bright indeed checking his watch carafano addressed the students i can see that some of you are moving a bit slower than normal this morning and im not going to inquire as to the reason i think i know why a wave of polite laughter swept the breakfast room when it died down he continued youve got ten minutes to load up on caffeine aspirin whatever it is that helps make you human and then i want to see everyone in the lobby checked out with their bags ready to go okay heads nodded and with the scrape of chair legs across the tile floor the students rose to get more coffee and return to their rooms to finish packing depending on traffic the professor knew that the drive south from rome to pompei would take a little over two and a half hours halfway there was a church with amazing mosaics that he wanted them to have plenty of time to study and sketch after that they had reservations for lunch at one of his favorite trattorias overlooking the bay of naples half an hour later the tiny hotel lobby was awash in a sea of suitcases and backpacks as a handful of students made one last dash to the breakfast room for coffee others helped the programs bus driver angelo load the bags into the belly of the bright yellow motor coach in the chaos of everyone checking out none of them noticed that one of the bags didnt belong to their group after a final head count to make sure everyone was on board tony carafano gave angelo the okay to depart as the italian maneuvered the coach through roman traffic the professor distributed the days itinerary walking down the aisle he found his students engaged in their morning ritual of texting friends back home checking email and listening to their ipods few were bothering to take in their last glimpses of one of the most beautiful and historically significant cities in the world with one of rome s most popular landmarks drawing near carafano called his students attention to it if anyones interested were about to pass the colosseum on our left some of them looked up many though were too busy it was a shame that even though they had all seen it before a thing of such wondrous beauty should go ignored especially considering what was about to happen as the bus pulled even with the ancient arena a spotter on a rooftop half a mile away removed a cell phone from his pocket and dialed the number he had been given six seconds later an enormous explosion rocked the city as the motor coach erupted in a billowing fireball chapter fallujah iraq the next day as his russian gaz sped down the dusty road omarhakim was fuming the local iraqi national guard commander had been engaged in plenty of blackmail schemes but always as the perpetratornever the victim next to him sat the man who had ensnared him and who had broken his hand when he had gone for his gun he never should have agreed to meet with him in fact he should have shot him on sight but now it was too late he was trapped and there was nothing he could do the man in question was a fortyyearold american who spoke arabic as well as omarhakim spoke english he was fivefootten with light brown hair blue eyes and a wellbuilt physique a navy seal who had been recruited to the white house to help bolster the secret services counterterrorism expertise the man had become a previous presidents favorite weapon in the war on terror but when that president had left office the mans tenure had expired now he was working for a private organization his employer was a legend in the intelligence world and had spent the last year polishing and honing the skills of the man who always deadly serious about his work now approached his life with a renewed sense of vigor he had a sense that somewhere a clock was ticking down it was due in part to a realization that his own time on the playing field was winding down but there was something more to it there was a sense of foreboding a sense that a storm was gathering and picking up strength as it sped toward shorehis shore america there wasnt a specific act or event he could pin his sense of foreboding on it was everything the movements and chatter and unending determination by america s enemies to hit again and again and again he and others like him believed that something else something different was on the way and they constantly reminded each other to keep their powder dry there were only two things any of them could do about ithunker down and wait for it to happen or get out there locate the threat and take the fight to the enemy headon scot harvath wasnt the hunkerdownandwaitforittohappen type looking at his gps device he activated his radio and said two minutes stand by roger that replied a voice from the neighborhood up ahead standing by the snipers had been in place for hours it was now nearing four am even though he couldnt see it he knew the drone was still above them on station via the combined air and space operations center he radioed for a final situation report from the drone pilots back at creech air force base northwest of las vegas press box are we still good to go that is affirmative came the reply tangos one through four are still in place thermals show that the heat signatures inside the target have not changed harvath didnt bother asking about the hostages he knew why there were no longer any heat signatures from them as they turned the corner the outline of their target could be seen silhouetted against the night sky it was time to go to the next phase of their operation this is it he said over his radio as he set the gps down on the seat next to him and adjusted his beret were going to sterile comms which meant from this point forward they would communicate only via a series of prearranged clicks in the two trucks following his the rest of the team made ready after checking their weapons they straightened the uniforms omarhakim had provided and donned their iraqi helmets power outages were a common occurrence in iraq per harvaths request the power to this neighborhood had been cut earlier in the evening the streets were completely dark at this hour even families with their own generators were sleeping remember what we discussed harvath said to omarhakim when the vehicles pulled up in front of the target i remember said the man harvath then motioned for him to get out in front of them was a house surrounded by a thick mud wall its entrance was a set of wide double doors fabricated from sheet metal and scrap wood a fistsized hole had been punched through each side a heavy chain padlocked from the inside kept them securely closed there wasnt a sound to be heard omarhakim sucked in his gut and attempted to ignore the throbbing pain from his broken hand harvath had warned him to leave it by his side and not draw attention to it the commander walked up to the gate and whispering so as not to awaken anyone addressed the sentry inside abdullah open up who is it replied a voice in arabic the iraqi bent his face down to the hole and spoke over the chain commander hakim you idiot what do you want omarhakim came from a large powerful fallujah family he was accustomed to being respected the insolence of the alqaeda sentry grated on him open these doors right now or ill tell assad youre the one who betrayed him to the americans the americans yes you idiot the americans they know youre here now open up so i can speak with assad before they arrive the sentry bent down and looked through the hole he studied the iraqi national guard vehicles ive brought extra uniforms and men to help you added the iraqi hurry up slowly the sentry removed a key from his pocket and placed it in the lock as he removed the chain harvath toggled the transmit button of his radio and sent two distinct clicks when the alqaeda man designated as tango one pulled back the gate the snipers engaged their targets muffled spits raced through the air the sentry on the roof was killed instantly as was the covert sentry positioned a block away a burst of radio clicks over the teams earpieces served as confirmation with his suppressed russian makarov harvath stepped from behind omarhakim and placed two rounds into the gatekeepers head the corrupt iraqi commander was no stranger to killing but the suddenness and violence of the act froze him in place he had no idea that this was part of the plan though he should have expected a raid on an alqaeda safe house to result in a bit more than hurt feelings while omarhakim was staring at the dead man harvath struck him in the head with the butt of his weapon the overweight iraqi collapsed to the ground as the rest of the team exited their trucks two men from the lead vehicle bound the commander with zip ties gagged him and threw him in the back they then took up lookout positions the rest of the team fanned out into the compound based on their intelligence there was only one obstacle remaining he was inside the rear of the house near the back door harvath had conducted raids like this so many times before that he could picture exactly what was going on inside all of the men save the remaining sentry would be gathered in the large room at the front of the house they would be sleeping on heavy fleece blankets purchased at the local market one or two might be up having tea if the power had been on a few more might have been watching jihadi videos more than likely a couple of them were having sex with each other homosexuality was so rampant among the jihadists that catching them in the act had stopped surprising harvath a long time ago as a matter of fact very little surprised him anymore even less shocked him a colleague of his in fallujah named mike dent had told him the story of a sixyearold boy named khidir khidir was the son of a local police officer two years ago while his father was at work members of an iraqi alqaeda cell had burst into his home and savagely torn him from where he was hiding behind his grandmother desperately clinging to her skirt the kidnappers wanted khidirs father shafi to help free several alqaeda members being held in his jail shafi knew how dangerous the prisoners were and refused to set them loose upon the citizens of fallujah he knew full well they would conduct more killings and put more families through the same horror he was experiencing the kidnappers promised to slit his little boys throat if he didnt comply but shafi refused to give in to their demands khidir had not been seen since dent had been so moved by khidirs story that he had made it his goal to help find out what had happened to the little boy as a civilian trainer for the fallujah police he spent a lot of time building a network of informants after a while he started to wonder if it had all been a waste of time when one day a contact passed along a rumor that a group of alqaeda members was holding several children hostage on a small farm outside the city with no funds to pay for any more intelligence dent had reached out to harvath he knew how harvath felt about children and to cement his assistance had emailed him a picture of a brighteyed smiling khidir taken before the little boys nightmare had begun three days later harvath landed in baghdad with his new bosss blessing an expense account and permission to do whatever necessary to bring the alqaeda cell to justice it took harvath dent and the team of contractors they had assembled in bribes and ten days to find the location of the terrorists pure hate for what they had done fueled harvath as he cobbled together the operation like dent since hearing the little boys story he had been living for this very moment each of the men would be the first through his respective entry point they moved quickly and quietly across the cracked brown earth of the courtyard harvaths team went to the front door while dent took the other half of the men to the back harvaths team put on their night vision goggles and when they all flashed him the thumbsup he signaled for the battering ram to come forward with his team in place he clicked dents team in back and gave them the goahead moments later there was the sound of splintering wood as the rear door was battered open and the remaining sentry was taken out harvath counted down from fifteen he could hear the shouts of the alqaeda operatives in the front room as they leapt from their beds and scrambled into the hallway that led to the back door harvath reached the end of his countdown and motioned for the assaulter with the ram to hit the front door the entry tool knocked the door completely off its hinges and harvath charged through followed by the rest of his team bottlenecked in the hallway the aq operatives were mown down with bullets from both sides the air was thick with the smell of blood and gun smoke when harvath called cease fire dents team moved up from the back of the house to secure the hallway while harvath and his team cleared the rest of the house they found the entrance to the spider hole beneath a stained rug in the main room one of the men said it reminded him of the hole delta force operatives had pulled saddam out of harvath looked down into the pit it smelled atrocious six sets of hollow halfdead eyes stared up at him everything is okay he said in arabic as he removed his night vision goggles were americans were going to take you home to your families in the beam of his flashlight he could see a shaft six feet deep that opened into a pit five feet square by three feet high for their bodily functions the alqaeda animals had left their child hostages only a rusted coffee can disgusting didnt even begin to describe the scene harvath sent one of his men outside to find a ladder and when he returned they lowered it into the pit the children were all male between four and eleven years old and were all sons of iraqi police officers in fallujah they had another thing in common all of them had been brutally tortured the oldest boy took charge and sent the others slowly up the ladder as they emerged they were assessed by the men of the team medically treated as necessary and wrapped in blankets as the oldest boy came into view he was quite upset and explained that there was still one child left behind badly in need of help is it khidir harvath asked hopefully the boy nodded gently moving him away from the shaft harvath climbed down into the pit what he discovered wrenched his heart out khidir was now eight years old and severely malnourished his eyes were set deep in their sockets and surrounded by black circles his once thick head of black hair had fallen out in clumps and he looked as if he had probably soiled himself repeatedly as harvath triaged the little boy he discerned that both his arms and legs were broken his left knee had a large iron nail driven through it and all the teeth in his mouth had been pulled out leaving behind infected gum tissue his breathing was shallow and came in rapid gasps harvath noted his elevated temperature and pulse the boy was shocky dosing a child for a morphine injection was a tricky gamble getting him up the ladder and out of the pit was going to be extremely painful harvath removed a preloaded syringe and injected half prep an iv he yelled up the shaft khidir was becoming unresponsive he needed to move him now cradling the child to his chest harvath shifted to the ladder and climbed using one arm at the top the medic gently took the little boy from him laid him down and began an iv assads dead but weve got two survivors from the hallway said one of the men from the team what do you want to do wheres dent hes processing them outside are they stable enough for transport asked harvath the man nodded cuff em and stuff em with omar you got it the medic looked up from khidir and said to harvath in addition to four broken limbs and septic shock he has a collapsed lung i can give him some more morphine so hell be comfortable but hes not going to make it that was unacceptable the little boy didnt deserve to die being the son of a policeman should be an honor not a death sentence can we get him to the hospital in fallujah even if we could it will be too late harvath knew both camp slayer and the green zone were too far what about the norwegian facility near the airbase at ramadi theyve got a fully staffed msf clinic there the medic shook his head harvath looked down as khidir started guppy breathing its your call said the medic what do you want to do harvath couldnt take his eyes off the boy can i hold him the medic thought about it a minute of course he said as he prepped a second syringe of morphine once harvath had the boy cradled in his lap the medic piggybacked the drug into the iv his breathing is probably going to stop soon but i promise he wont feel any pain harvath wanted to say thank you but the words didnt come these people are savages said the medic as he stood harvath nodded have dent bring the two survivors from the hallway back in here i want them to see this the medic nodded moments later dent and one of his men brought the alqaeda operatives back into the room harvath nodded at the opposite wall and dent shoved them down into a sitting position he told the team member who had helped him bring the prisoners in to go wait outside once he was sure the entire house was empty he came back into the room and nodded to harvath he had a feeling he knew what was going to happen next one of the alqaeda operatives turned his head away harvath yelled at him in arabic to watch the man reluctantly complied the other sat there with a smile on his face and harvath bored holes into the mans head with his stare harvath wished the little boy could live though he knew it wasnt going to happen the extra morphine had sealed the deal unable to do anything else for him he did something he hadnt done in a long time he prayed for a painless exit the little boy was fast losing his fight his little chest rose and fell so infrequently that harvath went for tens of seconds at a time wondering if the child had already expired he knew it was only a matter of time he held the boy tighter and rocked him the terrorist with the smile laughed at harvath and called him a pussy harvath ignored him as he tried to figure out how many seconds had passed since the little boy had last breathed placing two fingers on the little boys neck harvath felt for the carotid artery there was no pulse khidir had passed the alqaeda operative who had been laughing realized what had happened and now fell silent harvath adjusted the boy in his arms and reached for his lifeless hand khidirs fingers were rough and blistered into the boys hand he placed his makarov and wrapped one tiny finger around the trigger he raised the boys arm steadying his aim he pulled khidirs finger twice firing into the laughing terrorists stomach the alqaeda operative screamed in pain he began rocking back and forth unable to reach out and clasp his wounds with his hands ziptied behind his back standing up harvath carried the boy outside and placed him in the truck next to omarhakim once everyone was loaded the drive to fallujahs main police station took under half an hour it was almost morning and while it would be a day of thanksgiving for five of the families for khidirs it would be a day of incredible sadness as for omarhakim and the two surviving alqaeda operatives their ordeal was only beginning they would probably never see the inside of a courtroom justice for them would be meted out in a different fashion for what they had done and what omarhakim had allowed to be done to those little boys no torture could be too painful or too horrific harvath took little pleasure in what he did but it had to be done america was engaged in allout war with the islamists and as america became more aggressive in taking the fight to them he knew that they were going to become more aggressive in taking the fight to america he also knew that the loss of life wouldnt end with khidir things were going to get much much worse before they ever got better chapter virginia monday morning thirtyeight hours later harvath changed into shorts grabbed two sixpacks from the fridge and walked down to his dock he had wanted to get good and drunk in iraq but there hadnt been time he had to debrief and clean up a bunch of loose ends before flying home now he had all the time he wanted the docks wooden planks were hot beneath his feet without the throng of weekend boaters the potomac was quiet a light breeze stirred the surface of the water it was good to be home in addition to tying one on what he needed to do was put the things hed seen and heardthings hed known from the outset hed probably not be able to forgetin an iron box and bury it as deep as possible in one of the farthest corners of his mind the practice was unhealthy but he didnt care it was the only way he could do his job sitting down at the end of the dock harvath leaned against one of the pier posts opened his first beer and tipped it back his fiancée tracy was up at her grandfathers cottage in maine and he was grateful for the solitude he didnt want to see her right away he needed to decompress and come back to reality or at least what he liked to call reality that world beyond kicking in doors and shooting islamic fanatics in the face the biggest reason he needed time though was that he knew he couldnt talk to tracy about what he had seen children had become one of those topics that they no longer discussed harvath closed his eyes and lifted his face toward the sun he had given up trying to change her mind because of the persistent headaches she suffered she said she couldnt even consider becoming a mother at the same time she knew that he wanted a family and she had tried to convince him to start over again with someone else but he wouldnt leave her no matter how many times she worked to push him away she had been the victim of a vendetta launched by a sick terrorist who wanted to torture him by targeting the people around him there were days when the pain tracy suffered was so severe that she wished out loud that the bullet that had struck her in the head had done its intended job it was agonizing for harvath to hear her talk like that for tracy some days she couldnt tell what was worse the physical pain from the attack or the emotional pain from watching one of the most decent men she had ever known forgo the family he desired in order to stay by her side his father had also been a navy mana seal and then a seal instructor when he died father and son were barely on speaking terms harvath had forgone college for a career as an amateur athlete something the elder harvath had zealously disapproved of after his fathers death in a training accident harvath had found it impossible to return to competitive sports worried about what might become of him without any sense of purpose and direction in his life harvaths mother had encouraged him to enroll in college he graduated from the university of southern california in three years cum laude with a double major in political science and military history by the time he finished he knew exactly what he wanted to do following in his fathers footsteps he joined the navy and was eventually accepted to basic underwater demolition seal school buds and a specialized program known as sqt or seal qualification training though the process was grueling beyond measure his mental and physical conditioning as a worldclass athlete his stubborn refusal to ever give up on anything and the belief that he had finally found his true calling in life propelled him forward and earned him the honor of being counted as one of the worlds most elite warriorsa us navy seal he served with seal team two and then team six where he assisted a presidential security detail and caught the eye of the secret service wanting to bolster their antiterrorism expertise at the white house they eventually succeeded in wooing him away from the navy and up to dc harvath soon distinguished himself even further and after a short time was recommended for an abovetopsecret program at the department of homeland security called the apex project the projects raison dêtre was to level the playing field against america s enemies the belief was that if the terrorists werent playing by any rules then neither should the united states especially when it came to defending its citizens and interests at home and abroad but with a new administration had come a new approach to dealing with terrorism and the apex project was dismantled harvath had found himself out of a job with a unique skill set and a desire to continue serving the interests of his country he accepted a private sector position with a company specializing in intelligence gathering and highly advanced special operations training near telluride colorado in the words of a former cia director harvath knew that intelligence was at the nexus of every major security challenge facing the united states it didnt matter if it was alqaeda or hugo chavez the need for timely accurate comprehensive information was unprecedented harvath and the former cia director werent the only people to recognize that the drive for quality intelligence was paramount in the post world a wellfunded group of highlevel former military and intelligence operatives had seen the need as well deeply concerned with the entrenched bureaucracy at the cia and the political hobbling of the nations defense apparatus they sought to create an organization that would boldly do what the countrys politically correct votechasing politicians and constantlycoveringtheircoweringasses bureaucrats were too timid and too inept to attempt named after its founder reed carltona retired thirtyyear veteran of the cia and one of the nations most revered spymastersthe carlton group was based upon the office of strategic services or oss the wartime intelligence agency that had been the predecessor to the cia the carlton group was composed of patriots who wanted one thing and one thing only to keep americans safe no matter what the cost its modus operandi was quite similar to that of the apex project except for one thingit didnt fall under the auspices of any politicians or bureaucrats the carlton group was an obscure private organization funded completely from department of defense black budgets only a handful of highlevel career military dod personnel knew of its existence and it represented a major shift in counterterrorisms center of gravity the only thing it was missing was a reliable private intelligence branch to use existing government intelligence apparatus like dod dia nsa or cia risked exposure and was out of the question therefore they had to seek something in the private sector when the carlton group purchased the company harvath had been working for in colorado he received a phone call the new powers that be were restructuring and they wanted to move harvath out of simply gathering intelligence and building human networks and into something much more interesting carlton or the old man as he was affectionately known by those who worked for him had personally invited harvath to his home in northern virginia to discuss a new position he had assembled a small group of operatives with military and intelligence experience to carry out immediate action assignments using the popular pentagon catchphrase find fix finish and follow up he explained that harvath would be responsible for identifying terrorist leadership tracking them to a specific location capturing or killing them as necessary and using the information gleaned from the assignment to plan the next operation the goal was to apply constant pressure to terrorist networks and pound them so hard and so relentlessly that they were permanently rocked back on their heels if not ground into the dust in addition to immediateaction assignments carlton planned clever psychological operations to eat away at the terrorist networks from within sowing doubt fear distrust and paranoia throughout their ranks like a cancer it was everything the united states government should have been doing but wasnt serving under a man like carlton was an honor in and of itself the scope and intensity of the operations were icing on the cake harvath was sold for twelve months the old man had put him through the most comprehensive intelligence training he had ever experienced in essence carlton distilled what he had learned over his thirty years in the espionage world and drilled it as deeply as possible into harvath on top of the intelligence training harvath was required to keep his counterterrorism skills sharp he took additional courses in israeli handtohand combatives and the russian martial art known as systema there were driving classes language classes and tens of thousands of rounds of ammunition fired on the range and in shoot houses with a host of highend private instructors he made excellent progress and despite his recent milestone birthday felt that he was in better shape and better equipped than he had ever been before even so hed recently begun to notice that it was taking him slightly longer to bounce back from injuries the job was a dream come true but he knew he couldnt keep doing it forever at some point maybe ten years from now maybe fifteen things were going to change he couldnt spend the rest of his life kicking in doors and shooting bad guys in the head carlton had been ready to put harvath in the field but before he could begin harvath had asked for permission to conduct the iraq operation the old man had agreed and through the dod had greased harvaths passage into iraq seeing to it that he had everything he needed with the iraq operation complete the old man had given him a couple of days off before the real work was to begin he had suggested time with tracy harvath had told him hed think about it he was on his second beer still thinking about it and gazing absentmindedly across the water when his phone vibrated he took it out and checked the display it was an international call but the country code was spain figuring it had to be one of his guys who was using a spanish cell phone company to get better calling rates out of iraq he took the call the minute he heard the heavily accented voice on the other end he realized he had been wrong mr harvath said the voice whos this im a friend of nicholas nicholas repeated harvath nicholas who howd you get this number the man ignored the question he says you share an affinity for the same breed of dog immediately harvaths mind was drawn to his dog bullet a caucasian ovcharka or caucasian sheepdog as the name translated bullet was named after an old friend of his bullet bob who had been killed during a terrorist attack on new york city ovcharkas were exceedingly fast fiercely loyal and absolutely vicious when it came to guarding those closest to them which was why bullet was with tracy up in maine the name nicholas now registered harvaths dog had been left on his doorstep as a thankyou cum peace offering from a dwarf who dealt in the purchase and sale of highly sensitive and often highly classified information though commonly referred to as the troll the little man had told harvath he preferred his friends to call him nicholas harvath had reached a certain détente with nicholas but describing it as friendship would have been stretching the definition of their relationship in fact if he never saw or heard from the little man again it would be fine by him what do you want asked harvath someone tried to kill nicholas said the voice you reap what you sow he probably deserved it the man pushed forward undeterred the bombing in rome two days ago does he know something interrupted harvath he had heard about the bus explosion and the horrible loss of lives before leaving iraq it was all over the news he says he needs to talk to you about it does he know who was behind the attack there was a pause as the man seemed to gather his thoughts i want to speak with nicholas harvath said finally hes not in a condition to talk not right now well when he is tell him to call me back harvath was about to hang up when the man stated he needs to see you in person im not comfortable with that mr harvath youre going to be presented with evidence false evidence implicating nicholas in the attacks in fact two black suvs have just pulled into your driveway harvath looked up toward his house why should i believe you im just the messenger replied the voice nicholas is the one you need to speak to he can help you track down who did this but he needs you to come to him and to come alone harvath didnt like it it felt wrong and that little voice in the back of his mind that never lied and had always helped to keep him alive was telling him to be very very careful the only thing this offers missing is a dark alley he said someone wants your government to believe nicholas was involved ask yourself why review the evidence and if you decide you want the truth be in the old town of bilbao the day after tomorrow behind the cathedral in the calle de la tendería is a tobacconist ask the man there for cigarettes named after nicholass dogs and youll receive instructions on what to do next and mr harvath please hurry nicolas believes there may be more attacks in the works harvath was about to interject when the call was disconnected from up near the house he could just make out the sound of several car doors slamming chapter chicago burt taylor had just come back from the hospital cafeteria and his wife angela was next to their daughters hospital bed when trauma surgeon dr dennis stern walked into the room it had been ten days since the hitandrun alison taylor had suffered severe brain damage as well as multiple broken bones severe lacerations and internal bleeding her parents had driven in from minnesota as soon as theyd received the news for the first few days neither of them had left the hospital now they spent the days together with alison and took turns spending the night by her bed have the chicago police come up with anything asked stern as he finished his examination mr taylor had trouble keeping his anger in check not a damn thing normally mrs taylor would have called him on his cursing but in this case she agreed with his choice of words the police had been less than satisfactory its like they arent even interested in finding the guy continued taylor they quote stats for annual hitandruns as if were supposed to just accept what happened to alison as a consequence of living in chicago its ridiculous i agree with you said stern most cops mean well but the cpd is overworked this citys deficit is like a black hole it just keeps sucking more and more into it and it leaves the cops with less and less to work with he could see the anger building in burt taylors eyes but that doesnt mean that they shouldnt be doing everything they can to find the person who did this to your daughter youre damn right i think you should have someone working this for you from the inside working this from the inside repeated taylor incredulously isnt that what the detectives assigned to alisons case are supposed to be doing technically yes but like any bigcity police force the cpd has a large bureaucracy that doesnt excuse how your daughters case is or isnt being handled its just a fact again the majority of cops at the cpd are good people theyre just swamped with murders and rapes and shootings and all of it angela taylor brought the trauma surgeon back to the matter at hand what do you mean by someone working for us from the inside lots of cops moonlight replied stern many do security but they also do other things ive done a lot of tactical medicine with the swat team and have a friend who is now over in the departments organized crime division he happens to be a lawyer and he moonlights taking cases burt taylor looked at him so youre telling me that if we want our daughters case to get the attention it deserves weve got to pay someone off what the hell kind of police department is your city running the surgeon put up his hands absolutely not what i am suggesting is that you meet with him talk about what happened and share your frustration over the lack of progress by the cpd he might be able to help you im afraid im confused as well added mrs taylor once the police find who did this the city or district attorney will bring charges wont they correct itll be the states attorney said stern but i want you to understand im not trying to sell you anything youre either going to like john and want to work with him or youre not he wouldnt be acting as a chicago police officer hed be acting as an advocate for alison and your family hed be your attorney and his role would be to push the cpds investigation hed also launch his own investigation so that you can not only nail the person who did this and have the states attorney bring him up on criminal charges but youll also have a person you can sue in civil court for damages thats what i mean by having someone working for you on the inside he knows how the cpd works even though hell be wearing his lawyer hat the fact that hes also a cop will bring a lot of pressure to bear on the investigation burt taylor thought about it for several moments after looking at his wife he turned back to dennis stern and said how do we get in touch with him they met at an outoftheway restaurant not far from the hospital in the citys little italy neighborhood along taylor street sergeant john vaughan was sitting at a table in the corner his back to the wall with a view of the front door it was just after eleven am and the restaurant was empty he noticed burt taylor through the window before he even entered the hostess showed him to the table and john stood to shake his hand im very sorry about what happened to your daughter thank you said taylor as he released the mans hand and took a seat vaughan was in his late thirties he wore a brown suit with a green tie his dark hair was cut short and he had eyes that moved around the room are you expecting someone else im sorry said vaughan i dont come to this neighborhood a lot its nothing personal taylor didnt know what to make of him so far he wasnt very impressed dr stern thinks you may be able to help us dennis is a good man it was an odd reply youre a police officer but not a detective correct thats right but you are a lawyer i am he responded taylor paused waiting for some sort of a sales pitch as to why he should hire him but nothing came whatever this man was he was definitely no salesman setting aside your relationship with dr stern why should i consider hiring you well it depends on what you want we want to find the driver of the taxi who ran down our daughter good because thats what i want too finally taylor saw a spark in the man vaughan continued are you familiar with maslows hierarchy of needs you know categories of needs that have to be met before a person can start focusing on achieving the needs of the next category i am well when it comes to cops detectives in particular thats pretty much bs there are two types of cases that will always get solvedthe easy ones and the ones where there is so much pressure grinding down on the investigators that they absolutely have to climb out of the ring with a victory so which one is alisons unfortunately neither there are more than five thousand yellow cabs in this city and the only witnesses to the crime were so inebriated their testimony is worthless so that scratches your daughters case from the easy category and lets face it if this was an easy case you and i wouldnt be sitting here as far as crushing the investigators with pressure unless you have a very close relationship with the mayor our police superintendent or your daughter is some sort of notable personality theres just not going to be enough pressure to make this case a priority and get it solved taylor was confused then where does that leave us john vaughan smiled it leaves you with me and what would you do differently for starters id do the job the detectives were supposed to id investigate the entire incident from front to back then what id follow up on any leads and see where they take me thats it thats how its done said vaughan officer how many hitandrun cases have you ever investigated to be honest with you none how many violent crimes there was a pause so taylor added give or take two or three responded vaughan taylor was beginning to feel that this had all been a waste of time how old are you thirtyfive and exactly how long have you been an attorney six months sir six months when the heck did you get out of law school yesterday actually four years ago taylor was now completely convinced that he had wasted his time it took you that long to pass the bar no i took a fouryear leave to fight in iraq taylor wondered if maybe he had the man what branch of the service the marine corps youre a marine yes sir i worked in intelligence and helped shape our counterinsurgency strategy after several moments of silence taylor said do you believe you can help with my daughters case i wouldnt waste your time sir if i believed otherwise waving the waiter over he replied then lets order some lunch and talk about what you can do for my family chapter virginia coming up from the dock harvath decided to stay out of sight until he knew what was going on he cut across his neighbors property and used a stand of trees for cover peering toward his house he saw two blackedout suburbans parked in his driveway either nicholas had someone watching his house or he had access to realtime satellite imagery knowing the little mans skills he suspected it was the latter a small contingent of hard men in crisp suits with earpieces stood near the vehicles their heads on swivels they definitely hadnt come to sell girl scout cookies harvath wished hed taken his down to the dock with him as he watched one of the men spoke into a microphone at his sleeve when the passenger door of the second vehicle opened reed carlton stepped out and harvath relaxed he was a tall fit man in his midsixties with a prominent chin and silver hair you really should call first reed said harvath as he slipped from behind the tree line and took carlton s security team by surprise sorry about that said the old man as harvath met him in the driveway and the two shook hands something has come up can we talk inside as long as youre okay with casual monday replied harvath referring to his shortsandnoshirt look the older man nodded and followed him inside after pulling a shirt from the hall closet and putting it on harvath directed his new boss to the kitchen coffee he asked please said reed as he sat down at the kitchen table and placed his briefcase next to him i understand iraq was a success not for the little boy who died i was sorry to hear about that harvath didnt reply he kept his back to the man pulled two large mugs out of the cupboard and set them on the counter i havent read your full debrief yet continued carlton did you go through with the whole thing there was silence and the old man waited finally harvath said all of it while carlton was a master at psychological operations this assignment had been harvaths from start to finish he had dubbed it paradise lost the idea was to shake any other alqaeda cells who might be considering the kidnapping and torture of children upon each terrorist body at the safe house was left a black envelope inside the envelope was a detailed account in arabic of horrible things supposedly done to the men before they had been killed placed into the mouth of each terrorist had been a pickled pigs foot from a jar that harvath had brought with him from the us the idea of the notes in the black envelopes was to send a message to all of the other terrorists preying on children in iraq they would not die martyrs deaths they would not go to paradise they would be defiled before their god they would be unclean and unworthy and to make sure the point was driven home the pickled pigs feet were placed into the mouth of each of the corpses it was a derivative of the colombian necktie and harvath was confident word of it would spread quickly its meaning clear carlton changed the subject you heard about rome harvath filled the coffee cups and brought them to the table where he sat down i did twenty american college students plus their teacher the bus driver and eleven others who had the misfortune of being near that bus when it detonated at the colosseum current count has over forty wounded he shook his head do we have any leads reaching into his briefcase carlton withdrew a folder the italians are investigating a rumor about four muslim men trying to purchase militarygrade explosives in sicily the same kind used in the attack in rome sicily could mean only one thing they think the mafias involved thats what they thought at first and considering the fact that the cosa nostra did over two billion dollars in illicitweapons trafficking last year it makes sense to start with them so theres a connection carlton shook his head from what theyve uncovered the mafia was happy to sell the suspects guns but they drew the line at explosives fearing correctly that they might be used on italian soil then where did the terrorists get the explosives according to the italians the explosives came in through another channel a man mentioned in chatter before and after the attackmoscerino who is moscerino asked harvath its not a who exactly its a what replied carlton as he slid the file across the table moscerino is italian for dwarf harvath hesitated as he reached for the file it was only a fraction of a second but the old man noticed based on a tip they received the italians located a private airfield in the north of sicily where the exchange supposedly took place sifting through air traffic control records they traced the plane to a charter company in naples after being served with a court order the company handed over its records and made the pilot available for questioning and let me guess he admitted to flying a dwarf in and out of sicily along with two very large dogs harvath didnt like it did the pilot see anything he asked as he flipped through the folder did he see any muslim men or any alleged transaction take place no whatever happened it took place inside a closed hangar the passenger and his dogs deplaned with a large storm case on wheels entered the hangar and then about ten minutes later returned without the case reboarded the plane and instructed the pilot to take him back to naples what no aluminum briefcase full of cash handcuffed to his wrist carlton looked at harvath im not going to beat around the bush with you scot we both know who this is i know who you think it is youre telling me this isnt the troll harvath closed the file thats exactly what im telling you and how can you be sure first of all he sells information not militarygrade explosives and secondly hed never conduct an operation like this himself hed use an intermediary a cutout somebody is obviously trying to set him up carlton thought for a moment i know he helped you track down the man who shot tracy only after id erased all of his data and emptied out all of his bank accounts so there are no underlying loyalties i need to worry about between you on the surface it was a fair question the troll was all about money he lacked integrity and often worked with terrorist organizations he had taken advantage of an alqaeda attack on new york which killed thousands of americans including one of harvaths best friends to steal information from a topsecret us datamining operation at the same time though harvath felt sorry for him not only had he been born a midget but his parents had abandoned him as a child selling him to a brothel in russia where hed been starved beaten and forced to perform unutterable sex acts it was difficult for harvath to admit that he felt pity for the little man the pair had worked together and harvath had respected the trolls love for animals particularly his dogs he also respected his ability to glean information though he should have seen him as reprehensible no different from the many men who operated on the wrong side of the law whom hed been tasked with tracking down and killing over the years he couldnt despite his flaws harvath had come to like him what i want to know said the old man keying in again on harvaths hesitancy is if i assign you to find him can you carry it out harvath studied the file folder knowing what his answer should be but instead of answering he asked a question of his own is there an order for him to be terminated would that make a difference maybe then maybe you shouldnt take this assignment so they do want him dead stated harvath actually theyd prefer captured but theyll accept dead considering your history together i thought youd want to be the one to make the choice which option did his boss think harvath would exercise he studied the mans face but couldnt tell why isnt the cia spearheading this he finally asked ever since the agency snatched that radical cleric in milan theyve been persona non grata in italy like everyone else in the intelligence world harvath knew the story though the italians denied ever giving their blessing to the operation the cia claimed that all of the appropriate authorities had been filled in on the plan according to the agency they had been granted permission to grab the alqaedaaligned cleric in milan as part of their extraordinary rendition program he was then flown to egypt where after being released two years later he went public with stories of how he had been tortured by egyptian interrogators while it wasnt exactly great pr what was unforgivable was that the fifteen cia operatives involved had used their real names during the operation to rack up hotel loyalty points to make matters worse they had also used their personal cell phones it was beyond embarrassing do we have anyone in italy working the bombing besides a nonofficial cover operative or two the agency secretly still has over there the bureau continues to have a decent relationship with the italians and had a couple of teams wheels up within an hour of the attack harvath liked the people at the fbi but he knew that outside the forensics specialists theyd have working the bombing any other agents would take a backseat to their italian counterparts the attack had happened on italian soil and despite the high number of american casualties this would remain an italian investigation i still dont buy that the troll was involved in something like this maybe you put too much of a dent in his business maybe he needed to branch out and start dealing in explosives it doesnt matter weve been tasked with bringing him in if you dont want the assignment i can give it to somebody else no replied harvath removing the file from the table this is mine carlton nodded we have an apartment in rome you can use unless you want to begin in naples in which case well arrange something for you there hes not in italy hes in spain how do you know harvath had a lot to do standing he picked up his coffee mug and said because he just called me to set up a meeting chapter bilbao tuesday after landing in madrid harvath passed through immigration and customs then took the metro into the city it was packed with tourists near the boisterous puerta del sol he entered a nondescript building rode the aging elevator to the fourth floor and used the key he had been given to gain access to the carlton groups madrid safe house he located the capabilities kit that had been left for him and cataloged its contents while capabilities kits could be tailored to the specific assignment as a rule they contained all of the hardtoacquire items an operative might need in a foreign country kits were spook and normally included cash sterile sim cards cell phones lockpicking tools a condensed trauma kit tracking bugs tuff ties a taser folding knife multitool ir laser designator infrared strobe night vision monocular and a compact weapon with highend ammunition in harvaths case the compact weapon was a glock with two spare magazines of mm p ammunition the contents of the kit fit neatly into the day pack he had brought along with him following a quick shower and shave he gathered up his belongings and returned to the metro at chamartín station he boarded a train headed north though carlton could have arranged for the gear to be deaddropped in bilbao harvath preferred doing it this way there was no telling who or what would be waiting for him when he arrived it was a city he didnt know and didnt have any allies in too much could go wrong it was better to arrive prepared as the highspeed train raced across the spanish countryside he closed his eyes he thought about tracy and the goodbye call he had placed before leaving he also thought about the family he was never going to have with her shortly past nine oclock in the evening the train arrived at abando station mixing in with other passengers harvath kept his eyes open as he headed toward the escalators beneath the magnificent wall of stained glass at the end of the terminal he took the bilbao metro and got off two stops before his hotel moving through the neighborhood he conducted a series of surveillance detection routes or sdrs to make sure he wasnt being followed the evening air was cool and carried a hint of rain at a small café across from the hotel harvath ordered a coffee and watched the ebb and flow of the sidewalk traffic he studied the cars parked up and down the street and when he was confident that he hadnt been followed and that the hotel wasnt under surveillance he paid his bill crossed the street and checked in in his room he changed into a pair of dark jeans and a sweater he tucked his glock into a leather holster near the small of his back he put on a comfortable pair of lowprofile hiking boots and a leather jacket with deep pockets exiting the hotel through the service entrance he struck out for the citys medieval neighborhood known as the casco viejo it was a fifteenminute walk most of the restaurants and bars were still empty save for the few that catered to tourists not yet in sync with the spanish custom of dining later in the evening oblivious to the cars and the hour children kicked soccer balls in the street as older people walked small dogs and young mothers pushed babies in cheap strollers bilbao was a featureless city like milan but with a spanish twist bland buildings roofed in red tiles were wedged cheekbyjowl fronted by concrete sidewalks there were very few trees and even less grass every single inch of space that could be used had been used nearer the old town the streets narrowed and the architecture became more interesting harvath removed a map he had picked up in the hotel lobby and studied it as he walked he strolled up and down the siete calles or seven streets as they were known and got a feel for the neighborhood it was full of shops bars and restaurants behind the cathedral in the calle de la tendería he found a basque restaurant within sight of the streets only tobacconist he took a seat inside two tables back from the window withdrew a guidebook from his pocket and made himself comfortable over the next three hours he pretended to linger over his food and his guidebook as he watched the traffic patterns at the tiny tobacco shop he even tipped the busboy to go buy cigarettes for him as he watched the young man cross the street he debated finding a standin to do the exact same thing for him tomorrow he was concerned that the meeting could be a setup but if he conned some unsuspecting person into going into the shop on his behalf and something happened the person could very well be killed that wasnt a risk he was comfortable with he knew he had to walk into that store himself tomorrow if he wanted the truth about the troll he didnt like it but there was no way of getting around it all he could do was be as prepared as possible chapter chicago tuesday john vaughan had accepted burt taylors handshake and a promise that a check would be forthcoming theyd get to the paperwork later too much time had already gotten away from them as it was it took him a full twentyfour hours before he could unravel himself from his police work and start on the taylor investigation tuesday afternoon he stopped in a tiny sundries shop bought a small spiral notebook and walked back to his car inside he wrote alison taylors name and the pertinent details he knew thus far of the case he then focused on his next step the city of chicago was divided into five policing areas each with its own headquarters alisons hitandrun had happened in area five the detective division of each area was broken into three sectionsspecial victims unit robberyburglarytheft and homicidegang crimessex to streamline operations the city no longer maintained a major accident investigation division instead cases like alison taylors were now handled by hgshomicidegang crimessex vaughan understood the rationale behind it but collapsing vehicular crimes into hgs had never seemed like the best fit to him homicide detectives are used to pursuing linear crimes a shot b this is why a shot b weve captured a case closed there is often malice involved and that helps them track down and apprehend offenders hitandruns on the other hand are atypical they are not very sexy and that was why without even having seen alison taylors file he knew the hgs detectives probably hadnt put a lot of effort into pursuing it it wasnt because they were bad cops or because they were lazy it was simply because with all of the cases they had human nature was such that you pursued those you felt best equipped to handle and which you saw yourself having the greatest chance of solving the only people who took on loser cases were the young idealists who felt it was a personal failing if they didnt solve every case that crossed their desk a year of overwhelming detective work in a city like chicago helped grind that idealism out of most detectives vaughan made a call to an area five hgs cop he knew and within ten minutes one of the detectives from alisons case called him back youre welcome to see the file said the detective but we didnt make a lot of progress her coworkers were blitzed even if we had located the cabbie their testimony would have been worthless in court im sure you guys did the best you could i just want to be able to tell the family we didnt leave any stones unturned i hear you when can you get down here vaughan looked at his watch hows a half hour i probably wont be here but there were a couple of seconds of silence while the detective muffled the mouthpiece before coming back on the line ask for detective ramirez ill leave the file with her vaughan wrote down the name and was about to thank the man but he didnt get the chance the detective had hung up the halfhour drive thanks to chicago traffic took almost an hour when he arrived at area five and found detective ramirez she told him youre late as she handed him the file and offered to let him join her at her desk he hung his suit coat over the back of the metal chair removed his notebook and pen and opened the file the detective he had spoken with had been right they hadnt made a lot of progress there was an incident report pictures from the scene and witness statements in addition to the statements taken right after the hitandrun the detectives had gone back to interview alison taylors friends when they were sober a piece of black plastic had been recovered from the scene and was believed to have come from one of those triangular rooftop advertising setups popular on taxis throughout the city the neighborhood had been canvassed for further witnesses and phone calls had been made to all of the cab companies none of it resulted in any additional leads vaughan arrived at the end of the file flipping the last page over he said wheres the blue light camera footage from the intersection ramirez didnt even bother looking up from the report she was reading reaching into her desk drawer she withdrew the dvd the detective had given her for vaughan to look at is this a copy for me to keep no thats our copy theres a dvd player in the conference room she said pointing across the sea of desks to a door on the other side of the room vaughan took the disc and walked over to the conference room he was back fifteen minutes later god i hate our blue light cams ramirez was still working on her report and not very interested in vaughan s problems let me guess the footage was blurry and the camera automatically panned right at the minute you needed to see something exactly those cameras arent for solving crimes she said looking up theyre for deterring crimes im surprised they record any footage at all vaughan shook his head they had footage of the cab speeding through the intersection but it had happened so fast it was all blurry and just like she had said the camera panned away at the crucial moment where the cab number could have been identified there has to be another camera that caught this accident are you done with that she asked as vaughan began tapping his thigh with the folder yeah im done he said handing it back to her standing up he removed his jacket from the back of the chair and pulled out his business card in case anything comes up she dropped it into the file and offered him a piece of advice because youre a lawyer probably getting paid by the hour im not going to tell you youre wasting your time but there are a lot of cabs in the city dont get too emotionally involved vaughan understood where she was coming from detachment was the key to staying sane in their line of work he still shook his head lawyer cop it doesnt matter im a human being and so was the woman who got run down in that intersection i want to find the guy who did this ramirez held his gaze for a moment and then dropped her eyes back to the report shed been using as an excuse to ignore him have a nice evening counselor chapter bilbao wednesday harvath spent a good portion of the morning doing additional reconnaissance on the tobacco shop just after ten am he stepped away from the tour group he was shadowing and with both his glock and taser handy entered the shop the old man behind the counter didnt even bother looking up do you have argos and draco brand cigarettes he asked in spanish using the names of the trolls two dogs three euros the old man replied reaching under the counter and producing a pack of fortuna lites harvath gave him the cash pocketed the cigarettes and exited the store he conducted what felt like his hundredth sdr of the day and when he was confident he wasnt being followed walked into a small hotel he had identified earlier and headed into its café taking a table near the back he ordered coffee once the waiter had walked away he pulled out the pack of cigarettes and examined it it had a plastic wrapper but had been opened from the bottom and resealed harvath peeled off the plastic and opened the package at the top it was stuffed with tissue paper after removing the paper he withdrew a car key rubberbanded to a prepaid parking receipt in addition to the name and address of the parking facility someone had written c harvath remembered having joked that the only thing the trolls offer was missing was a dark alley it would seem that he hadnt been creative enough a dark parking structure was much more apropos the underground garage was on the other side of the river it took harvath about fifteen minutes to walk there fifteen minutes for reconnaissance and another five to locate the car so far so good he found a structural column and used it for cover as he depressed the button on the remote the lights flashed the door unlocked after thoroughly checking the vehicle for explosives he tossed in his backpack climbed into the drivers seat and started the car he reversed out of the space drove up two levels and after using the prepaid receipt exited the facility he drove through several neighborhoods before finally pulling over and looking for a clue as to where he was supposed to go next inside the glove compartment were a portable gps device a window mount and cigarette adaptor after powering up the gps he toggled to the screen with preloaded routes and saw it contained one destination labeled nicholas it appeared to be a village in the basque pyrenees according to the gps the drive was five hours and fortythree minutes harvath kept his gun where he could get to it incredibly he found a radio station playing the american funk classic pass the peas by fred wesley and turning up the volume he pointed the car toward the autopista and stepped on the accelerator fifteen kilometers outside of bilbao he noticed he was being followed chapter the immediate exits outside the city offered only bad neighborhoods and the shoulder of the highway was equally dangerous harvath decided to wait as long as they werent trying to overtake him and run him off the road he was fine the problem lay in whether or not there was an ambush waiting somewhere up along the route somewhere he could be forced off the road and everything could be made to look like an accident it seemed a bit over the top especially when they could have arranged for something to have happened to him in bilbao but maybe they had another scenario in mind all harvath knew was that he didnt like being followed he needed to find out who these people were and what they wanted fifty kilometers later an opportunity presented itself gunning the car he sped off the autopista and raced down the exit road to the service area the parking lot was crowded and spaniards coming or going from their cars gesticulated wildly and cursed him for his excessive rate of speed he slowed down as he neared the restaurant and parked in one of the handicapped spaces up front grabbing his backpack he unplugged the gps device tucked it in his pocket and left the keys in the ignition he wouldnt be coming back for the car the lot was peppered with cars and longhaul trucks inside the café cum restaurant most of the business was gathered around the beer taps at the counter there were two families having a late lunch and harvath noted four police officers drinking coffee at a nearby table but that was it he stepped to the far end of the crowded counter and ordered a beer seconds later he saw the car that had been following him since bilbao a black peugeot roll through the parking lot when it came upon his vehicle parked in one of the handicapped spaces up front it slowed down and then moved on if harvath had needed any further proof that they were following him that was it the peugeot had been moving slowly enough that harvath could make out a large man at the wheel with a thick neck a sloping forehead and eyebrows so thick they were like brillo pads then the car disappeared from sight harvath had a good vantage point not only could he look out the windows onto the parking lot he could also see straight through the buildings front door as he continued to watch he ordered a sandwich he didnt have to see them to know they were outside waiting for him the same questions that had been plaguing him since hed first seen them in his rearview mirror continued who were they and why were they following him asking the police for help was out of the question the men outside would say they had no idea what he was talking about and that they had pulled in simply to rest and get something to eat naturally they would then have plenty of questions for harvath who was carrying a firearm a stack of cash and had no idea exactly where he was going he would have to pull this off on his own removing the gps device from his pocket he powered it up and copied the directions down on the back of his paper placemat then he requested the device plan an alternate route for him but because he was indoors and out of range of the satellites the device was unable to complete the task frustrated harvath turned the device off and slid it back into his pocket using his limited spanish he asked for the check paid it and then waited for the right moment to walk back to the mens room the man at the urinal was about twenty years old and harvath ignored him as he walked over to the sink and turned on the water he splashed some on his face and then leaned heavily on the edge of the bowl when the young man approached harvath pretended to lose his balance before righting himself se siente bien señor the young man asked are you feeling okay he feigned difficulty focusing do you speak english i do are you okay i left my pills in the car harvath said gesturing toward the door do you want me to get them for you he took a deep labored breath i would really appreciate it thank you give me your keys and tell me where your car is its a blue opel he said it is in a handicapped spot just outside the front door the keys are in it its unlocked i think i left the pills in the glove box or they may be in the pocket behind the passenger seat wait here replied the good samaritan ill be right back harvath thanked him and once he left the mens room followed him at a safe distance he cut through the gift shop and exited the structure via a side door at the far end since no one from the black peugeot had come in looking for him there was only a handful of places they could be either they had given up and left which he highly doubted they had driven off to another point where they would wait to pick up his trail again virtually impossible to do without being seen or they were sitting out in the parking lot somewhere and if they were out in the parking lot they would be positioned so that they could keep an eye on his car while they waited for him to come back out it was the answer that made the most sense and therefore the one he went with it didnt take harvath long to find them the young man from the mens room was politely ransacking the opel looking for a nonexistent bottle of pills while the two men in the peugeot watched in silence trying to figure out what was going on the peugeot was three rows back and they never saw harvath coming using the butt of his glock he smashed the rear passenger window popping the lock he opened the door and sat down upon the spill of broken glass nobody move he said holding his pistol so that both of the startled men could see it next to eyebrows was the driver an equally beefy and thicknecked mouth breather with a thin scar on his right cheek whoever these two were they were not operators they were muscle and poorly dressed muscle at that why have you been following me asked harvath no hablamos ingles said eyebrows bullshit why have you been following me no hablam shut up do you have any weapons on you qué dónde estan las armas he said pulling eyebrows shirt up so he could check his waistband las pistolas dónde estan no pistolas no armas harvath put the gun against scarfaces temple and patted him down he was clean he used his pack to brush off some of the glass on the seat and settled back these two needed to be dealt with but not here vamonos he said a dónde vamos replied scarface nervously leaning forward harvath put his glock against the mans head and slowly repeated vamonos got it now quit jerking around and get moving the spaniard started the engine put the car in gear and pulled out of the rest area and onto the motorway two exits later harvath signaled for him to turn off they followed a small country road and he instructed scarface to pull behind a thick copse of trees he then told him to turn off the engine climbing out he instructed them to exit the vehicle one at a time afuera his spanish was lousy but the pistol was a wonderful interpretive aid that seemed to help get his points across he motioned for the men to put their hands on their heads and get down on their knees it was obvious from their faces that they believed he was going to execute them he walked around to the back of the vehicle and popped the trunk pulling back an old blanket he discovered two sawedoff shotguns no pistolas no armas huh eyebrows began to speak but harvath cut him off shut up he searched the rest of the trunk but didnt find much there was an empty gas can some road flares snow chains a spare and a jack what he really would have loved was some duct tape but there wasnt any the plastic tuff ties from his kit would have to do walking around to the front of the car he tucked his glock in the back of his jeans and after making sure it was loaded set one of the sawedoff shotguns on the hood of the car with his eyes on scarface and eyebrows he fished through his backpack and removed the plastic ties he walked over to eyebrows and demonstrated how he wanted him to secure his friend when scarface was zipped up harvath had eyebrows lie facedown in the dirt and he returned the favor with their ankles zipped together and wrists bound behind their backs harvath had them hop over to the car and helped load them in the trunk facedown once they were in he chained a couple more tuff ties together so he could hogtie the men it was cramped quarters in the trunk and neither of them was going to be able to move until they were cut loose after gagging the men he slammed the lid shut and climbed into the drivers seat he removed the gps unit fired it back up and once it had acquired the satellites planned an alternate route to the destination which he quickly memorized the reason he had been able to id eyebrows and scarface coming out of bilbao was that they had been following close enough to be seen if the gps unit or the opel he had been driving contained some sort of a tracking device they should have been able to stay back and out of sight nevertheless he didnt want to gamble that the gps device might give him away to whoever had sent the two geniuses in the trunk and so as he pulled back out onto the country road and headed for the motorway he dropped the unit out the window he had no idea that the car he was now driving was the biggest giveaway of all chapter chicago after leaving area five headquarters sergeant john vaughan drove to the intersection where alison taylor had been struck he parked his vehicle and surveyed the entire area on foot beyond the lone chicago police department blue light camera used to discourage street crime vaughan located five other privately owned security cameras that might have footage of the hitandrun the first belonged to alison taylors apartment building vaughan scared up the resident manager who had already spoken to the area five detectives john mollified the man and explained that he was simply following up the manager told him exactly what he had told the detectives the buildings exterior camera provided a feed so that residents could see who was buzzing them from the front door unfortunately the feed wasnt recorded was it possible that a resident could have had their tv switched to the video loop when the accident occurred yes but at three oclock on a weekday morning he doubted it the majority of his renters were young professionals like ms taylor whats more he assumed that if anyone had seen something they would have alerted the police the manager agreed to send an email to his residents asking if they had seen anything and took vaughan s card the next three cameras belonged to merchants near the intersection all of whom had previously spoken with the detectives of the businesses ones camera had not been turned on that evening another stated that her camera was a fake and only there to deter crime and the third merchant replied that unless hed been broken into during the night he automatically erased the footage every morning when he came in and started anew the fifth camera was from a bank atm and they still had their footage from the night in question though the area five detectives had already screened the footage the bank manager was happy to let vaughan see it considering the cameras field of view it should have been perfect in fact it would have been perfect if not for a large delivery truck that had parked on the street just in front of the atm that evening all of the banks customers had been recorded perfectly but seeing beyond the truck to the intersection was impossible vaughan had figured it was a long shot but sometimes those were the ones that paid off his hopes of catching the act on tape now were all but gone after dinner at home with his family homework and baths for the kids vaughan returned to the intersection and went into the subway station he wanted to recreate the scene for himself as closely as possible to the way it had happened coming out of the subway he turned to the right exactly as alison and her friends would have and retraced their steps along the sidewalk he spent hours studying the intersection and its flow of pedestrians and traffic he watched the timing of the lights and how many vehicles rushed the reds he charted the vehicles that turned into the crosswalk where alison had been struck and noted their rates of speed for most people it would have been mindnumbing tedium but for vaughan it was a challenge a puzzle he was convinced that he could find the answers he was looking for here he just needed to keep looking at in the morning he went home in time to shower and change into a new suit before the children were up and wanting breakfast thirty minutes four kisses and one family hug later his wife took their son off in one direction to his school while he took their daughter to hers as a marine who had seen hundreds of firefights in iraq he was no stranger to sleep deprivation in fact hed often joked that he could handle sleep deprivation in combat it was the sleep deprivation of parenthood that was the real killer because there was no dunkin donuts near his daughters school he broke one of his hardest and fastest rules and stepped into a starbucks the minute he did he could hear the giant sucking sound of money being vacuumed out of customers pockets starbucks had good coffee and as a capitalist he didnt fault them for getting the most they could for their product he just disliked the whole ventegrande mochafrappubscino coffeeasart shtick hot black and in a cupthats the complete extent of the relationship he wanted with the beverage instead of taking his large cup of house blend back to the car he found a table and took a seat his eyes were glazed over as he stared absently out the window and there were probably multiple customers who found the sight of a man with a pistol on his hip and a thousandyard stare more than a little disturbing if people were looking he didnt notice the weapon was so much a part of who he was that he never really thought about it it was just one of several tools necessary for doing his job as his mind wandered he watched a yellow taxi drive by outside he watched as it neared the corner and slowed to a stop a uniformed crossing guard directed the cab to stay where it was while she crossed a group of kids with backpacks and skateboards he had never liked cabbies very much the fact that they were predominantly immigrants wasnt what bothered him as long as they had come in the front door like everybody else he was okay with it what bothered him was what lousy drivers they tended to be it didnt make any sense a rational person would be correct in thinking that the more one performed a task the better one would become at it but that didnt seem to apply to cab drivers he seriously doubted the cab would have even stopped for the kids if the guard hadnt been there at that moment he got an idea pulling out his notebook he turned to a fresh page and clicked his pen he removed his cell phone and dialed the main number for the cpd when the operator answered he asked to be connected to the public vehicles division public vehicles officer brennan said the voice who answered good morning officer brennan this is sergeant john vaughan from organized crime it was all my wife and motherinlaws idea i had nothing to do with it put me in the witness protection program and id be happy to testify vaughan loved working with cops no matter what they all had a pretty good sense of humor ill send someone down to take your statement officer in the meantime im wondering if you could help me out with something im working on for the sergeant whos going to relocate me to florida or arizona you name it part of your responsibility is keeping an eye on the cab companies right you make sure the licensing and the medallions are all in line follow up on criminal complaints involving drivers that sort of stuff correct thats us miami vice without miami or the vice im looking into a hitandrun that involved a chicago yellow cab do you have a number case number or cab number ill take whatever youve got said the officer vaughan read off the case number thats all we have we are trying to track down the cab there was the sound of keys clicking as brennan pulled up the report on his computer it looks like yellow cab was contacted by our division but we were unable to get any further information yellow claims it doesnt have any knowledge of any of its drivers being involved in hitting a pedestrian on the evening in question what about damage to a vehicle consistent with a hitandrun on the night in question once again the keys clicked away as the officer searched vaughan added or maybe there was a driver who failed to return his vehicle finally brennan said sorry sergeant it doesnt look like weve got anything here that can help you this doesnt mean youre going to back out of your promise to get me into the witness relocation program does it vaughan chuckled and then was all business if your wife was struck by a cab and the driver fled the scene he began and then corrected himself strike that if your mother was struck by a cab and the driver fled the scene who in your division would you want on the case paul davidson no question the officer hadnt even hesitated hes that good said vaughan you asked me who id want id want paul davidson now if the guy had struck my motherinlaw that would be completely different im sure it would can you pass me over to officer davidson please hes up in wisconsin fishing can you give me his cell number vaughan absorbed a couple more jokes about the mans wife and motherinlaw and after getting his promise to put in the word for him with the witness relocation program brennan gave him the number thirty seconds later a cell tower had located paul davidson on wisconsin s lake geneva you have reached the cell phone of vacationing chicago police officer paul davidson said the fortyfiveyearold cop pretending to be his own outgoing message if this is an emergency please hang up and dial for all other matters hang up and call me when im back in my office two days from now someone in the background then happily yelled hey look at that hurry get the net vaughan was getting the distinct impression that the department of public vehicles didnt hire people unless they were certified wiseasses there was the sound of line being pulled from a reel as he said officer davidson this is sergeant john vaughan from the organized crime division i didnt have anything to do with it it was my wife and motherinlaws idea brennan already used that one what a thief i leave the office for three days and he steals all my material is this a bad time officer let me see said davidson as he took stock of his surroundings sixpacks sandwiches chamber of commerce weather and the last day of my vacation no nows perfect i can call back if you let that line snap again he said over his shoulder to his fishing companion i swear to god ill drown you right here got your motherinlaw with you asked vaughan no my priest now what can i spend the last day of my vacation doing for you sergeant im working on a hitandrun not a lot of leads a yellow cab hit a young woman about two weeks ago we know where it happened and approximately what time it happened but thats all do you have a description of the driver the two witnesses we have are friends of the victim and were intoxicated at the time is the victim still alive yes but shes got serious trauma and some bad brain damage ive never heard of good brain damage said davidson touché so were the witnesses too drunk to give you a description of the driver they think he was middle eastern replied vaughan okay iranian iraqi jordanian palestinian i have no idea all i know is that officer brennan said that if his mother had been the victim of a hitandrun like this youre the one hed want on the case first of all brennan doesnt even have a mother he was a foundling and theres lots of times i think he should have stayed lost but setting aside his penchant for irish bullshit he does occasionally get some things right then you can help whats the organized crime angle here im also an attorney in this case im representing the family trying to help track down the driver so youre getting paid for this yes said vaughan but when i find the guy then my lawyer hat comes off and im going to arrest him myself seeing as how youre supposed to pursue this as a lawyer and not a cop i assume youve got a licensed private investigator working with you vaughan hadnt gotten that far in fact he really hadnt thought about it until now normally he worked his cases alone actually i dont have one you do now i charge two hundred bucks an hour plus expenses nonnegotiable two hundred dollars an hour thats more than what im charging as the attorney the difference between you and me though is that itll only take two hours of my time to get this guy and unlike a lawyer i dont charge for simply thinking about cases i only charge when i am working on them this guy has been drinking in the sun too long thought vaughan if you can find this guy in two hours youve got a deal i said two hours of my time it might take me fortyeight overall to get a name and a cab number for you but im only going to charge for the two hours i work plus expenses of course what kind of expenses asked vaughan dont worry sergeant ill keep it under a hundred bucks so do we have a deal vaughan didnt need to negotiate with him if davidson could deliver and do it that quickly it would be worth ten times the amount youve got a deal he gave him the rest of his contact details and asked when can you start how about right now are you serious of course not said davidson im on vacation ill call you when i get back to the city vaughan said goodbye and set the phone down on the table davidson reminded him of a cocksure young marine hed gone into tikrit with everything was a joke and he never broke a sweat twelve hours later when the marine went in to clear an insurgent safe house he zigged when he should have zagged and died on the spot chapter basque pyrenees spain the outoftheway route harvath had chosen meant that it was well after midnight when he drove into the village of ezkutatu like many of the villages he had driven through since entering the pyrenees mountain range ezkutatu was composed of rugged squat buildings made of stone its highest point was the steeple of the local catholic church with its tiny storybooklike railway station it was as if he had driven back in time clear the cars from the streets and the village would look no different now than it had over a hundred years ago pushing further into the heart of ezkutatu he came upon its cobblestoned communal square according to the route that had been planned for him on the gps this was his final destination he would have liked to have done some reconnaissance but the village was built along the side of a mountain with only one road in and one road out against the lights illuminating the church facade he saw the silhouette of a man in a long dark coat as he slowed the peugeot the man began walking toward him harvath balanced the sawedoff shotgun on his lap his finger on the trigger he had no idea who the man was and didnt like that he had apparently been waiting for him when he got within forty yards of the church he realized that the figure was not dressed in a long coat but rather the vestments or soutane of a catholic priest harvath brought the peugeot to a stop on an angle powered down the passenger window and raising the sawedoff said thats far enough father let me see your hands please the figure lifted his hands into the air but kept walking forward harvath gripped the weapon tighter and aimed for center mass though they couldnt have looked more dissimilar the mans flowing garb reminded him of the robes worn by many muslim imams and he had learned the hard way how well the costume lent itself to secreting weapons and psychologically disarming opponents thats far enough he repeated the man was within ten feet of the vehicle and harvath could now make him out he looked to be about the same age as him with dark hair and a cleanshaven face he held himself ramrod straight almost militarylike as if he were undergoing an inspection and while he projected a serene countenance he was not like any priest harvath had ever seen before something about his eyes put him on edge you seem to be carrying a lot of weight in your trunk said the priest should i be preparing to hold funerals tomorrow or can we release those two men and let them return to their warm beds and families harvath recognized the mans voice from the phone call two days ago in virginia that depends why were they following me to protect you to protect me from whom from whoever tried to kill nicholas said the priest these are nicholass men no i sent them funny they didnt strike me as altar boy types mr harvath its late im tired and because you changed the route those men are long overdue at home hold it a second replied harvath how do you know what route i took youre driving a vehicle that belongs to the basque separatist organization eta i have been receiving updates on your progress ever since you entered the foothills from the opposite direction from the one i programmed into the gps device we left for you now in the trunk of your vehicle you have the cousin and brotherinlaw of one of the district commanders for your sake and mine i hope that theyre still alive they are good the sooner you let them go the sooner they can report in and the sooner the men of this district can stand down and we all can get some sleep harvath lowered the shotgun and stepped out of the car he scanned the buildings around the square and wondered how many pairs of eyes they had on them at the moment so this is eta country he said as he met the priest at the trunk practically the epicenter replied the man once we take care of this i have a bed and food waiting for you id like to see nicholas first im afraid thats not possible its too dangerous well leave in the morning where is he the man smiled you expected us to keep him here in the village please mr harvath you may not find us very sophisticated but were not amateurs thats good to know said harvath as he lifted the lid of the trunk and revealed the two basque men hogtied inside because if you had sent amateurs i would have been insulted chapter the embarrassed priest produced a basque yatagan and cut the men loose both glared at harvath as they climbed out of the trunk and massaged their stiff limbs though he didnt speak basque he had no problem interpreting the priests remarks as he chastised the men and sent them home once they had driven off the priest formally introduced himself i am padre peio harvath shook his outstretched hand the man had an unusually strong grip i have a car nearby if youre ready harvath nodded and quietly followed the priest down a small street to a battered land cruiser would you like to place your bag in the back the man asked as he opened harvaths door for him no thank you padre i think ill keep it with me the priest gave a slight nod as he walked around to the drivers side and climbed in though it was an older vehicle the inside was meticulously kept and the engine instantly sprang to life harvath closed his door and padre peio pulled away from the curb and piloted the land cruiser out of the village im sure you have many questions said the priest one or two admitted harvath well when i take you to nicholas in the morning im sure hell be happy to answer them for you who are you if you dont mind me asking i dont mind im just a priest a friend of nicholas harvath doubted that was the long and the short of it but changed the subject anyway does he know who attacked him the priest took a moment to find his words it is a delicate matter mr harvath and i think it would be better if he explained it to you himself it was obvious he knew the answer to the question but he wasnt going to give it up let me rephrase my question is the person who attacked nicholas still alive no dead who killed him it wasnt a he it was a she and the dogs killed her nicholas was attacked by a woman the priest downshifted as the road began to climb according to what he told me she was a very patient assassin she bided her time worked on gaining his trust she even got him to remove the dogs to another room that is when she struck then how did the dogs kill her they heard his screaming and broke through the heavy oak door of his bedroom she was mauled to death and they tore her throat out there was blood everywhere didnt nicholas have any security no one was supposed to know he was here it was a subtle disapproving tone that harvath picked up on he invited her didnt he mr harvath said the priest returning to his previous posture i think its best if you discuss these things with nicholas harvath watched as the headlights bounced off of large rocks and thicktrunked trees he wanted more answers are you a priest or is that just a cover no i am actually a priest have you always been a priest i have been many things the man replied his eyes focused on the road harvath could only imagine as they gained altitude it grew colder peio reached over and adjusted the temperature knob trying to coax a little more heat from the land cruisers vents how do you know nicholas he asked you could say we met through work replied harvath how about you i also met nicholas through work dont tell me you were in the seminary together i take it you dont think much of him in all honesty padre i dont know what to think of him he has done a lot of bad things in his life havent we all asked the priest harvath didnt reply peio maneuvered the land cruiser around a small slide of rocks and once they were back on the road stated i know very little of who nicholas is and what he has done he has not taken confession with me be careful what you wish for father the priest looked at him no one is beyond gods love and mercy not you not nicholas not anyone despite what you may think of him nicholas has a very good heart there is incredible decency in him as do all men he has his failings but he has a desire to do good in the world youll forgive me for asking but how long have you known him many years now and you say you met through work what kind of work peio removed a pack of cigarettes from the dashboard and offered one to harvath when he refused the priest removed one for himself lit it from the vehicles cigarette lighter and cracked the window he took a long deep drag and then exhaled have you ever heard of the children of chernobyl harvath like everyone else had heard of the chernobyl nuclear disaster it happened in the ukraine in and was the worst nuclear power plant disaster in history the only levelseven event to ever occur on the international nuclear event scale it distributed four hundred times more fallout than the atomic bombing of hiroshima fiftysix people were killed directly with about more being stricken with various forms of cancer nuclear rain fell as far north as ireland and over three hundred thousand people had to be resettled across huge swaths of area far beyond the chernobyl exclusion zone he had never heard any reference though to the children of chernobyl i assume these were children somehow adversely affected by the disaster peio took another drag on his cigarette sixty percent of the fallout landed upon belarus you can imagine the consequences one of the most disturbing has been the increase in birth defects parents in the affected areas are usually poor scared and lacking in hope if they have children born with mental or physical impairments they often abandon them at state orphanages it is such a common occurrence that a word for them has entered the lexicon podkidysh one who is left at the door early in my priesthood i did missionary work at one of the orphanages in belarus thats where i met nicholas harvath knew that when nicholas stopped growing because of his dwarfism his russian parents hadnt even bothered to try to find a suitable home for him nor did they even have the kindness to place him in an orphanage instead they had sold him to a brothel near the black sea that troubling aspect of his past and the mans obvious love for his dogs had been two of the biggest reasons harvath could not completely harden his heart toward nicholas knowing his history made it easy to understand why he might be involved with an orphanage dedicated to the children of chernobyl he was very generous to the orphanage as well as the children with both his time and his money said peio in exchange he was accepted i would even say loved by many of the people there what happened as nicholas put it the only way one can outrun his past is to keep running but his past caught up with him in belarus at the orphanage we never knew replied the priest one day he just disappeared how did he end up here we remained in touch i told him that when the day came that he got tired of running he could come here and when exactly did he arrive either peio hadnt heard him or he had chosen not to respond he quietly turned off onto a smaller road bordered by high rock walls three hundred meters later a locked livestock gate prevented them from going any further the priest flashed his brightslong long short short shortand from behind a large boulder off to the side of the road a man appeared he reminded harvath of the two basque from the peugeot he was about the same size and was cradling a similar sawedoff shotgun he peered into the land cruiser and after acknowledging peio unwound the chain from around the gate and swung it open for the vehicle to pass as they drove through harvath saw three more men through the open door of a wooden guardhouse that had been obscured by the large boulder they sat around a propane heater but instead of sawedoff shotguns were armed with highend tactical rifles and night vision optics where are we asked harvath someplace safe chapter harvath was given four hours to rest in a small apartment above the stables judging by the heavily armed guards and all of the other security precautions he had seen on their drive in they were at some sort of fortified ranch compound that probably belonged to eta in the apartment a single place had been set at a wooden table in the kitchen next to it was a chipped glass and a half bottle of wine on the stove was a traditional dish of basque beans flavored with ham and basque chorizo after eating harvath slept fitfully with his hand wrapped around his glock just before sunrise padre peio knocked at the door good morning he said handing harvath a thermos of hot coffee gone was the soutane in its place the priest was wearing blue jeans boots and a dark green fleece he had a small bag slung over one shoulder were you able to sleep a little replied harvath good youll need your strength its a tough journey ready to go harvath put on his jacket and grabbed his pack will we be coming back no and just so we understand each other we were never here understood replied harvath as he followed the man into the hall and down a flight of wooden stairs when they stepped outside two horses were saddled and waiting for them it was cold and their breath rose into the air peio offered him a pair of leather gloves i assume you are comfortable around horses harvath walked up to one of the animals and patted it on the neck i like all animals padre its people i usually have problems with is nicholas one of those people nicholas is a thief and yet you have come halfway around the world to help him ive come for answers were all searching for answers i think you and i have different questions father youd be surprised mr harvath after a cup of coffee harvath tucked the thermos into his pack swung into the saddle and fell in behind the priest as he led the way further up into the mountains the trail was narrow and didnt allow for them to ride abreast so they rode in single file it made conversation difficult which was fine by harvath there was still something about the priest that didnt fit until he had him better figured out he preferred not to get too chummy with him harvaths mount followed the horse in front and didnt need much guidance either the animal was used to following the priests or it had made this journey before he suspected both answers were probably correct the trail was covered in scree and large rocks that had tumbled down from above they passed precipitous dropoffs where he had serious concerns about the narrowness of the eroded trail combined with the weight of his horse twice the animal lost its footing and scrambled nervously two hours into their journey the trail widened and they emerged from a high mountain pass beneath them was a lush valley bisected by a wide stream near the stream was a burnedout stone farmhouse that was where nicholas was staying when he was attacked said peio as harvath drew alongside him was the fire set on purpose i dont think so his bedroom had apparently been filled with candles in the struggle one fell over and ignited the draperies perched upon a steep cliff across the valley was a small hermitage or priory of some sort and that that is where nicholas is now said the priest the monastery of saint francis xavier they descended into the valley and rode past the charred farmhouse harvath noticed the remnants of a diesel generator as well as multiple solar panel fragments there were also cables coming from the stream and he assumed that they led to some sort of hydroelectric turbine they crossed the stream and rode to the other side of the valley where they were met by one of the monks who saw to their horses peio then led harvath up a lengthy switchback on foot to the monastery itself though the architecture was simple harvath marveled at the amount of work it must have taken to construct this refuge in this hidden valley deep in the pyrenees all of the materials looked as if they probably came from the valley itself the interior had a solidity and a solemnity to it it was like being inside a vault the only sound came from their footfalls the air of the little monastery smelled of wood smoke and spices at the end of a short hallway peio came to a closed door and softly knocked when dogs began growling on the other side harvath knew he had arrived at their destination the door was opened by a young monk whom the priest conversed with briefly in basque and then excused after the monk exited the room peio stood back and held the door open so harvath could step inside the two enormous dogs immediately got to their feet and came to peio they then recognized harvath and came to him he scratched both of the caucasian sheepdogs behind their ears and crossed the threshold the little man was lying in bed beneath an old wool blanket and looked like he had run facefirst into an airplane propeller someone had sewn him up but the stitches were thick and uneven cut yourself shaving asked harvath as he drew a chair alongside the bed nicholas looked up at his visitor and smiled i assume i wont be winning any beauty pageants no but you werent exactly a stunner to begin with now were you too true said the little man with a laugh thank you for coming dont thank me thank the united states government which reminds me you have the right to remain silent anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law you have the right to an are you actually mirandizing me harvath shrugged its a service we provide everyone now even suspected terrorists youve been living in the mountains too long my friend we declared defeat in the war on terror about two years ago we dont even use the word terror anymore theres only manmade disasters caused by disenfranchised groups who are really just misunderstood in fact ive undergone intense training so that i can better relate to your feelings if and im not promising well get there but if you can assure me you will repent of your evil ways ill be able to let you go with only a warning nicholas studied him you dont believe i had anything to do with the bombing in rome do you hell no said harvath who turned and apologized im sorry father dont worry hes heard much worse than that havent you the priest bowed his head slightly and backed out of the doorway i think ill give you two some time to catch up if you need anything please let me or one of the brothers know thank you replied harvath how about some more bandwidth said the troll as he tapped the laptop lying on the bed next to him patience nicholas the brothers are doing the best they can with what they were able to salvage from the farmhouse the little man threw his hands in the air as the priest left the room they were covered in bandages and wrapped with gauze were in the middle of fucking nowhere and im all but cut off before the fire i had a halfway decent uplink now im lucky to have any signal at all secretly i think they prefer me cut off i think theyre worried that if i connect back with the outside world something else might happen to me so what did happen to you a woman tried to kill me you do have an unusual proficiency for pissing people off nicholass face was like stone she was not just some woman she was a professional she knew exactly what she was doing she couldnt have been that professional youre still alive call it a higher power but at the very last minute i sensed something and moved as she swung at my throat but the real credit goes to the dogs if they hadnt broken through the door id be dead theyre the ones who stopped her and dragged me outside away from the fire harvath examined the wounds a bit closer what did she use a knife straight razor why would you let anyone near you with a straight razor i thought i could trust her i was wrong so who was she asked harvath as he pulled the thermos from his pack and offered nicholas a cup of coffee she was a courtesan he said declining the coffee you mean a prostitute were splitting hairs here call it what you want she was a very expensive woman for hire an escort how did you find her through an agency whats the name of this agency asked harvath as he took a sip of coffee i dont know what it says on their bank statements but to its clients its known as the academy and how does it work they have an online passwordprotected catalog when you see something youre interested in you send them a query the director speaks with the courtesan in question and if she agrees you set up a skype visit as a sort of gettoknowyou session then the price is set and the details are worked out and youre convinced she was a professional not just some whack job the troll shook his head no she was definitely a professional what does this have to do with the bus bombing in rome youve been shown the evidence of my supposed involvement i have said harvath what can you tell me about it someone obviously wanted to frame me they chartered a private jet to sicily and sent a little person with two dogs and a suitcase into a hangar ten minutes later he comes out and the plane takes off the pilots never see the meeting but plenty of grist has been thrown into the rumor mill and a scenario starts to emerge add to that some muslim men who make contact with the cosa nostra looking to buy explosives and why wouldnt the authorities believe what theyre being told the only thing is im not in the arms business i didnt sell any explosives to some muslim terror cell thats cheap and beneath me it was the same thing harvath had told the old man so the idea was to frame you and then kill you to make the frame job stick dead or alive as long as they could convincingly pin it on me i assume that it meant nobody would be looking for them harvath raised his eyebrows and who are they i dont know what i do know is that whoever this person is they began building their attempt to frame me for the bus bombing before it even happened that means they had advance knowledge of it i agree said harvath did you buy or purchase any information leading up to the bombing that could be connected as far as i can tell no there was nothing i was involved with that indicated this attack was coming i dont like when children are targeted i never would have gone along with something like this i might have taken money from animals who wanted to target children but i would have found a way to either sell them incomplete intelligence or leak their plans to the authorities so that i didnt get implicated but the attack would have been stopped harvath was good at telling when he was being lied to right now he wasnt so you believe the woman who tried to kill you was placed at the academy as bait im sure of it who knows that youre a client nicholas thought for a moment its not something i advertise theres the women themselves and the director other than that nobody harvath knew the list had to be longer than that he was also certain nicholas knew it as well in the sex trade everything was for sale even the identity of valued customers it all came down to how much someone was willing to pay whoever placed the woman there knew enough to build a profile that i would find irresistible i should have known better you should have but right now thats not my problem when padre peio called me he said you believed there would be more attacks i want to know when and where the troll began to shrug but abandoned the gesture due to the pain im only picking up bits and pieces there has been chatter the handful of sources i have communicated with are talking about attacks in multiple european cities against americans like the one in rome or something different i dont know cmon nicholas said harvath if were going to stop these attacks i have to know more nothing would make me happier than to give you more information but everything has gone quiet you know what that means harvath did know what that meant terror networks often went dark before a big attack our best hope for stopping these people is for you to uncover who placed my attacker at the academy he was right the directors name is dominique fournier shes based in provence nothing happens at the academy without her knowledge shes an absolute bitch and i promise that she will not willingly cooperate with you well see said harvath what kind of security does she have better than most ive already discussed my plan with peio he isnt a priest is he nicholas smiled father peio is definitely a priest but its what he did before his calling that makes him so interesting im going to assume he didnt run a petting zoo no said nicholas with a laugh he didnt run a petting zoo he was an eta operative wasnt he what happened he got tired of planting bombs and found religion youve got peio completely wrong he wasnt a terrorist he was actually an intelligence agent peio was a spook nicholas nodded with the centro nacional de inteligencia harvath was familiar with spains official intelligence agency also known as the cni how did he end up making that kind of career change you can ask him on the way on the way where france hes offered to make sure you get across the border i just hope you can get to fournier in time chapter chicago friday when john vaughan met paul davidson at a health food restaurant under the l tracks in chicagos river north neighborhood he thought he had the wrong guy davidson was a barrelchested man in his late forties who looked more like a narcotics officer or a hells angel than a cop from public vehicles he had long hair pulled back in a ponytail a goatee and even an earring vaughan who had dropped off his daughter at school and bypassed the starbucks in order to get to this meeting on time hadnt been expecting this weve only got one type of coffee said the waitress after he had joined davidson at the table but ive got tons of teas i can bring over the box if you want to choose no thanks said vaughan just coffee please anything to eat their turkey sausage is off the hook replied davidson vaughan shook his head he hated health food davidson rattled off an order that sounded like it was straight from a craft services table for some hollywood movie vegan this and tofu that it was disgusting why do you eat that stuff asked vaughan because im too stubborn to go on lipitor id rather take a bullet no you wouldnt trust me its not fun youve been shot asked vaughan i didnt move to the public vehicles division for the action when did it happen four years ago i was a patrol officer my partner and i were doing a traffic stop some thug pulled a gun and my partner and i both got capped i took it through the shoulder and my partner got a round in the leg i shot the offender in the head and killed him so you decided to hang it up being a patrol officer no my wife decided no mas patrol how did you wind up at public vehicles asked vaughan due to my heroism and valor blah blah blah the department let me have my pick there was a slot at public vehicles and the rest is homebysixeverynight history vaughan was amazed by how the man downplayed what had happened is your partner still a patrol officer davidson laughed he is and hes been shot two more times since then im glad i got away from him the guys a bullet magnet vaughan laughed listen im sorry again for bothering you on vacation dont worry about it ill let you pay for breakfast and well call it even i was going to offer to pay anyway in that case ill think of something else wiseass thought vaughan youve already got something for me you sound surprised i only called you the day before yesterday i can hold on to it for a day or two if itd make you appreciate it more no what have you got davidson pulled a blue notebook from his jacket pocket and set it on the table are you familiar with how the cab system works in chicago i dont want to bore you with a bunch of stuff you already know i know the basics youve got the actual cab owner who purchases a license to operate from the city office of consumer services its also called a medallion you cant legally operate a cab without one usually the medallions are worth more than the cabs themselves correct each cab is required to have a meter the meter is turned on when a fare gets in the meter has set rates et cetera exactly drivers then lease the cab for a short period of time from the owner the most common lease is for a week for about six hundred bucks owners whether its a smalltime guy with a handful of cabs or a big conglomerate like yellow also do weekend leases for about two hundred bucks if theyve got extra vehicles sitting around not making them any money thats the surface material when it starts to get interesting is when you get beneath that like gas stations and minimarts cabs are a popular entry job for immigrants in chicago the taxi subculture is composed of three predominant cartels the middle easterners the pakistanis and the east africans what about the russians asked vaughan the russians and eastern europeans own a lot of cabs but im talking about drivers the eastern europeans are more into the limo business you know all of this from being in public vehicles i know it because i have initiative public vehicles may be a safe place to work but its frickin boring after a year of wanting to put a gun in my mouth and im kidding by the way i decided to get out on the street i got my sergeant to approve a sting operation i wanted to run on gypsy cabs at the airport i was busting these guys left right and center you should have seen it id pop the glove box and theyd have ten grand in cash and a stack of food stamps it really pissed me off i wanted to learn more so i started building a network of informants when i caught a guy i thought could be useful id let him go which meant he owed you thats right said davidson i started visiting the pool parking lot where they all wait and got to know as many drivers as i could i became friendly with a lot of them and learned what restaurants they hung out at and started eating in those places and so on and so forth what really surprised me was that nobody was doing this not the cpd not the fbi nobody i mean before i could understand them overlooking these guys but not doing it afterward was nuts nevertheless thats the way it was and still is im it how does this play into alison taylors case i put the word out to all of my informants i wanted to know if theyd heard of anything that fit with our case was anyone suddenly out sick was anyone suddenly remorseful or guilty that kind of stuff i pumped my contacts at the cab restaurants the roach coaches the hummus stands the hookah bars everywhere i even spent the last two nights cruising the neighborhoods most of these guys live in looking for cabs with damage howd you do i struck out replied davidson i didnt get anything so so i reached out to another driver i know hes not a regular informant but i let him slide on something a ways back and he owed me i wanted to put myself in the shoes of the guy were looking for so i called him up and laid out the scenario for him i asked if he had been involved in a hitandrun what would be going through his mind i would assume getting caught by the cops said vaughan davidson shook his head not quite according to this driver hed be more afraid of his owner learning that the cab had been in an accident seriously yup and to prevent the owner from finding out the guy were looking for would need to get the cab repaired as quickly as possible enter the triple p whats the triple p piss paint and pray replied davidson as the waitress set his breakfast down on the table its an undertheradar taxicab mechanic and body shop theyre all over the city and fix damaged cabs while drivers wait and theyre fast too the muslim ones have little prayer rooms in them and the joke is that as soon as youve taken a piss and said your prayers the paint on your cab would be just about dry vaughan was fascinated if youre a middle eastern driver you go to one of the triple ps owned and run by a middle easterner if youre pakistani you go to a pakistani operation if youre east african you go to an east african one yada yada yada how come i havent heard about these places before like i said theyre under the radar they operate around the clock only deal in cash and dont advertise they do business only within their own ethnic group and you think the driver who hit alison taylor used one of these body shops to repair the damage to his cab according to my source there was a pakistani driver who brought his vehicle into a particular shop on the night in question he was shaken up and was dumb enough to blab about clipping some woman he wanted to get his cab repaired as soon as possible and was willing to pay extra for it this is fantastic said vaughan when can we pay a visit to the shop right after were done with breakfast chapter they left vaughans crown vic at the restaurant and drove davidsons bronco to the crescent garage and body shop outside several cabs were doubleparked along the street men dressed in the traditional salwar kameezlong cotton tunics over loosefitting trousers that stop just above the anklesstood in front talking many had long beards without mustaches and almost all of them were wearing sandals vaughan couldnt tell if he was in chicago or karachi as the two police officers walked up the men ceased their conversations and stared at them davidson had purposely left his jacket in his truck and all eyes fell to the shield clipped to his belt and the large pistol he wore on his hip for his part vaughan didnt flash anything he didnt need to they all could tell he was also a cop with the overhead door down they accessed the garage via a standard entrance next to it there were four hydraulic lifts two on each side in the far corner was a makeshift painting bay tool chests lined the walls and there were fenders bumpers mirrors body panels and other parts stacked everywhere at the far end another overhead door led to a small lot crammed with beatup taxis out back the garage was lit with sputtering fluorescents hung from the ceiling the first thing davidson noticed when he walked in was a man attaching a medallion to the hood of a freshly painted taxicab what the hell do you think youre doing he demanded if there was one thing davidson had learned from dealing with the cab communities it was that their cultures only respected strength if you showed any weakness whatsoever you were screwed you had to get in their face from the getgo project power and never let them forget who was in charge all of them came from countries where the police were famous for abusing their power they carried with them a deeply ingrained fear of law enforcement that davidson used to his advantage it wasnt any different from how he handled the innercity thugs hed been dealing with his whole career as a cop are you deaf he said i asked you what youre doing with that medallion nothing replied the mechanic as he stepped away from the cab and set his drill down it doesnt look like nothing to me turning to vaughan he said get his name his id all of his information why asked the mechanic why you know damn well that only the office of consumer services can touch a taxi medallion youre in a lot of trouble the mechanic was about to speak when an old man with a long gray beard came out of the office yelling in urdu he was followed by another man who looked to be in his late twenties whos in charge here demanded davidson the old man walked up to him still yelling in urdu until the younger man put a hand on his arm and pulled him back my father doesnt speak english said the younger pakistani man thats okay replied davidson im sure the court will provide an interpreter for him the court what are you talking about whats your name i am jamal and this is my father fahad bashir i still dont understand what you are talking about though im talking about four cabs doubleparked outside said davidson as he wrote down the two mens names im talking about your mechanic over here affixing a city of chicago medallion to the hood of that cab and thats just for starters tell your father he can send all of his employees home he can tell the customers to beat it too youre going to be closed down closed down sir please there must be something we can do we cant afford to be closed down well you should have thought of that before you helped cover up a hitandrun accident cover up jamals english was perfect and davidson figured he was probably firstgeneration american when you help destroy evidence of a crime we call that a coverup what crime sir please i dont know what you are talking about though he had all of the details committed to memory davidson flipped back several pages in his notebook and recounted the facts on friday june in the early morning hours a yellow taxicab was involved in a hitandrun accident shortly thereafter the cab was brought here for repairs you fixed it we fix many cabs that have been in accidents thats what we do the young man stopped and translated for his father who was demanding to be filled in after communicating briefly with his father jamal turned back to davidson we dont ask our customers how their damage happened we simply repair the vehicles even if a customer told us how the damage had been committed why would we suspect that they had not done the right thing and alerted the police i dont like being messed with said davidson bypassing the young mans excellent point well hash this out in court in the meantime youre going to be shut down the older pakistani man said something to his son and gestured toward the office area vaughan came back from collecting the mechanics personal information and stood next to davidson we keep very good records stated jamal my father doesnt want any trouble if you come to the office with me well see what we can do the old man bowed his head and gestured toward the office encouraging the policemen to follow his son the office reminded vaughan of many he had seen while in iraq there were prayer rugs in the corner and the walls were relatively unadorned save for a pakistani airline calendar that looked as if it was ten years out of date he looked up at the stained acoustic ceiling tiles above the rooms three desks and figured it had to suck being in here when it rained in fact it probably sucked being here at any time he could only imagine the toxic mold that was growing up in the ceiling jamal was looking through a filing cabinet when his father returned with three mugs and a small dish of sweets vaughan didnt have to look inside the cups to know what was being servedtea the old man gestured to a threadbare couch fronted by a nickedup coffee table and two mismatched chairs davidson nodded for vaughan to sit down both of the officers knew that nothing got done in the muslim world without tea as jamal continued to look through his files the other men sat and took tea finally the young man said i cant find it cant find what replied davidson the tone of his voice indicating that he wasnt happy our logbook we keep one with all of the details of the repairs we do i cant find it bullshit im serious said jamal who then spoke several words to his father once the old man responded jamal pointed at one of the desks and said the other man who works here he keeps the logbook whats his name ali masud davidson wrote it down where is he now jamal shrugged do you have a phone number for him yes call him the young man removed his cell phone and dialed moments later he began speaking he chatted for less than a minute and then hung up davidson looked at him so does he have the logbook jamal put his palms up and smiled his head bobbed as if he had just been given the answer to a profound riddle ali masud took the logbook home with him last night and and hes coming in to work in about three hours and will bring the book back davidson stood and said then well be back in two and if that book isnt here im not only going to have you closed down im going to arrest you and your father for obstruction of justice is that clear jamal nodded as vaughan stood and the two officers left the garage out on the sidewalk davidson asked what do you think i think hes lying i do too so what do we do davidson fished his keys out of his pocket as they approached the bronco we give him the two hours and if he dicks us around we go to plan b whats plan b ill let you know when i figure it out chapter at the appointed hour vaughan and davidson returned to the crescent garage and body shop and were shown into the office jamal sat behind one of the desks with a red spiral notebook in front of him sitting on the couch were his father and another pakistani man who they assumed was ali masud jamal never bothered to introduce him is that it said davidson as he approached the desk as promised davidson flipped open the cover to the first page and noticed that it was damp what happened ali masud regrettably spilled some tea on it you can still read all the information davidsons bs detector was fast approaching the red zone quietly he turned the moist pages the handwriting was meticulous and listed each cab number the date what work was done and the dollar amount this is your handwriting he asked the man sitting next to the old man on the couch its his answered jamal am i talking to you asked davidson no then be quiet davidson asked the question again is this your handwriting the man on the couch nodded davidson stopped when he got to the entries for july the date of alison taylors hitandrun do you recall a cab coming in here on or around the ninth of july with damage from a hitandrun the man shook his head whats your name ali masud mr masud do you recall anyone talking about a hitandrun accident recently no sir replied masud i do not davidson studied all of the entries for july and wrote down the cab numbers and then did the same for the next seven days can you make a copy of this for me he asked jamal i would be happy to sir said jamal as he gathered up the book and walked over to a small xerox machine davidson turned his attention back to masud have you ever had a customer who needed repairs due to hitting a pedestrian the pakistani shrugged i would have to look back through the files i cant expect you to remember something like that davidson cracked ali masud didnt respond jamal returned with the copies and handed them to davidson im sorry we couldnt be more helpful me too said davidson as he removed a pair of handcuffs while he was sure all three of the men were lying vaughan had not witnessed anything that constituted an arrestable offense the last thing he wanted was to get dragged into a falsearrest claim with davidson leaning in he said quietly what are you doing time for plan b answered davidson as he walked out of the office and onto the garage floor vaughan followed him and was just in time to see him point to the mechanic from earlier and holding the handcuffs at his side say you put your tools down and come over here you are under arrest me said the mechanic you davidson had only taken two steps toward him when the mechanic dropped his tools and bolted for the door looking at vaughan he yelled get him ill get the car vaughan made it out the door just in time to see the mechanic turn right at the corner chasing suspects was one of his least favorite parts about the job but he took off after him turning right at the corner he saw the mechanic cross the street and turn into the alley if there was one place you didnt want to chase someone it was into an alley the problem was that these guys seldom ran across open flowerstrewn meadows the mechanic cut in between two buildings leapt up onto a dumpster and flipped over a chainlink fence into a vacant lot vaughan was fifty yards behind him and closing at the far side of the lot the mechanic hit the pavement and turned left vaughan had not chased a lot of pakistanis but if this was what he could expect the next time he made a mental note to just take out his gun and shoot the guy stop running he yelled but the pakistani man wasnt interested in following orders instead he picked up his pace even further this guy was running like his life was on the line vaughan was pissed where the hell was davidson they came to the next intersection and the mechanic didnt even slow down he ran right through traffic and almost got nailed horns were still blaring as vaughan who was tightening the gap raced across the street after him up ahead the pakistani began to slow down whatever reserves he had he must have burned through them nearing the middle of the block he stopped and risked a glance backward thats right vaughan yelled you fucking stop right there the mechanic must have judged the distance and figured he had enough energy left to outrun the police officer because something flickered over his face ever so briefly it looked like a smile he wasnt stopping he was just catching his breath that did it now vaughan was really pissed not only was he going to catch this dirtbag he was going to beat him full of courtesy with either an emily post guide or the chicago phone book whichever was thicker go ahead start running again asshole he thought to himself it was almost as if the pakistani man could read his mind with his eyes still glued to vaughan he sucked in a huge breath of air and took off once again he had only made it three steps when he stepped off the curb into the area where the alley met the street and paul davidson hit him with his bronco the mechanic tumbled across the ground like a human lint roller picking up shards of glass and loose gravel as he went it wasnt the worst road rash ever suffered by man but for a guy that hadnt been pitched off a bike or a motorcycle it was pretty impressive by the time vaughan reached them davidson had already leapt out of his truck and had the suspects arms pinned behind his back they teach you that move in public vehicles asked vaughan as he leaned against the building at the mouth of the alley and tried to catch his breath my doctor says i shouldnt exert myself replied davidson as he snapped a pair of cuffs on the mechanic and yanked him to his feet i am in pain complained the pakistani the party is just starting my friend said davidson as he led him into the alley and propped him up behind his truck his breathing slowly coming back under control vaughan walked back and joined them i told you not to run i am sorry sir replied the mechanic its a little late for that please sir i cannot go to the jail davidson laughed oh yes you can my friend and it is not a happy place the pakistani looked away from him and for some reason seemed to decide that vaughan was the more rational and reasonable of the pair and focused on him sir please no jail you should have thought of that before you started running actually injected davidson you should have thought of that before you started playing with cab medallions like they were refrigerator magnets i can pay you said the man i have money please dont do that said vaughan bribing a police officer is a very serious offense and you are already in enough trouble as it is whats your name javed miraj davidson removed his notebook and wrote the mans name down where do you live the man answered and after a few more questions about his background vaughan asked why did you run i told you sir said miraj i do not wish to go to the jail i got that part what i want to know is why you ran the mechanic was quiet for several moments before responding if i go to the jail i will be sent back to pakistan youre illegal javed miraj hung his head and nodded vaughan whistled not good javed not good at all my friend unless you can convince a judge youre from mexico youre definitely going to be on the next plane out of here can you habla español miraj looked up at davidson and then turned his tearful eyes to vaughan please sir there are no jobs in my village in pakistan i send money to my family so they can buy food if you send me home we will all starve but look at it this way replied davidson placing an arm around his shoulder and steering him toward the passenger door at least youll all be together no implored the mechanic please sir no do not send me back theres nothing we can do we have to follow the law besides you should see what you did to the hood of my bronco i can fix your bronco sir wait a second said vaughan who had figured out davidsons plan b the moment he stepped out of the crescent office waving a pair of handcuffs at the mechanic maybe there is something we can do maybe if mr miraj can help us we can help him javed cant help us hes going back to pakistan vaughan looked at the man and shrugged sorry javed miraj hung his head as davidson opened the passenger door of his bronco just as davidson was about to place him inside he took a deep breath and asked if i help you you will help me davidson stopped and leaned him against the side of the truck its your decision said vaughan you either help us or you go to jail and get sent back to pakistan the mechanic winced and vaughan saw another flash of what he had previously thought had been a smile i must go to the toilet said the man my stomach is very bad you chasing me has made it worse no corrected davidson you running from us made it worse now if youll pardon the pun shit or get off the pot the pakistani was confused he means give us something we can use or you are going to jail right now the logbook they showed you is false it is not real how do you know i heard them replied javed they told ali masud to make up a new book davidson knew it theyd even spilled tea on it to age it and disguise the fact that it was brand new so we were right he said the cab from that night had been there yes who worked on it asked vaughan javed looked at him i did chapter provence france saturday fortyfive kilometers east of the border padre peio pulled into a tiny french village and parked behind a fouryearold blue citroën he had taken a circuitous route through the mountains and down into france much of what they had driven on could hardly have been called roads at all in fact harvath suspected that they were very likely basque smuggling routes but he didnt ask he was more interested in listening to peio as they drove the priest had opened up about his past the information came slowly at first but built from there harvath wondered how many people the priest had ever shared his story with he doubted his fellow priests would fully understand harvath wondered if because of their similar backgrounds peio felt more comfortable with him that somehow harvath was better equipped to understand it he began by talking about his family they were basque and his father had worked for the government when peio was in his first year of high school his family had moved to madrid with so many members of the family involved in the separatist movement they were worried about him and his older brother becoming involved with eta too the fear wasnt unfounded within a year of graduating from high school peios older brother had returned to the basque country and joined three months later he was killed in a shootout with police the family was devastated peio did his compulsory military service and proved himself quite proficient in military intelligence he extended his tour completed his college degree on nights and weekends and eventually transferred into the spanish intelligence service where he met his wife they deeply loved their jobs and each other they had a plan to work five more years in the intelligence field and then transition into something steady and less dangerous so that they could begin a family they were six months shy of that goal when on a cold march morning in peios wife alicia boarded a rush hour commuter train for madrid at am just as the train was pulling out of the station an improvised explosive device planted by muslim terrorists detonated killing her instantly it was the spanish and spain was in shock peio was beyond devastated as an intelligence operative who specialized in muslim extremism he felt that he had not only failed his country but that somehow he should have been able to prevent the attack because he hadnt he had gotten alicia killed none of what was going through his mind could have been further from the truth but peio had slipped into a very dangerous mental and emotional state he came into work the very next day demanding to be allowed on the investigation his superiors rightly refused his request and sent him home placing him on a leave of absence friends from work took turns staying with him over the next two days until the third day when he disappeared his colleagues assumed he had gone up to the basque country to get away from madrid and the scene of his wifes murder they had no idea how wrong they were over the next thirtysix hours peio hunted down and brutally interrogated several muslim extremists severely hampering the spanish investigation no matter what direction the authorities chose to follow peio like some allknowing deity had already been there he captured two members of the terror cell and tortured them for three days before executing them after drawing out all the money in his bank account he left madrid for the island of cabrera where he drank himself nearly to death and became hooked on heroin when he ran out of money he attempted suicide it was a priest on the tiny island who found him and helped bring him back from the dead when it became time for peio to decide whether or not to return to madrid and put the pieces of his previous life back together he felt that god had another plan for him as harvath now sat waiting for dominique fournier it was peios last statement that made him wish the priest had kept his past to himself the biggest regret peio said he had was not the brutal interrogations the tortures or the executions of the terrorists he had captured for those acts he had repented atoned and would ultimately have to answer to god what he regretted the most was not having had children with his wife if theyd had children even just one those days and months after alicias death would have been different harvath doubted it any real man especially someone with peios background would have tried to hunt down his wifes killers it was the sixmonth bender heroin addiction and suicide attempt that were troubling maybe a child would have prevented peio from sinking so far into despair but maybe not there was no telling for all he knew peios circuits werent exactly wired properly the way his past life still seemed to pull at him he had serious doubts about whether or not the man could or would remain a priest what bothered harvath was the whole thing about not having kids he didnt mind peio unloading on him it was a long drive and maybe he really did see something in harvath that made him feel he could confide in him but that his biggest regret even after god had supposedly called him to a life in the church was never having had kids really stuck with harvath if this man a priest couldnt get over it how would he there were parallels between peios loyalty to the church and his loyalty to tracy that he didnt want to even begin exploring he had some very serious things to consider but for now they would have to wait dominique fournier was almost within his grasp nicholas had been right about her security measures they were indeed better than most but they werent perfect with limited bandwidth his satellite phone and a small wire transfer from one of his many bank accounts finding fourniers achilles heel had not proven difficult the woman had made more than a few enemies in her lifetime the terraced hills near fourniers estate were fronted by stone walls and planted with grapevines and olive trees the fields beyond were an undulating sea of lavender it was definitely one of the more picturesque places harvath had ever conducted an ambush after confirming that fournier had left the house he returned to the citroën tossed his binoculars into his pack popped the hood and waited fifteen minutes later she and her bodyguard came jogging up the road leaning against the front of the car he put on his most charming smile fournier was a stunning woman she was in her late forties stood almost six feet tall and had been a print and runway model until the business had finished chewing her up and had spit her out she had long red hair drawn back in a ponytail and green eyes and there wasnt an ounce of fat on her extremely athletic body which harvath had a more than ample view of as she was wearing one of the skimpiest jogging outfits he had ever seen her bodyguard looked hard as nails he was about the same age but stood two inches shorter he wore a fanny pack which is where harvath assumed he carried his weapon he was cleancut and intelligent looking this guy wasnt just hired muscle he was experienced and professional harvath noticed his demeanor change the minute he spotted him he stiffened up and gave his protectee a subtle signal to drop back as they drew closer harvath stood up straighter and waved the bodyguard was in front of fournier by several feet and cautiously approached in addition to jogging the same road every day with only one bodyguard dominique fournier had another weak spot her vanity if this is what roadside assistance looks like in france im going to have to make sure i break down more often though harvath spoke very good french he wanted to put the pair at ease with him as quickly as possible he figured the best way was to play the role of american tourist he wasnt ready for what came next whats wrong with your car said the bodyguard in perfect english his accent sounded like he came from somewhere around baltimore are you american asked harvath his smile growing even broader yes replied the bodyguard who continued to remain professional whats wrong with your car i dont know i think citroën is french for piece of shit the bodyguard cracked a smile when we get to a phone well call a wrecker for you why dont you see if you can help him richard said fournier as she stepped up and introduced herself my name is dominique bonjour dominique said harvath my names russ its nice to meet you russ are you here for the summer or just passing through she had an incredibly sexy accent and harvath could have stood there all day and listened to her speak im here for the summer actually really how nice did you bring your wife or maybe your girlfriend nope just me thats even nicer the sex appeal just oozed from this woman it was obvious that she was interested in harvath he turned his attention to the bodyguard i appreciate your help im not really a car guy richard is very good with all things mechanical said fournier ill see what i can do why dont you hop in and try to start it while the man was being polite harvath could see that he hadnt let his guard down one bit he really was a professional the only reason he was helping a stranded motorist was that his employer had asked him to he knew better than most how often this kind of ploy was used to facilitate an attack okay said harvath as he opened the door and slid into the drivers seat here goes he turned the key anything the bodyguard looked under the hood and laughed turn it off for a second and try it again harvath did and the engine roared to life thats fantastic thank you what did you do the ignition control module was loose i tightened it up but you should get it checked out i will thank you said harvath who then looked at fournier and added and thank you do you have a pen she asked harvath fished around in the glove box until he found one and then handed it to her give me your hand she said he obeyed sticking his left hand out the window palm up fournier leaned into it and allowed it to rub against her upper thigh for a moment harvath felt a jolt of electricity rush through him she then cupped his hand and wrote her cell phone number on his palm i suggest you call me before it rubs off before harvath could respond fournier tilted her head and she and the bodyguard began jogging once again harvath took a breath and noted that his heart was actually beating faster fournier had gotten to him tossing the pen on the floor he shook it off and put the car in gear he drove slowly allowing them to pull a bit ahead of him it was a tactical decision meant to disarm the bodyguard that said it also provided an excellent opportunity to check out dominique fournier from behind she was gorgeous not only that she had been very charming he couldnt tell why nicholas thought she was such a bitch harvath began to increase his speed until he pulled right up alongside the runners thanks again for the help he said the bodyguard smiled back anytime he replied that was when harvath lifted the taser and fired chapter harvath slammed on the brakes as the bodyguards muscles seized up and he fell over into the road he had to act fast he threw the taser on the dash its long wires running through the window to the two barbed probes embedded in the bodyguards chest he had figured that dominique fournier would take off on her long legs like a gazelle but he had figured wrong he wasnt even halfway out of the car when she was on top of him immediately his original opinion of her shifted as she kicked him in the groin harder than he could ever remember being kicked his vision dimmed the wind whooshed from his lungs and his knees buckled he fell to the ground and realized how badly he had misjudged this woman he looked up just in time to see her considerably sized fist come sailing through the air at his head he was on his knees between the car and its open door powerless to do anything to stop her he had no choice but to absorb the blow the problem was that it wasnt just one blow it was several a combination two punches followed and harvaths ear began to ring as a trickle of blood started to run from his nose whether this woman had taken martial arts training or had just attended one too many tae bo classes made no difference he was getting his ass kicked and if she kept this up he was going to end up being knocked unconscious and to make matters worse it was only a matter of seconds before the bodyguard would be up and around once that happened the game would be over even though the woman had kicked his eggs so far up into the henhouse he thought his beak was going to snap off he needed to do something he needed to push aside the pain and get control of the situation now before he could do anything though fournier grabbed the open car door and slammed it into his side harvath had a rule about striking women but was about ready to tear that page from his book the whole righthand side of his body was on fire and five feet away the bodyguard was struggling to stand planting his left foot harvath exploded into the door with his shoulder and knocked fournier backward with it she lost her footing as she tripped over the bodyguard and fell on top of him harvath lunged for the taser atop the dash and pulled the trigger because fourniers skin was in physical contact with her bodyguards the electricity was transmitted to both of them and they got to ride the bull as it was known together the minute fournier was incapacitated harvath removed a handful of tuff ties from his pocket and trussed her up tight he did the same thing to the bodyguard after removing the mans fanny pack he slapped pieces of duct tape over each of their mouths and placed hoods over each of their heads then he had to get them into the car fournier had done a real number on him and it was a lot harder moving the two of them than it normally would have been the bodyguard was a pretty solid fellow and even though she didnt have an ounce of fat on her six feet of woman was a hell of a lot of sugar and spice to be moving right after the beating he had taken the bodyguard got dumped in the trunk and he laid fournier down on the backseat and covered her with a blanket he didnt have far to go but even out here in the middle of the countryside there was always the possibility someone would see them the last thing he wanted was to drive past some bicycling tour of provence with the redheaded amazon queen in plain sight bound and gagged across the backseat for their destination he had searched for something close that would allow him to work without being disturbed after driving around yesterday he had found it the abandoned barn was only a few kilometers away from the ambush site though part of the roof was missing all of the sides were still intact it was well off the road and hadnt been touched in decades it was perfect he drove the citroën directly into the barn turned off the ignition and then got out and closed the barn doors leaving her hood on he pulled fournier off the backseat and then took her to a stool in the middle of the barn he sat her down and gently dragged his knife blade across her midriff before placing it against her throat and telling her not to move with that he walked back to the car and fished some gauze out of the first aid kit and shoved it into his nose to stop the bleeding after hed had enough time to assess the rest of his injuries he tuned in the citroëns radio and turned up the volume the bodyguard didnt need to hear what he and fournier were about to talk about next to the stool upon which she sat was a rickety old table upon it harvath had assembled several pictures nicholas had emailed him it was his hope that they would be all that was necessary to secure fourniers cooperation removing the gauze from his nose harvath walked up behind the woman and snatched off her hood she was frightened and her eyes swept the barn as she tried to figure out where she was and what was going on harvath stepped into her field of view so that she could see him when she did the look of fear in her eyes turned to one of pure hate she tried to say something but the duct tape made it impossible whatever it was she was very animated about it and harvath could imagine what it was she was saying shut up he replied fournier ignored him harvath walked back over to her grabbed a fistful of her ponytail and jerked her head backward as he played the tip of his knife along her cheek just under her eye dont say another word he cautioned look still holding her hair he directed her attention to the photos laid out along the table they were partially illuminated by a shaft of sunlight filtering in from the damaged roof above harvath himself had trouble looking at the pictures they had been chosen because of fourniers vanity he had no desire to physically harm her that said he had no reservations about threatening the use of harm and leaning on her as hard as he could psychologically he also knew that if it came to it and he was left with no other choice he would use violence against her if it meant preventing more americans from being killed but the person who would decide what ultimately came to pass was fournier herself ms fournier you are in the position you are right now because you tried to kill the wrong person he said instantly fournier protested through the duct tape and began to shake her head theres no use denying it the man you tried to kill has sent me to exact his revenge now in front of you you see the pictures of five women the man who sent me suffered serious facial trauma because of your botched attack he is not unreasonable and though i suggested he kill you and be done with it he has decided to keep things fair each of the women you see on the table before you was disfigured in a very specific manner each attack was painful and caused grotesque disfigurement my employer is willing to allow you to select the means by which you will be disfigured fournier began screaming behind the duct tape and shaking her head wildly tears streamed down her face as she looked at the photos depicting the results of torture by acid knives hammers and other terrifying instruments you need to make peace with it ms fournier undoubtedly your looks have served you very well in life shortly you will become a monster and will have no choice but to hide your face from the world im going to remove the tape from your mouth please choose your method the moment harvath pulled off the tape fournier began to negotiate with him please she begged dont do this i have money i will pay you i also have girls lots of beautiful girls they can all be yours harvath wasnt finding her very attractive anymore i could tell you liked me back on the road i like you too i can be yours if you want me i dont want you he said i want payback for the man you tried to kill but i didnt try to kill anyone he smiled yes you did maybe not directly but you used his trust in you his loyalty to place an assassin in his bed a flash of recognition raced across fourniers face it only lasted for a fraction of a second before it was gone harvath had seen it it was called a microexpression and he had been taught to spot them years ago by the secret service you know who im talking about dont you no she replied and the tell was visible again ms fournier i have lunch in nice and a flight back to paris choose or i will choose for you he said tapping the table with the edge of his knife you dont want money you dont want sex she sobbed what do you want harvath looked at her i told you i want revenge revenge for the man you disfigured i had no choice she stated besides how was i supposed to know she would try to kill him ms fournier im giving you thirty seconds to choose i was forced to take her i was told not to place her in the general catalog only the one that was made available to him harvath walked several feet away and with his back to her asked who are we talking about the dwarf of course its the little man who sent you isnt it harvath didnt respond who forced you he demanded as he turned back to face her i cant tell you fine first well use the acid and then i will go to work on you with the knife no fournier screamed no then tell me he shouted tell me right now who forced you i will not ask you again fournier was silent and harvath removed a bottle from his pocket and began unscrewing the top leveque gaston leveque she cried how did he force you one of my girls had been involved in smuggling a substantial amount of drugs into france he was going to implicate me i would have lost everything she was lying harvath could see it in her face youre not telling me the truth he said fournier hung her head and was quiet again finally she said i have a child a little boy his name is david hes eight years old he was in a private boarding school outside paris was leveque found him and kidnapped him he told me i would never see my boy again unless i did what he asked he said if i told anyone he would kill me and david both fournier then broke down sobbing where is your son now back with my mother in toulouse and this leveque fournier tried to stop crying antibes chapter hotel du capedenroc antibes the only thing harvath disliked more than russian communists was the russian mafia and the côte dazur was lousy with them what once was a tasteful european summer playground was now choked with bulletproof hummers women overinjected with silicone and men wearing so much gold jewelry that no matter what direction they faced when sitting down in the cafés they always ended up pointing magnetic north they were as gaudy as the saudis and had bought up much of this stretch of the french coast even the russian president was rumored to have a villa here they did what they pleased and even handled crime in their own special way to wit when the home of a rich russian gangster had been burgled he sent his own leg breakers in every direction to crack heads until they found the perpetrators once the mafiosos goods had been recovered he loaded the two thieves into his helicopter flew it out over the mediterranean and shoved them out the french police never even lifted a finger for years the center of russian gravity was the exclusive hotel du capedenroc its owners were more than happy to suck up the russians illgotten gains and once they found themselves to be the hotel of choice they began ratcheting up their prices not only was it a license to print money they found that the more expensive they were the more popular they became as their clientele rarely used credit cards they abolished their use at the hotel completely instead armored cars came three times a day to carry away the money to the bank finally a bigtime russian billionaire with plenty of notorious connections to the russian mob made the owners an offer they couldnt refuse and the hotel was sold a subtle sign that the economy was catching up even with the russians came when the hotel quietly reinstituted credit cards despite the global economic hardships affecting the hotels clientele it was still comfortably booked throughout the summer months harvath was less than ten minutes away when nicholas called to inform him that he had finally managed a reservation when he pulled the black porsche panamera turbo he had rented in cannes up to the hotels front doors his sports car was the least expensive vehicle by far he counted three maybach landaulets two bugatti veyrons an ssc ultimate aero a leblanc mirabeau a pagani zonda cinque roadster a lamborghini reventon and a koenigsegg ccxr it was easily twenty million dollars of exotic cars right there knowing the russians they all probably belonged to one man harvath tipped the valet and followed the bellman inside the lobby was full of freshcut flowers and potted palms it was bright and elegantly furnished its high ceilings and soaring white columns bounced back the sunlight that streamed in through the porticos and open french doors it wasnt at all garish and harvath put a check in the billionaire owners column for having the good sense not to mess with a good thing after the frontdesk clerk had checked him in harvath sent the bellman on to his room with his bag he had a stop to make before going upstairs behind the concierge desk was an averagelooking man of medium height and thin build in his late fifties he had a long gaelic nose upon which were perched a pair of trendy designer glasses affixed to his perfectly pressed uniform was the prestigious clefs dor or crossed keys of gold marking him as a member of the top concierge society in the world beneath the clefs dor was a name tag which read leveque may i help you sir the concierge asked as he saw harvath approach harvath smiled i hope so he said removing a stack of bills counting off a thousand dollars and sliding it across the counter to the man im going to need some dinner reservations while im here and i also would like to charter a yacht absolutely sir where would you like to eat it was all harvath could do not to reach out and throttle the man right there if only half of what dominique fournier had told him about leveque was true it would be too much he was a fixer for the russians whatever they wanted he got for them drugs underage children for sex you name it fournier used to arrange liaisons for the wealthy guests of the hotel du cap but had stopped she claimed the russians drank too heavily and when they did they beat her girls mercilessly add to that the fact that leveque trafficked in children for prostitution and fournier had severed all ties with himat least until he had orchestrated the kidnapping of her son harvath brought his mind back to the business at hand and answered the mans question a colleague of mine is supposed to email me some suggestions can i get back to you on that certainly said leveque what about your yacht charter if you can tell me which day you would like to go out how many people how long youd like to go and what kind of a vessel you are interested in i can get started on that right away id like to go tomorrow for a half day there will just be four of us and id like to have lunch served as far as the vessel id like a motor yacht at least seventy meters in length oh and wed like to swim of course tomorrow should be a beautiful day for swimming ill get started right away on this for you harvath gave leveque his room number and headed upstairs after tipping the bellman he put the stopper in the tub turned on the tap and called room service fifteen minutes later a waiter knocked on the door and was shown in harvath tipped him and told him he could leave the table on wheels in the middle of the room next he called down to the valet and asked to have his car brought around he then began filling the tub the rest of the way with the ice the waiter had brought he tossed the buckets into the closet moved the table out of the way and once everything else was ready called down to leveque the concierge was only too happy to personally bring harvath an ethernet cable for his laptop and help him retrieve the email his colleague had sent with restaurant suggestions in antibes when leveques knock fell upon his door harvath was ready he opened it with a smile and showed the concierge in once the door had closed behind him harvath sprang the punch took the frenchman completely by surprise and he staggered backward knocking over a lamp and hitting his head on the coffee table as he fell to the floor grabbing him by the back of his collar harvath dragged him into the bathroom and dropped him next to the tub he wrapped one hand around the concierges throat and used the other to pull the glock from underneath his shirt make one noise and i will kill you do you understand me he asked the barrel of the weapon pressed against leveques head the man nodded slowly the terror evident in his eyes good replied harvath he pulled the pistol away and then slammed it into the side of his face breaking the mans jaw that was for dominique fourniers son leveque wanted to cry out in pain but harvath squeezed his throat so hard no sound was able to escape now were going to go ice fishing let me know if you see anything with that harvath raised the concierge up and over the side of the tub backward so that his head went into the water upside down filling the tub with ice and submerging the victim in this fashion intensified the psychological trauma a spinoff of waterboarding it was known colloquially as iceboarding and was based on a concept called cold calorics that could manipulate and irritate brainstem reflexes the sensation of being drowned was bad enough but the layer of ice and the intense cold of the water compounded the experience it also succeeded in better muffling any screams the victim might make the only drawback was that if you werent wearing gloves which harvath wasnt your hand got cold very quickly leveques legs thrashed wildly and harvath brought the butt of his pistol down hard into the mans crotch before pulling his torso back out the concierge vomited out both his mouth and nose and harvath shoved him back over the side of the tub and under the water once more the thrashing started all over again and harvath held him under for what must have seemed like an eternity to leveque finally he pulled him out of the water again and asked one question who hired you to kidnap dominique fourniers son i dont understand what you are talking about wrong answer said harvath as he plunged the man back into the water this time he let leveque stay down a long time the frenchman flailed wildly until harvath pulled him back up once out he vomited again and his body heaved for air listen to me leveque said harvath scumbags who target children dont deserve to live i want to kill you so bad i can taste it the only way youre going to walk out of this bathroom alive is if you tell me who hired you to kidnap dominique fourniers son right now as a matter of fact screw that he added as he tipped the man backward again im going to give you some more time underwater to think about it no croaked the concierge please his name is tony tsui ive never heard of him who was the girl you forced fournier to place inside her operation tony set all that up i was just a middleman harvath had figured as much what was her name i dont know i was just the gobetween tony handled everything i just passed the information to dominique harvath was about to ask another question when he felt the cell phone he was carrying vibrate it was one of the clean sim card phones from the safe house in madrid the one he was using to communicate with nicholas ive got a name he said as he connected the call and raised the phone to his ear youve got to get out of there said the troll i just learned the entire hotel is wired the new owner is a blackmailer hes got mics and cameras in every room but i swept the room when i got in said harvath as does every guest who knows even a little bit about security this is all new equipment theyre using youve been blown there is a security team about to kick down your door get out of there now chapter harvath heard the soft click of his door being opened and tightened his grip around leveques throat quietly he pulled the concierge to his feet he then got behind him and placing his pistol in the small of the mans back clamped his left hand down around leveques mouth if the luxurious lobby was an indication of the money is no object approach of the hotels billionaire owner harvath had to assume his security team was going to be topnotch as well any hope that they might be nothing more than sides of beef in dark suits was dashed when they chose to enter his room quietly instead of breaking down the door harvath assumed the men now entering his room were very well trained either former fsb operatives or spetsnazrussian special operations soldiers he had his answer the minute they stepped all the way into his room their weapons were drawn but they werent in any tactical formation at worst these were fsb at best they actually were slabs of beef in dark suits in the end it didnt matter harvath was the only person with any cover whether hed agree or not the concierge was earning his tip the only weapon harvath had was his glock the three security operatives facing him all had ear pieces and he assumed they were getting a playbyplay from someone somewhere in the hotel who was watching via their hiddencamera system put the gun down said the lead security agent in heavily accented english now harvath kept leveque between him and the three russians at all times as he shuffled toward his backpack if he could get to it he might have a chance of getting out of this stop moving and put gun down the same man yelled harvath talked as he moved careful to remain hidden behind leveque he doubted any of these apes could get him with a headshot but he didnt want today to be the day one of them got lucky listen i dont want any trouble stop and put gun down now or we shoot that made three warnings harvath doubted there would be a fourth tucking his glock in the back of leveques waistband he removed his cell phone flipped it open and held it up so the security men could see it i have a bomb the lead security man laughed there is no bomb lowering the phone harvath slid it back into his pocket as he drew his glock he shoved leveque at the security team and said youre right his first two shots kneecapped the lead security agent hitting the floor he rolled to the right and drilled the second agent in the hand and the third in the shoulder with leveque in their way none of the russians were able to fire harvath gave a small prayer of thanks that they were professional had they been strictly gangster muscle they would have filled the room with lead and sorted out the dead once the smoke cleared grabbing his pack harvath charged for the door he fished a guardian protective devices popanddrop pepper fog canister and activated it in the hallway before running to the stairs he knew that his every move was being watched and that the rest of the security team was being activated they would know exactly where he was and because this was their home turf exactly how to get to him the only thing he could do was put as many obstacles in their path as possible and the best way to do that was to activate the fire alarm as it began blaring he charged for the lobby he encountered a security team of two he fired close enough to scare the hell out of them but not anywhere near enough to hurt them they retreated momentarily back in the direction they had come the next team was waiting just beyond the chaos of the lobby with the fire alarm and shots fired guests ran in every direction there were four security men between harvath and the cars outside he saw a young woman hiding behind one of the couches in the lobby and he grabbed her she screamed as he pushed her forward and tried to lash out at him as soon as he had his pistol up underneath her chin she stopped i promise i wont hurt you but youve got to cut that out and cooperate he had no idea if she spoke english or not but she seemed to understand shoving her toward the door he encountered no resistance harvath hoped that the security men outside were as professional as the ones upstairs had been as he stepped through the doors with his hostage the men exchanged quick remarks and lowered their weapons as they backed away looking for his car harvath saw that it was blocked in by two large bentleys idling in the drive was a saleen s while the paint job was a little flashy for his taste beggars couldnt be choosers pushing his hostage through the drivers side into the cramped cockpit he pulled down the gull wing door and took off even though he didnt need to look in his rearview mirror to see what was going on he did so anyway commands were being shouted as the security team scrambled for their vehicles youve made a big mistake said the woman sitting next to him she had a thick accent it probably wont be my last dont be so sure youve stolen something very valuable harvath gripped the steering wheel and turned hard onto the street at the end of the drive at youd think this car would corner a bit better im not talking about the car said the attractive blonde as she buckled her seatbelt im talking about me and who are you my name is eva but its my husbands name you should be concerned with downshifting harvath took another tight turn and accelerated knowing the russians they wouldnt call the police just like the thieves infamously dropped from the helicopter out in the ocean theyd want to handle him personally the thing was harvath was in no mood to go swimming the security men were going to come after him hard but fast was going to be a little tough for them they were creatures of habit trained to follow orders it wouldnt occur to them to grab several of the guests sports cars instead theyd pile into their heavily armored suvs and wend through the narrow streets of antibes as fast as their enormous tanks would allow hitting the boulevard du littoral south toward cannes harvath tried to focus on the traffic and not the tanned toned legs projecting from the womans exceptionally short skirt next to him i dont even want to know your husbands name he said as he overtook the car in front of them as soon as weve put enough distance between us and the men from the hotel ill let you out thats going to be difficult said eva as she produced what looked like an ipod nano your husband monitors you with a tracking device hes very jealous she said and very insecure okay ive changed my mind whos your husband nikolai nekrasov never heard of him the russian billionaire owner of the hotel du cap now he knew why the guards had been so quick to lower their weapons sorry he replied doesnt ring a bell but in all fairness to your husband ive fallen behind on my forbes lately eva smiled so this isnt a kidnapping no thats too bad rolling down the window she tossed out the device that should buy us a little time if youre hungry i have a friend who runs a wonderful restaurant in cavalairesurmer either this woman was extremely unhappy with her husband or this was the worlds quickest case of stockholm syndrome on record maybe i can take a rain check he said looking into his rearview mirror he could see the russian security team weaving in and out of traffic behind him they had to be insane to be driving like that in those kinds of trucks they were going to get people killed thats too bad the woman said nikolai hates cavalairesurmer but i think its very romantic something tells me you would enjoy it harvath didnt doubt it maybe another time he said as he pulled into the oncoming lane and accelerated the closer they got to cannes the heavier the saturdayevening traffic became drivers honked and flashed their brights but he kept going before a truck forced him back onto his side he glanced in the rearview mirror again and couldnt see the security men not yet at least the momentary satisfaction he felt evaporated when his passenger said it looks like nikolai is taking you very seriously harvath looked to his left and saw a red ec eurocopter tracking parallel with them over the water your husband is very persistent isnt he he doesnt like sharing his things she said placing her hand on the inside of his thigh she quickly pulled it back and gripped the edges of her seat as harvath slid between two cars with just inches to spare now that there was a helicopter involved there was only one way he could disappear and to do it hed need cover turning to eva he said i need a favor that depends she replied when nikolai nekrasovs armored denalis thundered into cannes they came to a screeching halt at a café on the avenue du petit juas as the hotel helicopter hovered above mrs nekrasov recovered from her ordeal over a glass of montrachet the american who had tortured the hotels concierge and shot three of its security staff was nowhere to be seen chapter chicago javed miraj the pakistani mechanic from the crescent garage turned out to be an excellent source of information he explained in detail how ali masud the shops bookkeeper had been instructed to create a new logbook and to leave out the vehicle the police were searching for when asked why the mechanics response was very simple not only were fahad bashir the crescents owner and ali masud from the same village in pakistan but so was the driver who had run down alison taylor in pakistan loyalty followed a very strict hierarchy family first then village and then tribe the rules were even stricter abroad it was a firmly held us against them mindset davidson asked the mechanic if he knew where the original logbook was miraj had no idea but strongly suspected it had been disposed of fahad bashir and his son jamal were smart once they were committed to doctoring the logbook he was certain they wouldnt leave behind any information that could incriminate them vaughan was more concerned with nailing the driver than the men of the crescent garage but this was where javed mirajs usefulness as an informant started to break down yes he had worked on the cab in question he even idd the piece of black plastic that had been recovered at the scene which turned out to be part of the plastic header from above the radiator he described how he had replaced the hood and a side mirror and had pulled a new windshield complete with a chicago city sticker from one of the damaged cabs in the lot behind the garage the driver had been nervous and upset he had offered to pay double to get the work done right away the mechanic had been pulled off another taxi to work on the yellow cab it was a small shop and he couldnt help but hear how the man had sustained the damage at that point though the information flow from the mechanic practically dried up understandably he couldnt remember the cab number he saw lots of cabs every day cataloging the numbers was ali masuds job all he could remember was that it was a fourdigit number with a three in it he was able to provide a description of the driver and even coughed up a first name but a darkskinned pakistani named mohammed in a city like chicago probably wouldnt do much to winnow down the haystack as the mechanic had no chicago family that would be looking for him vaughan and davidson decided to let his coworkers think hed been arrested after cleaning up his road rash they drove him down to the department of revenue and searched every fourdigit cab license with a three in it until their eyes were bleeding and they had come up with their man mohammed nasiri with nasiris full name and cab number they approached the owner of his cab yellow cab company because of his position with public vehicles paul davidson was fairly well known by the cab operators he was also because of his nobs takenoprisoners style fairly disliked he wasted no time in going straight to the top at yellow calling the director of operations at his home and waking him up after davidson threatened to enact a crackdown of epic proportions on yellow cabs across the city the director agreed to meet him the next morning at their corporate offices when davidson and vaughan showed up the director was there along with the companys corporate counsel who quickly and repeatedly pointed out that their cooperation was in no way an indication of liability on their part rather in the interest of being a good corporate citizen yellow want to help in the investigation in any way it could davidson gave them a list of things he wanted and within the hour he and vaughan left yellow cab not only with nasiris personnel file but also with the dispatch logs and gps coordinates that placed his cab right in the vicinity of the accident that evening they were golden now all they needed to do was collar nasiri vaughan didnt need to subpoena the phone records of the three stooges at the crescent garage as he had taken to referring to fahad jamal and ali masud to know that nasiri had already been tipped off if they were willing to fabricate a new logbook to protect him there was no question that they would call and warm him that the police were closing in the question at this point was whether nasiri was still in chicago for all they knew he had hotfooted it back to pakistan and if that was the case their investigation was as good as dead with his address in hand they drove to nasiris heavily pakistani devon avenue neighborhood on chicagos north side as it was saturday the sidewalks and streets were crowded with people doing their shopping cars were doubleparked and those that were moving were committing so many traffic violations vaughan and davidson could have handed out tickets all day long as a car blew a stop sign and almost hit them davidson commented some day im going to read the quran but if ive learned anything in the public vehicles division its that it doesnt contain anything about the proper operation of a motor vehicle vaughan chuckled and kept his eyes peeled for nasiris cab the neighborhood looked like any other immigrant neighborhood in the city people dressed differently and he couldnt read any of the signs he didnt feel here the way he did in other immigrant neighborhoods he was an obvious outsider he could read that in the peoples faces and it was more than just about being a cop this world was alien to him much the way iraq had been the culture couldnt have been any more different from his own it wasnt like driving through chicagos polish or mexican neighborhoods this one put him on edge and he didnt like it it was how he had felt when they operated outside the wire in iraq he wasnt supposed to feel like that here in america the little voice inside his head the same one that had told him something wasnt right on that assignment in tikrit was trying to tell him something again but it wasnt clear enough for him to understand he wondered if maybe he was just being stupid this wasnt iraq after all this was chicago shaking it off he refocused on the search for nasiris vehicle two blocks later they found it this means hes gotta be close right said davidson as he pulled over to the curb should we hit the apartment now first things first replied vaughan as he reached into the bag hed brought along and removed two black triangles about five inches long and three inches high what are those swat chocks he said pulling back the tented part to show the public vehicles officer the spikes underneath if we miss him or he tries to run he wont get very far with a flat tire davidson laughed did they teach you that little trick in the organized crime division i was on swat before i landed at oc i heard you did intel work in iraq why arent you in the intelligence division here vaughan shrugged you know how things work a theres got to be a slot and b you have to have impressed someone enough that theyll go to bat for you so in other words asskissing isnt your forte not exactly no you just dont try hard enough all you have to do is put your lips together and davidson closed his eyes to demonstrate and vaughan held up his hand to stop him i get it he said as he zipped up his bag and reached for the door handle ill keep the car running just in case he comes out before youre done and you have to chase him vaughan was tempted to flip the man the finger but he didnt think he knew him well enough yet lets get a patrol car to back us up on the arrest davidson nodded and picked up his radio i also want to impound the cab so lets get a flatbed too once we have it impounded we can have forensics go to work on it aye aye captain vaughan walked back to the cab and did a slow loop around it the bodywork was pristine right down to the shiny new rivet holding the medallion in place on the hood the interior was clean and contained no items of any personal nature other than a beaded seat cover he placed his chocks one went in front of the rear passenger tire and another behind the front passenger tire this way whether nasiri pulled straight out or backed out of his space theyd be covered the chocks set he walked back up to davidsons bronco and got back in whats the eta on the patrol unit theyre about two blocks away replied the public vehicles officer where do you want them somewhere in front of the building but not directly in front lets not tip our hand until we have to davidson radioed the instructions to the patrol unit hes in the thirdfloor rear apartment said vaughan as he checked the file once more well go through the alley davidson moved his truck to a better spot and then the two men climbed out they were both wearing plain clothes and tried to act natural but they stood out like a couple of sore thumbs in chicagos de facto little pakistan man i must look really good today quipped davidson as he noticed people staring at him what do you think do i have my mojo working or what this has got to be what its like for brad pitt when he goes out huh vaughan wasnt paying attention to his colleague as a cop he was always careful always aware of his surroundings but there was something about nasiri and this neighborhood that put him on edge he knew these were pakistanis and not iraqis but nevertheless he had clicked into his iraq mode it was a heightened sense of awareness and almost hypervigilance it bordered on paralyzing he moved slower than he normally would davidson noticed and shortened up his stride to keep next to him you all right he asked vaughan nodded he scanned apartment windows for spotters and checked the rooftops for kids who might give away their approach via cell phones he looked for the lopsthe little old people who were always used as watchdogs thank goodness there were no shops along this street shopkeepers in iraq were notorious spies it was all stupid and he knew it yet he couldnt stop himself every day in iraq he had honed the skills that had kept him alive while other men had been killed and had come home in boxes once developed those instincts dont disappear but why were they flooding back now my god he thought ive got ptsd you still want to do this asked davidson as they reached the alley and vaughan stood still on the sidewalk he coughed and shook it off im good to go lets do it the men entered the alley and came up behind nasiris residence it was a fourstory brick building with a wooden set of stairs there was a chainlink fence separating the property from the alley its gate was unlocked so far so good said davidson as he pushed it open and walked down the narrow gangway toward the stairs as they climbed vaughan had an inexplicable urge to pull out his gun he didnt nasiri was the driver responsible for a hitandrun accident they werent about to pop osama bin laden nevertheless his hands were sweaty and his heart was pumping harder than it should have been ptsd anxiety attack or whatever this feeling was he didnt like it the openair thirdfloor landing outside nasiris apartment contained a couple of rusting lawn chairs and some empty cardboard boxes vaughan looked out across the alley with its asphaltshingled garages at the apartment buildings on the other side in one of them he could see someone watching them somewhere close by pakistani music was playing a large window with its drapes drawn stood next to nasiris back door i guess we knock offered davidson of course we knock the only time you dont knock is when you have a noknock warrant besides i think we may have an audience lawyers said davidson rolling his eyes no wonder you havent impressed anyone in the intelligence division theres someone watching us from the building across the alley davidson turned but didnt see anything dont worry youre just paranoid this time vaughan didnt hesitate to give the man the finger the public vehicles officer knocked there was no answer he knocked again police open up there was still no response davidson tried the door handle but it was locked youre right he said glancing over his shoulder and gesturing across the alley with his chin we are being watched i think its a scumbagasaurus a what you know what those are he said as he bent closer to the door handle and slipped something from his pocket they suck blood and feed on bribes normally you dont see them this far from a government building politicus assholus is the correct latin term i believe vaughan knew what the man was doing but before he could stop him the lock was picked and the door was open thats breaking and entering the door was open in fact i think i hear someone calling for help he replied closing his mouth and trying to throw his voice like a ventriloquist help me help me the organized crime cop wasnt impressed allah akabar davidson asked vaughan still wasnt buying it allah snack bar paul were not authorized to vaughan began when he saw davidson raise his radio to his mouth announce his intent to the patrol officers outside and step into the apartment are you coming he asked this wasnt the first time vaughan had broken the law and it probably wouldnt be the last nevertheless he wasnt proud of himself shaking his head he followed the other cop inside chapter it was a dump they entered through the door into the kitchen a plate of food sat halfeaten on a folding table covered with a vinyl table cloth somebody left in a hurry said vaughan he touched the food to test its temperature and then walked over to the stove and reached for the teapot both were cold he shook his head at davidson the fridge contained very little there was nothing in the freezer as they made their way further into the apartment davidson pulled his weapon and vaughan followed suit they cleared the bedroom living room and bathroom no one was there davidson reholstered his weapon well seeing as how weve already crossed the rubicon do you want to take a more indepth look around neither the cop nor the lawyer in him wanted to make an already bad and unquestionably illegal situation worse by turning nasiris apartment inside out but it wasnt the cop or the lawyer inside him that won out there was no question that what he was doing was wrong he couldnt moralize it rationalize it or loophole his way out of it but he didnt feel guilty about it mohammed nasiri had run down a woman and had fled the scene people from his village then tried to cover up for him whether he asked them to or not made no difference judging from what he saw in the apartment and what his gut had told him nasiri had been tipped that the police were on his trail cops were not bad people in fact for the most part cops were one of the best classes of people vaughan had ever known they were the good guys they stood on the side of law and order and civilization they manned the wall that protected everyday good hardworking americans they were the sheepdogs and beyond that wall there were the wolves at times the wolves could be smart very smart a few knew just how much rope the people had given their sheepdogs and they operated just beyond it they were constantly coming up with new ways to stay one step ahead of the law luckily enough for the people the majority of the wolves were stupid when they were caught it was not always because of great police work but because of some colossally stupid mistake it bothered john vaughan that while the wolves were constantly evolving and finding new ways to commit crimes and horrible acts of violence the sheepdogs remained bound by the same rules of engagement the courts seemed more disposed to protect the criminals before their victims and that was wrong but so was breaking into an apartment and searching it without a warrant vaughan knew that but he didnt care not right now in fact he had been slowly caring less and less the longer he stayed on the job did that make him a bad person maybe maybe not what he knew was that if he had to bend and sometimes break the rules to bring the guilty to justice he was willing to consider it hed seen far too much suffering and far too many bad guys escape answering for their crimes to completely ignore the fact that sometimes the ends do justify the means which room do you want asked davidson halfway into the bedroom already all of them all of them thats right said vaughan as he pushed past him into the bedroom now watch the back door and make sure we dont get ambushed he worked quickly and methodically nasiri had a lot of books and not much else almost all of them were in urdu the national language of pakistan it was a language vaughan couldnt read so he took a picture of the books with his camera phone he had a friend in marine intelligence he could send it to for translation though he had a feeling he wasnt going to like what he heard back his feeling was based on nasiris other books the ones he had in english they had all been penned by the same author sayyid qutb qutb was the intellectual father of islamic fundamentalism and his teachings were at the very core of muslim justification for violence and jihad in the name of islam two of his biggest fans were osama bin laden and his deputy ayman alzawahiri vaughan had read an interesting compendium of qutbs work while he was in iraq called the sayyid qutb reader by albert bergesen it was his gateway into the mind of islamic terrorism and the fact that mohammed nasiri had several titles by qutb only reinforced the unease he was feeling he continued to search the apartment hoping to find something that would tell him where nasiri had gone or what he was planning to do there was nothing no personal letters no laptop no cell phone the man didnt even have a landline but those were growing less and less popular these days in short he and davidson had taken a huge risk had broken several laws and had come up with nothing even nasiris shirts trousers and jackets were clean what pocket litter there was wasnt helpful the whole place looked more like a movie set than the apartment of an actual human being vaughan walked back into the kitchen davidson was sitting at the table and looked up anything nothing replied vaughan do you mind if i take a look around now that youre done vaughan grabbed a towel off the counter and threw it to him go ahead just make sure you wipe everything down i dont want to leave any prints behind cautious motherfucker arent you ten minutes he replied and then were out of here davidson nodded and headed toward the bedroom opening up the double doors beneath the sink with the toe of his shoe vaughan bent down and looked for another towel or a rag of his own there were certain places you didnt want to be linked to an apartment you broke into without a warrant was definitely one of them followed closely by a residence belonging to a muslim cab driver who had a fondness for sayyid qutb nothing but trouble could come from being connected to this place under the sink he found a white plastic grocery bag stuffed with more of the same white plastic bags in the center was what looked like a pink towel he emptied the lot of them onto the kitchen floor only to realize that the pink mass in the center wasnt a towel but a folded shopping bag from a beauty supply store it was an odd item for nasiri to have maybe someone had left it in his cab or maybe nasiri had a girlfriend if they could locate a girlfriend they might be able to locate him vaughan unfolded the bag there was a silhouette of a woman with perfectly coifed hair and the name address and phone number of the store vaughan opened the bag and looked inside he found a receipt dated two days before the accident nasiri had purchased only one item but multiple bottles of it vaughan began going through the other bags looking for receipts he didnt find a ton but he found enough and they were very interesting in addition to purchasing hydrogen peroxide at the beauty supply store he had also bought more of the same along with drain cleaner at grocery stores and pharmacies he included other odds and ends to try to mask what he was doing but vaughan knew what he was up to nasiri wasnt giving out dye jobs and throwing draincleaning parties for his friends davidson stepped back into the kitchen and saw vaughan with the plastic bags whatd you find do you know what the mother of satan is no idea said davidson triacetone triperoxide tatp said vaughan holding up the receipts should i know what that is its also called acetone peroxide it is an explosive popular with terrorists its ingredients are very easy to get the two most important things you need to make it are hydrogen peroxide and sulfuric acid where do you get sulfuric acid drain cleaner said vaughan holding up the receipts it looks like every time he goes to the store he picks up a bottle or two or sometimes even three he appears to have been doing it in small batches so as not to raise suspicion and fly right beneath the radar vaughan nodded exactly its called the mother of satan because it is so volatile one of the ways we could spot bomb makers when i was in iraq was because the best ones were missing fingers sometimes even hands the best ones were missing fingers or hands that doesnt make sense they were the ones who learned to respect their craft lose a finger or two or three and you become incredibly conscientious lose a hand and youll probably end up being an instructor is that the stuff that was used in the london bombings asked davidson yup it was also part of the shoe bomber plot the transatlantic plane bombing plot the underwear bomber plot and what that afghan named zazi they busted in denver was working on so nasiri is a bomb maker that or he was acquiring the ingredients for someone else said vaughan either way this is probably the real reason he took off after hitting alison taylor so what do we do now im no lawyer davidson stated drawing the word out but that evidence is definitely fruit of the poisonous tree even though his metaphor was a bit mixed up he was right evidence obtained through an illegal search seizure or interrogation was known as a poisonous tree any evidence later discovered because of knowledge gained from the first illegal search seizure or interrogation was known as the fruit of the poisonous tree none of it would be admissible in a court it would also be impossible to get any warrants based on it this put the officers in a very difficult position nasiri was up to no good but legally their hands were tied they couldnt share what they knew about the bombmaking ingredients while the mechanics information had been given under duress they probably could get a warrant with it and come back but someone across the alley had already seen them enter the apartment as far as the apartment was concerned they were dead in the water were definitely impounding the cab somehow theres got to be a way to get it tested for bomb residue if we get a hit then everyone is going to climb on board this case lets say you do figure out a way to bury our poisonous fruit and get them to test the cab what if theres no residue it doesnt matter we cant give up weve got to stay on this guy we legally obtained his name and photograph we can put those out across the pd and ill reach out to a guy i know on the joint terrorism task force ill have him pull all the flight records and see if nasiri has tried to board any aircraft and if he hasnt asked davidson then we should assume hes still in the city and that hes not planning on taking his bombs back to pakistan with him davidson looked down at the halfeaten plate of food we should also assume hes not coming back here agreed so if you were him where would you go now someplace safe vaughan nodded someplace with people you could trust like members of your terror cell bombers tend to need support so im willing to bet theres a cell but how do you track it down asked davidson we may not have to replied vaughan lets finish up here and get back to your truck i want to see if nasiri will lead us to it all by himself chapter abdul rashids cell phone vibrated again he held it up so the man sitting across from him could see it rashid was in his midtwenties with dark hair and a handsome angular face he was lean and stood about six feet tall he had green eyes an unusual feature that marked his mixed arab descent the longer we ignore him the more dangerous this gets the man gave a dismissive backhanded wave thats your answer asked rashid are you serious you know what fuck you marwan rashid stood up from his cushion and threw his cell phone at the man marwan jarrah a man in his late fifties with gray hair and a neatly trimmed saltandpepper beard dodged the phone and smiled he loved the younger mans passion rashid had more than earned the right to be so outspoken he was one of the very few true believers who could effortlessly stroll among the infidels without raising their suspicion his methods of waging jihad were often unorthodox but they were also brilliant it was why jarrah kept him close it was also why jarrah tolerated rashids impulsiveness and foul language blessed with a caucasian father and an egyptian mother abdul rashid possessed a mixed set of features those features were such that westerners never saw him as an arab or as being distinctly muslim to them he appeared perfectly american while to muslims he looked arab such was the magic gift of his parents combined dna with family scattered across the muslim world he had a backstopped cover for the extensive trips abroad where he studied in some of the most rigorous and extensive mujahideen camps marwan had personally witnessed him gun down two jordanians who had tried to doublecross them in iraq though they had known each other for only a couple of years he was proud to call rashid his brother even though he was more like a son the mans experience and skills were beyond question so talented was he and so beloved that he was referred to in arabic as shahaba bright star that illuminates the heavens as talented as he was though he often could be obsessive about details and got angered when others didnt listen to him or follow his plans marwan attempted to calm him down the man doesnt know enough to be a danger give me my phone back so i can throw it at you again you worry too much shahab its my job to worry said rashid as he walked behind his bosss desk parted the blinds and looked out the office window over the showroom floor you should worry too why said the older man with another wave of his hand you worry enough for both of us everything will be fine we are in no danger we will send mohammed nasiri back to pakistan we cant send him back to pakistan now the police are looking for him his name is going to be on the nofly list then well kill him it was a choice made as casually as someone ordering off a menu wow marwan you really wrestled with that decision didnt you mohammed nasiri will be a martyr for the cause of allah that is all that matters did you ever stop to think asked rashid that maybe allah values success more than martyrdom jarrah smiled again are you about to give me another lecture on our duties to islam consider it a lesson in management economics we have a project to complete this project must be completed on time we have limited resources if we remove nasiri from the production line we will miss our deadline not if you take his place rashid was shocked and didnt even try to hide it i cant believe it you want me to be a shahid after all that we have been through youre asking me to martyr myself it would put to rest all of the questions about whether or not we can really trust you yeah permanently id rather you continue to doubt my loyalty jarrah laughed we both know youre much too valuable to become a martyr besides id be lost without your company what youd be lost without is my ability to move amongst our enemies you have been a great blessing to us the older man said as he raised a finger in caution but never underestimate our opponents you must never believe yourself completely beyond their grasp when that happens you will get careless and when you get careless that is when you will start making mistakes which brings us right back to nasiri jarrah sighed what do you want to do i want to bring him in protect him he made a mistake but i dont want the rest of us to suffer because of it the older man began to speak but rashid held up his hand wait marwan hear me out nasiri has been loyal to the cause he will do whatever we tell him to do he can still be useful in fact we may even find a completely different use for him that remark piqued jarrahs interest a different use what are you thinking of the police want him for his hitandrun accident maybe we can use that to our advantage we may be able to use him as a decoy of some sort that is interesting i havent figured the whole thing out but i know that we cant use him for anything if hes dead youre too soft said the older man baiting him this time rashid laughed listen if i cant figure out a use for him ill kill him myself fine next issue where are we going to keep him give me my phone back first why asked jarrah are you going to throw it at me again no i dont want you to throw it at me chapter paris samir ressam took another drag on his cigarette and tried to look bored as he walked down the boulevard saintmichel toward the seine he had made his martyrdom video and knew that within the next halfhour it would be uploaded to the internet along with the videos of seven other martyrs the setting for his had been particularly brazen a graduate student at the international film school of paris ressam had eschewed the traditional backdrop of a black islamic flag this was to be his final film it would be seen all over the world and he wanted it to be special therefore it had to grab people move them the introduction was shot in a park across the street from the us embassy and contained a raging diatribe about americas imperialism as well as its moral and cultural decline the film transitioned to a montage of american tourists at different attractions across the city focusing on the heaviest and most unattractive ones he could find he conducted manonthestreet interviews asking americans their opinions about islam and the involvement of their country in the affairs of various muslim nations all of the responses were then edited to make america look as evil as possible in what would become a chilling reminder from beyond the grave he spliced together a series of shots of unattended bags in churches parks sidewalk cafés metro stations and department stores it ended with ressam reading several passages from the quran set to a popular jihadist tune from his ancestral home in algeria the picture then faded to black and the music was replaced with the sound of french revelers counting down the final ten seconds to midnight on new years eve at zero there was the audio and visual of a large hollywood explosion scenes of the bali bombings were juxtaposed against scenes of supposed american atrocities against muslim civilians and set to the music of the american national anthem finally the word fin appeared and the video was finished there was a reason ressam had never been able to find any work in the french film industry at this moment though it made no difference as ressam crossed the boulevard saintgermain he had no misgivings no second thoughts he was about to launch his greatest production ever it was all in the name of allah the most merciful the most compassionate had he been struck with a change of heart there would have been nothing he could do about it and he knew it he understood why the cell phone had been wired to the vest he wore beneath his clothes if he tried to back out his handler would complete the job for himfrom a distance of course twice he thought he caught sight of the man but each time he looked back the figure was gone the sensation was somewhat disquieting why that would bother him considering what he was about to do didnt make much sense and the ridiculousness of the emotion made him laugh nervously to himself ressam crushed out his cigarette on the sidewalk and lit another he held the smoke deep in his lungs and thought about his family as he exhaled he banished all worldly emotion from his heart like the tendrils of smoke the last vestiges of humanity within his soul were banished from his body and whisked skyward into the warm parisian night the crowd of tourists thickened as he wound his way deeper into the warren of narrow twisting streets around the rue saintséverin predominantly offlimits to cars it was one of the greatest concentrations of restaurants in all of paris it had almost every cuisine imaginable being in the shadow of notre dame guaranteed its popularity with tourists particularly with americans he had wanted to detonate inside one of the citys many mcdonalds restaurants and had argued with his handler about it at great length while the man agreed that it would have been wonderfully symbolic the idea was to create the largest death toll possible and to make the americans realize that there was no place they would ever be safe firm in his belief that islam could only prevail by slaughtering as many nonbelievers as possible ressam strode down the middle of the street to the busiest section of restaurants all of the outdoor areas were packed he checked his watch he was right on time he unslung the backpack from his shoulder and casually carried it with one hand near the entrance to a greek restaurant was a large sandwich board it had a picture of a greek fisherman holding a blackboard upon which the evenings specials had been scrawled setting the bag on the ground near the opening of the tentlike sign he read the menu from top to bottom then he peered around to see what was written on the other side as he did he used his foot to nudge his bag underneath may i help you asked the restaurants owner in a haughty tone do you serve couscous ressam asked the owner dropped his voice grabbed ressam by the arm and guided him off the curb and into the street does this look like a fucking couscous restaurant to you asshole go find someplace else to pick pockets get lost the owner turned back to his guests and smiled no problem no problem he said with a laugh gypsies very bad ressam kept his temper in check and walked to the end of the block turning the corner he stepped into a doorway lit a cigarette and watched the final seconds tick down on his watch the explosion was deafening from his vantage point he saw a cloud of smoke belched from the end of the street and watched as debris from his primary device rained down from above as soon as the ringing in his ears started to abate he could hear the sound of people screaming leaving the security of the doorway he walked back around the corner his handler had been very specific about this part he was so very close now he needed to fight his urge to rush right in let it happen he had been told be patient it was much easier said than done ressam was certain that at any moment someone would point him out and yell thats him hes the one who placed the bag at the greek restaurant it was a foolish fear nobody was looking at him at all everyone was rushing to the scene of the blast all of the other restaurants were emptying out as people ran to see what had happened they were like moths drawn to the flame in the distance he could already hear sirens as he neared the restaurant he could see the carnage firsthand tables were overturned windows were blown out bodies were everywhere and there was blood oh so much blood blood that had been shed for allah and all of the worlds muslims god was indeed great so great indeed allahuakbar he thought allahuakbar and then he began saying it quietly at first but raising his voice as he moved closer to the crowd that now numbered at least two hundred people allahuakbar he yelled at the top of his lungs people heard the islamic war cry and screamed but it was too late samir ressam took his finger off the detonator and completed his masterpiece chapter harvath had wanted to put as much distance between himself and cannes as possible despite playing dumb with the mans wife he knew who nikolai nekrasov was considering all of his ties to organized crime it didnt surprise him one bit that he had a lowlife like gaston leveque working for him at the palais des festivals harvath had pulled into the underground parking garage where he had earlier left his citroën after having wiped his prints from the saleen he had grabbed his pack turned over the keys and had said goodbye to eva nekrasova at the ticket booth she had blown him a kiss and had roared away toward the center of town harvath had let two cars pull out after her and had then exited the structure looking up he had seen no sign of nekrasovs helicopter and so had pointed his citroën toward marseille he made the drive in under two hours and took a room at the sofitel near the vieux port the valets seemed distracted as did the front desk staff when he checked in whats going on he asked there has been a series of suicide bombings in paris the clerk replied the minute he got into his room he turned on the tv there had been bombings at major tourist attractions across the city footage was being played of the devastation at the eiffel tower along the champs élysées at montmartre and near notre dame the facts were still sketchy but there was talk of primary and secondary detonations it was a favorite tactic of islamic terrorists to detonate a primary device in order to draw in further victims and first responders and to then detonate a second more powerful blast french news services were speculating whether the attacks were related to the bus bombing in rome and placed the death toll in the hundreds though many of the victims were tourists locals had also been killed it was being described as the french harvath stood at the foot of his bed still holding his backpack he had no doubt this attack was tied to the rome bombing he also felt responsible he knew he shouldnt but he did the old man was going to be very angry harvath owed him a phone call but before he spoke with his boss he wanted to speak with nicholas setting his pack on the desk he opened up the minibar he grabbed a small bottle of whiskey twisted off the metal cap and poured it into a glass removing one of his clean cell phones he powered it up and dialed the number for the trolls satellite phone you heard about paris nicholas asked ever fearful of the nsas voiceprinting capabilities he was running the call through a special program on his laptop the voice sounded robotic there was a slight delay along with an echo as it went up to the satellite and bounced back down we were too late said harvath we couldnt have stopped it we could have and we should have there are going to be more replied nicholas trust me lets focus on stopping those we cannot bring these people back harvath took a sip of his drink tell me about tony tsui thats who hired leveque yes who is he he is a secondrate digital pimp thats who he is so you know him unfortunately i do answered the little man but this is all starting to fit when the assassin he hired failed to report back in he proceeded right to the next step in his plan which was implicating you in the rome bombing exactly why would he want you killed im his leading source of competition tsui is in the intelligence business asked harvath tsui is barely a step above a peeping tom and not a very high step either hes pure scum hed sell out his own mother if it meant a couple of bucks in his pocket he has been trying to fish from my pond for years but why attempt to kill you now the troll was silent as he tried to fit the pieces together i sold him a piece of information recently how recently in the last year and that was the last time you communicated with him its not like the man is on my christmas card list harvath took another sip of his drink what was the information you sold him normally replied the troll i dont kiss and tell but in this case i have no problem filling you in it was the location of a secret military base in mongolia run by the pla what did he want with a secret base run by the chinese military it was for a client did he say who the client was as unprofessional as tsui is he knows how to keep his mouth shut harvath was having trouble connecting the dots whats the base used for nicholas exhaled loudly ive got no idea how about tsui does he know maybe maybe his client knows all i brought to the party was the location and tsui paid you for that information asked harvath yes he did any chance the information didnt pan out and so he wanted to whack you out of revenge nicholas laughed thats not how our business works if the information had been bad he would have demanded his money back and i would have paid him but he never asked which tells me that the information was solid so he tried to kill you to get you out of his way or to keep me quiet harvath needed to fill in the blanks how many transactions have you done with tsui over the years a lot and you never had any animosity no problems at all there was plenty of animosity but nothing that would rise to either one of us wanting the other killed i told you hes a despicable character but from time to time he proved a useful and lucrative source we flowed information both ways if the price was right and we never let price prevent us from making money it sounded to harvath as if tsui and nicholas deserved each other they were a couple of gossiping old ladies who talked trash behind each others backs but would sit down and have coffee to trade gossip about everybody else if they got the chance the only difference was that the gossip they traded in was the stuff of state secrets and the kind of dirty laundry that brought politicians business titans and even countries to their knees harvath swirled the liquid in his glass all signs pointed to tsui but he wanted to be sure who else could have framed you with the italians the pope himself could have done it im going to assume that youre exaggerating you havent actually crossed the pope have you i dont want to talk about it said nicholas leveque gave you tsuis name and im going to bet he didnt do so willingly no it was under significant duress replied harvath then you need to ask yourself how confident you are in what leveque told you personally tsui makes perfect sense he knows enough about me and what he doesnt know he most likely has the means to find out what do you know about him enough to make him very uncomfortable said nicholas i want to pay him a visit how soon can you get me an address itll probably take me a few hours get started and call me back when you have something after hanging up harvath downed the remainder of his drink and opened the minibar for a second though his ego was more bruised than his body he was still sore from the beating he had taken from dominique fournier but it was nothing compared to the beating he knew he was going to take from reed carlton after a couple of sips of his second whiskey he picked up the phone and dialed chapter harvath had had only intermittent email contact with his boss since leaving for europe three days ago it was time to provide carlton with a full debriefing which was exactly what he did when it was complete he sat back and readied himself for the recriminations he was sure would follow so let me get this straight said the old man you trunked two basque separatists tasered a madam and her bodyguardafter she kicked your tailthen bagged and dragged her to some french farmhouse where you threatened to disfigure her then iceboarded a concierge shot three hotel security guards kidnapped the wife of one of russias wealthiest mobsters and are now sitting in a hotel in marseille waiting for a callback from the man i sent you over there to apprehend is that about right pretty much all except the part of me she kicked it definitely wasnt my tail very funny smartass have you seen what happened in paris harvath changed his tone yes what am i supposed to tell dod tell them i havent located the troll yet you want me to lie to them then dont tell them anything which is it asked the old man are you pulling my chain because i cant tell i could say the same thing to you i sent you over there to pick up your little buddy and bring him back not to be his designated hitter he didnt have anything to do with rome reed it doesnt matter dod wants him harvath tried to keep himself in check his guilt over the second bombing had made him defensive i thought dod wanted whoever was behind the attack and the first rung on that ladder is your pal i agree but the second rung is fournier the third leveque and the fourth is tony tsui were making progress tell that to the people in paris though carlton probably didnt mean it that way the rebuke stung the troll is a dead end he had nothing to do with rome he was framed and the person who framed him is tony tsui tsui had prior knowledge of the attack do you think rome and paris are connected i dont know yet said harvath i didnt ask you what you know i asked you what you think i think theyre connected me too there was silence between them harvath was the one to finally break it would you have connected these dots any differently than i have no are you going to tell me my methods are too harsh no do you think that im being too much of a cowboy youre doing exactly what i expected youd do when i selected you harvath laughed are you telling me im predictable im telling you that youre a professional and youre reliable i trust your judgment youre the man in the field if you have a choice between a flyswatter and a sledgehammer would i rather you use the flyswatter of course but thats for you to decide thats your job my job is to give you whatever you need to get things done well what i need right now is more time how much more asked the old man ill know better once i have a location for tsui in the meantime tell dod that were making progress body bags arent progress scot i promise you said harvath im going to find who did this and im going to make sure they never do it again i agree with you but first give me something i can give dod if you can prove the troll had nothing to do with this then bring me tsuialive do that and then well be able to take the next step it was sunday and the sun was just beginning to rise when harvaths phone rang ive got a location said the computermodulated voice on the other end where geneva thats terrific howd you find him asked harvath its a long story ill tell you when i pick you up be at the general aviation terminal at the marseille airport in two hours what about customs in switzerland already taken care of replied nicholas are you sure youre up for this i wouldnt miss it for the world the white learjet touched down in marseille and taxied to a revetment area near the general aviation building an attractive aviation services hostess walked harvath to the plane he was met at a set of airstairs by the copilot who offered to take his bag harvath politely declined and stepped aboard argos and draco were the first to say hello the dogs werent the only company nicholas had brought with him surprisingly padre peio had come along as well he was dressed in a pair of tan trousers and a blue buttondown shirt good morning he said good morning father replied harvath dropping his pack on one of the forward seats the troll was lying on a leather couch toward the rear of the cabin you should have stayed in spain youre not up for this thats exactly what i told him said peio and yet here i am replied nicholas as he reached for the intercom i want to get this over with harvath looked at peio youll forgive me father but i would think that this is something you wouldnt want to be mixed up in the priest smiled wistfully there is great evil in the world i know that hundreds of people were killed yesterday but i dont believe that the answer is more killing i wish it was that simple father for gods sake peio lighten up added the troll you of all people should know whats at stake here when it comes to muslim fundamentalists the only thing they respect is force imagine if christian europe had simply turned the other cheek at the battle of lepanto or the gates of vienna wed be living in a much different world than we are now but weve come a long way since the battle of lepanto we may have come a long way but they havent to paraphrase churchill individual muslims may show splendid qualities but islams fanatical frenzy is as dangerous in a man as hydrophobia is in a dog its been over a hundred years since he spoke those words and yet there is still no more dangerous retrograde force in the world and before you give me that tired argument that the fundamentalists have perverted the faith let me be perfectly clear on something a religion must stand or fall on its own writings and holy books the fundamentalists havent perverted anything in fact osama bin laden is the best practicing muslim out there he is practicing islam exactly the way that violent nutcase mohammed wanted it practiced its the worlds peaceful muslims the majority of the followers of islam who have perverted the faith they have strayed if mohammed came back today you can bet thered be hell to pay hed be lopping off heads left and right and hed have a lot of help too because in case you havent noticed the largest killer of muslims in the world isnt us filthy infidels its other muslims fundamentalist islam is booming if youll pardon the pun peio turned to harvath im here because i was concerned about nicholas making this journey alone the troll laughed as he activated the intercom and relayed instructions to the pilot dont believe him he misses the intrigue dont you father harvath couldnt help wondering if maybe that was true chapter once the plane had reached its cruising altitude peio unbuckled his seatbelt and walked back to the galley as he removed the trays of food that had been stocked for their flight nicholas explained to harvath how he had tracked tsui so in other words you planted a trojan horse in his computer system a very expensive extremely difficult to trace trojan horse clarified the troll hes one of my key competitors so i viewed it as an insurance policy you cant trust anybody these days ill keep that in mind replied harvath have you put one of these on my computer nicholas looked sheepish when this is over ill show you how to deactivate it peio emerged from the galley and could tell from looking at harvath that he wasnt happy everything okay here he asked fine said harvath as the priest set the food down nicholas is going to buy me a new computer when i get home a very expensive and extremely difficult to trace computer when the learjet landed in geneva it taxied to a small hangar where it was met by two swiss customs officers in suits harvath watched through his window as the copilot deplaned and handed over their passports the officials stamped each one handed them back and then disappeared once their passports had been returned the three men deplaned and crossed the hangar to two waiting vehicles a windowless panel van and a dark blue range rover it had been decided that peio would use the van to drive nicholas and the dogs to the warehouse the troll had rented while harvath would drive the range rover to the fivestar beau rivage hotel they had traced tsui to with the airport only six kilometers away from the city harvath arrived at the hotel within fifteen minutes of leaving the hangar it was an elegant white stone structure in the tradition of the grand hotels of europe it sat on the quai du mont blanc facing the lake within sight of genevas famous jet deau a magnificent fountain which shoots an enormous plume of water over feet in the air harvath valeted his car and checked into his room he pulled out a diet coke and a jar of almonds from the minibar then opened the laptop nicholas had given him on the plane according to the troll tsui had used the hotels wifi service to plant viruses on the computers of multiple guests once the computers were infected he could control them remotely even after they had left the hotel without their owners being any the wiser he used his network of zombie machines to covertly send and receive data without revealing his involvement tsui though had made one mistake all of his cleverly hidden sophisticatedly encrypted data came and went via the hotels wifi system by accessing it and pushing small packets of data toward him nicholas believed his trojan horse would help them pinpoint the exact location tsui was operating from or so he had hoped harvath opened the french windows that looked out across the lake settled in at the desk and dialed his cell phone nicholas answered on the second ring his voice disguised as usual i didnt get a chance to power the battery all the way up this could take a while so make sure you plug the power cord in harvath fished the cord from his pack and plugged the computer into the outlet done he said as peered down at the quai du mont blanc i dont see the van wheres peio hell be there shortly now i want you to log on to the system open a browser window and surf over to any site you like ill take it from there harvath did as he was instructed after entering his room number and agreeing to the charges he plugged in the url for the midget and dwarf wrestling federation very funny said the troll who was remotely monitoring the laptop glancing back out the window harvath saw the van pull up peios here good replied nicholas turn up the tv and leave the do not disturb sign on the doorknob ill talk to you from the van harvath stood up from the desk and closed the windows slinging his pack over his shoulder he grabbed his coke and his almonds and headed downstairs peio was finishing up a conversation with nicholas when he climbed into the van and shut the door so where to asked harvath as the priest ended the call and pulled away from the hotel nicholas wants us to stay in the area once he pinpoints tsuis location youre going to have to move fast harvath studied the man you do miss the lifestyle dont you maybe a little he admitted are you hungry he asked motioning to several small grocery bags on the floor behind them i didnt know how long wed be out im okay for now thank you a couple of blocks from the hotel a parking space opened up and peio pulled in he put the van in park but left the engine running rolling down the window he pulled out a pack of cigarettes and offered one to harvath who declined the priest removed one from the pack pulled out his lighter and lit up he took a deep drag and out of respect for his nonsmoking passenger blew the smoke out the window i gave it up for lent last year he said put on twenty pounds almost overnight those things will kill you replied harvath with a grin as he took a sip of his coke peio smiled back my wife used to bother me all the time about my smoking i quit once for her didnt take i became so difficult to be around she begged me to take it back up again harvath laughed are you married no the priest was silent for a moment assuming i am correct in what you do for a living it must be difficult finding the right woman someone who understands the demands of your job to be honest father i found the right woman she knows me better than anyone else in the world she has no problem with what i do for a living she not only supports me she encourages me shes an exceptional person in that regard why do i detect a but peio didnt miss much harvath imagined hed probably been a pretty good intelligence operative my personal life isnt that interesting father everyones personal life is interesting scot yours i find particularly interesting tell me why you are hesitant were your parents divorced harvath laughed again no in fact just the opposite they were made for each other after my father died my mother never remarried im sorry said the priest is that your concern about marriage are you afraid something may happen to you and that you would leave this im sorry what is this womans name tracy are you afraid that if something happened to you that you would leave tracy alone i certainly wouldnt want to die but if that happened tracy is an incredibly resilient woman peio looked at him so this is about having children harvath couldnt believe it the man had put his finger right on it at least he had until he added youre afraid that the same thing that happened to you could happen to your children if you died youd be doing exactly the same thing to them that your father did to you something like that its nothing to be ashamed about obviously your fathers passing had a very profound impact on you how old were you when he died i was already out of high school said harvath and if you dont mind father id rather not talk about this anymore i understand said peio as he took another drag on his cigarette and exhaled out the window harvath doubted it but he let it go and the two men sat in silence for several minutes may i ask you how your father died said the priest he was a seal he died in a training accident nicholas told me you had been a seal is that why i suppose that was part of it replied harvath i think your father would be proud of you this was one of the biggest reasons harvath hated conducting these types of ops with someone he didnt know what they were doing was akin to surveillance it was grindingly boring to sit around and wait to be set loose on a target the boredom got to some people faster than others and when it did they always wanted to chat and it was often about stuff that was entirely too personal with all due respect padre he said you dont really know that much about me dont i i know you care for nicholas i know you care for argos and draco i know you care for your country and i know you care for this woman tracy you are a good man nicholas told me so and i can see it for myself and no matter what has happened to you up to this point in your life i want you to know that god wants you to be happy even if i want to kill all the muslim fundamentalists in the world it took peio a moment to ascertain whether harvath was pulling his leg lets leave the fundamentalists out of this he was about to make a snappy remark that probably would have drawn the ire of the priest when his cell phone rang it was nicholas ive got him chapter chicago my wife called said paul davidson as john vaughan slid back into the bronco and handed a styrofoam cup of coffee over to him yeah replied the organized crime officer pulling the passenger door shut whatd she say she says shes naming you in the divorce decree as well me i only kept you out one night yeah but today is punta sunday what the hell is punta sunday asked vaughan vaguely recognizing the spanishsounding word todays the day we you know said davidson awkwardly are you serious you only have sex with your wife on sundays and my birthday vaughan started laughing go ahead and laugh said davidson but this is going to affect you too me he repeated how the hell could this possibly affect me youll see trust me vaughan rolled his eyes and peeled the lid off his coffee examining the logs from the dispatch computer in nasiris cab he had discovered a pattern the pakistani driver picked up fares in a certain part of the city at regular times of the day as that area was nowhere near his apartment there had to be another reason nasiri favored it on a hunch vaughan crossreferenced the pickups with muslim prayer times and his hunch paid off nasiri was picking up fares after he had gone to pray the only problem was that there were no official mosques within the entire eightblock radius they were looking at the keyword though was official with one phone call davidson was able to learn that there were unofficial makeshift mosques and prayer rooms all across the city normally they were hiding right in plain sight people just didnt know what to look for such as an abundance of taxicabs in front paperedover windows arabic writing or the word masjid written somewhere on the facade once vaughan and davidson found out it took them several hours but they finally located what they believed to be mohammed nasiris mosque unlike american places of worship vaughan knew that it wasnt unusual for mosques especially those frequented by fundamentalists to be used to plot attacks store weapons and give sanctuary to terrorists anything else happen while i was gone he asked davidson pretended to consult his notebook muammar gaddafi dropped bin laden and zawahiri off for sunday school jimmy hoffa pulled up with a stack of union ballots in arabic and amelia earhart has been circling overhead with this really cool banner that says islam is the bomb vaughan shook his head hey dont take it out on me my wifes not happy either and im sure it goes double for my kids i normally cook pancakes on sunday how old are they my wife would tell you her age is none of your business but the kids are five and seven how about you do you have children no just two extremely highstrung miniature dobermans who piss the carpet if i shut the refrigerator too loud i hate tiny dogs do you mind asked davidson his head pulled back youre talking about my kids here sorry forget about it i dont like tiny dogs either can you picture what i look like walking those little apartment rats when the wife is under the weather vaughan chuckled how about you continued davidson do you have any animals weve got a lab mix mixed with what pit bull now thats a mans dog thats what mrs vaughan tells me he said as he opened up a bag and offered davidson a doughnut sorry they didnt have any turkey or tofu sausage ill let my wife know to add you to the wrongful death suit as well he said reaching into the bag which one has the crestor sprinkles vaughan was about to laud the health benefits of doughnuts when his eye caught movement across the street i dont believe it me neither theyre all glazed theres not a single chocolate one in the whole bag who goes for doughnuts and doesnt bring back at least one chocolate im not talking doughnuts check out the guy who just got out of that car across the street davidson looked up as a fat man with a long gray beard and dark sunglasses was helped out of a car by two younger men he looked to be in his late sixties and was dressed in traditional muslim clothing with a length of fabric wrapped around his prayer cap look at his hands said vaughan holy hand job batman whered he get those backscratchers exclaimed davidson as he saw the mans two stainless steel hooks probably not from baking cupcakes you can say that again dont they cut off hands for stealing over there the saudis do and sometimes the taliban its definitely an islamic thing but ive got a feeling this guys a different story said vaughan lose a hand and you end up becoming an instructor isnt that what you said vaughan nodded judging by this guys qualifications he must be teaching a phd course thats what im afraid of said the organized crime officer as he put the lid back on his coffee cup maybe we should hand this over to the joint terrorism task force now and tell them what while looking for our hitandrun cabbie we saw a man with hooks for hands everything from nasiris apartment is poisonous tree davidson knew he was right but if what we think is going on actually is going on we cant just sit around and do nothing i agree we need to do something but the last thing we can afford to do is to be spotted if that happens everyone will scatter and this thing will go deeper underground weve got one thread were hanging on by and if we lose it theres no telling how badly this will end the public vehicles officer shook his head i wonder if this was why didnt get stopped were not going to let another happen i dont care what we have to do but the one thing we cant do is continue to sit here in your bronco we need a better surveillance vehicle the pi company i moonlight for has one said davidson as he pulled out his cell phone why didnt you say anything before because i dont like using it why not it has a certain feature thats a real pain in the ass it gets hot and stuffy and begins to stink like every other surveillance vehicle asked vaughan no not at all this thing is walltowall luxury its like riding in a limo so then whats the problem davidson turned on the ignition and put the bronco in gear youll see chapter geneva harvath didnt like flying blind they should have had much more information before moving on tsui they didnt even have a description all nicholas could tell him was that tsui was asian possibly taiwanese that was it he didnt even have any idea how old he was though based on their interactions he believed he was young mid to late twenties tops he had tracked tsuis signature to the servers at the university of geneva once through the universitys security protections he narrowed the location down to a lab in the computer sciences department tsui had been very careful in covering his tracks if it wasnt for the trojan horse nicholas had planted in his system they never would have even gotten this close there remained though one problem i cant find a student or a faculty member anywhere in geneva with the name tsui said the troll first things first replied harvath as peio drove the van across the river toward the university are you sure everything terminates in this lab it doesnt get routed out again to taipei or shanghai or something like that does it no thats as far as it goes unless the trolls voice trailed off unless what asked harvath unless its a digital dead drop meaning meaning his traffic gets dumped onto a drive of some sort that gets physically collected and then rebroadcast from another location harvath thought about that either way there has to be a human being involved and that human being has to have access to this lab yes as far as i can tell then thats where well start many of the universitys buildings were southwest of genevas old town once they had located the building that housed the lab peio found a place to park harvath watched the foot traffic come and go and then exited the van and walked off campus a couple of blocks away he found what he was looking for the bar was noisy and crowded with students who were not paying attention to their belongings he was in and out in less than five minutes he walked back with his backpack slung over his shoulder and using the access card he had just liberated entered the building tsuis data was being fed in and out of he found a directory and located the lab he was looking for students came and went no one paid him much attention when he arrived at the lab its door was locked he tried his access card but it didnt work after checking the hallway to make sure no one was coming he removed a set of lockpick tools from his pack harvath preferred lockpick guns but was able to get the door open in a respectable amount of time slipping inside he closed the door quietly behind him the room was nothing special and exactly what he had expected rows of tables with computers faced a long wall at the other end of the room complete with blackboards a retractable projection screen a lectern and a desk off to the righthand side was a pod of offices harvath made his way forward there were at least fifty computers in the room any of which could have been the one designated to send and receive tsuis message traffic at the front of the room harvath saw that a message had been taped to each of the blackboards it was written in french and english it was dated one week ago and listed funeral arrangements for professor lars jagland as well as an announcement to his students that classes would resume with his teaching assistant on monday there was no explanation as to how the man had died but harvath had a pretty good feeling it wasnt an accident the door to the offices was unlocked and harvath walked through he studied the nameplates and decided to start with jaglands his office was clean and sparsely decorated bookshelves and a small desk took up much of the room there were no photos and no personal effects anywhere on the wall near the window were two blank spots where artwork must have once hung harvath took out his cell phone and stepped behind the desk dialing nicholas he fired up jaglands computer what have you got asked the troll there are about fifty desktop computers in the lab there was also a notice about funeral services for a professor lars jagland does that name ring a bell with you no but im running it now while i do that i want you to ping the email address i gave you its asking me for a password before it will allow me on the system replied harvath hold on let me see what i can do theres three other offices here if you want me to check those computers ill probably also need passwords for them but something tells me jagland is our guy lars jagland phd replied the troll who had just pulled his obituary norwegian citizen age fiftyeight expert in the field of computational complexity theory and professor of same at the university of geneva at least until he was killed in a car accident just over a week ago any family the obit ive got here doesnt recognize any harvath was about to ask nicholas to see if he could uncover an address for jaglands home when suddenly he heard a womans voice what are you doing in this office who are you let me call you back said harvath as he disconnected the call and stood up smiling he offered his hand im sorry the door was open i asked you who you are the woman repeated she spoke english but with a germanic accent of some sort she was in her early thirties about fivefootfour with brown hair and trendy glasses she was dressed in jeans and a tshirt my names jeff hemmings who are you im dr jaglands teaching assistant what are you doing in his office we had a meeting scheduled said harvath the woman looked at him and her posture softened a bit you havent heard heard what dr jagland was killed in a car accident when the week before last i had no idea the funeral was yesterday she said im taking over until the university finds a replacement classes resume tomorrow harvath stepped out from behind the desk and you came in to prepare and here i am yes here you are what is it you were supposed to meet with dr jagland about i work for american express dr jagland approached us about a project he thought our fraudmonitoring department would be interested in we were supposed to meet here and go for dinner he told me to dress casual the teaching assistant smiled youre a liar excuse me youre after michael arent you whos michael asked harvath dont worry i wont say anything but i have to tell you that anyone who knows him wont be surprised why is that he said curious as to where this was leading hes nothing more than an overeducated hacker bingo hes incredibly rude as well the woman continued and to tell you the truth i dont know what dr jagland saw in him love is blind i guess so they were the teaching assistant nodded disgusting isnt it dr jagland was easily at least thirty years older than him why he couldnt find a boyfriend his own age is beyond me so what did michael do its delicate replied harvath id rather not get into it he finally went too far im not surprised are you going to arrest him possibly we have to find him first any idea where he might be he didnt even come to the funeral that sounds strange its typical selfish michael afterward we all went out for a couple of drinks and went by the house to give him a piece of our mind the house asked harvath dr jaglands house he and michael lived together but michael wasnt there it looked like he hadnt been there for a little bit any idea where he might be now the teaching assistant thought for a moment and then said the chalet i guess do you have an address you can give me the woman pulled out her iphone and began going through her folders we celebrated dr jaglands birthday there over the winter heres a picture of the place she said holding up her phone so harvath could see it cute isnt it it is he agreed heres a picture of michael too harvath looked at him and he was exactly as nicholas had so poorly described if i give you my email can you send those pictures to me as long as you promise you wont tell michael i gave them to you you dont need to worry michael and i have a lot of other things we need to discuss good said the assistant with a laugh i really hope he gets whats coming to him chapter lars jaglands chalet was located in a small village in the mountains two hours outside of geneva harvath and peio had picked up nicholas who insisted on bringing argos and draco along it was turning into a circus but harvath grudgingly agreed the fact that tsui had set nicholas up to take the fall for the attack in rome had bothered him from the beginning it didnt make sense why not let the terrorists take credit for the operation it was obviously meant to be a distraction but from what another attack was it meant to somehow help the terrorists pull off their paris operation by siphoning away investigative resources or was there another reason entirely harvath suspected it might be a bit of both the one thing he knew was that their best and only lead was tony tsui he not only knew about the attack in rome he most likely knew about the attack in paris and whatever else the terrorists had planned as far as harvath was concerned he was the key to everything most importantly stopping any further attacks based on satellite imagery nicholas had downloaded harvath identified a secluded vantage point from which they could observe the chalet as they planned their next move while the teaching assistant blamed selfishness for the fact that tsui michael or whatever his name was missed jaglands funeral harvath had another theory the man had gone to ground the question though was why harvath thought he might have a good idea somehow somewhere tsui had screwed up and jagland had found out about it maybe he had even threatened to expose tsui whatever the case tsui was dangerous he had already tried to have nicholas killed and now jagland was dead this was not someone that should be underestimated no matter how mild mannered he looked in the pictures the teaching assistant had forwarded tsui was a killer theres no way youll get close enough without him seeing you coming said peio as he handed the binoculars back to harvath well have to wait until dark i dont want to wait said nicholas i want to go in now you dont get a vote replied harvath the hell i dont whos financing this operation who found tsui nicholas scolded peio forgive me father for i have sinned and am going to sin a lot more before the night is through so get used to it i want you to promise me something began the priest nicholas held up his hand no no promises peio looked at harvath but harvath simply raised the binoculars to his eyes and went back to surveilling the chalet the priest didnt belong here he knew better than most what was going to happen once they got hold of tsui if he cooperated things would be relatively easy for him but if he refused to cooperate it would get ugly fast peio wasnt toeing the edge of some imaginary line he had crossed it he had feet firmly planted in two different worlds and needed to decide which side he wanted to be on the men shared the food and water that the priest had purchased and waited for the sun to go down they made very little small talk when it was dark harvath pulled the night vision monocular from his pack along with the other items he was going to need dont shoot him until i get there unless you absolutely have to i want him to see my face said nicholas he turned to look at peio but the priest turned away harvath stepped quietly out of the van it was an overcast moonless night and it was unseasonably cold just like it had been back in spain so much for global warming he thought as he turned up the collar of his coat using his night vision device to help guide him he carefully moved from one outcropping of rock to another when he got to the weatherbeaten cowshed about one hundred meters from the chalet he stopped and caught his breath this was the last piece of concealment available until he hit the house as he traversed the remaining distance he would be completely in the open he would have given his eye teeth for a sniper providing overwatch for him there was a chance that this quarry had night vision as well and had observed harvaths entire approach he could be inside at this very moment waiting for harvath to step out into the open waiting for him to get close enough to mow him down harvath pushed the thought from his mind as he drew his glock and prepared to run counting to three he was about to charge the house when he heard the scatter of gravel behind him he spun just in time to see what looked like two enormous wolves barreling down on top of him he leapt out of the way as argos and draco sped past he recognized the lump clinging to the bizarre harness on dracos back it was nicholas he had jumped the gun and was going to screw everything up with nothing he could do to stop him short of shouting which would tip tsui off harvath had no choice but to take off after them owning a caucasian ovcharka of his own he knew how fast the breed was but nicholass dogs were amazing he was still at least fifty yards behind them when the front door burst open and the shooting began chapter tsui was an idiot he opened the door and silhouetted himself against the light from inside as nicholas and his two dogs barreled down upon him he raised his shotgun and fired the odd thing was the gunfire didnt come from tsui it came from somewhere to his right there were sharp cracks as rounds splintered the doorframe around tsuis head he ducked just as argos leapt into the air the enormous animal landed right on top of the man and knocked him backward into the chalet right behind came draco and nicholas harvath hit the side of the structure and pulled up short he pulled out his night vision device and was just able to catch a flash of a person taking cover nearby tsui must have had a sentry of some sort whoever it was he had done a very good job of remaining hidden while harvath had been doing his surveillance of the chalet he had never seen the man harvath snuck around the back of the chalet and over some rocks behind it he tried to make as little noise as possible he used his night vision device to guide him finally he located the outline of the shooter taking cover behind a large store of firewood creeping up behind him harvath leveled his glock and said dont move and then repeated himself in french just in case turning his head the figure replied its me harvath recognized the voice immediately it was peio there was no time to say anything as a scream was raised inside the chalet it was tsui and harvath knew what was happening nicholas was exacting his revenge the balls the balls the troll was yelling at argos in russian bite his balls tsui was kicking wildly at the dog trying to get him off his pants were shredded and the man was bleeding badly nicholas harvath yelled as he burst into the chalet enough on top of the kitchen table was a terrified yorkshire terrier with a rhinestone collar and a ridiculous blue bow atop its head yipping wildly draco circled the table growling holding the smaller animal at bay the troll ignored harvath and taunted his victim as argos tore into him look at my face you motherfucker look look what you have done to me tsui was screaming for help the tears streaming down his face as he continued kicking at the dog and thrashed to get away harvath grabbed for argos and the animal turned and tried to bite him his snout covered in blood call him off or ill kill him harvath ordered the dwarf didnt comply so harvath lifted his pistol and put a round through the wall reluctantly nicholas complied he stepped away from tsui and called his dogs to him from the top of the table the tiny yorkie jumped down and ran to its injured master peio stepped through the doorway harvath spun and leveled his pistol at the mans head before recognizing it was him again jesus padre the priest let the remark slide he tucked his pistol into his waistband and picked up tsuis shotgun from the floor he checked the breech and then turned it around for harvath to see empty in the corner tsui was crying and writhing in pain harvath grabbed a couple of dish towels sitting near the sink and threw them to peio make sure he doesnt have any other weapons on him and then see if you can stop the bleeding harvath turned to nicholas you were going to kill him more like maim actually you told argos to bite his balls off he could have bled to death if he lives long enough to tell us what we need to know who cares harvath shook his head he was going to have it out with both nicholas and peio but now wasnt the time the yorkie had started barking again and was trying to bite peio as he attended to tsui harvath was getting a headache walking over to peio harvath reached down and grabbed the dog by the back of the neck gently he picked it up along with its water bowl moved it to the furthest room in the chalet and locked it inside when he came back the priest was helping tsui into one of the chairs at the kitchen table nicholas stood off to the side with his two dogs both of which were growling harvath leaned up against the sink and set his pistol on the counter next to him this is either going to be fast and easy or its going to be long and very painful im going to wait outside said peio as he wiped off his hands and stepped away why are you doing this to me tsui sobbed his crying beginning again in earnest i didnt do anything to you i dont even know who you are look at my face the troll yelled again you did this to me no i didnt i didnt the man was hysterical harvath studied his face for any indication he was lying but there was nothing whats your name please i need a doctor what is your name michael lee i need a doctor please get me to a doctor he begged tell me about tony tsui said harvath i dont know anyone named tsui youre a liar spat nicholas harvath waved him off we know you were washing your internet traffic through lars jaglands computer lab at the university of geneva we know about everything washing my traffic what traffic just kill him and lets get this over with said nicholas shut up replied harvath lee looked at him and pleaded i need to see a doctor please not until you answer our questions lee was whimpering youre not asking me anything i know the answers to why wasnt your gun loaded i dont know he said emphatically it belonged to lars you were expecting us werent you i wasnt expecting anyone when sugar started barking i looked outside and saw someone coming toward the house i just wanted to scare you away how long have you known gaston leveque i dont know anyone named gaston leveque why did you hire him to contact dominique fournier i dont know any of these people stated lee please you have to call an ambulance for me harvath had continued to watch for any sign that lee was lying there wasnt any not one single tic tell or facial cue he had a very bad feeling that they had the wrong person how long have you known lars jagland i am in a lot of pain answer the question six years okay i was a graduate student of his before i became his ta when did you start hacking asked harvath lee didnt respond answer the question screw the question interjected the troll kill him if you dont zip it harvath warned im sending you outside i started when i was sixteen and what did lars think of your hacking what do you think he thought he was mr straight arrow he hated it but you kept doing it is that why youre here is this how companies get even now replied lee like casinos is this payback time are you the leg breakers were much worse than that said the troll why didnt you go to jaglands funeral lee looked at harvath none of your business pointing to the dogs he said you can tell me or i bring them over and put them back to work what about a doctor i think im going to pass out as soon as you answer my questions well get you a doctor lee readjusted himself in the chair and winced his family hated me it was bad enough for them that lars was gay but to have an asian boyfriend was too much for them they always made comments about searching for a cure for larss yellow fever they were the most hateful people id ever met i brought some of larss ashes up here so i could say goodbye to him alone what was his financial situation for a university professor i guess he was paid okay did he have any enemies lars no not at all harvath watched his face very closely did you have access to his university computer network no he replied i mean yes well not anymore which is it i told you he was lying said the troll im not i just want to answer your questions so i can get a doctor so which is it asked harvath either you did or didnt have access to his university network when i was his teaching assistant i did what happened i did some things i shouldnt have done finally some truth snapped the troll what kind of things asked harvath i made a stupid mistake that got traced back a mistake on a hack lee nodded it cost me my job at the university lars made me promise never to do it again but you kept on hacking didnt you it was dishonest but in my mind i was promising not to make the same stupid mistake again not to stop hacking so you lied to jagland yes now please can i see a doctor i dont believe that your access to jaglands network was cut off it was he started changing his password and didnt even access the university system from home so no one had access to it but jagland and his ta the one he hired when i left the woman with the glasses asked harvath thats her dripping with talent but cold ice cold at that moment harvath realized that they had made a very big mistake rechecking michael lees wounds he said were going to get you to a doctor but first im going to need you to do something for me chapter monday adda sterk awoke from a strange dream in it she had purchased a very expensive new car but couldnt remember where she had parked it there was something about the car that wouldnt allow her to go to the police or friends for help as she continued to search her neighborhood she became more and more distraught when she opened her eyes the nightmare should have been over but it was just beginning the man standing over her bed was rough and very strong his face was covered by some sort of mask he placed a piece of tape over her mouth and bound her hands painfully behind her back she felt certain that he was going to rape her until he bound her feet and then placed a hood over her head she struggled but it made no difference to her situation as he lifted her from the bed he pulled off the top sheet and covered her with it she wanted to believe that this was an act of decency on his part an attempt to conceal her nakedness because of the goodness the humanity in his soul but she knew that wasnt why he was doing it he was doing it to conceal her altogether and with that realization she knew in her core that whatever was in store for her was going to be worse than rape adda sterk fought to purge her mind of the fear and to focus if she knew who was doing this to her perhaps she could negotiate her way out of it after all she had only been the messenger one didnt kill the messenger the man carrying her paused near the glass doors to her balcony and her heart seized in her chest he was going to drop her to the pavement the man then bent down and picked something up with his other hand they were close to her desk was it her laptop was that what this was about did he want information maybe she would be able to bargain with him after all in the hallway he moved quickly past the elevator and into the stairwell he was very strong indeed to be able to carry her down so many flights of stairs he was obviously being careful too he hadnt risked the elevator the chance he could have bumped into a neighbor even at this earlymorning hour would have been too great in addition to being strong he was intelligent or at least experienced if only she had been more attractive she might have also been able to use her body to entice the man to spare her life but she had been born with neither good looks nor an attractive physique the only thing god seemed to have blessed the teaching assistant with was an incredible mind that said how had this man found her as an average citizen she had no value as a kidnap victim he or the people he was working for somehow knew what she really did for a living and therefore understood her true value and for that to have happened somewhere along the line despite all of her safeguards to prevent this very thing she had made a mistake in the parking structure she was placed facedown inside a van with a sliding door the man bent her legs upward and secured the restraints around her ankles to those around her wrists the vehicles metal floor was cold and the thin sheet did little to insulate her body there was a faint lingering odor as well something she vaguely recognized as her lungs constricted and she began having trouble breathing she knew what it wasdog hair underneath the hood her eyes wide with terror sterks greatest fear rushed to the front of her mind she was going to suffocate to death after leaving the garage the van made so many turns she would have given up trying to follow its path had she been paying attention instead she was trapped within a horrific nightmare she felt a warm wet sensation grow beneath her stomach and realized that she had wet herself outside the vans thin metal sides she could hear the din of morning traffic she wanted to scream she wanted to yell for someone to save her but even without the hood and tape over her mouth she would have been unable she was in the midst of a fullblown asthma attack when the van pulled into the empty warehouse on the outskirts of the city sterk was only semiconscious the pungent scent of urine and sweat greeted harvath as he opened the vehicles door the fact that she wasnt moving told him something wasnt right hopping inside he pulled back the sheet and snatched off her hood he tried to hold her head up but it just lolled to the side and you told me i went too far with lee admonished nicholas from just outside the van harvath tore the tape from her mouth and checked her breathing and vital signs she was on the verge of death her purse is on the front seat said harvath get it nicholas climbed up into the van retrieved the purse and brought it back harvath unzipped the bag and dumped its contents on the floor he found her inhaler shook it opened her airway and injected the inhalant because he was administering it to her without her being able to actively breathe in the medication he repeated the process two more times before pulling her from the van cutting the restraint that bound her hands to her feet and laying her on the cement floor when her breathing began to normalize he picked her up and moved her to the center of the facility where he secured her to a column and waited for her to fully regain consciousness the first person she saw was michael lee he lay with his legs akimbo and his arms bound behind another support column his trousers were tattered and he was covered in blood to his left stood two enormous dogs their faces also covered in blood sterk knew who the beasts belonged to had she any question it was all but settled when the little man waddled into her field of vision and spoke you are much more intelligent than i ever gave you credit for said the troll as he came closer here i thought tsui was some little hacker operating out of his parents basement somewhere i was obviously very wrong i shouldnt have let my prejudice get the better of me sterk turned her eyes away why so shy my dear dont you want to see what you have accomplished granted as friends remind me i wasnt very pretty to begin with but im downright hideous now wouldnt you agree the woman who had built a burgeoning intelligence dynasty as tony tsui remained silent own it the troll screamed look at me and own what you have done sterk looked up at him and as she did a tear rolled down her left cheek oh thats good said nicholas thats very very good with a calm and perfectly placid expression he drew back his small arm and struck her across the side of the head with the wrench he had removed from the vans emergency toolkit harvath who was standing behind sterk looked at nicholas and drew a hash mark on the dusty support column she was tethered to my what a horrible gash said nicholas as he studied the wound he had inflicted upon her sterk had never had any of the bones in her face broken but she was fairly certain that her cheekbone had just been shattered you like to hit women youre pathetic the troll wound up and hit her again this time on the other side sterk cried out from the intensity of the pain harvath ticked off another hash mark on the column youve been a very very bad girl adda said nicholas as he hit her again harvath put yet another hash mark on the board and was fairly certain the little man was going to start popping stitches blood was rolling freely down both sides of her face i hope the woman i sent was a good lay because she was obviously a terrible assassin nicholas was about to hit sterk again but he stopped michael lee had been right about her about both her asthma and her pride he dropped the wrench and without a hint of irony smiled and said now we can speak freely if youre going to kill me she said get it over with nicholas got a considerably good laugh out of that kill you youre worth much more to me alive than dead sterk looked at him i have big plans for you first im going to cut out your tongue and seal your rather bland face inside an iron mask then im going to sell you to an unusually perverse saudi prince who will chain you outside his tent in the middle of the desert naked between the arabs and the camels youre going to be the belle of the bedouin ball and the award for s m fiction goes to the man with the worlds smallest penis said sterk nicholas lunged for his wrench and struck the woman again this time he tore open a wound along her forehead harvath tallied his fourth hash mark nicholas would be allowed only one more swipe at her before he stepped in the troll set the wrench down quietly this time do you know that man across from you the woman didnt reply of course you do thats michael lee nicholas continued hes the man you set up to take the fall as tony tsui if the heat ever got too close to you i dont know what you are talking about do i need to pick the wrench back up adda or perhaps you would like to meet my dogs nicholas snapped his fingers and the dogs began growling in fact im going to even go so far as to suggest that the untimely demise of lars jagland wasnt an accident but that he somehow stumbled on to what you were up to and you killed him to frighten the woman lee had been bound to the other column facing her and in order to make him look like a real hostage which in part he was and also to make sure he didnt say anything he shouldnt harvath had placed a piece of duct tape across his mouth the man now struggled against it his eyes bulged as he cursed her and yelled from behind the tape i agree with you i think lars was probably murdered but i didnt have anything to do with it i dont believe you said the troll i think he discovered what you were up to and you killed him didnt you no i didnt i have to hand it to you the tsui persona was exceptional you not only had me fooled but you covered your tracks quite well and the icing on the cake was positioning michael lee to take the fall if things ever got bad brava i didnt kill lars sterk insisted but youre not denying you set up michael are you sterk said nothing i have no reason to believe anything you say you tried to have me killed whats one more sterk remained silent you always have a fallback dont you said nicholas when the assassin you sent after me failed you implicated me in the bombings in rome what about paris are my fingerprints going to surface there too at that moment something in the womans face shifted nicholas motioned his dogs over you really have been a very very bad girl what are you going to do to me sterk demanded that depends on how you answer my questions chapter is there another assassin looking for me asked nicholas sterk didnt respond and nicholas bent down and picked up the wrench again no she responded none at all im sure you have plenty of enemies but when leveques woman in spain failed to return i assumed you had killed her and had gone deeper to ground so you moved to plan b implicating me the woman shook her head alive or dead you were always going to be implicated why why implicate me my employers wanted a diversion who hired you someone i fear much more than you nicholas tapped the head of the wrench in his tiny palm ill give you one more chance sterk shook her head nicholas brought back his tiny arm and swung the wrench met its target and blood began to pour from a tear behind the womans ear harvath tallied his fifth and final hash mark on the column and stepped out from behind her it was time for him to take over producing a roll of duct tape he tore off a piece and placed it across her mouth he then put the bag back over her head as nicholas said to sterk oh my things are about to get very bad for you indeed harvath cut the rope binding her wrists to the support column stripped the sheet from her naked body and carried her back to the van he had no idea what had triggered the asthma attack the first time he suspected it was stress though it could have been something else either way he was determined to recreate the circumstances as closely as possible to bring about another one he tied her back down in the vehicle exactly as he had before and closed the door from the front seat he grabbed two water bottles and then searched the warehouse until he found a suitable length of hose the good thing about gasoline was that it was so pungent harvath wouldnt need much for what he had planned he made a big deal of banging around the rear of the van he opened one of the water bottles and poured out some of the water he then carefully siphoned a small amount of gasoline out of the van and into the bottle with nicholas in tow he stepped back around to the other side and opened the sliding door he studied sterk her breathing was rapid as it should be for anyone in her situation she was frightened she wasnt yet though suffering from another attack you cant do this said the troll as harvath stepped into the van what if you dont just burn her but you end up killing her there was a long list of harsh interrogation techniques he could have tried on sterksleep deprivation stress postures sensory bombardment or even extreme coldbut he didnt have the time frankly after the beating the woman had taken from nicholas he was surprised she hadnt already broken she was a much tougher character than he had expected he had no idea if she had undergone training to resist hostile interrogation or if she was just one tough woman it didnt matter everyone broke eventually the key lay in discovering exactly how to break them and if time was of the essence as it was here how to do it as quickly as possible whether adda sterk was left physically or psychologically wounded by the ordeal was of no concern to harvath she held all the cards and could end the experience at any point she wanted the more one knew about ones subject the better equipped one was to carry out a successful interrogation considering the fact that up until several hours ago they had believed adda sterk was a young male hacker of asian descent by the name of tony tsui it was plain they didnt have much to go on but they did have one thing on the scale of harsh interrogation methods one of the stronger tactics that can be employed is the exploitation of a prisoners phobias the fact that sterk was asthmatic left no question in harvaths mind that she harbored a fear that most asthmatics shared asphyxia opening the bottle filled with the gaswater mixture he poured the contents over the womans hood panic quickly overtook her as she began writhing and struggling against her restraints he followed by pouring the second bottle of water over the rest of her body her nostrils were so filled with the scent of gasoline she would assume that she was now covered with it from head to toe the gas seeping into her hood had probably found its way into the open wounds around her face and head harvath didnt have to wait long whether there was some trigger like dog hair on the floor of the van or if it was the stress of believing she was about to be set ablaze sterk was soon consumed by another intense asthma attack lifting her from the van he carried her several feet away and set her on the warehouse floor he pulled the hood from her head and tore the tape from her mouth he pulled out her inhaler and showed it to her are you going to answer my questions gasping for air sterk nodded feverishly harvath shook the inhaler placed it in her mouth and administered the medication he waited until her breathing became less labored and then dragged her back to the support column now it was time to see if she would cooperate or not he studied her face as he asked his first question when i met you in jaglands office why did you give up michael lee the woman coughed repeatedly before answering because i didnt need him anymore but he was your cover it didnt matter that cover became useless when lars was killed youre not making any sense said harvath i knew that someday someone might come looking for me that was why i had created the whole tsui persona it was a layer of protection i set it up so that everything traced back to lars and from him to michael but when lars was killed my backstop was gone who killed him i dont know the police say he died in a car accident you dont believe that i can tell by looking at your face i dont know what to believe she said could what happened to lars have been an accident possibly but im not certain thats why i was waiting to see what happened to michael you mean you were waiting to see if he would be killed as well asked nicholas lee shouted at the woman again from behind the duct tape covering his mouth he pulled against his restraints and there was no doubt in anyones mind including sterks that if he managed to break free he would kill her thats why you gave him up to me replied harvath you wanted to see if i had been sent to finish off tony tsui obviously then what then when i thought it was safe i would have started over under a new persona the woman was absolutely mercenary but as far as harvath could tell she was telling the truth so who killed jagland he asked sterk looked down at the floor and refused to answer i want to make something perfectly clear said harvath right now the only person in this entire world you should fear is me if i even suspect youre holding out on me im going to light you on fire i will let you burn and then i will put the fire out before it kills you the pain will be worse than anything you have ever experienced the heat will sear your lungs and youre going to suffer from smoke inhalation its going to be severe ill repeat this process until youre dead or you give me what i want which will it be my lifes worth nothing if i survive theyll find me and theyll kill me just like they did lars and im certain itll be in a manner much worse than anything you can possibly devise who are they sterk didnt respond harvath turned to nicholas see if there are any matches in the van if there arent heat the cigarette lighter the troll nodded and headed for the van sterk looked at him both sides of her face were beginning to swell just kill me and get it over with you dont have to die im dead anyway we can protect you you dont even know what youd be protecting me against these people have resources beyond your imagination so do i he replied the woman laughed and shook her head what if we gave them tony tsui from the other support column lees eyes bulged how would you do that never mind said harvath what if we can give them tsui or at least make it look like tsui isnt someone for them to worry about anymore these are not stupid people they cant be easily fooled i wouldnt expect them to be nicholas returned with the vans cigarette lighter and held it out to harvath lets burn the witch harvath took it and looked at sterk its your call adda the woman studied the faces of her two captors and thought about her options after several moments she said ill cooperate but on one condition youre trying to negotiate youve got to be kidding me stammered the troll what do you want harvath demanded sterk focused her gaze on him and replied a little added insurance chapter chicago john vaughan sat in a plush leather captains chair inside the most comfortable surveillance vehicle he had ever seen and wondered what paul davidsons problem was josh levy the owner of surety private investigations ltd and davidsons boss when he was moonlighting as a pi couldnt have been more personable polite or professional if he had tried he was a handsome welldressed man in his late fifties and very experienced in private investigative work there was no question in vaughans mind that levy had easily spent over a hundred thousand dollars on his surveillance van it really was decked out like a limo inside and the electronic equipment rivaled anything the cpd or the fbi owned unless this guy had a dvd carousel loaded with animal porn vaughan couldnt find anything even remotely questionable about him it was beyond him why davidson so disliked doing surveillance with his boss is the temperature okay for you asked levy theres plenty of juice left in the batteries to run the air exchangers as the man bent down to flip a switch davidson looked at vaughan and rolled his eyes the airs real good josh thank you said vaughan ignoring davidson levy righted himself leaned over flipped open a minifridge and pulled out a cup of yogurt davidson tapped vaughan on the shoulder with the back of his hand anybody want one asked levy no thanks josh responded davidson were all good vaughan watched as levy peeled back the lid and licked the yogurt from the top when he was done he placed the lid on the narrow counter beneath the surveillance equipment and went to work folding it into eighths before dropping it into a ziplocked garbage bag hanging from the wall while he was fishing a spoon from a drawer near the fridge davidson tapped vaughan again and rolled his eyes the organized crime cop looked back at him and shrugged he had no idea what davidsons problem was levy took a bite of his yogurt and then picked up the copy of mohammed nasiris picture so this is our guy but we dont know if hes inside the mosque correct thats right said vaughan based on the calls weve made he hasnt gotten on any airplanes out of town but he could have hopped on a bus a train or borrowed a car and left thats correct levy took another bite of yogurt this time he licked both sides of the spoon afterward why do you think hes inside vaughan could feel davidsons glance begging him to notice how levy was licking the spoon and he tried to ignore it we saw a lot of this stuff in iraq they know we wont come into a mosque unless weve got a mountain of overwhelming evidence especially in the us its political suicide the mosque is a sanctuary for these guys wed never in a million years think of doing in a church or a synagogue what they do in their mosques nor would any priest or rabbi put up with it added davidson i cant imagine what my priest would say if i told him father were going to go shoot up a girls school plant a few roadside bombs and be back for lunch dont let anyone into the room downstairs where we keep all of the rifles and grenade launchers okay levy chuckled though they all appreciated the fact that the reality of it wasnt that funny i guess thats one of the many differences between islam and the rest of the world you can say that again vaughan looked at the monitor feed for one of the infrared cameras mounted in the vans sideview mirrors in iraq wed know guys we wanted were inside a particular mosque sometimes wed chase them right up the front steps but then we couldnt do anything wed have to wait until iraqi soldiers got on site iraqi muslim soldiers added davidson for clarification exactly we infidels couldnt go inside at least we couldnt lead the charge why the hell not asked levy as he took another bite of yogurt because nobody wanted it to look like we were waging a crusade against islam levy licked both sides of his spoon once more and said thats the dumbest thing i have ever heard vaughan nodded i agree so they think well treat their mosques here in the us the same way we do in iraq up to now thats exactly how weve treated them its not just hands off its hands way off levy shook his head political correctness is going to be the death of western civilization i hope youre wrong but theres no question that our enemies are using political correctness against us you can say that again replied davidson muslim honor killings are becoming an epidemic in the us but do you think it gets reported by the media no wife and child beatings are through the roof but the media ignore those as well point out whats wrong with muslim culture and youre automatically labeled a racist its like shunning the guy on the titanic who says he sees water in the forward bulkhead levy finished his yogurt and placed the empty cup in the bag and zipped the top shut again vaughan checked his watch the evening ishaa prayers will be over soon think nasiri will stick his head out asked davidson you never know terrorists make a lot of stupid mistakes not this guy said levy vaughan and davidson both looked at him how would you know asked davidson if hes up to what you think he is you have to assume he didnt get his job by being stupid and if he felt the heat was so intense that he had to flee to the mosque even a storefront mosque then you have to give him enough credit that he wont pop his head out until he thinks he can get away with it vaughan nodded in agreement which means continued levy that eventually were going to have to do more than just sit outside here watching the front door he was right and neither of the other two men in the surveillance van could argue with him what are you thinking asked vaughan levy tapped two black storm cases with the toe of his boot and said i think were going to have to get more aggressive with our surveillance chapter levy opened the cases and showed his guests what he had brought vaughan reached down and plucked out a wireless camera embedded within a hard black baseballsized shell whats this brilliant israeli military technology davidson looked at it then how come it says remington on the side because they licensed it for the us but couldnt get it off the ground i bought this sample kit from the rep how does it work asked vaughan you just drop these where you want them better than that you can actually throw them when they stop rolling they right themselves on those little stubby feet on the bottom you can toss them on a roof over a wall anywhere and those are fiberoptic cameras in the other box levy nodded if youve got balls big enough to get close to the door or drill down from the ceiling then well really get a good view inside what are the baby wipes for you should see how dirty this stuff gets he said as he pulled another one of the camera balls out of its case as he did davidson jabbed vaughan in the ribs and raised his eyebrows as if to say see vaughan waved him off all he saw was a guy who was particular about how he ate his yogurt and who liked to keep his gear clean big deal in fact hed take josh levy over most of the sloppy cops hed been forced to sit through stakeouts with if we can drop a couple of those in the alley behind the building will you be able to pick up the signal out here i should will they work okay in low light theyve got an ir illuminator but it puts an extra drain on the batteries we wont be able to run them all night hopefully we wont have to davidson used the cameras mounted outside the van to check for foot traffic along the street they were in a small honorsystem parking lot where you placed your money in a slot on a big board beneath the number that corresponded to what stall you were in levy had picked the lot himself preferring it to being parked out on the street the view wasnt as good but it was acceptable it was his opinion that a windowless van parked too near the mosque might draw undue attention to itself vaughan had agreed how do you want to do this asked davidson weve got your bronco parked around the corner replied vaughan from this distance i dont think anyone is going to notice us getting out of the van ill stay here and monitor the feeds while you take josh with you hell ride shotgun and can drop three balls one at the beginning of the alley one near the back door of the target building and one before you turn back out onto the street levy shook his head i dont leave the van why not i just dont vaughan looked at davidson for some sort of explanation but the public vehicles officer just looked back at him and smiled as if to say i told you so he turned back to levy how are we going to know if we got the balls placed correctly the pi pulled a radio from a charger rack and handed it to vaughan its not rocket science you roll down the window and drop them out ill radio you and let you know how the picture looks what if i screw it up and one of them rolls underneath a dumpster dont screw it up satisfied that the argument was settled levy unzipped the gym bag hanging from the arm of his chair and removed a small hand towel unrolling it across his lap he fished his key ring from his pocket thats good enough for me said davidson taking the radio from vaughan suddenly anxious to leave lets get going hanging from levys key ring was a gold nail clipper the pi pivoted open the handle and studied his nails the streets as quiet as its going to get said davidson as vaughan watched levy lets get this done before evening prayers are over with he poked the organized crime cop with the radios antenna breaking the spell and getting his attention make sure to do a radio check when you get to your truck stated levy as the two men parted the heavy blackout curtain and exited the van through its back door cutting through the alley behind the parking lot vaughan said ive never known anybody who carries a nail clipper on their key ring is it solid gold probably said davidson with a shudder i cant watch him clip his nails it creeps me out if thats the worst of his behavior then youve got it pretty good thats the thing it isnt just one quirky thing with him its a million and they all add up and thats why you dont like doing surveillance with him damn straight replied davidson the guys an investigative genius but theres something just not right about him its like if magnum pi and rain man had a baby you saw how he wouldnt leave the van so so judge wapner probably comes on in ten minutes vaughan shook his head the guys a little eccentric so what you need to lighten up davidson smiled give it another hour youll want to beat the guy to death with the heel of your shoe he doubted it and they walked in silence the rest of the way to the bronco and climbed in while davidson did a radio check vaughan received an email from one of the forensics specialists going over nasiris taxi the piece of plastic that had been recovered at the scene of the hitandrun was indeed from a radiator header and the radiator header in nasiris cab was new everything they were telling him jibed with what the pakistani mechanic from the crescent garage had told them the bad news was that there was no blood hair or tissue anywhere on the outside of the vehicle worse still was what the tech told him next skirting the poisonous tree issue had not been easy the only thing vaughan could do was to ask his forensic pal to search the interior of the cab as well as the trunk for traces of any chemicals he said he was looking for any sign that nasiri had washed down his cab with solvents in an attempt to hide evidence of the hitandrun his real hope was that they would come back with hits for tatp or the precursors for the compound the bad news from forensics was that the cab contained no traces of chemicals whatsoever vaughan shared the bad news with davidson as they pulled away from the curb and headed toward the alley im not surprised replied davidson if that stuff is as volatile as you say it is theyre not going to want to move it until they absolutely have to if nasiri was transporting anything it was bottles of peroxide and cans of drain cleaner all nice and sealed vaughan didnt like it but he had to agree so weve still got nothing what do you mean nothing youve got josh levys balls in the palm of your hand he held up one of the cameras and looked at it now josh may think his balls are made of brass said davidson but i still think you should drop them out the window delicately nobody likes to have their balls busted are you done asked vaughan as he rolled down his window since you asked you have to admit that even though he wanted to stay in the van josh really does have big balls is that all of them all of my ball jokes yeah for the moment good said vaughan id like to concentrate on whats happening at the mosque like captain hook vaughan nodded as they rolled up to the stop sign half a block from the alley davidson snapped the clip on the metal clipboard wedged between his seat and armrest you know what that is no what is it the sound of no hands clapping vaughan shook his head can we please concentrate on what were about to do so youre asking me to give you a hand with this part you know levy probably isnt the one im going to beat to death with my shoe tonight all right i get it said davidson you lawyers have no sense of humor how fast do you want me to drive down the alley fast enough to look like you know what youre doing and are just cutting through davidson put his left hand over his eyes and waved his right index finger over the speedometer before landing on a speed okay got it anything else yeah youd better put your thinking cap on if this surveillance doesnt pan out were going to need a really good plan b chapter vaughan lowered the radio and looked at davidson they had just driven out of the alley after dropping all three covert surveillance balls is the placement of the second camera not right because its not right or because levys not right despite what i told you he knows what hes doing he wouldnt ask you to tweak it if he didnt have a good reason levys voice came over the radio again did you guys copy that tenfour said vaughan we heard you loud and clear you didnt pitch it under a dumpster but you did manage to get it wedged behind a garbage can added levy i wouldnt be expecting a call from the white sox this year davidson looked at him is he pissing you off yet hes getting there so what are we going to do vaughan really wanted a view of the back door of that building ill fix it he climbed out of the bronco and made his way into the alley it was cluttered with empty boxes splintered pallets dumpsters and garbage cans though he didnt have a terrific view he did have lots of good concealment and he carefully picked his way forward just before the building that held the mosque he stopped and took a slow look around if he was going to move the camera he might as well put it in the best spot possible now that he was here he wished hed brought along a couple of the fiberoptic cameras as well having come this far it would have made sense to go the rest of the way and get the best look at what was going on inside as they could the back of the building was covered in gray brick the basement windows had been painted black and were covered with iron bars the firstfloor windows were covered with newspaper and also covered with bars a broken lightbulb hung over the back door the ground was littered with cigarette butts despite a coffee can filled with sand which the buildings smokers must have figured was a doorstop vaughan identified a spot for his camera and stacked a few empty boxes around it so it would run less of a chance of being noticed with a new hiding place ready he went looking for the hard black sphere there was a row of about five trashcans the ball was fairly heavy for its size and when he dropped it out the window he hadnt expected it to roll very far they must have been driving down the alley at a higher rate of speed than he had thought pulling a flashlight from his pocket he leaned over tilted back the first can and looked there was nothing there he slid out the second can and came up empty as well it was the same story with the remaining three cans where the hell had that thing gone to vaughan studied the alley there were buildings cans dumpsters and trash on both sides the camera could have rolled to the other side but he doubted it he had dropped it on the east side of the alley that was where it had to be he came back down the row of cans tilting each one out and this time he saw it even if his life had depended on it he couldnt have made such a oneinamillion shot sitting wedged inside a laundry vent or a drain opening of some sort was his missing surveillance camera he pulled back the can and bent over near the wall to free the ball he was just beginning to stand when he heard something behind him vaughan had no idea who it was and had learned a long time ago that discretion wasnt always the better part of valor he was in a dark alley in a bad neighborhood on the trail of even worse people he went for his glock the move was met with a searing pain in his right hand as he was struck with a piece of rebar and his wrist was broken vaughan spun and came up with his left hand in a fist he connected with his attackers jaw and sent him stumbling backward at that moment the barrel of a gun was shoved into his face and a flashlight was shined in his eyes though it hurt like hell on his right side vaughan raised his hands i dont know who you are but im a police officer the light was taken out of his eyes and for a moment he thought he was going to be let go until he felt his glock being removed from his holster and saw the man he had punched out gather himself off the pavement and come forward the man was middle eastern this wasnt good walking over to him the man drew his fist back and struck him right in the gut vaughan doubled over the man grabbed him by the hair and jerked his head up vaughan had been in plenty of fistfights in his time and he readied himself either for a knee to the face or for the man to punch down at his head either way he knew it was going to hurt suddenly he heard a voice from behind his attackers this isnt even a fair fight you assholes didnt bring enough guys vaughan looked past the man with the gun to see davidson right behind him with his own gun pressed up against the back of the mans head the man holding him by his hair let go and vaughan straightened himself up his relief at seeing davidson was shortlived four other men were now standing behind him with weapons pointed right at him well it looks like maybe you did bring enough guys said davidson why dont we put our guns down and settle this like men one of the men stepped forward and struck him in the kidneys with the butt of a rifle davidsons knees buckled from the pain and he collapsed to the ground as his gun was taken away from him davidson looked up and said thats it youre all under arrest the man who had broken vaughans wrist smiled and punched davidson in the mouth someone gave a series of orders in rapid arabic and the two police officers were dragged from the alley and into the building as the heavy metal door clanged shut vaughan wondered what was going to happen but part of him already knew all of the bad feelings hed had since going after nasiri came flooding back this was no longer chicago and he was no longer a cop or a lawyer working for the family of a young woman whod been struck by a fleeing taxi he was a marine and he was being dragged into a terrorist hellhole worse than anything he had ever seen chapter geneva the speed with which reed carlton worked was a testament to the efficiency of the private sector within hours he had not only helped plug the holes in harvaths plan he had gotten the train on the tracks and out of the station it was agreed that michael lee had seen and heard too much to be let go for the time being he was going to have to be held on to and while peio was a decent field medic he wasnt a trauma doc lee was stable but he needed a professional to look at his wounds there was an american surgeon based in paris who was being flown in she had some sort of relationship with the department of defense but other than that carlton didnt elaborate all he added was that she was equipped to keep an eye on lee until they decided what to do with him harvath had trouble imagining what a surgeon could do short of keeping lee drugged up but he figured carlton knew best and let it go there were several more pressing items that needed to be worked out anyway as the attempted murder of the troll had been orchestrated from within switzerland the united states didnt have any jurisdiction they also didnt have any jurisdiction over the alleged murder of lars jagland not that anyone in the united states cared very much about either all they cared about were the rome and paris attacks that and sterks material support of terrorism and how it had resulted in the deaths of hundreds of american citizens harvath was a big believer in the merits of enhanced interrogation he also had no problem with torture when the situation called for it which this one definitely did there were very likely more attacks on the horizon and sterk possessed information that could help stop them the key lay in applying as much pressure as was necessary to get her to play ball once she began cooperating the pressure could be dialed back but the threat of it ramping back up needed to hover over everything they did in order to ensure her continued collaboration if theyd had more time to interrogate her carlton and the higherups at the dod might not have been so willing to cut a deal but as it was everyone including harvath agreed that preventing further attacks was more important than prosecuting her painting sterk as a covert intelligence source for another agency an immunity agreement was drafted so long as she cooperated sterk would not be prosecuted with that demand met they set to work on closing out tony tsui sterk had been dead set against having it happen in the united states too suspicious she had argued believing that it would raise too many questions and sow too many seeds of doubt the woman preferred that it take place in an asian or latin american country that made things difficult for the old man it had to be done correctly and with people he knew he could trust the best was if it could be done through someone who owed him a favor there were several of those scattered around the globe but not all of them could lay their hands on a fresh john doe asian corpse the woman finally agreed to the closeout taking place outside frankfurt germany the gun battle between tony tsui and an elite gsg team began shortly before eleven oclock local time and raged for over fortyfive minutes when the unit finally stormed the small house news vehicles from every media outlet in frankfurt were already stacked three deep behind the police cordons none of them had any clue that the man returning fire from inside the house was not tony tsui but was one of the gsg counterterrorism operatives from the german federal police force as dead bodies do not bleed the operative inside the house had pumped plenty of fresh blood through the corpse as he simultaneously pumped it full of rounds from his mp a forensics team was brought in and a big show was made of a single laptop being removed from the house it was placed into an official police vehicle along with the gsg team and driven away in one of the longest and most secure convoys any of the media had ever seen one reporter remarked that not even foreign heads of state traveled with that much security not even the american president the first piece of disinformation was leaked to the popular german weekly der spiegel and appeared on their web site within the hour german counterterrorism forces had decided to move on a known espionage figure who dealt in the sale and trade of highly classified state secrets this figure was reported to have had wideranging ties including several highlevel terrorist contacts the suspect had been shot and killed by german counterterrorism forces the next leak went to the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung which reported that the house located in a largely rural area contained a significant stash of weapons and cash it went on to say that while the victims identity had yet to be established it was believed to be an asian male in his late twenties or early thirties by the time hessischer rundfunk television updated its viewers the narrative was almost perfectly formed along with the weapons and money found at the house of the suspected black market information broker were several passports which the suspect had attempted to destroy the name of the suspect and any names at all gleaned from the passports were being withheld by german authorities pending investigation while the names were being withheld from the german citizenry and its press they were already being circulated through international intelligence channels mixed in among them was the name tony tsui finally der spiegel did a followup piece identifying the laptop removed from the scene as being suspected of containing sensitive german military secrets because the laptop was protected by an extremely sophisticated encryption system it was very likely the government would seek outside specialists to help crack it other international media outlets were already picking up on the story and running with it tony tsui was as good as dead that was the easy part reed carlton was a master spy who had spent a lifetime in the espionage and counterterrorism arenas building a network of friends contacts and people who owed him favors but there wasnt anything he could do to satisfy adda sterks second and final request before she would cooperate looking at nicholas she said i want his dogs before harvath could even respond nicholas had told the woman to go perform an impossible sex act upon herself and had lunged once more for the wrench why do you need the dogs harvath had demanded collateral as long as i have them somewhere where he cant get to them i know he wont allow anything to happen to me at this point cautioned harvath youve got a lot more to worry about from me than you do from him the woman looked at him if i have the dogs its in his best interest to make sure im safe from everyone including you when im someplace safe ill make sure the dogs are returned take it or leave it it was a discussion harvath hadnt wanted to have in front of sterk so he had called peio in to keep an eye on her while he walked nicholas outside to talk to him it wasnt surprising that a dwarf would hit below the belt and nicholas took the low road right from the minute they exited the warehouse he said that because harvath didnt have children he would never understand what is was that sterk was asking nicholas not only ranted at him he threatened to have harvath killed if he caved to her demands as far as he was concerned they were going to have to go back inside and start torturing her again because there was no way he was going to hand over his dogs to her they would not be used as an insurance policy end of discussion the mans love for his dogs was one of the things harvath had long respected about him he could have berated him for beating sterk so badly with the wrench he could have blamed him and told him thats what he got for taking out his anger on her in such a way but he didnt he had done the same and worse in his life sterk had tried to have nicholas killed and harvath would have expected anyone in that situation to want revenge were not going to give her your dogs he said then what are we out here discussing as harvath explained his plan a smile crept across the little mans face when they stepped back inside harvath watched as nicholas said a convincing goodbye to his dogs and then turned to face sterk if anything happens to my animals he said i will make sure you die a death even you couldnt imagine am i clear sterk grinned and nicholas raised his hand to strike her but harvath stopped him enough the doctor arrived an hour later she rang harvaths cell phone to tell him she was there he stepped outside the warehouse to find a very fit very attractive woman in her early thirties she was leaning against a van identical to the one that was parked inside her reddishbrown hair was pulled back in a ponytail she had blue eyes full lips and a wide mouth im scot he said offering her his hand when she took it he felt a bolt of lightning pass between them riley she replied breaking off the handshake when she realized it had gone on a few seconds too long im sorry it took me so long that was quite a todo list i was handed howd it go you can see for yourself she replied stepping away from the door harvath slid it open and looked inside there were two large crates with two large white dogs inside stacked next to them were boxes filled with adda sterks personal belongings from her home and office as well as two laptops three desktop computers and stacks of portable drives thats what i call a house call you work fast im impressed thats why they pay me the big bucks he stepped back and closed the door the old man said you do security too thats also why they pay me the big bucks harvath was definitely intrigued but he didnt have time to ask the questions that were going through his mind well bring your patients out shortly ill be standing by harvath fought the urge to look back over his shoulder at her as he walked back into the warehouse though he couldnt be completely sure he was fairly confident that she was watching him back inside the warehouse he made a beeline for adda sterk im thirsty she said too bad ill give you one more chance to leave the dogs out of this no no dogs no deal fine he said as nicholas handed him his laptop based on sterks instructions they logged on to a swiss discussion forum under her account harvath looked up the user name she had given him and typed a quick message five minutes later he received a response when the instructions were complete nicholas loaded the dogs into the back of his van and watched as peio drove them out of the building he returned twenty minutes later harvath had him help riley load michael lee into her van and then he stood guard outside when harvath checked the forum there was a message waiting the handoff had taken place and the dogs were being taken to the country he had no idea who the person in the discussion forum was it could have been sterks boyfriend a student who owed her a favor or a neighbor he didnt care all he wanted was the information he needed to stop any more bombings and nail the people responsible though the handoff had moved faster than he had anticipated they had wasted a lot of valuable time he showed sterk the confirmation message and said ive done everything you asked now its time to live up to your end i want to know who is behind the bombings and how i stop them im still thirsty she replied as far as anyone is concerned tsuis dead youve also got the dogs im not giving you anything else until you begin cooperating with me fine although without water im probably going to have some trouble speaking harvath was done getting jerked around turning to nicholas he said go heat the cigarette lighter back up as the troll walked toward the van sterk looked up at harvath that wont be necessary ill give you what you want chapter i never met the people who hired me sterk said as the troll returned with the cigarette lighter but you know who they are replied harvath thats just it i dont know all of our transactions were via digital dead drops and wire transfers so why are you so afraid of them because i have seen what they can do what the rome attacks the paris attacks sterk shook her head the hell with this interjected the troll i want to know why you were trying to have me killed harvath motioned for him to be quiet this bitch tried to murder me im not going to be quiet i want answers we all want answers he said firmly as he turned his attention back to her its all connected she replied why was i targeted nicholas demanded sterk looked at him there was a certain piece of business we did together the people who hired me wanted any and all traces of it to be wiped away and that meant wiping me away as well yes i imagine that it also helped to provide the authorities with a false trail to follow sterk nodded thats why i had the dogs and the dwarf flown to sicily so you knew about the bombings in advance said harvath it took her a moment to respond finally she said yes i did he shook his head how do you charge for something like that is it a flat fee or is it on a sliding scale based on how many are killed versus maimed and wounded it was a rhetorical question she didnt bother answering this is about the last piece of business we did together isnt it said nicholas i sold you the location of site the woman nodded i was hired to help steal what they were working on i was actually surprised when you contacted me about buying the coordinates the level of secrecy surrounding it was amazing i was only able to get its location and even that took some doing what is it asked harvath the more appropriate question would be what was it stated sterk two weeks ago site was destroyed by whom by my clients they were able to launch an attack inside china on a chinese military base and not only kill everyone on the base but they then tracked down the remaining chinese intelligence officers who had any knowledge of what was being worked on at site and they killed them as well this was a chinese operation the woman nodded you wanted to know why i fear my clients thats why who mounts an attack on a chinese military base slaughters everyone on it and then hunts down highranking chinese intelligence agents inside and outside of china who has the skills and the resources to do something like that i still dont understand what this has to do with the attacks in rome and paris sterk took a deep breath the chinese know that they cant defeat america on a conventional battlefield theyve known that for a long time to win a war against america the chinese would have to engage in unconventional warfare they created a military base in the middle of nowhere in mongolia with the sole purpose of studying america its operatives spoke only english ate only american foods read american books watched american television programs played american video games and surfed nothing but american and western web sites it was as close as you could be to the united states while still remaining under chinas umbrella they were steeped in american culture and the american way of thinking their job was to study america find its weaknesses and develop the most devastating attack they could conceive of they were encouraged to think outside of the normal military mindset and suicide bombers were the best they could come up with asked harvath look at the impact of replied sterk look at what it did to americas psyche and its economy how many billions were lost how many billions more were spent preventing another similar attack massive governmental agencies like your department of homeland security and the tsa were created as a response now multiply that impact across the united states in all new waves of attacks pick whatever targets you want movie theaters shopping malls churches hotels schools your country would grind to a halt its people paralyzed with fear but the attacks arent happening in america they are happening in europe not yet what do you mean not yet replied harvath through site the chinese had created an entire terrorist network my clients have not only hijacked it they have activated it and they are planning on targeting american cities yes how do you know so much its my job i deal in information information is power and she probably spies on and steals from her own clients added nicholas the bigger the picture i have she replied the better i am able to connect the dots when i know what pieces im missing i go after them and secure them my customers dont come to me to purchase incomplete intelligence so in other words you snuck a peek at what your clients were paying you for i didnt get to see all of it but you got to see some of it sterk nodded harvath was trying to make sense of it all why would they bother targeting americans in europe why not move right to attacks on american soil i dont profess to understand the mind of the chinese sterk said with a shrug try she thought about it for a moment the easiest answer is that muslim attacks in western europe erode support for the wars in iraq and afghanistan the less support america has from its allies the deeper it will get drawn into those conflicts its military is stretched too thin stretch it even further maybe open up another war somewhere and all that stretching could lead to a snap it was a good point and one that harvath and others had grown increasingly concerned about with the madrid train bombings islamic terrorists had proven that they could influence western elections and help catapult politicians to power who would withdraw support for american military actions why wouldnt the chinese have picked up and expanded upon this as well it was an exceptional tactic aside from a few people who could see what was going on the europeans were a lost cause rather than fight the islamists in their midst they chose to commit cultural suicide they starved their lawabiding citizens with high taxes in order to gorge an invading army on massive social programs europes steadfast devotion to the failed religion of multiculturalism and political correctness not only emboldened its enemies but encouraged more attacks and was hastening its downfall the other thing that troubled harvath was the knowledge that with each attack in europe the united states would be focusing more and more of its limited resources abroad that invariably meant less attention to what was going on at home sooner or later america wouldnt have enough eyes on the ball in its own backyard and thats when its enemies would strike what us cities have been targeted i dont know bullshit spat the troll im telling you the truth sterk insisted theyre playing the american attacks close to the vest how about when asked harvath after the bombings in europe have all been carried out how many are left sterk was silent harvath grabbed her throat and clamped down how many two she finally coughed please i cant breathe where please i cant harvath squeezed harder where london and amsterdam where in london and amsterdam piccadilly and the dam square when tomorrow night now please my throat harvath dug his fingers in how do we stop them you cant theyre fully operational the cells have gone dark the brits need to shut down piccadilly and the dutch need to shut down dam square said the troll sterk could no longer speak she shook her head harvath relaxed his grasp it wont work the woman said as she gasped for air why not both cells have alternate targets no one but them knows what they are if you shut down piccadilly and the dam square theyll just move to the second location on their list there was more that harvath wanted to know but carlton needed this information right away he stepped to the other side of the warehouse and pulled out his phone chapter chicago vaughan and davidson both had their hands tied behind their backs and their ankles bound to the legs of the chairs they were sitting on they were in a dank room somewhere in the basement their pockets had been turned inside out and all of their belongings were now laid out on a table one of the men from the alley did all of the talking you are police he said youre damn right we are stated davidson and youre in a lot of fucking trouble my friend the man walked over to davidson and punched him so hard in the face his chair rocked onto its rear legs and almost fell over he then looked at vaughan tell me what you are doing here the pain of having his wrist broken was nothing compared to his conviction that these men were up to something very bad and had nothing to lose he felt certain they wouldnt think twice about killing them you have taken two chicago police officers hostage he said this entire building is going to be crawling with police very soon the man drew back his fist and hit vaughan even harder than he had hit davidson the marine was knocked so far backward that his chair fell over and even having his arms tied behind his back couldnt stop his head from cracking against the cement floor immediately two of the other men stepped forward picked his chair back up and returned to where they had been standing the man bent down and looked into vaughans eyes he was so close the marine could smell his foul breath back in my country i spent ten years as an interrogator in one of the worst prisons you could ever imagine my colleagues and i laughed at your abu ghraib scandal i know what real torture is and i will show you unless you answer my questions were the chicago police asshole were not answering shit stated davidson the man turned his attention to the public vehicles officer and smiled he then gave a command to one of the other men who opened the door and exited the room vaughans arabic was not the best it sounded like he had sent the man for water the interrogator then focused on vaughan i will ask you again what are you doing here davidson his face swelling said we were looking for your sister the man was about to strike the cop again but caught himself when vaughan admonished davidson cut it out thats not going to help it wont you are right said the interrogator what will help you is if you tell me why you are here we have your mosque under surveillance replied the marine his jaw his head and his wrist were all throbbing who is we the chicago police department the man lined up his captives credentials and studied them and while you are on police business you carry other business cards and badges as well davidson didnt know when to shut up tell him to fuck off listen vaughan continued blood running from his mouth you may think you know how this works but you dont the police will not negotiate for our release i dont expect them to what do you want then i already told you that your mosque is under surveillance but you havent told me who is monitoring it i have the chicago police department the interrogator smiled youre lying vaughan knew that if he told the man the truth if he told him nobody else except for josh levy even knew they were here they were as good as dead their only hope was that levy would realize something had gone wrong and that he would bring reinforcements vaughan was trying to come up with a response when the door opened and the man who had left a few moments ago returned he was carrying a case of large water bottles with two towels laid across the top ill pass on the sponge bath shot davidson but theres a couple of you who should definitely consider it maybe some back waxes too the interrogator picked his foot up and kicked davidson over backward the sound of his head cracking against the floor could be heard across the room calling two of the men over the interrogator had them tilt vaughan back another man grabbed a towel and though the police officer resisted managed to wrap it around his face and pull it tight at the back of his head the interrogator opened half of the bottles and sent the man to go get more picking up two of them he walked over and stood looking down at the marine we have much more water and i have all night lets see if we can decide once and for all whether or not this is torture chapter rashid had seen enough he opened the door and stepped back out into the hallway marwan jarrah was waiting for him and could read the younger mans face he signaled for him to hold his tongue until they got upstairs the two men proceeded in silence to the mosques office the faithful having long dispersed since the end of evening prayers once they were inside and the door was closed rashid wasted no time getting to the point were in big trouble everything will be fine shahab replied jarrah no it wont do you have any idea how serious this is you have two chicago policemen as prisoners in your mosque a police officer does not carry a private investigators badge when he is on duty as a policeman nor does another carry business cards identifying him as an attorney and a little notebook with the information about his case it doesnt matter what they were carrying marwan theyre still cops i understand the situation said jarrah i also understand that they were carrying a picture of mohammed nasiri and that it wasnt my idea to bring nasiri here it was yours we had no choice we should have killed him please marwan weve been through this we need nasiri so what do we do now you mean now that your thugs have tortured those two cops its not the time for recriminations replied jarrah i told you that those guns were supposed to stay in the mosque until we were ready to use them shahab what is done is done we need to plan you want to make a plan said rashid heres my plan we pack everything up send everyone home and put this entire operation in a box and bury it for at least two years maybe longer the man shook his head we cant do that you dont have a choice there are always choices marwan your thugs tortured two cops do you understand that maybe we could have made up a mistakenidentity story about how we thought they were breaking into the mosque when we found them but not now then we need to kill them rashid shook his head we could but that might not be the right move not yet jarrah looked at him then what would you like to do the younger man thought about it for a moment and then said obviously the mosque is no longer safe well need to move everything and we need to do it right away move it where you know where jarrah now shook his head no absolutely not it is too dangerous you wanted choices you can stay here compromised or you can move the operation just know that if you decide to stay youll be staying without me you would leave if you force me to yes for the sake of argument jarrah replied lets say we move what will we do with the policemen well move them too why do you want to take that risk it seems easier to just be done with them i know it seems that way said rashid but they could end up being worth more to us alive than dead no theyre a complication we need to be rid of them marwan you agreed to let me run this cell and this part of the operation ive done everything youve asked do you not trust my judgment of course i trust your judgment you are like a son to me how many times have i risked my life for you more than once shahab more than once so after a short period of reflection the man finally relented okay well move im not happy about it but i agree with you we cannot stay here rashid remained quiet and we will bring the police officers he added its the right choice jarrah shrugged rashid removed his cell phone as he opened the office door well need to start as soon as possible and do it in two trucks they continued discussing their plans as they walked downstairs to the basement the men who had captured the police officers were standing in the narrow hallway talking one of them was smoking seeing the men standing there rashids anger resurfaced in rapidfire arabic he berated them for their mistakes there was no excuse for it he was lecturing them on how stupid they had been to carry their weapons outside the mosque when the door to the alley burst open the men were caught completely off guard a bright flashlight clamped to the barrel of the intruders weapon blinded the men as they pulled out their guns and attempted to shoot drop your weapons the intruder yelled none of the men complied as the first pistol was pointed in his direction levy pulled the trigger of his remington shotgun and hit the two men closest to him racking the slide he prepared to fire again but before he could pull the trigger two shots rang out and he was knocked backward into the alley smoke was still rising from the barrel of his pistol as abdul rashid pushed past the men and rushed to the door he kicked the intruders shotgun away pointing his weapon at the mans head he said dont even think of moving with pain spreading through his body and blood soaking through his clothes josh levy did exactly as he was told chapter london harvath flew out on the private jet carlton had arranged for him leaving things back in geneva in the best state he could nicholas remained in the warehouse while peio helped harvath transport adda sterk to the carlton group safe house riley was already there tending to michael lee and she secured the woman in one of the bedrooms the priest agreed to stay until the interrogation team carlton had en route arrived he had no desire to watch them wring whatever else could be wrung from the woman harvath still wanted to have a discussion with the priest about what had happened at the chalet but the opportunity never really presented itself it was none of his business and he figured he should probably drop it and leave the man to his own conscience he had fed everything he was able to download from sterk including her medical condition back to carlton in virginia outside of the dates and locations she seemed to know very little about the attacks themselves she believed the cells were composed of muslim males but was uncertain of their ethnicity they would be using homemade bombs packed with marbles ball bearings nails or screws to act as shrapnel to maximize their killing power sterk also couldnt tell him if the men would be wearing suicide vests if the bombs would be carried in backpacks or if they would be packed in a car she didnt know how many bombs there would be or how they were designed to go off she couldnt say if the men would be hiding their explosives and leaving as had been done in rome or blowing themselves up as had been done in paris she also had no idea if there was one bomb intended for piccadilly and one for amsterdams dam square multiple bombs at both or one bomb at the former and multiple bombs at the latter as much as he wanted to harvath couldnt be two places at once with such sketchy information the choice of which city to try to head off an attack in was a tossup it all came down to the numbers he would go where the most american lives were at risk and it was the old man who made the calllondon carlton had excellent contacts in great britain experienced people he could trust he also had something elsea delta unit training with the british sas at a classified site in wales with one call from the old man to the dod the unit was packing its bags and heading for london when harvath arrived he was met by one of the deans of mi robert ashford he was a barrelchested man of medium height with steelgray hair and a broad flat nose he looked very capable of handling trouble and also looked like he had probably dealt plenty of it out over the course of his career ashford introduced himself and handed over his card bob ashford welcome to england looking at harvaths bag he added i understand theres nothing special you need to declare correct as the capability kit at the safe house in geneva wouldnt cover riley and the interrogation team the old man had instructed harvath to leave his gear behind correct harvath said tapping his bag i only brought my toothbrush and a change of underwear i was told you know all the best places to shop ashford smiled removed his credentials and navigated harvath through the passport control and customs checkpoints parked in a fire lane just outside was a black bmw the mi man directed harvath to the passenger seat and then walked around and got behind the wheel seatbelts please he said as he shut the door and started the vehicle peaches would never forgive me if something happened to you peaches repeated harvath a little joke amongst his friends i assume you refer to him as mr carlton or some such back in the states either that or boss sometimes known simply as the old man ashford chuckled softly applied his turn signal and pulled away from the curb we werent always old you know we were once quite young younger than you even harvath didnt need a reminder of his age he still had a swollen testicle and a couple of bruises that five years ago would have been gone by now reeds a good man and an even better operative ashford added is that where the nickname peaches comes from or should i ask mrs carlton about it the mi agent smiled suffice it to say the nickname was meant as an antithesis your boss was anything but sweet no matter how unsavory a tactic the enemy employed he could always oneup them he never hesitated doing what needed to be done and you should have seen him interrogate my goodness within minutes even i was ready to tell him everything i knew and i was on his side in a word he could be bloody ruthless ergo the name peaches exactly replied ashford as he changed lanes cutting off a cab driver who honked in protest he has always been a gentleman though exceedingly polite your boss he speaks very highly of you too said harvath he damn well should without me he never would have been allowed back into the uk again harvath had heard rumors around the carlton group offices about the old mans past he didnt really strike prince charles did he he didnt strike him he knocked him out bloody cold mate thats where that whole polo accident story came from all because charles had said something about diana reed was very fond of the princess he had gotten to know the royal family quite well while working over here they always insisted he be involved with their security when they came to the us whether that rankled the secret service or not i dont know but reed always made sure the royal family had the very best agents some even said their security plans rivaled the presidents he got called in for help after dianas death right he was part of the secret team looking into whether the car crash was an accident or a homicide ashford nodded when reed arrived charles had been drinking a lot thats when the prince made a crude remark about diana and reed punched him out i stuck up for peaches of course which means you pulled your gun when charless security detail rushed him there are many conflicting stories as to what happened that night said ashford as he switched lanes and cut off another vehicle lets put it this way i understand why all my peers have been knighted and i havent but in the end as long as im still recognized in the pub when i go back to yorkshire thats all that matters to me harvath smiled bullshit i havent met a brit yet who doesnt dream of being knighted the mi man smiled back and changed the subject reeds phone call has caused quite a bit of a stir i can imagine said harvath obviously we want to extend to you every professional courtesy but we are taking the lead on this based upon the intelligence we gathered for you and which specifically states that americans are the target ashford downshifted and switched lanes the targets may be american but the attack is planned for britain and british lives as well as other nationalities are also at risk besides if the shoe was on the other foot would you be giving us control over times square the man had a point no we wouldnt of course you wouldnt nobody wants an attack to take place in their own country as long as we work together we already are against our better judgment we are not raising the terroralert level and we are not going to close down piccadilly circus you and your team will be able to work the area but our teams will be there too harvath was about to reply when he added and before you say anything i want you to know that you have nothing to worry about you wont see my people yes i will ashford laughed okay maybe you will see them but i guarantee you the bad guys wont harvath loved the brits they were some of the most squaredaway operators he had ever met but he wasnt comforted by ashfords assurance and theres one final item which is not open for negotiation the man added any suspects taken into custody here shall belong to us and will be interrogated by us its the only way i could get this signed off is that clear crystal harvath replied interrogations make me squeamish anyway ashford looked at him somehow i doubt that for the balance of the drive the men made small talk and discussed politics ashford soon brought his bmw to a stop in front of an immaculate georgian town house in belgravia just southwest of buckingham palace theres a package for you in the boot he said activating the trunkrelease as harvath climbed out harvath walked to the rear of the bmw and inside was a large hardsided suitcase lifting it out he walked back around to the front of the vehicle ashford rolled down his window peaches has pinned a lot of his hopes on you he says you have good judgment and that we can trust you you can replied harvath good because weve put a lot at risk there are many people weve kept out of the loop for security reasons when this goes down theyre not going to be happy that they werent included theyll get over it provided everything goes to plan but if a bomb or bombs are detonated tomorrow and there are casualties there will be hell to pay harvath had no trouble grasping who ashford and the brits intended to stick with the bill if something went wrong we want to take as many of them alive as possible lets hope we get them all said ashford putting his car in gear he looked at his watch well meet tomorrow morning at six ill pick you up here if i hear of anything before then ill call you harvath thanked him and stepped back from the curb as the mi man pulled away opening the townhomes wroughtiron gate he walked up the stairs to the front door he punched the code reed had given him into the keypad and stepped inside there was a cavernous silence it was immediate as if a television had just been shut off but the echoes of a program still lingered in the air harvath was suddenly aware that he wasnt alone he set the case down and stepped into the living room for a moment he thought that he had entered the wrong house then he saw the weapons one of which had been picked up and was now pointing right at his chest chapter the woman pointing the mp at harvath turned to one of her colleagues and commented i thought somebody said this guy was hot the other five women in the room laughed hes a lot better than that guy we had to work with in dubai replied another remember him what was his name aswad most of the women groaned the woman holding the mp looked harvath up and down hes definitely better looking than ass wad but is he into goats thats the question the women laughed again there are a lot of things im okay walking in on a man doing the woman continued but the goat thing isnt one of them im sorry said harvath through the laughter i must be in the wrong place im looking for the emily dickinson reading hes also a smartass said the woman as she lowered her mp just my type so this was what an athena team looked like harvath thought to himself he had heard the stories about delta haunting highend womens sporting events recruiting the best female athletes to turn into operators but he had never worked with any of them they were considered just as lethal as their male counterparts and often posed as wives in husbandwife teams with male delta operators especially in countries or situations where sending in two or more men would raise too much suspicion the ruse worked particularly well when posing as missionaries or ngo workers the women were also deployed as they were now in allfemale teams normally composed of four to six members harvath had every confidence in their abilities he also liked the fact that theyd be harder for the bad guys to key in on in their mid twenties to early thirties the women were all extremely fit they were also very attractive and represented a cross section of backgrounds harvath was trying to figure out who was in charge when one of the women stepped forward and introduced herself im gretchen casey she had brown hair pulled back and a slight southern drawl it sounded as if she might have been from texas nice to meet you harvath said as he walked over and shook her hand after explaining that their sixth teammate had been injured in training in wales and had been forced to remain behind casey went around the room and introduced the rest of the team so from left to right we have julie ericsson megan rhodes alex cooper and on mp nikki rodriguez ericsson had jet black hair and looked like a brazilian volleyball player rhodes was the tallest of the bunch had blue eyes and was the only blonde cooper had fine ethiopian features with a lightbrown complexion and brown eyes rodriguez was the shortest of the group but despite her tough exterior was easily the bestlooking with dark hair and even darker eyes nice to meet you all were not going to have any goat trouble with you are we asked rodriguez with a smile give the guy a break nik said rhodes as she stood up and offered her hand to harvath its bad enough he has to be surrounded by women who can shoot better than he can all right already said casey he may just be a navy man but i think he gets it she gestured to the women and then looked at harvath tough ladies get it got it good are you hungry she asked what do you have in mind we need to recon piccadilly but we cant all walk through en masse true i want to do it in teams separated out over the next few hours you and i will get a bite to eat and then when its our turn well go in when everyones done well meet back here to debrief sound good sounds good harvath replied smiling at the athena team as he headed for the hallway he added theres one more thing what is it asked casey make sure i get the bedroom with the lock on it the women snorted and rolled their eyes got your lock right here said cooper as she flipped harvath the finger ericsson made a lewd gesture while rhodes blew him a kiss and rodriguez started stripping the mp harvath and casey went over details as they ate at a small thai restaurant off regent street when they were finished they walked to piccadilly circus to begin gathering intelligence the area was packed with britons and tourists alike people took pictures of the blazing neon signs and of each other standing in front of the shaftesbury memorial fountain most of them appeared not to have a care in the world undoubtedly they were aware of the attacks in paris and rome but if they were concerned they didnt show it those who were out and about were all smiles and laughter harvath reflected on what his friend colonel dave grossman liked to say sheep only have two speedsgraze and stampede as a sheepdog harvath wanted to guarantee that nothing would happen to them the sheer size of the traffic circle or circus as it was known in roman times made him question whether they were doing the right thing even if they flooded the area with operatives there was no way they could check every face follow every suspicious person it was an overwhelming task casey had brought along a digital video camera she used it to blend in with the other tourists and film as much of the area as possible as she did harvath tried to put himself in the mindset of the bombers rome had been a single bombing but paris had been a quantum leap forward with multiple bombings in multiple locations each event was created to have maximum impact but also to be different from the last from a tour bus bombing to multiple bombings in one city to simultaneous bombings in two cities the terrorists wanted to keep shaking people up they wanted to keep citizens and law enforcement off balance while continuing to create spectacular attacks taking in everything as they walked he asked himself how he would pull this off if he was them would he detonate in the tube station and then have a secondary device waiting for all of the survivors who then flooded out on the street how about placing a lone device or suicide bomber near the fountain with secondary bombers on every street leading away from the circus he tried to think of everything he studied the fixed railings all along the sidewalks that funneled pedestrian traffic and only allowed crossing at recognized crosswalks he studied what buildings people might run into for safety he watched how traffic moved into around and out of the circle he forced himself to examine every detail and by the time they left he was exhausted back at the belgravia house he and casey compared notes they discussed where the most efficient kill zones would be they explored what a single bomb would do versus multiple bombs based on the devices used in paris they queried each other on where similar devices in london might be placed then they discussed the topic harvath was most concerned with what if it wasnt bombs in backpacks or suicide vests they were planning to detonate what if they were going back to a vehiclebomb model as had been used in rome what if there was more than one what if they all converged in piccadilly at the same moment and detonated en masse buildings would be leveled and the carnage would be off the charts the only scenario harvath feared more than that was actually being there when it happened bob ashford had been right to bring his people on board there were too many whatifs here and it was far too large an operation for harvath and casey to get their arms around by themselves when the rest of the athena operatives had gathered at the house they designated the dining room as a makeshift ops center sitting around the table each team reported their findings and delivered an assessment everyone was in agreement that screening and managing traffic in and out of piccadilly circus was far outside their ability that task was going to have to fall to the brits but if the bombers came in on foot as they had in paris then that would be a different story the largest gathering place for tourists was around the shaftesbury fountain thats where most people stood to take in the neon signs and it was also where the tube stop was this was where bombers leaving backpack bombs or detonating suicide vests would get the biggest bang for their buck it was also the most obvious and thats what bothered harvath while it made the most sense to strike near the fountain the terrorists werent stupid with the paris bombing security had already been stepped up at tourist sites across europe and london was no different he and casey had seen plenty of uniformed officers as they did their reconnaissance of piccadilly and they had noted several plainclothes officers as well and they werent limited solely to piccadilly circus either they had picked up concentric rings of security the moment they had left the restaurant and had begun walking down regent street the closer they got to piccadilly the more intense the police presence became the terrorists would be doing dry runs as well and would have to know this so what were they planning how did they intend to subvert the police and get close enough to strike harvath had reached out to reed carlton twice hoping for news that adda sterk had revealed more information about the bombings to the interrogation team without any luck hed inquired as to whether or not the dutch authorities had had any success on the amsterdam attack and whether or not the interrogators had come up with more information on who had hired sterk but so far everything seemed to be a bust with cameras everywhere they knew the brits would be scanning every face coming and going from piccadilly they also knew though that the cameras wouldnt prevent a determined terrorist attack whereas pickpockets and purse snatchers might be concerned with the police hunting them down after they had committed their crime martyrs didnt really have that problem if the bomb or bombs were going to be vehicleborne rhodes brought up a very good point according to sterk the london and amsterdam attacks were supposed to be simultaneous that meant that a vehicle or vehicles would have to arrive at piccadilly at a precise time this would mean that the terrorists would have to commit drivers they couldnt simply plant a bomb as they had done in rome and hope that the vehicle they had planted it in arrived at piccadilly on time and didnt get held up or change course it was an excellent point harvath made a note to bring it up with ashford they needed to make sure that any regularly scheduled traffic that passed through piccadilly such as public buses or guided tours with set routes and pickupdropoff times were monitored if the terrorists did try to drive in then hopefully london police would be able to identify and neutralize them before they reached piccadilly and before they could detonate their explosives harvath didnt like having to hope for successful outcomes he liked to tilt the playing field so far to his advantage that his opponent didnt have a chance this was a different game entirely he was still very concerned with how little they had to go on the odds were much more in favor of the terrorists maybe keeping the alert level low was a mistake maybe people did have a right to know with his cognitive abilities nearing zero and his head still filled with doubts harvath walked upstairs to grab a few hours of sleep before ashford came to pick him up he thought about calling reed again but realized the old man would call him when he had something to report climbing into bed harvath forced his mind to relax and he fell into a deep dreamless black sleep three hours later a buzzing near his ear dragged him back he was more tired than when he had first turned in and it felt like he had been asleep for only a few minutes he brushed at his ear and reached for his watch to see what time it was thats when he saw the light on his phone blinking as it vibrated on the nightstand picking it up he flipped it open yeah its ashford scotland yard just got a tip theyre moving on the target within the hour harvath swung his feet out of bed and sat up what target what tip a car will be there in ten minutes ill explain when you get here with that the mi man disconnected the call and the line went dead chapter tuesday by the time harvath stepped outside his ride was already waiting for him it was an older navy blue van with the words davids hour plumbers home of the royal flush painted along the side the driver looked like a heavily tattooed thug barely into his twenties when he spotted harvath he stepped out of the vehicle and opened the sliding door youll have to ride back here harvath climbed inside and tried to get comfortable it was still dark outside and the morning rush was several hours off the van headed east the driver didnt speak a half hour later it pulled into the garage of a plumbing supply warehouse in east london when harvaths door was opened bob ashford was waiting for him sorry for the subterfuge he said unfortunately in this neighborhood anglosaxons stick out like sore thumbs ive ridden in worse conditions dont worry about it what have you got ashford led harvath to a small office with a coffeemaker and a scarred conference table the walls were lined with shelves stocked with plumbing parts in the corner was a television set the mi man switched it on while harvath helped himself to some coffee a thin pakistani man sat at a small desk there were what appeared to be two plainclothes detectives in the room with him one was sitting while the other stood leaning against the wall thats a feed from the room down the hall said ashford as he followed harvath and poured a cup of coffee for himself the man you see there is named saud wadi the men with him are metropolitan antiterror police mr wadi is one of their informants last night he learned of a terror cell planning to carry out an attack in the very near future how do you know its the cell were looking for because his youngest brother rafiq is a member harvath turned and looked back at the image on the tv as ashford continued apparently rafiq has already made his martyrdom video but he got cold feet he reached out to his big brother to help him figure a way out but before saud could do anything rafiq disappeared and rafiq told him everything unfortunately no all he said was that it was a martyrdom operation geared for central london did he mention piccadilly yes harvath couldnt believe it do we have any idea where rafiq may be we think the cell is operating out of a mosque four blocks from here the police are assembling their tactical teams now did he mention what kind of attack they had planned or what their secondary target was ashford shook his head no how well do you trust this source i dont know him hes run by the yard they say he has always produced good intelligence for them in the past but its never been on this kind of scale before how long have you been watching the interrogation since they brought him in i think hes genuinely worried about his brother harvath was running the options through his mind if rafiq got cold feet they may have killed him already or they may have wooed him back an alreadyrecorded martyrdom video can be a very successful tool for cultural blackmail they also may have threatened his family we dont know and frankly i dont care i just want to stop this attack so do i good because as soon as we have our ducks in a row well launch the teams harvath pulled out a chair and sat down at the table he watched the two cops continue their interrogation do we know if their attacks were going to use explosives thats been confirmed but it appears to be the limit of what saud was able to glean from his brother when you say operating out of the mosque what do you mean we think theyre headquartered there said ashford do you think theyre building the bombs there too its happened before these people are smart they know well raid a mosque but only as a last resort and only if we really have to the pr fallout in their community is terrible the pc moonbats everywhere else also go crazy makes you wonder whose side they are all really on i know said ashford whats more from a strategic standpoint if the bombers have a willing imam theyre probably better protected in a mosque than in a house or an apartment and if that is whats happening you know the imam will claim he knew nothing about it theyre always shocked to learn what was going on right beneath their noses harvath took a sip of his coffee if todays the day the attack happens theyre going to be on edge they probably have been up all night praying and getting ready hopefully theyll be sluggish when the entry teams hit the mosque what if theyre not what if theyre prepared for the teams we have the element of surprise on our side the mi man replied whats the motto peaches was always so fond of speed surprise and violence of action harvath nodded but what if theyre buttoned down meaning they have their fingers on the proverbial switch exactly what happens if your teams kick the doors in and they detonate their packages thats one of the reasons they call it a highrisk entry these teams have gone after bombers before they know whats at stake with all due respect they dont know whats at stake said harvath this isnt just about piccadilly one cell and one attack this is about an entire terrorist network we need these guys alive what do you suggest then should we knock on the door and ask mother may we come in harvath brushed aside the mans sarcasm what information do you have about the mosque ashford rolled his chair back and withdrew a file folder from his briefcase and slid it across it was a general briefing and contained only a couple of pages harvath skimmed it until he found what he was looking for what if we could get operators inside that sort of thing takes time a commodity we have precious little of right now it says in here that scotland yard has a confidential source unaffiliated with the wadi family who attends this mosque ashford nodded theyve already dispatched a team to collect him hes going to provide us with detail as to the layout what if he can also walk a small team of operators inside even if we had enough ethnic operators who could fit the bill if saud is correct about what is going on in that mosque theres no way they would allow a bunch of strange men in not today harvath looked at him and replied who said anything about men chapter by the time casey rhodes cooper ericsson and rodriguez arrived at the plumbing supply warehouse two of the british tactical teams were already on site harvath had informed them that the athena team would be coming in with most of their own gear but as a courtesy they had set up a table with an assortment of items they thought the women might need once again harvath was reminded of how professional the brits were and how much he enjoyed working with them they were truly one of americas best partners in the war on terror the ladies stepped out of another nondescript van each carrying a duffel bag and a large black storm case the only explanation ashford and the tac team leaders had been given was that the women were part of a highly trained us covert operations team neither delta nor the department of defense was mentioned harvath introduced them to the women and after checking out the equipment table the group walked back to the small conference room in addition to coffee bottled water and food had been brought in the women helped themselves and then sat down and waited for the briefing to begin moments later a grayhaired woman in her early sixties strode in and took over the meeting good morning ladies and gentlemen she said my name is rita marx im a detective with scotland yards so or for the benefit of our american friends in the room the counterterrorism command the mosques of east london in general and the darul uloom mosque in particular fall under my jurisdiction the man you will soon meet yusuf alfihri has been a scotland yard asset for the last two years and has been attending the darul uloom for the last four mr alfihri hasnt been told what will be taking place this morning though i suspect he has a fairly good idea nevertheless he has agreed to help get the team into the mosque for that we owe him our thanks and the commitment to do everything we can to keep him safe is that clear casey and company nodded good said marx who nodded to a detective standing next to her as we have never conducted formal surveillance on the darul uloom our information on it is rather incomplete jackets are being handed to you now with the pertinent information mr alfihri will be accompanying you to morning prayers and presenting you as female relatives once you have secured entry to the mosque you will go to the section reserved for women and children this next point is very important so please listen closely neither the metropolitan police mi nor the british government want any casualties ashford cleared his throat to get the womans attention i believe were willing to tolerate certain casualties marx grasped what he was implying these bastards like to hide behind women and children she said with a smile lets make sure they dont get that chance now before i bring in mr alfihri i want to introduce you to mr saud wadi he is also familiar with this mosque and will help give you a feel for its general layout mr wadi is our source that provided the mosque intelligence and he is also the gentleman whose brother was a member of this cell before he went missing if rafiq wadi is inside the mosque and you are able to facilitate his release wed like you to help extricate him saud wadi made his presentation and pictures of his brother were handed out he discussed what he knew of the plot and answered questions from the team the ladies were then introduced to yusuf alfihri who would be taking them inside he made sure the women were familiar with how to perform salaat the islamic ritual prayer and gave them tips on how to behave and where to go once they were inside the mosque the female operators then asked alfihri questions about the layout of the mosque where certain rooms could be found how many people would be there and so forth once they were satisfied that they had obtained all of the information they could from him rita marx thanked alfihri and had him taken to another room to wait it was time to talk about the assault itself alfihri had insisted that he could take in only three of the women casey didnt like odd numbers and under pressure alfihri had agreed to four this way the women could break off into two twomember fire teams deciding which of the women would go was another matter all of them wanted in and all of them were qualified for the assignment they each understood muslim culture could converse in a handful of languages spoken throughout the islamic world and were incredibly well trained in closequarters battle in the end the decision came down to appearance megan rhodes was too tall and too fair she would be the odd woman out that meant that gretchen casey julie ericsson nikki rodriguez and alex cooper would be the ones to go in the tac team commanders discussed strategy with their american counterparts and a plan was settled upon it was simple but simple plans were often the best especially when violently executed the only way success could be better assured was to have the plan well rehearsed with the clock ticking down to morning prayers rehearsals were not something they had time to carry out detective marx left the conference room and came back with four shopping bags containing the islamic garb the women would be wearing from an ops standpoint casey and her team loved burqas they allowed them to mix in the muslim community without drawing undue attention to themselves and a lot of gear could be secreted beneath the fact that they were employing one of the most preeminent symbols of islamic oppression against women to get up close and stick it to the bad guys was an added piece of sweet irony opening their storm cases the team selected the weapons and equipment they were going to use one of the items was a device harvath had heard about but had yet to deploy withthe new semiautomatic multishot taser x the new ecd or electronic control device provided the opportunity to deploy a second and third cartridge immediately and could even incapacitate three subjects simultaneously it was a sexylooking piece of gear with a cool spaceage design it had dual laser sights a thirtyfivefoot range and unlike the bright yellow device taser was so well known for this was as black as night it also matched their burqas an observation harvath decided to keep to himself casey and rodriguez walked back into the garage and selected several pieces of equipment from the tac team table and then marx got them outfitted with radios before anyone knew it it was time to launch they gave their weapons and radios one last check before climbing into yusuf alfihris car as they pulled out of the garage and the vehicle disappeared down the street harvath had a bad feeling but like his burqa observation he kept it to himself when he climbed into one of the backup vans and took his place alongside rhodes he could tell by the look on her face that she was feeling exactly the same thing chapter gretchen casey sat in front and studied yusuf alfihri as they drove toward the mosque she could tell he was nervous are you a smoker mr alfihri she asked from beneath her burqa yes miss he replied why dont you have a cigarette it wont bother us i dont like to smoke before prayers it will help calm your nerves i think its a good idea yes miss said alfihri who then fished out his cigarettes and lit one he took a deep pull of smoke into his lungs and the soothing effect the nicotine had on him was instantly apparent youre doing the right thing mr alfihri remember that i know miss they found a parking space and then as instructed walked behind alfihri the rest of the way to the mosque casey reminded him to take his time they wanted to get there as late as possible they had no desire to stand around socializing before prayers approaching the front doors alfihri nodded and said hello to several men he knew but kept moving he accompanied the women to a side entrance where he spoke a few words to a burqaclad woman who appeared to be a greeter of some sort per the plan he then berated casey for making him late shoved her inside along with the other women and hurried back to the main entrance which was for men only the greeter further chastised the women and after they had removed their shoes rushed them up a narrow set of stairs on the second floor she shooed them into a small bathroom and waited outside while they performed their ritual purification as they conducted their faux ablutions casey radioed a quick update over the bone mic in her left ear when they reemerged the doorkeeper hurried them into the packed womens prayer room and pointed to where she wanted them to stand in the back row she then took up a spot right between them and the door the team was professional and maintained radio silence casey didnt need to hear anything she knew exactly what they all were thinking the doorkeeper had just gone from being a pain in the ass to an actual impediment that would have to be dealt with with their heads down feet shoulderwidth apart and their hands at their sides as they faced in the direction of mecca the ladies pretended to quietly utter their intentions to perform salaat the islamic ritual prayer over her earpiece casey could hear nikki rodriguez reciting the pledge of allegiance right away cooper and ericsson joined her casey did too a voice crackled over the loudspeakers at the front of the room in arabic and the salaat began the athena team followed along voicing the appropriate phrases and adopting the proper postures until casey signaled over the radio that she was going to take out the doorkeeper rising from the floor casey wrapped her midsection and bent over as if she was in pain she sat in that position until she could tell that she had gotten the doorkeepers attention standing up slowly she then moved toward the exit the doorkeeper met her halfway and tried to stop her from leaving im going to be sick she mumbled in arabic and then added in heavily accented english need toilet sick sick the woman stepped out of her way but followed casey toward the womens bathroom approaching the door she pretended to falter and the woman rushed forward to grab her arm she helped steady casey and steer her into the ladies room as she did she took the opportunity once more to chastise her shame on you she hissed you should know better than to come to mosque when you are sick im not sick darling said casey in her best texas drawl as the door shut behind them and she reached over to lock it but i am getting pretty tired of what a bitch youre being i i i the woman stammered suddenly aware that something very bad was happening yup you you you replied the athena team leader as she pulled her taser from beneath her burqa and stundrove it into the womans chest the doorkeepers muscles seized up and casey caught her as she fell forward she was in the process of removing the womans burqa to bind and gag her when she heard ericssons voice over her earpiece were in the hallway all clear casey reached up and unlocked the door rodriguez and cooper helped her secure the doorkeeper in one of the stalls as ericsson continued to keep watch once they had her out of the way casey radioed harvath that they were heading to the basement morning prayers would not last long so they needed to move quickly with suppressed weapons at the ready beneath their burqas they descended the narrow staircase casey took the lead followed by cooper rodriguez and ericsson on the ground floor they retrieved their shoes and proceeded to the end of the hallway where they found the door alfihri claimed led to the basement casey reached out and tried to open it but it was locked she stood back and signaled cooper who stepped forward checked the door for any sort of alarm and then pulled out a lockpick gun within seconds she had the dead bolt taken care of nodding at casey she stepped away from the door replaced the lockpick tool beneath her burqa and readied her weapon casey grabbed hold of the door handle and counted down quietly from three when she said go and opened the door they followed her into the stairwell and down the stairs their presence on the stairs was greeted with a string of sharp words spoken in arabic a young man no more than twentytwo years old with a glock placed on the prayer mat in front of him demanded to know what they were doing salam salam peace repeated casey in the traditional muslim greeting as she continued down the stairs toward him the man was nervous the women didnt belong there had he not had a weapon sitting right in front of him casey would have transitioned to her taser but her primary duty was to protect her life and those of her teammates dont go for the gun she begged him under her breath but he did it was a bad decision and the last one the young man would ever make casey fired two suppressed rounds from beneath her burqa both striking him in the face it was a very difficult shot especially having to aim down a set of stairs and firing from behind clothing the young man was still alive as they reached the last step but barely pulling out her mp she popped him twice just above the bridge of his nose finishing the job contact she said over the radio tango down the man had collapsed on his prayer mat and cooper and ericsson used it to drag him underneath the stairs before the blood soaked through and stained the floor once they had him stashed they all removed their burqas there was a distinct chemical odor in the air with rodriguez covering the door at the top of the stairs they got ready to clear the rest of the basement the fact that they had encountered an armed man told them two things not everyone had gone upstairs for morning prayers and there was something down here someone felt very serious about protecting judging by the odor whoever was down here wasnt preparing cookies for the mosque bake sale the hallway ran the length of the building above with four doors along each side the amplified voice of the imam radiated down through the ceiling and vibrated the dusty light fixtures above them casey withdrew a special device with a long piece of fiberoptic cable from her pocket she hit pay dirt with the very first door slipping the cable beneath it and raising the unit to her eye she saw a makeshift lab complete with long tables jammed with glass jars soldering guns nylon bags of some sort and stacks of discarded electronic equipment she signaled for the team not to move beyond the tables she could see at least six men prostrated on prayer rugs pulling the cable back out from under the door she turned to her teammates and drew a quick diagram on the floor the room appeared to run the entire length of the building on its south side it must have been subdivided into offices or separate storerooms at some point as it had four doors leading into it casey planned to use this feature to their advantage moving down the hallway so she could get a good look at the men from the front she positioned herself near the last door and fed the cable only partway beneath it she noticed that the voice of the imam above was even louder here and figured there must be speakers in this basement room just as there had been in the womens prayer hall once again she counted six men all of whom had weapons with them on their prayer mats at the very end furthest from the door was rafiq wadi gone was the beard hed been wearing in the photo his brother saud had showed them back at the plumbing warehouse like the five other men he was praying with all were cleanshaven that was a bad sign that this group had performed the islamic ritual cleansing rites intended to speed their way into paradise they appeared ready indeed to go operational casey studied the men trying to discern who was in charge but it was impossible to figure out carefully she withdrew the cable and backed away from the door the prayer service was almost over she checked to make sure none of the doors were wired and then quickly cleared the other rooms they were all being used for storage of one sort or another and one even appeared to be a bike room she searched for a fuse box or a circuit breaker but couldnt find one they would have to come up with some other kind of distraction based on the smell and the compounds known to have been used in the other attacks casey had no doubt these men were constructing organic peroxide explosives this was going to be one of the trickiest assaults they had ever conducted one wrong move and the entire building could be leveled maybe even the entire block their job was made even more complicated by the fact that they needed to take as many of the men inside alive as possible casey didnt have time to formulate an elaborate plan they also couldnt risk using flash bangs for fear of setting off the bombs inside they were going to have to go in hard and fast and hope that the element of surprise would give them enough of an edge she decided to pull nikki off of covering the door at the top of the stairwell though this would leave their rear vulnerable right now the men in that room posed a greater threat than anyone who might come down the stairs the rooms occupants were praying between the third and fourth doors and thats where casey decided to hit them she would take door number four with cooper while rodriguez and ericsson took door number three cooper and ericsson would be armed with their mps while she and rodriguez the fastest and most accurate shooters on the team would be armed with their tasers the idea was to incapacitate all of the men if possible if any of them were able to pick up their weapons it was up to cooper and ericsson to take them out when both fire teams were positioned at their respective doors casey tightened her grip around the x took a breath and then once again counted down from three chapter though the sight of four heavily armed women kicking in the doors of their bomb factory scared the hell out of them the six muslim terrorists had been trained well and didnt allow their fear to paralyze them they were in the process of rising from their prayer mats when the two doors exploded inward in various stages of standing they reacted quickly scrambling for their weapons almost in unison all except for rafiq wadi there was a series of pops as casey and rodriguez deployed their taser cartridges cooper fired two rounds from her mp hitting one of the terrorists in the arm and upper chest ericsson fired her mp as well hitting one of the men in the hand and the neck as he lunged for his weapon it was chaos as the men fell to the ground the terrorists with the neck and chest wounds were already bleeding out rafiq wadi lay down on his prayer mat with his hands over the back of his head he was yelling dont shoot dont shoot as a precaution and just to get him to shut up casey tasered him anyway cooper covered the men while ericsson entered the room and secured their weapons as she did casey activated her radio six tangos in custody two with multiple gsws what about explosives replied harvath stand by the team secured the prisoners while casey began searching the room for bombs she went directly to the bike messenger bags and sure enough they were loaded with explosives there was a row of panniers and they had been loaded with explosives as well ive got multiple explosive devices here at least fifteen maybe more the compound appears to be tatp and it has been packaged in bicycle messenger bags and large panniers it looks like they have been packed with ball bearings roger that replied harvath who now realized how they were going to navigate traffic and all enter piccadilly at the same time it was not only extremely lowtech it was incredibly creative this method had been used in both pakistan and afghanistan people rarely gave bike messengers or bike riders a second glance while police would be keeping their eyes out for backpacks bicycleborne bombs could very well escape their scrutiny they could weave in and out of traffic and park just about anywhere not only would it work well in london where riders with their heads down could obscure their faces from surveillance cameras the tactic would be brilliant in bicyclechoked amsterdam do you see any bikes affirmative theres a roomful across the hall dont move any of them they could be packed with explosives too cautioned harvath who pictured bike shrapnel in addition to the ball bearings in the bags tearing people apart roger that are the bags armed checking said casey as she examined one of the bags more closely there are wires leading to some sort of reflection beacon im assuming that when the beacon gets turned on thats when the bags blow well leave that for the bomb technicians affirm began casey but then her voice broke off youre breaking up repeat please the bags are hot she said all of them are you talking about the beacons replied harvath negative each bag has a chicken switch theyre wired to cell phones and the cell phones are powered up harvath looked at ashford and marx sitting in the van next to him listening in any way we can jam cell phone signals from entering that mosque we dont have any jamming equipment with us replied the mi agent how quickly could we get it marx looked at her watch ours would probably take at least an hour how about mi harvath asked ashford probably the same amount of time depending on where the nearest gear is caseys voice came back over the radio what do you want us to do it was clear the jammer route was closed theyd have to do something else can you describe the setup to me harvath replied it looks like the phone from the undetonated device in the madrid bombings same stuff they have been using in iraq there are two wires protruding from the interior of the phone to a small circuit board taped to the front of the phone with clear plastic tape hows the signal strength three bars that was not good news the circuit board appears to be wired to two detonating caps she continued im assuming the entire setup leads back to the phones ringer as long as thats not a booby trap we should be able to snip the wires and deactivate that secondary trigger was rafiq wadi injured in the assault no he just rode the bull turning his attention back to casey harvath said get him away from the others and ask him what he knows about the bombs after that i want you to verify the primary and secondary targets roger that the terrorists had been bound hands and feet with ez cuffs gagged with duct tape and made to lie facedown on the floor the barbed taser probes were then pulled from them as they each had their pockets emptied and the contents placed in piles so that the athena members could id what belonged to whom next to the bombs being detonated caseys biggest concern was that there could be more terrorists upstairs who might be on their way down now that the service was over she dispatched rodriguez and cooper to make sure the upper door was locked and to cover the stairs ericsson was left to watch the prisoners the two men who were bleeding out would not be given medical attention until the situation was completely under control casey walked over to the terrorists they looked up at her as she pretended to decide which one of them to select finally she grabbed rafiq wadi and yanked him to his feet the man next to him began mumbling something from behind the duct tape across his mouth and casey kicked him in the ribs hard she shoved wadi out the door and closed it behind them in the hall she pushed him up against the wall drew her knife and placed it against his throat she held her fingers to her lips and motioned for him to be quiet his eyes reflected how frightened he was he nodded once very slowly and casey peeled the duct tape back from his mouth we have saud she said before rafiq could speak he will remain safe only as long as you cooperate if you understand nod your head once rafiq nodded good i know everything about what is going on here if you lie to me i will gut you like a pig and let you watch your insides spill out do you understand me again rafiq nodded are there any more bombs the man nodded and flicked his eyes across the hallway the bicycles rafiq nodded are the bombs armed the man nodded but then shook his head which is it demanded casey the bags yes the bicycles no how are the bags armed each one has an electronic light the woman studied his face and then said im sorry saud will have to die because his brother lied rafiq became even more panicked i am not lying theyre beacons that flash twenty seconds after they are activated the bombs detonate tell me about the cell phone triggers how do you defuse them i dont know youre still lying to me im not lying why would they want us to know the cell phone is their guarantee if we dont go through with it or our primary detonator doesnt work this is how they make sure the mission goes forward the cell phone detonators were a failsafe these rafiq would not have been taught how to deactivate casey moved on to her next question whats your target piccadilly circus when tonight during the evening rush hour what is your secondary target i dont know we surveyed many targets it could be any of them the london eye covent garden several of the theaters whos in charge of your cell rafiq wadi seemed reluctant to answer and casey applied pressure to her knife the man who was shot in the neck he said finally and who does he report to i dont know how do they contact each other i dont know please casey placed the tape back across his mouth theyd have to interrogate all of them her thoughts were interrupted when julie ericssons voice came over her earpiece you need to get back in here why whats up one of the cell phones just began vibrating chapter gretchen casey quickly steered rafiq wadi back into the room and had him lie facedown with the other prisoners which one ericsson pointed to the cell phone in question it was in a pile of pocket litter belonging to the terrorist who had been shot in the neck the man rafiq wadi had identified as the cell leader she could tell by looking at him that he wasnt going to make it hed already lost too much blood there wasnt anything they could do for him casey picked up his phone and stepped to the back of the room where she radioed harvath one of these guys just received a text message what did it say harvath replied someone wants an update what did rafiq say about the bombs he said the cell phone triggers are a failsafe in case one of the devices fails to detonate do you believe him i do what about the secondary target he doesnt know they surveilled several potentials do we know who the cell leader is asked harvath the guy with the neck wound hes not going to make it right now though we need to focus on these bombs what do you want to do harvath knew what he wanted done but it was up to casey whether she wanted to do it how do you feel about deactivating the cell phones as long as theyre not booby traps weve done these before so ive got no problem with it she was a brave woman good grab one of the prisoners and make him stand with you when you do it they may know more than they are letting on they might still also want to go to paradise in which case in which case harvath interjected it should be written all over each of their faces watch for them to start sweating or rocking back and forth mumbling their prayers now do you see any wire clippers there im already ahead of you replied casey as she picked up a pair off the table she walked back to the prisoners and pulled one of the men to his feet she jerked him over to the table with all the messenger bags and panniers assembled on it she could feel his body tense beneath her grasp opening the first bag she pointed at the cell phone and the wires leading from it the man stared at it and then back at her casey made a clipping motion with the cutters the man didnt respond this guy doesnt like that were standing near the bombs she said to harvath but other than that hes not giving me any other signals im going to cut the wires coming out of the phone to the circuit board everybody get ready casey paused took a deep breath and then let it out as she did she gritted her teeth placed the wires in the mouth of the cutter and clipped them both at the same time harvath was anxious to know what happened but he remained quiet ready for whatever the outcome might be but hoping for the absolute best he hadnt realized he was holding his breath until gretchen caseys voice came back over the radio chicken switch number one deactivated she said moving to number two roger that replied harvath good job when all of the cell phone detonators had been deactivated harvath had casey remove them from the bags and place them in the order she had retrieved them she then took care of the beacons with the bombs deactivated ashford and marx were eager to send the tactical teams into the mosque harvath wasnt so sure that was a good idea why not said ashford there are two men dying in there added marx with all due respect harvath replied i dont care about two dying terrorists what if they have intelligence we can use the cell leader isnt going to make it and if the second one dies thats two trials the british taxpayers have been spared im more concerned with finding out whos behind this attack ashford looked at him so then why not secure the mosque and begin interrogating these men because wed lose our advantage explained harvath which is what that nobody knows were in there except the terrorists clarified marx correct and weve cut them off from whoever their controller is thats the person we need to get to lets try to trace the number that text message came through on i guarantee you itll be a throwaway phone if the right text response doesnt come back soon whoever originated that message is going to abandon that phone then we check the cell phone detonators whoever selected them would have tested them to make sure they received incoming traffic without any problems i can have casey pull off the tape and circuit boards to see if theres a list of previous activity said harvath but if it was me id have deleted all the logs ashford thought about it for a moment and then nodded youre probably right how about the six men we have in the mosque asked marx in addition to interrogating them shouldnt we check their phones for any common numbers i can ask casey to do that but i dont think thatll provide much either then what do you want to do i want to force their hand how i want whoever is running this cell to think the operation is in jeopardy and i want them to expose themselves if we do this right when they do well be able to nail them chapter word of a major gas leak in east london was in reality a heavy release of mercaptan the substance added to natural gas to make it smell like rotten eggs residents in a fourblock radius surrounding the darul uloom mosque were evacuated shortly after the evacuations began the reporters showed up a cordon had been established and the news crews as well as onlookers were kept a safe distance away with ashfords approval harvath had decided that the bbc should be allowed the scoop when the time was right the bbc news team on site was tipped off about some strange activity only a block from their location hot for a story the reporter ran for it with her cameraman in tow they arrived just in time to see teams of heavily equipped blackclad balaclavawearing antiterrorism police piling into four gas company vans the cameraman was able to capture all of it rushing back to their own van they uploaded the footage to the bbc who broke into their morning news programming for a strange development in the east london gas leak story within seconds of the footage being received the bbcs helicopter was diverted to east london and the completely predictable speculation began was the gas leak terrorism was it a cover for an antiterrorism raid why was the british government keeping its people in the dark dont the people have a right to know should the prime minister resign they played right into harvaths plan moments later the other networks had picked up on the story anyone watching tv now knew that there was a lot more happening in east london than a gas leak antiterrorism units were not normally sent in to handle utility problems harvath was hoping that whoever controlled the cell at the darul uloom mosque was watching tv as well the architecture of any human network whether it was created for gathering intelligence or committing acts of terror was pretty easy to understand as you climbed the food chain each layer was designed to protect the operative positioned above it those layers were people and they were known as cutouts at the ground level was the cell itself the number of people in that cell was dependent upon their specific assignment and the overall goal of the network the cell had a leader whose job it was to make sure that the cell operated efficiently and to communicate up the food chain the next rung on the ladder was the controller he or she might control only that one cell or he or she might control many cells but that persons primary job was to act as a gobetween and protect the identity of the regional controller the regional controller could be limited to controlling all of the networks activity in a particular region in a particular country or even a group of countries the regional controller then reported to a figure known as tight control tight control was in charge of the entire network worldwide despite site being a chinese project harvath doubted that any of the controllers were chinese most likely they were all muslim men who totally believed they were operating within a true islamic terror network that was the brilliance of the operation whoever tight control was harvath was confident he didnt live anywhere near china he very likely operated similarly to bin laden prior to as the guest of a country sympathetic to the islamist agenda pulling his strings would have been achieved through coded communications for all intents and purposes the man could very well have believed he was working directly for the alqaeda hierarchy even though hed probably never met any of its members facetoface it was the perfect turnkey operation why go through the trouble of building your own muslim network when you could hijack one from the chinese what harvath couldnt figure out though was why they had done it why unleash the carnage what was the point to figure that out they were going to need to get to tight control and to get to him they were going to need to work their way up the food chain one bite at a time they all agreed that the terrorist who had received the text was most likely the cell leader and the sender of the message had been the cell controller while harvath would have liked to have applied pressure to the terrorist he was barely clinging to life as it was and would not have withstood interrogation whats more reverse engineering a network was very delicate work members were taught distress codes and could easily relay to their controllers that the cell had been compromised they didnt even need to send the message themselves often they could trick their captors into doing it for them it could be as simple as a chalk mark in the wrong place a window shade at the wrong height or the wrong color or style of font in a chat room knowing full well the pitfalls harvath decided it best to force the controller out into the open but to do it robert ashford and rita marx had to call in nearly every favor they had ever accrued for the first time in britains modern history its entire electronic surveillance apparatus was focused on one objective and one objective onlylocating a single phone somewhere within the united kingdom when everyone was in place marx radioed for the tactical teams to move in on the mosque whose morning worshippers had already departed high above television helicopters were broadcasting the entire thing all the rest of the team could do was wait and hope that the cells controller would expose himself the gas company trucks converged on the mosque from opposite ends of the street when the officers poured out they were all heavily armed armored and wearing gas masks rounds and rounds of tear gas were fired through windows as the officers rapidly advanced on the mosque across the country viewers were undoubtedly glued to their sets if the cells controller was watching which harvath prayed he was all he would be able to surmise was that the mosque his men had been using for their headquarters was compromised and was now under a fullscale assault the fact that he hadnt been able to reach any of his cell members would only heighten his anxiety very likely the only question greater in his mind than how the cell had been discovered was why his men hadnt yet detonated their explosives that was what their training would have dictated the only thing the controller would have been able to attribute the delay to was that the cell members were trying to draw more police officers into the mosque before blowing it up that sort of deviation definitely would have been against protocol their job would have been to detonate not fight it out or try to take as many officers with them as possible there was one other option that the controller would have had to consider he would have to entertain the possibility that the men had lost their nerve either scenario was unacceptable the controller would have been left with no other option than to engage the failsafe when the tactical team hit the mosques front doors marxs voice came over harvaths headset the cell phone detonators have begun lighting up give me a location were working on it she replied stand by precious seconds ticked down as the tac team flooded into the mosque harvath studied the faces of the athena team members sitting next to him to the untrained eye they would have appeared cold and even expressionless but harvath knew the look of operators about to go into battle the women were the picture of professionalism he could also sense their impatience he was feeling it too this was their one shot and the window was narrower than almost any other he had ever dealt with if the brits couldnt get a lock on the controller they were going to be dead in the water we need that location harvath repeated stand by come on come on finally marxs voice came back over his headset got it the woman from scotland yard rattled off a set of coordinates roger replied the helicopter pilot who then announced to harvath and his passengers hold on the pilot banked the agustawestland lynx and sped toward the center of london it was the fastest helicopter in the world and speed was exactly what they needed right now as marx worked on pinpointing the exact building the controller was in she had already begun sending undercover tactical teams in the general direction but unless the teams were in the immediate vicinity when the address was revealed harvath had a strong feeling he and his team were going to be the first boots on the ground buildings whipped beneath the belly of the helo as it rapidly closed the distance with their destination harvath had been surprised by the central london location it wasnt that the cells controller couldnt be fully integrated into british culturethe wave of british doctor attacks had proven thatit was just incongruous with what harvaths experience had been normally these guys used ethnic neighborhoods as cover there they could blend in and disappear the neighborhoods were difficult for nonmuslims to penetrate and the closeknit often ethnic makeup of their inhabitants provided an unending supply of lookouts and human trip wires that said only hours earlier harvath had cautioned bob ashford not to underestimate their enemy and now he reminded himself to heed his own advice expecting the controller to be holed up in some blighted muslim neighborhood sitting on a carpet drinking tea while he coordinated bombings was sloppy thinking on his part he was trained better than that this guy could be a banker or a professor at the london school of economics for all he knew as the lynx banked again and raced up the thames robert ashfords voice came over harvaths headset weve lost the signal chapter chicago just try to breathe said john vaughan in and out nice and easy youre going to be okay just relax and breathe jesus it hurts said levy i think im having a heart attack focus on the sound of my voice josh listen to me youre going to be okay were going to figure out a way to get out of here theyre going to kill us arent they if they were going to kill us theyd have done it already either way added davidson im a dead man if they dont kill me my wife will how many days have we been here all three were bound and hoods had been placed over their heads as a marine vaughan was the only one who had been trained to withstand captivity and interrogation he knew that most of it was a mental game and that meant that he had to help davidson and levy get through this weve only been here about twentyfour hours give or take an hour or two thats it said davidson my marriage is definitely over my wife is never going to believe i was taken hostage vaughan kept his attention on levy josh i want you to describe to me how youre feeling levy took a moment to form his assessment my shoulder hurts like hell and i have a lot of pain in my chest my back hurts and so does my neck welcome to what it feels like to have been shot but i was shot in the shoulder not in the chest your torso absorbed a lot of blunt force trauma youre going to feel it everywhere i have tightness and trouble breathing that probably has more to do with anxiety than anything else hes right josh said davidson try not to think about how long it has been since you last clipped your nails up yours as levy and davidson started laughing vaughan felt relieved they needed to keep their spirits up ever the wiseacre davidson said hey do you guys know what the only thing in the world shorter than a muslim terrorists dick is his to do list there was another roll of quiet laughter but the elevated mood didnt last what do you think theyre going to do with us levy asked we gave them everything replied vaughan so i dont know that theres any other information they could squeeze out of us which reminds me said davidson i thought you big tough marines were supposed to be able to hold out indefinitely under interrogation no one can hold out indefinitely paul thats just in the movies but we told them everything said levy what possible value could we still have for them they know we came looking for nasiri and that this wasnt official police business vaughan had been thinking about that too we should take it as a good sign that were still here as long as were alive theres a chance were going to get out of this were all married so lets focus on our wives and children way to ruin it for me said davidson come on your wife cant be that bad when we get out of here you can stay at my house for a week with her and her two dogs okay vaughan smiled beneath his hood think about fishing then i have been and ive been thinking about how im never going to take my cell phone on vacation again if it makes you feel better to blame me for all of this go ahead when the turban fits by the way who were you really fishing with when i called i know you didnt threaten to kill your priest you should hear the kind of stuff he threatens me with vaughan still didnt believe him but he laughed anyway ive been thinking about my wife levy interjected his tone morose we had an argument yesterday a bad one youve got to stay strong josh said vaughan were going to make it what if we dont we will how nobody knows where the hell we are we dont even know where we are i guarantee you that our wives are raising holy hell right now replied vaughan the fact that paul and i are cops means that cpd will be working extra hard to find us i didnt tell my wife where we were going or who we were surveilling said levy there was silence finally davidson admitted i didnt give my wife specifics either beneath the darkness of his hood vaughan could feel the other mens eyes shift toward him he knew what they wanted to hear he knew what they needed to hear and so he said then i guess its a good thing i told my wife everything the other two didnt respond they knew he was lying chapter london talk to me bob said harvath as the lynx flew over westminster bridge and decreased its speed as the pilot awaited further instructions we had a flurry of activity and then everything stopped ashford replied somebody pinged the cell members phones from different numbers and when they didnt respond whoever it was began trying to activate the detonators on the explosives we had the caller traced to a oneblock area how many buildings are we talking about the caller wasnt in a building he was outside moving was he in a vehicle or on foot we dont know said the mi man how about cctv cameras were there any in the area yes rita has already pulled the footage and were rolling it back to the time the calls were placed the first filter is people visibly using phones the next is headsets or earbuds if someone is seen using more than one phone or changing sim cards then obviously we the mi mans voice trailed off can you repeat said harvath i didnt get that last part marxs voice came back over the radio i think we have our man arab male early forties approximately two meters tall and eighty kilos harvath did the conversion in his headsix feet and around pounds he has short black hair and a goatee marx continued he is wearing a brown sport coat a blue jumper khaki trousers and dark shoes what happened to bob he seems to be having trouble with his radio said marx youre sure this is our guy positive we have footage of him operating three different devices where is he and which direction is he headed we idd him off of footage from several minutes ago said the woman from scotland yard we need to reacquire him were sorting the live feeds now stand by harvath turned to the pilot where can you set us down theres a helipad at the london hospital in whitechapel he replied pointing down at his map too far replied harvath who then hailed ashford again bob i need to know which direction the subject was heading north but as best we can tell he doubled back replied ashford his radio working again were still trying to find him hes running sdrs let him we dont have anyone on him yet so theres nothing for him to pick up what if he gets on the tube asked harvath weve got cameras in all the stations hold on a second do you have him i think so stand by is it confirmed harvath heard him say over his open mic moments later he came back and replied yes weve reacquired him the sport coat is gone hes got the blue jumper on now along with a pair of wirerim glasses the khakis and shoes are the same hes definitely running sdrs said harvath agreed right now he is on waterloo place near the sofitel headed toward trafalgar were going to mobilize all the teams we have and flood the area were getting his picture out to police as well dont do that harvath cautioned why the devil shouldnt we if hes the controller of the east london cell hes going to need to get in touch with his superior to sort out what just happened they have no idea how deeply theyve been penetrated and if other cells are at risk what if we lose him asked marx now the only way that will happen is if we spook him so we wont spook him the last thing we want to do is put the kind of surveillance on him that hed be expecting you want to use your team again harvath looked at casey and the rest of the athena team who all flashed him thumbsup your people can establish a loose cordon harvath said keep it at least three or four blocks out well let my team work inside the bubble you realize that just because theyre women that doesnt mean he wont take notice of them if he sees any of them a second time were going to have a problem so lets make sure we dont have any problems put your teams into the area but hold them as far back as possible well stay on the radios and you can give us cctv updates as to what our man is doing meanwhile try to find out who the hell he is and get me everything you can on him we will said marx anything else yes replied harvath glancing back down at the map im going to need you to make an important phone call for me chapter the lynx helicopter flared as it came in and landed on the horse guards parade exercise ground in whitehall crowds of tourists gathered for the famous changing of the guard were kept a safe distance away by formally garbed household cavalry troopers both harvath and the athena team members were familiar with the household cavalry as it was a highly respected operational regiment whose personnel which included prince harry had served courageously in both iraq and afghanistan a special contingent of troopers spirited the helicopters passengers to the archway that led to the street there were shouts of coming through they have an ivory as the team passed beneath the ceremonial arch reserved solely for the queen and those who had been given the queens permission to pass in the form of a formal ivory invitation harvath had no idea if marx had contacted the queen but the speed and professionalism with which they were ushered through was remarkable out on the street they divided up into teams and harvath watched as the women transformed right before his eyes they made subtle adjustments to their clothes and hairstyles that could later be changed at a moments notice and would result in their appearances being significantly altered like their male colleagues this delta force detachment was exceedingly well trained once again harvath was teamed with gretchen casey cooper went with ericsson and rodriguez went with rhodes halfway up the street he watched cooper and ericsson duck inside a tshirt shop he could see the scene playing out in his mind without even being there in a hurry their tour bus leaving momentarily two tourists wanted to stock up on a bunch of souvenirs if they were smart which harvath already knew they were theyd be buying a bunch of clothing to help further alter their appearance the bonus was that the bags theyd be carrying would make them look even more like tourists as they approached the statue of sir henry havelock with lord nelsons column and trafalgar looming behind harvath was amazed at the number of people that were out black cabs doubledecker and tour buses disgorged people on every corner and somewhere in that mass of humanity was the man they were looking for because of the number of operatives now involved ashford wanted firm call signs and harvaths team had been designated corona he was corona one casey corona two cooper corona three ericsson four rodriguez five and rhodes six ashford took the call sign viceroy harvath and casey had picked up a tourist map while the other women used maps that they had found on the web via their iphones they gave trafalgar a wide berth and stayed well across the street via the bone mic he was wearing harvath pretended to consult his map with casey and said okay viceroy wheres the subject hes heading into the national gallery before harvath could respond cooper said this is corona three weve got him the dance went on for over an hour the man they were following used channels stairstepping intrusion points and timing stops he also changed his appearance several more times but it made no difference he never spotted harvaths team and was therefore unable to shake them he walked into an internet café on charing cross road with megan rhodes right on his heels it was a small storefront operation that sold newspapers cigarettes and western union services in addition to internet access the space looked like it had once belonged to a grocer and they also offered skype it maintenance web design computer networking and web and data security it was an odd hodgepodge to say the least chewing gum and clicking away at her iphone rhodes was directed by an overly pierced clerk to the only remaining terminal the one right next to the man she was following having pulled out her earpiece before walking into the café rhodes was now communicating via text messages with gretchen casey who along with harvath was two blocks away and closing nikki rodriguez took up a position outside while cooper and ericsson split up to cover any rear exits ashfords men maintained their perimeter ready to move in as soon as harvath gave the command shut up rhodes snorted as she popped her gum rolled her eyes and thumbed out another text message the controller cursed the ugly american under his breath and tried to tune her out as he opened up his web browser rhodes set her phone down next to her computer and opened her web browser as well and began slowly surfing through a series of tourism links for the cotswolds the man next to her logged on to his skype account picked up the headset next to his computer and initiated a voip call the oranges were no good he said in arabic i have no idea why he added after a pause to listen to something said by whoever was on the other end it might have been just this batch or it could have been throughout the entire crop the cryptic call went on for several minutes as the men spoke in code rhodess iphone was recording the entire thing and broadcasting it to casey i understand the controller finally said it is the right thing to do he then disconnected the call and removed his headset rhodes paid no attention to the man as he stood up to leave once he was at the door she picked up her phone and said hes coming out take him down in case the man had some sort of a relationship with the café they waited until he was half a block away and then harvath and rodriguez did the honors with a blast from one of the taser xs by the time harvath had the mans wrists bound with a pair of ez cuffs an mi van was in the street its sliding door wide open he and rodriguez chucked the man inside and then watched as it raced away turning to her he asked did that guy smell like goat to you rodriguez shook her head and went back to join the rest of the team at the café a small nondescript car pulled up to the curb dropped off bob ashford and then took off in the same direction as the van do we have any idea who he is yet asked harvath as ashford approached we think he may be a former yemeni intelligence service operative but were not sure based on the way he conducted his surveillance detection routes hes had formal training and if thats true he wont be an easy interrogation subject suffice it to say that the people hes just been handed over to will get to the bottom of who he is sooner rather than later said the mi man trust me harvath didnt doubt it there were certain things the brits did very well and were able to keep away from the press one of those things was the interrogation techniques they used to drain intelligence from suspected terrorists he was about to ask if the techniques involved things the american press found so hateful like calling terrorists names and hurting their feelings when casey emerged from the internet café and hurriedly walked over to them i think we may have caught a break but were going to need some real muscle in there lets get to it then said harvath he took a step forward but gretchen put her hand against his chest and stopped him not your kind of muscle prince charming she said turning to look at ashford his chapter once casey explained what she wanted and why she believed the café manager not only had it but was lying to her about it bob ashford went straight inside and turned the womans world upside down law enforcement in the uk had exceptional powers to deal with terrorism ashford also had an incredibly powerful personality he had a way of being polite yet terrifying all at the same time he left no room for argument and was very clear about what would happen to the manager if she didnt cooperate immediately when he asked her for identification and began to question her about any past difficulties she might have caused for police her tough facade crumbled within minutes she had not only confessed to the cafés keystrokelogging program but had explained how it worked and had blamed it all on the cafés owner casey had been right the café not only spied on its customers it probably trafficked in their personal data as well without an iron key very few people were safe anywhere ashford didnt much care about what the café did with its other customers data what he wanted was what the man they had apprehended outside had typed into his computer the manager pulled up the information for the terminal and printed out all of the mans keystrokes unfortunately there werent very many he had logged on to his skype account searched for another skype user named jamal and made one call before leaving the café and being taken down casey sat down and pulled the mans skype account back up but he had deleted everything i just did a search for any accounts with the name jamal she said and asked harvath and theres so many skype doesnt even list them all without knowing which dropdown menus he clicked to focus his search we wont be able to zero in on him what about going to skype directly said ashford they have london offices you can try but theyre not going to do anything other than talk to you without a judges order harvath removed one of his cell phones and sent a text message to nicholas moments later a response came back yes the israelis are rumored to have already cracked it excusing himself harvath stepped outside and called the old man did you get him carlton asked when he picked up his phone we did he ran sdrs for about an hour and then slipped into an internet café where he made a skype call do we know who he called no all we know is that it was another skype user named jamal the brits can lean on skype via their offices here but that could take a while word on the street is that the israelis have cracked skype a few months ago im told said the old man but you have to give me more than somebody named jamal who received a skype call within the last hour how about our guys username and password thats better harvath rattled off the information and carlton told him hed reach out to some friends he had in tel aviv and get back to him as soon as possible when he stepped back inside ashford was bagging the keyboard and headset as evidence he then asked rhodes to email the recording she had made so he could see if there was a voiceprint of the man on file somewhere those tasks complete he looked at harvath its your call what do you want to do now where are you doing the interrogations at a lovely country estate outside the city said the mi man why you want to watch them i thought interrogations made you squeamish only if i dont wait at least a half hour after eating before jumping into one ashford smiled as his phone vibrated he removed it from his pocket unwrapped the earbuds and read the text message that had just come in if were done here ive got transport for us outside harvath looked at casey are we done the athena team leader nodded were all good outside there were two passenger vans waiting ashford turned to harvath with a suggestion why dont you and your team get something to eat ive assigned two of my best men to you they were both royal marines whatever you want theyll see to it where are you going im going to drop the evidence at my office and then pay an unannounced visit to the skype people over on lexington street i want to come with you to skype the mi man pointed over his shoulder this was just a warmup if i encounter resistance from skype that visit is going to be considerably more unpleasant i can probably help bring some pressure to bear i dont doubt it he said putting his hand on the younger mans shoulder you and peaches do seem to have a very similar approach neither of you ever take no for an answer harvath was flattered to be compared to the old man ashford looked at him in my country the fact that i have to order you to take five very attractive ladies to lunch would be grounds for immediate dismissal what about amsterdam lets worry about skype first without that there is no amsterdam he said as he removed his hand from harvaths shoulder relax and eat with your team ill let you know what happens at skype and if we somehow get a break in the interrogations ill call you immediately youve got all my numbers right yes said ashford as he walked toward his vehicle dont worry harvath watched as ashford climbed into the numberone van and it pulled away a tall wellbuilt man in his early thirties dressed in a sharp blue suit and perfectly polished shoes stepped out of the remaining vehicle and walked over to harvath he stuck out his hand and said my name is bloom commander ashford has instructed us to take care of you they had gone from one hundred miles per hour to five and harvath hated it allaheadstop was not a maneuver he was fond of he didnt know how to channel his energy if he wasnt careful it could wind up as anger he shook the mans hand and tried to be nice youre aware that the situation were in is still active correct yes sir the commander briefed us the brits were so damn professional and polite i guess we need to eat he said and then added someplace where we can keep the vehicle close in case we have to move quickly understood sir it would also be nice if we could eat someplace where were not going to stick out and the ladies wont be bothered absolutely sir once the team was in the van bloom and his colleague michaels took the team to number herbert crescent it was an unremarkable victorian building behind harrods department store in knightsbridge it was perfect and harvath had no doubt that ashford had made the reservations himself there was no name plaque on the shiny black door only a brass lion knocker with a buzzer recessed into the frame up above a camera recorded the comings and goings of guests bloom pressed the doorbell and when the door clicked open ushered his charges inside standing in the small carpeted foyer was a welldressed man cradling an mp they had just entered londons special forces club harvaths suspicion that the lunch had been put together by ashford was confirmed by the fact that there was already a table waiting for them under bobs name the clubs membership was open to anyone who had a clandestine role in or out of uniform its motto was spirit of resistance simply put it was the private club for current and former secret agents special forces operatives mi mi and cia officers in london they were led to a large table in the dining room after they were seated menus were passed around and the days specials were explained bloom and michaels sat at a table nearby none of the team felt they were dressed appropriately for a private club but none of the other members seemed to mind perhaps some of the more wily intelligence operatives suspected what kind of work their american guests were up to but if they did they didnt let on they were halfway through lunch when harvaths cell phone rang standing up he walked back down to the entry hall to take the call it was reed carlton the israelis broke the skype transaction for us youve got the regional controllers location where is he asked harvath london no replied carlton amsterdam chapter chicago abdul rashid rubbed the stubble on his cheeks and massaged his eyes with the heels of his hands as he poured more tea it had been a long night it was bad enough the two police officers had happened upon them but then the third man had come in through the alley door with his shotgun and the shooting had happened rashid had been forced to act quickly the first thing he had done was to call the police from one of his prepaid cell phones which he promptly disposed of afterward he reported shots fired but gave the location as four blocks away he also made up descriptions of the shooters the vehicles they were driving and the direction they were headed in though the building they used as a mosque was in a largely commercial area and the shots had been fired late at night there was still a chance that someone might have heard the exchange and reported it unless they were looking out a window onto the alley where it happened they wouldnt be able to give the police much more to go on than that they heard gunshots nearby by phoning in a believable account of a gangbanger shootout four blocks away rashid all but guaranteed where the police would focus their efforts that though would buy them only so much time the explosive compounds and all other incriminating materials had to be moved right away as well as the hostages without time to go fetch two of marwans trucks they had to use the vehicles of the cell members at the mosque pulling the vehicles into the alley they loaded them as quickly as possible rashid personally kept watch for any other surprise visitors once the vehicles had departed he had one of his men follow him in the police officers bronco which he abandoned in a rough neighborhood several miles away with any luck it had been stolen within minutes it looked as if they had dodged a bullet the only remaining loose end to be tied up was the mosques imam whom marwan handled with a phone call should the police come to question him about anything he would simply tell the truth after the faithful had departed following the final prayers of the evening he had locked up the mosque and had gone home he knew better than to reveal that things were happening in the basement if the police wanted to look around he was instructed to accommodate them there was no incriminating evidence anywhere in the building so far the police hadnt showed up rashid doubted they would for the time being they were still safe or so he had thought the timetable must be changed marwan said as rashid brought over tea for their guest we should not speak in front of him the guest responded in arabic slicing one of his hooks through the air as if physically cutting off the conversation his name was aazim aleem he was british by birth and had fought against the soviets in afghanistan it was there that he had both hands blown off allegedly trying to deactivate a landmine close to a school only the truly naive believed the story in truth he had lost both of his hands when a bomb he was building prematurely detonated rashid had met him once before in pakistan while he was travelling with marwan aleem was a respected islamic scholar who had studied at egypts prestigious alazhar university in cairo he was famous for his writings about jihad as well as his sermons the audio recordings of which were disseminated throughout the islamic world and across the internet he was known as the mufti of jihad but he never made any public appearances very few knew his true identity not even british or american intelligence agencies knew who he was back in the uk the man lived on a full disability pension paid for by the same government he plotted against and deeply desired to overthrow rashid had been surprised to see aleem at the mosque it was completely unexpected and happening so close to his cell going operational he was quite sure that it wasnt a coincidence he set down the tea and said i understand arabic like an angry sea crab aleem leaned forward and snapped his hooks at him you are not one of us he hissed in english rashid looked at marwan im confused sheik aleem grew up in the uk he speaks better english than i do and yet hes got trust issues with me you were not a mujihadeen who fought against the soviets with all due respect replied rashid as he looked at aleem the jihad against the soviets is over he pointed at his chest for emphasis i represent the current jihad the one that is actually being waged right now aleem smiled and addressed marwan he doesnt know his place very well but he is passionate marwan jarrah held his hand out to calm his protégé you will show our guest the respect he deserves shahab rashid did as he was told i apologize you are able to temper your passion noted aleem that is important important for what weve had a change of plans said marwan rashid looked at their guest and then back to his boss so sheik aleem is involved in our struggle aleem laughed i have been involved in this struggle since before you were born boy yes said marwan hes involved there has been a problem in europe what does europe have to do with us he has much to learn replied aleem rashid was tempted to give the hookhanded old man a piece of his mind but held his tongue so we are working in concert with the brothers in europe marwan nodded you could have told me the need for compartmentalization has always been greater than your need to know so why are you telling me now because you are being promoted said aleem as he raised one of his hooks and mimicking rashid jabbed himself in the chest for emphasis because while you may represent the current jihad i am the one who orchestrates it rashid didnt respond smile continued aleem allah has just called you for something very special chapter amsterdam my name is anneke van den heuvel said a tall uniformed woman with curly hair who met the team when they stepped off the plane are you transporting any weapons there was no hello or welcome to the netherlands not even a thank you for trying to help us head off a major terrorist attack instead the womans only concern was if they were bringing weapons into her country were not carrying any weapons replied harvath not yet at least nikki rodriguez added quietly from behind him harvath had been informed that bringing in weapons would only slow the team down good the woman said as she motioned the team to follow her into the terminal first we will proceed through passport control and then customs there are two flights that have just landed so i suggest we move quickly in order to gain the advantage of the queue gain the advantage of the queue commented cooper how about some professional courtesy and we skip the queue altogether is there a problem the woman asked casey held up her hand to silence her team we require all police officers to file certain paperwork upon arrival to the netherlands well were not police said harvath thats not what i was told our trip has been cleared by the he continued but he was cut off if you are not police officers then we have a problem we are working for the american government do you have any government identification no replied harvath trying to melt the ice around her a bit with his tone our group is not issued id cards if you are not police and you do not have proper identification from your government we will need to get this straightened out have a seat please she said pointing to a row of orange plastic chairs bolted to the gray tile floor harvath tried to explain but she turned her back on him raised her radio to her mouth and began speaking to someone in dutch casey stepped over to harvath and said the religion of peace is going to blow up their city in a matter of hours and shes jerking us around on entry requirements i thought you had this handled harvath was just as angry as she was dont worry about it he said removing his cell phone he scrolled to a number in his address book and sent a quick text an immigration officer is holding us up where r u a couple of seconds later his phone vibrated with a response look up coming down the hallway were three men all well over six feet tall the men on the left and right were blondhaired and blueeyed while the man in the middle who was sliding his cell phone back into his pocket had a shaved head and narrow dark eyes like a hawk they looked like three rugby captains walking out onto the fieldif rugby captains wore italian suits polished shoes and secret service earpieces the man on the left idd van den heuvel as the reason for the holdup and went straight for her though neither harvath nor the athena team spoke dutch they got the gist of the serious dressing down he gave her with van den heuvel incapacitated the bald man came over and shook harvaths hand im sorry were late there have been a few developments since we last talked we have cars waiting outside as they were whisked through immigration and customs harvath introduced martin de roon of the aivd to casey and the rest of the team aivd was the acronym for the netherlands general intelligence and security service the algemene inlichtingen en veiligheidsdienst which was charged with combating both domestic and international threats to national security after the murder of theo van gogh and the discovery of the muslim hofstad network aivd had become particularly focused on the islamic fundamentalist threat to dutch society the two blond men fell to either side of the group their heads on swivels as harvath and de roon took the lead martin swept an id through a card reader pushed open a fire door and led them all up a short flight of stairs opening another door they found themselves outside parked in front of them were three armored brabus sv r mercedesbenz ss recognized as the fastest sedans in the world they were all black with deeply tinted windows did our mutual friend send these for me asked harvath de roon smiled and shook his head members of parliament do not drive armored mercedes not even mr wilders these belong to the queen harvath and casey climbed into the back of the first mercedes cooper and ericsson got into the second and rhodes and rodriguez the third de roon was sitting in the front passenger seat the car was so quiet it was like being in a bank vault once the convoy was ready to roll de roon raised his sleeve mic to his mouth and gave the command to his drivers to move out as the convoy sped out of the airport harvath asked what have you learned about the target the dutch intelligence officer prepared his driver and then told the rest of the team over the radio to move two lanes he then turned around in his seat to address harvath the target is an accountant named khalil alyaqoubi with no record of any sort the only thing we could find out about him is that he does the books for one of the most radical mosques in holland he answered the skype call from london in his office is he still there de roon nodded he is we have a surveillance team on him we also have active surveillance on his apartment as well as the mosque how close together are the locations its all the same neighborhood but its an sua sua said casey its dhimmispeak for sensitive urban area replied harvath de roon looked at her its actually euspeak but scots essentially right the subject operates in an allmuslim neighborhood so what its still part of the city of amsterdam isnt it technically yes but the police wont go there well as we stated upon arrival were not the police and just so you know theres no place my team is afraid to go into harvath met de roons eyes theyre the ones who took down the mosque in london then maybe she should be in charge casey held up her hand this is scots operation do you know what a klootzak is he asked her no i dont thats what we call men like him here in holland harvath gave de roon the finger see said the dutchman thats the behavior of a klootzak they always want the most dangerous assignments and if youre not ready to move when they are they leave without you i think youre referring to what we call a cowboy i suppose you could call him a cowboy but klootzak is more offensive and more accurate therefore he is a klootzak casey looked at de roon do you two have some sort of history i need to know about it all started when marty placed an ad in the village voice began harvath im not talking to you she said cutting him off i dont like to think about it de roon replied harvath smiled it hurts that your boss liked me more than you he was not my boss he was my protectee who are we talking about asked casey geert wilders answered de roon hes a member of the dutch parliament scot helped us with some trouble he was having casey looked at harvath what kind of trouble do you know who mr wilders is he asked his name is familiar he produced the movie fitna caseys eyebrows went up the one the muslims went nuts over harvath nodded i watched it on the internet and never understood the outrage didnt it show scenes of muslim terrorism alongside passages from the quran that call for violence against nonmuslims it did said de roon mr wilders was holding a mirror up to the muslim community worldwide and exposing their hypocrisy they riot over cartoons of mohammed but are silent when muslim terror attacks happen and so they want to kill him over a movie that simply shows the truth the man nodded as if to say i know its ridiculous the hypocrisy is completely lost on them remember islam is a religion of peace and if you say it isnt theyll kill you so you met through wilders geert was speaking at an event in new york city to raise awareness about islamic fundamentalism said harvath there were several other bigname speakers at the event like robert spencer and former dutch member of parliament ayaan hirsi ali a group of bloggers at a site called the jawa report which specializes in taking down islamist web sites uncovered a terror plot against the event i knew several of the security people involved and when they learned of the threat they asked me to come in and consult and was there actually an attempt on the event yes but we stopped it he means that he stopped it said de roon casey looked at harvath is that true some radical american muslim wounded two police officers and three hotel security guards trying to get into the ballroom the man was not only heavily armed he was also wearing a bomb vest he would have killed all of the presenters and many of the attendees if scot hadnt killed him first i got lucky replied harvath you can say that again replied de roon if i had snuck out of the ballroom looking for a red bull maybe i would have been in the right place at the right time too so thats how you two know each other harvath nodded marty invited me to come over and do some training with his unit dumbest thing i ever did said de roon why asked casey because said harvath when the powers that be saw how good he was he got promoted he went from being a special police officer protecting people like geert and the royal family to aivd where he now gets to deal with muslim whack jobs on a daily basis and unfortunately today is no different added de roon we need to decide what were going to do scot glanced at his watch the attack is supposed to happen during the evening rush so well have to take him at his office describe it to me de roon pulled up the file on his blackberry and rattled off the salient details the office is on the ground floor of a threestory building plate glass windows no rear exit how many people working there besides alyaqoubi three men do we have histories on them no theyre all clean ages asked harvath alyaqoubi is fortyfive and the three other men are forty fortythree and fiftyfive and we have no idea if they have any role in this or not no we dont they could be cell members or function in some other capacity within the network which means that if we grab him were probably going to have to grab them too said harvath unless being an accountant is alyaqoubis legitimate cover and these men know nothing about his terrorist activities but with no way of knowing we have to assume that theyre involved if their firm does the books for the most radical mosque in amsterdam we can guess where their sympathies probably lie thats true replied de roon is there anything covering the windows asked harvath shutters blinds no any other rooms from what we can tell theres a storeroom of some sort and a toilet thats all the entire office is in full view of the street which is a big problem the dutch intelligence officer nodded keep in mind that if were going to grab all the men in the office we have to be in and out in less than a minute any longer than that and it wont happen why can the locals organize a riot that fast they can theyre experts at it believe me how do we transport them asked harvath we can use the van and my agents who are surveilling the office now since we cant conduct the interrogation at the accounting office whats our alternative de roon pulled up a picture on his blackberry and turned it around to show harvath theres a liberian freighter in the port we arrested the crew two days ago for smuggling i have two men there now youll have the whole ship to yourself how long will it take to get there ten or fifteen minutes depending on traffic thats too long what do you have closer for the kind of interrogating youre going to want to do thats it harvath let that sink in our larger problem is that with no back door were not going to be able to get them out of the office and into the van without people seeing it happen exactly and word travels fast in the muslim neighborhoods harvath was frustrated no matter how he spun it in his head he couldnt come up with the right way to conduct the snatch casey had already given up on forcefully taking alyaqoubi from his office can we draw him out she asked what are his pressure points is he married does he have kids de roon scrolled through the file and read he is a dutch citizen of moroccan extraction rabat to be exact according to our records he has three wives and eleven children but despite the fact that they receive dutch social assistance wait a second said harvath this guy is an accountant and his family receives welfare the intelligence man shook his head the system has a lot of problems including the fact that we cannot find any proof of current residency for the family none no we have no dutch medical dutch school or dutch employment records for any of them which means theyre probably back in morocco that gave casey an idea do we have full names and dates of birth for the family she asked as she removed her cell phone de roon pulled it up and handed his blackberry to her what are you doing asked harvath casey highlighted a number in her address book and activated the call button i know a few people in the moroccan secret police she replied if thats where this guys family is we might not have to walk into his office at all chapter martin de roon ordered the other two vehicles to hang back the less attention they drew to themselves the better one blackedout mercedes cruising through one of amsterdams worst muslim ghettos was more than enough there are two pistols in the armrest between you he said casey opened it and harvath fished out a pair of sigsauer ps and an extra magazine for each it goes without saying that you didnt get those weapons from us understood replied harvath as he handed casey a pistol and a spare magazine have you heard anything back from morocco she checked her phone again theyre approaching the house thats all i know harvath glanced at his watch they were running out of time whats plan b if the house is empty we create a distraction on the next block said de roon something big something that will draw people out of houses and shops we pick a building and send in fire trucks and ambulances we send them in fast and loud we make police go in and set up barricades to hold people back as soon as the crowds begin to gather and enough people have gone to see what is happening we pull up in the van and grab alyaqoubi and the other men in the office how quickly could you get all of those emergency responders there asked harvath it would only take a matter of minutes i dont think thats going to be necessary said casey as she read the message that had just come across her phone two of alyaqoubis wives and several of the children are apparently at the rabat house my dst contact wants to know how he should proceed tell him to take the house roger that replied casey who called her contact in moroccos secret police formally known as the direction de la securité du territoire or dst above a wooded gorge south of rabats diplomatic district at ain aouda the united states had helped morocco build an interrogation and detention facility for its alqaeda suspects it was run by the moroccan dst and gretchen casey had participated in several interrogations there over the last two years she put the call on speaker phone so harvath and de roon could listen in to the takedown commands were issued in arabic as men could be heard jumping out of cars and pounding on a door in typical arab fashion a woman could be heard arguing with the men and when that didnt work she slipped into sobbing hysterics claiming she didnt know anyone named khalil alyaqoubi finally the dst man in rabat told casey they were ready to make the call how close are we she asked de roon four blocks less than two minutes out he replied proceed to the target the intelligence officer nodded and instructed his operative to take the next left they stopped there and waited for the second mercedes when de roons operative had gotten out he retrieved several items from the trunk and then slid behind the wheel casey joined him up front while harvath remained in the backseat when they were half a block away from the target casey told her contact in rabat to make the call they pulled up in front of the accounting office just as the phone began to ring the dst operative had called from inside the house in rabat casey could hear everything from his end including when he put alyaqoubis wife and then one of his children on the phone the instructions were very clear the dst operative told alyaqoubi to look out the window when the accountant confirmed that the black mercedes had just pulled up the dst man told him to stand and without saying a word hang up the phone and exit the office if he was seen to utter even a single syllable his family would be killed it was a despicable tactic but one harvath had learned long ago to accept in the war against islamic fundamentalists often the only tie greater than the tie to their god was their tie to their families especially when children were involved it made harvath wonder if maybe he was actually better off without children himself maybe tracy had been doing him a favor he could only imagine how horrifically gutwrenching it would be to be on alyaqoubis end of the phone right now they watched as alyaqoubi hung up the receiver stood up from his desk and exited the office the team in the surveillance van watched and confirmed that he had not spoken a word to his confused colleagues walking up to the mercedes he opened the door and got in harvath pointed the sigsauer at his chest and told him in arabic to sit down the man did so close the door alyaqoubi complied harvath looked at de roon and said drive who are you what have you done to my family the man demanded in english he was far from being frightened in fact he was indignant how do we stop the attack i dont know what you are talking about de roon said the surveillance team says the men in the office seem confused they are all standing at the window trying to figure out what just happened should the men go in and get them or do you want our guest to make the call this was where harvath was going to have to take a gamble if the men in the office were in on the plot alyaqoubis sudden departure might seem odd but they would likely rationalize that something had come up that he needed to take care of right away as far as they would have been able to tell he had left of his own free will besides he had climbed into a mercedes not a police car while indeed unusual and while it may have put them in a state of unease it wouldnt have been enough to cause them to ring any alarm bells not yet harvath decided to leave them in the office tell your team to keep watching and to let us know if any of them pick up a landline or cell phone understood said de roon as he radioed the orders to his team how do we stop the attack harvath repeated to their passenger i want to know what you have done to my family the man demanded once more harvath nodded at casey who brought de roons taser up over her seat aimed it at alyaqoubis torso and pulled the trigger instantly he cried out and his body seized as if hed been overcome by rigor mortis harvath waited until it was safe and after tucking his weapon into his waistband zipped the mans wrists together behind his back with a pair of flex cuffs pushing him back in his seat he patted him down and removed the mans cell phone keys and pocket litter which he set in a pile on the floor how long until were there he asked fifteen minutes replied de roon harvath looked at his watch we dont have that kind of time were going to have to interrogate him here he wrapped alyaqoubis ankles with duct tape and then took the taser from casey catching de roons eyes in the rearview mirror he said no matter what happens do what i say and dont stop driving chapter you tell me how i stop this attack said harvath who knew the fear that moroccans had of their countrys secret police or i will tell the dst to begin torturing your family in rabat there was a flash of anger across alyaqoubis face he looked like he was about to spit at him so harvath pulled his fist back and broke the mans nose there was a crack of cartilage followed by a gush of blood that poured down the front of his shirt well start with your children said harvath i dont believe you spat alyaqoubi your country and your president forbid you from torture harvath smiled thats what you think thats what i know let me disabuse you of that notion right now said harvath as he told de roon speed up and do not slow down he then slammed his fist into the accountants stomach and shoved the man doubled over onto the floor of the backseat reaching for the heavy armored door he opened it and forced alyaquobis legs outside faster he ordered de roon the intelligence operative complied as harvath bent down and yelled into the accountants ear so he could hear over the rush of the wind whipping past them when i let go of this door itll pin your legs against the sill when that happens your knees will be forced to bend and your feet will begin dragging along the pavement at this speed your shoes will be burned through in a matter of seconds your socks will go even faster then the flesh from your feet will be ground away the road underneath this car will eat through sinew and grind down your bones the pain will be like nothing you have ever known when i pull you back in both of your feet will have been eaten away you will beg me to kill you you cannot torture me the geneva and hague conventions forbid it those treaties prevent me from torturing lawful combatants youre a terrorist this is your last chance khalil this time the man was able to spit before harvath could stop him he caught it in the face and it was full of blood he let the door go they all knew when alyaqoubis shoes and socks had been burned away because the man began screaming harvath pushed the door open just enough to pull him back inside his feet looked like hamburger how do we stop the attack tell me alyaqoubis head lolled to one side and his eyes rolled up in their sockets oh no you dont motherfucker said harvath as he juiced him with the taser again the accountants body went rigid and he screamed even louder this time once harvath could get him to focus he said to casey tell the team in rabat to start with his youngest child make sure the family and in particular the children know that this is happening because their father doesnt care about them casey relayed the orders over her cell phone and then placed it on speaker phone and pointed it toward the backseat so alyaqoubi could hear the dst operator addressing his family in rabat the children immediately began sobbing and their mothers screamed at the news that they were to be held responsible for alyaqoubis crimes harvath watched as the man began to sob he was breaking harvath leaned in to rub salt in the gaping wound that had been torn inside him after the dst is done with them your familys nightmare will only get worse the accountant looked at him as if to say how could it get worse we will make it known to alqaeda that you are a traitor and that you gave up the london cell well then let them know where to find your family harvath let that sink in before adding the dst is very creative but alqaeda is going to come up with things for your family that no one has ever heard of before they will make an example out of them that no one will forget the tears were openly running down alyaqoubis bloody face you can stop all of this right now said harvath your family will be spared the man didnt reply harvath looked back at casey who had withdrawn her blackberry khalil would like the dst to start torturing his family but make sure to let them know that they are to leave them as close to alive as possible so that alqaeda gets their turn as casey took her phone off speaker and lifted it to her ear alyaqoubi yelled from the backseat no no what replied harvath i will tell you what you want to know how do we stop the attack alyaqoubi started shaking he was slipping into shock harvath slapped him to get his attention where is the attack going to take place the red light district youre lying im not pleaded alyaqoubi we know the target is dam square said harvath that was before london was interrupted what time sometime before midnight i dont know exactly when how do we stop it the accountants shivering increased how do we stop it harvath repeated you cant bullshit how are they planning to attack alyaqoubis eyes were unfocused and when he failed to respond harvath slapped him again and repeated his question explosive vests the accountant stammered not bicycles after london everything was changed do the men have cell phones can they be recalled the only phones are on the explosives they are carrying they are in their final stage and are not supposed to have contact with each other or anyone else chicken switches thought harvath just like london he believed alyaqoubi was telling him the truth it also made sense you wouldnt want your martyrs reaching out to a girlfriend or family member at the last minute only to have that bring about a change of heart someone will be watching them to make sure they carry out the operation correct the accountant nodded his pupils beginning to dilate where will he be positioned i dont know what about the bombers where will they be de wallen he mumbled harvath looked up at de roon i know it said the intelligence operative but its only a general district he needs to be more specific harvath shifted his attention back to alyaqoubi who was decompensating his pulse was rapid and thready his skin cool and clammy to the touch they were going to lose him harvath tried slapping him again but it had no effect he yelled into the mans ear and knuckled his sternum without any success hes crashing he needs medical attention if we take him to a hospital your interrogation is over said de roon if we dont hes going to die youre a seal you have experience with battlefield medicine cant you stabilize him with what asked harvath looking around duct tape de roon slammed on his brakes and pulled to the shoulder as he leapt from the car he yelled for casey to climb into the backseat to assist he removed a trauma bag from the trunk and tossed it to harvath as he got back in the car put it in gear and peeled back out harvath quickly unzipped the bag and emptied out its contents it was full of quikclots israeli bandages and other odds and ends this isnt enough this will only help me stop the bleeding at the very least hes going to need an iv and painkillers alyaqoubi had been laid across the backseat casey found a reflective space blanket in the supplies and opened it up and laid it across him while harvath began to tend to his wounds if you had those supplies could you stabilize him im not a doctor but could you do it probably the answer seemed to satisfy de roon who began issuing orders over his radio as he put his foot down even harder on the accelerator chapter the rusting liberianregistered freighter was called the sacleipea and had the filthiest infirmary harvath had ever seen nevertheless it was well stocked and de roons men had everything harvath had asked for ready and waiting when they carried khalil alyaqoubi in casey helped get an iv going and began administering pain meds while harvath plucked as much road debris from the accountants shredded feet as possible once he had cleaned and rebandaged the mans wounds he taped up his nose and gave him a dose of antibiotics to begin fighting any potential infection harvath opened a package of smelling salts and waved it under alyaqoubis nose until he came to the man shook his head violently to get away from the odor but soon opened his eyes he tried to move his arms but they were flexcuffed to the infirmary gurney where am i not nearly close enough to save your family said harvath as he tossed away the salts i told you everything harvath was in no mood to argue how many bombers are there six plus one making sure they detonate correct yes i want physical descriptions of all of them i also want to know where the bombs were assembled and how the accountant nodded his assent and khalil said harvath locking eyes with the man the descriptions you give me had better be perfect if we are unable to stop them if even one bomb goes off your family is as good as dead alyaqoubis bombers had picked one of the most densely packed tourist areas in amsterdam de wallen was the most popular redlight district and was located in the heart of the oldest part of the city it was a network of alleys and small streets crisscrossing several blocks and canals south of the oude kerk scantily clad women midgets hermaphrodites and transvestites offered themselves from behind large windows or glass doors often accompanied by a red light the prostitutes places of business were often interspersed with sex shops peep shows hash bars and livesex theaters tourists gawked at the women but for the most part kept moving the challenge for harvath and martin de roon was how to field their teams dutch law enforcement officials were similar to their american counterparts and were easy to spot by their physiques and demeanor regardless no one spent hours upon hours wending their way through de wallen it wasnt that big anyone who did so would be pegged as unusual and therefore suspect the last thing they wanted to do was tip their hand harvath came up with an idea to put four of martins youngest operatives in soccer jerseys they looked like athletes anyway and could convincingly pass themselves off as teammates out celebrating a win de roon thought it was a good idea and decided to okay it suggesting the men park themselves at one of the hash bars in the center of the redlight district he also agreed that since most people never looked up placing snipers out of sight along as many of the rooftops as possible was a good idea using small cameras to observe the streets below them they acted as extra eyes in the skies and wouldnt need to expose themselves unless they were ready to take a shot the positions for the last assets to be placed in were the hardest to decide upon while couples and bachelorette parties strolled through de wallen they kept moving and rarely passed the same location twice unless it was on their way home after a night out on the town casey didnt need to be asked she knew placing the athena team in the windows was the best way to watch the flow of people and they all volunteered all that needed to be decided was which windows they would take once harvath and martin had identified the best possible locations de roon contacted a cop he knew and trusted who dealt with the redlight district and explained that he was running a very quiet sting the occupants of the windows in question were paid a hefty sum of cash from harvaths funds and given the night off everything was ready to go except for one thing the athena team members were probably some of the most attractive prostitutes the redlight district had ever seen before the operation could begin they needed to figure out a means by which to dissuade potential customers from bothering them the plan they came up with actually helped distribute their remaining operatives operatives including harvath and de roon were placed out of sight with each of the women if a potential suitor approached and wanted to arrange for her services each operative would say that he had bought her for the night and to take a hike in addition they would also be wearing the same soccer jerseys if someone did hit up all five women theyd be left thinking some soccer team or hooligan fan club had taken over the best talent in the district and hopefully move on with positioning out of the way harvath was left to reflect on the men they were looking for alyaqoubi had been quite ingenious instead of recruiting arab muslims for his attack he had recruited indonesians indonesia was the most populous muslim country in the world and had once been a dutch colony people of indonesian descent could be found throughout the netherlands they had largely assimilated themselves into the culture and werent considered threatening unlike their arab brethren they also could move through the redlight district even during a time of heightened anxiety and security without drawing attention to themselves alyaqoubi was in bad shape and it was a fight to keep him conscious he could only give rough descriptions of the men they were of average height with dark hair and eyes all in their mid twenties he had no idea how they would be dressed except to say that they would have to employ some means to cover their bomb vests the cells controller was in his late thirties and also indonesian he had a thick white scar behind his left ear from a motorcycle accident in his youth the accountant only knew the bombers by their muslim names and not their given names under which they lived their dutch lives he did though know the controllers given name joost moerdani it was all they got out of him before he slipped back into unconsciousness with that information martin had been able to pull the mans drivers license and passport photos everyone including the plainclothes police that had been brought in to form a covert ring around the redlight district knew what he looked like if he was spotted everyone had been given strict orders not to take him down they were to report his location and attempt to keep him under surveillance it was a warm night and harvath hoped that would help them spot their suicide bombers indonesian men wearing sweatshirts sweaters jackets or bulky shirts would get very special attention once a potential bomber was idd the nearest team members would go to work posing as a tourist taking video of the redlight district with a camera phone one member would try to get the mans picture while the other would track him the picture would be sent to de roons men on the sacleipea if alyaqoubi was awake then he would be shown the picture to help confirm identification if he wasnt awake they were going to be in a lot of trouble assuming alyaqoubi would be able to id the bombers the rules of engagement became very clear the target needed to be taken out the only question was how to do it without starting a panic that would send tourists screaming de roons men had come up with a solution that showed strong faith in their snipers when the sniper was ready to take his shot the aivd team tailing the target would close ranks come up right behind him and catch him as he was being neutralized harvath didnt like it there was too much that could go wrong if the bombers were walking around buttoned down with a deadman switch the minute they released their trigger their device would explode there was still a chance that any interdiction could happen within sight of the controller who would then activate the device remotely according to alyaqoubi the cell phone detonators were sewn into each vest in the back it wouldnt be easy to get them out and deactivate them therefore neutralizing the controller was an integral part of their plan despite all of the risks martins men wanted to go ahead with the operation harvath had a tremendous amount of respect for them they were a tribute to law enforcement officers the world over the evening progressed and the crowds of tourists in de wallen grew heavier harvath had been paired with nikki rodriguez who was wearing a lace bra matching panties a garter belt with stockings and a pair of high heels are you getting a good eyeful from there she asked harvath im not looking at you he said im watching the street yeah sure you are hows my ass look he was used to inappropriate banter in tense situations but normally it was with men not a very attractive halfnaked woman ive seen better he replied youre a liar no offense rodriguez but youre not my type what a hotlooking woman in peak physical fitness turns you off she asked honey you can come look i dont have an adams apple harvath chuckled im the navy man remember ive been to some pretty interesting ports of call if you had an adams apple i guarantee you i would have spotted it from a mile away so were agreed im all woman absolutely said harvath just like my fiancée rodriguez shook her head i knew it sorry just tell me she isnt a goat shes not a goat said harvath with a smile but the smile quickly faded from his face look do you see that guy out the window where ten oclock rodriguez looked and when she did harvath could hear her draw in her breath the man was going to pass right beneath her window harvath activated his radio identified himself and said player one has entered the game chapter chicago i dont get it marwan are you trying to tell me that you trust him more than you trust me asked abdul rashid it is not a question of trust shahab replied the older man it is a question of loyalty they were sitting in the lobby of the chicago marriott on michigan avenue rashid was drinking a coffee marwan a diet coke so what are you saying that i should swear allegiance to aazim aleem as long as you are loyal to me thats all i care about how do we make sure we dont repeat the mistakes that the brothers in europe have made thats not something you need to be concerned about said the older man rashid set his coffee down and leaned forward i dont even know what our plans are after chicago and youre not supposed to know it is for my own good and the good of the operation said rashid finishing the mans sentence for him as long as you follow my orders everything will go according to plan and whose orders do you follow aleems im not exactly comfortable with the fact that he may be our supreme leader dont concern yourself with matters beyond your control rashid glanced around to make sure no one was listening to them before continuing marwan look at us weve spent half the day surveilling hotel lobbies do you have any idea how crazy this is circumstances have dictated that we change our methods circumstances what circumstances marwan took a sip of his diet coke and looked at his watch you will know this afternoon whats happening this afternoon inshaallah the final attack in europe then it will be our turn the young man lowered his voice can i speak honestly with you marwan i should hope you always do rashid smiled and bowed his head always but i am concerned ive told you that you worry too much maybe but you made me operational director of the chicago event i helped train the recruits and do the planning now you and sheik aleem want to throw all of our planning and all of our training out the window that worries me it shouldnt replied jarrah but it does we have this operation perfectly planned everything then all of a sudden you want to switch us to a mumbaistyle event straying from what is comfortable is often stressful marwan it would take us months to get our men properly trained we dont have months said the older man we only have two days excuse me you heard what i said rashid looked at him itll never work you must have faith there is great wisdom in what sheik aleem has suggested im sorry marwan the older man smiled and cut him off let me finish i have decided that the original event will continue as planned but marwan raised his hand to quiet his protégé again as a contingency and hopefully to strike even greater terror into the hearts of our enemies we will follow sheik aleems suggestion rashid shook his head sheik aleem wants you to be in charge of both i am honored the older man looked at him you should be but changing everything at the last minute will make success nearly impossible with faith in allah nothing is impossible of course replied rashid but where am i supposed to find men in two days with weapons experience who are willing to be shahid do you have faith in allah of course i do good for he has already provided you with everything you need rashids brow furrowed i dont understand allah has already given you six iraqi national guardsmen your thugs at the mosque they are not thugs they are exceptional instruments if wielded properly i thought they were just muscle you used for security the older man shook his head you should have told me about their backgrounds at the time you did not need to know now that you do know perhaps you will treat them with more respect rashid rubbed his mouth with the palm of his hand and said while were talking about respect lets talk about where i fit into the bigger picture one step at a time he replied as he changed the subject and gestured toward the second story of the atrium that overlooked the lobby where they now sat aleem has suggested the men work in three teams of two i think that is a good idea but two of your national guardsmen were shot last night remember they will be fine one of them we will put up there on the second floor to act as a sniper thats not really the plan is it were not just going to pick four hotels with the best fields of fire and turn the guardsmen loose are we why not anyone can walk into these hotels there is no security whatsoever our men only need to make it as far as the lobby maybe it was the fatigue that caused him to take a moment to catch on mumbai was a combination of bombings and shootings it turned the entire city upside down police fire ambulances none of them knew where to go it was mass chaos marwan smiled very good shahab i should have thought of that yes you should have you have been focused on the success the brothers had in bali and the bombings in london you must remember to always ask yourself how can we do better mumbai was definitely better rashid nodded so three teams means three hotels come shahab youre not thinking big enough this is chicago the hotels sit side by side the men will go from one hotel to another and then to another and another still as our bombs rip through the city the police will be overwhelmed and then what marwan removed a tendollar bill from his wallet and set it on the table you concentrate on succeeding in chicago the rest of the plan will take care of itself chapter amsterdam three hours ago harvath and de roon had almost come to blows in the infirmary of the sacleipea with alyaqoubi barely clinging to consciousness he had given them everything he could about the amsterdam bombing cell but harvath had wanted more he had wanted to know who the overall architect of the plot was what were the cities targeted for attack in the united states when and by whom how could they be stopped alyaqoubi had lost consciousness twice and both times harvath had brought him back around again with the salts the third time he lost consciousness though de roon had stepped in if harvath hadnt stopped he would have killed the man the accountant would have ceased being of use to anyone de roon needed him to be awake and alert enough to help id the bombers if they were lucky enough to spot them harvath had known his friend was right but he also knew that he couldnt stop until alyaqoubi gave them everything in the end caseys had been the voice of reason that had convinced harvath to back down the amsterdam attack had to be neutralized first the redlight district would be packed with americans thats where harvaths focus needed to be the accountant was cuffed to the bed of an infirmary of a confiscated ship in the dutch port its crew cooling its heels in a dutch jail cell alyaqoubi wasnt going anywhere this was their chance to see if he was really telling the truth if he was and they succeeded then they could return to the ship and take the interrogation to the next level she was right harvath had apologized to de roon who called him a klootzak and suggested they formulate their plan and get their people into position it had happened only three hours ago but in the wake of the adrenaline dump it felt like three days but now with fresh adrenaline pumping through his system all harvath could think about was taking out the bombers back at the ship alyaqoubi was awake and alert he had idd player one the man spotted by harvath as one of the cell members one of de roons teams was tracking him but they were in a shadow an area where none of the snipers could get a clean shot harvath had faith that the problem would soon remedy itself what bothered him though was that no one had idd the controller yet he was the wild card the one who could detonate the explosives remotely he needed to be found and neutralized immediately as harvath was trying to put himself inside the controllers mind his earpiece crackled with radio traffic one of martins men had been speaking in dutch and de roon quickly reminded him to speak english the operative apologized and repeated his transmission the soccer team at one of the hash bars had just spotted player two with that sighting the floodgates opened backtoback three more sightings were registeredindonesian men overdressed for the weather each one was confirmed that made five if alyaqoubi was telling the truth there was only one more left once the sixth bomber had entered de wallen the countdown would accelerate hidden from view in the back of the room harvath removed the map de roon had given him and plotted where the men had been spotted and the direction they were all moving he still had the same question wheres the controller as the targets were confirmed via cell phone from the sacleipea the snipers locked in and held ready they were all waiting for the final bomber to appear harvath was tense sitting back with rodriguez was driving him crazy that sixth bomber was going to show up any minute or worse any second they could no more wander around the redlight district aimlessly for hours without drawing attention to themselves than harvath and de roons teams could suddenly the sixth potential bomber was sighted two minutes later he was positively identified by alyaqoubi they were in the final stretch except for the controller moments later the snipers reported that the targets were all changing direction as harvath studied his map de roons voice came over his radio theyre all converging toward the center thats where the attack is going to happen hold on cautioned harvath as something rodriguez had said played through his mind we dont know that everyone stay calm he then told martin to meet him on the corner the athena team members wanted to get into the fight but harvath wasnt exactly sure this was over and asked them to remain in place what the hells wrong with you asked de roon when he met harvath at the corner and they both headed for the center of the district why didnt any of your people spot the controller outside de wallen maybe they didnt see him replied the intelligence officer or maybe thats not where he is said harvath maybe hes actually inside the district then why didnt our teams spot him because maybe they didnt know what theyre looking for de roon stared at him confused but harvath didnt have time to explain within seconds one of the bombers walked right past them the chill of death surrounding him was almost palpable did you see his hand asked harvath de roon nodded and radioed the others that the bomber they had just passed was holding a dead mans switch in his left hand okay said martin when they arrived at the center of the district the only point the bombers paths had intersected what are we looking for harvaths eyes scanned the area until they fell on one particular window her he said the intelligence officer looked but couldnt understand what harvath was talking about the ugly prostitute in the blue coverup harvath kept moving what do you think her nationality is who knows they all dye their hair blond look at her face he did but he still couldnt figure it out with all that makeup she could be palestinian or she could even be norwegian look at the eyes said harvath filipina how about indonesian de roon saw it you think thats the controller she he whatever is the only hooker in de wallen wearing a robe and a scarf in the middle of summer de roon understood that harvath meant it was probably a man trying to disguise himself as a woman and watched as the american pulled his pistol harvath kept the weapon hidden behind his leg as he approached the window the man inside had been gyrating to music that couldnt be heard out on the street he stopped as he noticed harvaths approach the subtle change in the mans demeanor wasnt lost on harvath he kept walking forward and said to de roon tell the snipers to get ready to fire either the man in the window was an incredible lip reader or he saw on harvaths face that his cover had been blown out of the blue he lunged for his purse and thats when harvath raised his pistol and fired the glass of the window erupted and people began screaming and running in every direction harvath took the steps up to the little private room two at a time and kicked the door open the figure with the scarf around its neck lay dead a pool of blood rolling across the sloped wooden floor toward the front of the room behind the mans left ear harvath saw a thick ropey white scar take them down harvath said over his radio take all of the bombers down now he looked up to locate de roon and as he did a burst of traffic came over the radio less than a second later an enormous detonation shook the entire redlight district as a roiling fireball exploded into the night sky chapter leaving de roons men to process the corpse and secure the scene harvath raced in the direction of the explosion what the hell happened he screamed over his radio one bomber detonated before we could take a shot a voice replied what about the others all neutralized harvath ran against a sea of people who were all fleeing the bombing klaxons wailed in the distance and a heavy pall of dust and smoke hung in the air it was like in miniature the force of the blast had shattered every window he passed shards of broken glass blanketed the street as he got closer he began to develop a sense of how bad the attack had been the walking wounded stumbled past him unsure of where to go knowing only that they had to get away they had to get out of the area then came the people who couldnt move they sat or lay near walls and despite the bravery of a few good samaritans there werent enough hands to administer aid so the wounded stayed where they were waiting for help many were crying and in extreme pain there was blood everywhere then came the bodies harvath had no idea how much explosive the bomber had been carrying but its impact was unbelievable it was one of the worst scenes of carnage harvath had ever witnessed the dead and dying were scattered everywhere some had even been tossed into the air and were hanging from signs or out of second and thirdstory windows the buildings were charred and the stench of burnt human flesh was overwhelming it took harvath a moment to get his bearings and when he did he was overcome with a sense of dread the bombing had happened almost directly in front of the window nikki rodriguez had been in he attempted to hail her over the radio as he rushed into what remained of the building its entire facade had been sheared away planting his feet he tried to raise a section of collapsed wall but it was too heavy he radioed de roon and told him to bring jacks and any earthmoving equipment he could get his hands on then he began to dig there were severed electrical wires and the scent of gas from ruptured lines harvath ignored all of it he lifted piece after piece of heavy stone shrapnel and twisted metal tore at his hands until they began to bleed but harvath kept on at some point casey arrived then ericsson rhodes and cooper de roon and three of his men materialized with a long iron pry bar they used a piece of rubble for a fulcrum and managed to raise part of the wall underneath harvath saw skin nikkis skin hitting the ground he slid beneath the wall and crawled toward her in the darkness he couldnt tell if she was alive or dead he had a flashlight in his pocket but the space was so tight he didnt have enough room to pull it out the claustrophobic darkness reminded him of the pit full of children he had crawled into nine days ago in iraq behind him harvath could hear de roon and his men grunting under the weight of the wall and yelling for casey and her operators to find something to help prop it up before it fell as he got closer harvath tried to talk to rodriguez but she didnt reply i need some light down here he shouted someone cast a flashlight into the narrow confines harvaths body blocked most of the light but he could just make out the side of nikkis head her hair was matted and covered with blood he strained his eyes to see if she was breathing but he couldnt tell as he inched forward the crawl space became smaller and smaller his legs and arms burned and he realized that it wasnt from the exertion but that he was worming his way across broken glass when he reached rodriguez he tried once more to get her to respond nikki he said can you hear me she still didnt reply and harvath silenced his own breathing to listen for hers de roon yelled for him to get out but harvath told him to be quiet he thought hed heard something when the voices behind him fell silent he cocked his head and didnt make a sound thats when he heard her breathe rodriguez was still alive ignoring the instability of the pile of debris he was crawling through he muscled his way forward when he got close enough he reached out and touched the side of her face he heard her groan in response we need to get you out of here nikki can you move rodriguez didnt respond scot de roon yelled you need to get out now we cannot hold the wall any longer leave her well try again you hold that goddamn wall harvath ordered as he reached for nikkis shoulders he had no idea what the extent of her injuries were and moving her went against all rescue protocols except for one saving someones life inching backward he gave a tug and pulled her toward him rodriguez screamed in pain and the sound tore right through him he tried not to think about it as he backed up and gave her another tug forward she screamed again but this time she didnt move please no thought harvath shes pinned they were close enough now that he could tell she was having trouble breathing her breath came in short shallow gasps and was becoming more rapid nikki he said can you move your legs the woman was unable to respond nikki listen to me i know it hurts but we need to get you out of here im going to count to three and when i do im going to pull as hard as i can if you have any ability to help me if you can push with your legs or twist your body in any way to get free you need to do it do you understand me rodriguez said nothing it didnt matter harvath knew what he had to do with his hands beneath her arms he inched his way back as far as he could without losing purchase and then counting to three he pulled there was a wrenching sound and then a snap which he prayed was the crack of dried wood from somewhere behind her in the rubble and not bone de roon yelled that they were losing the wall but harvath refused to let go of her he had her now they were moving it was slow inch by painful inch as if she was dragging some sort of incredibly heavy weight hurry damn it yelled de roon hurry harvaths entire body burned from the strain but they were almost free he continued to slide back a foot and pull slide back a foot and pull he had no idea how close he was to the end of the tunnel until he felt hands on his boots and then his legs helping to pull him back then there were hands on his belt pulling him hard de roon and his men grunted under the weight of the wall they were yelling and cursing for the others to hurry with harvath out there was only rodriguez left already the wall was beginning to fall harvath rolled away from the rubble pile as nikkis teammates reached in to pull her out as they did he saw a sharp piece of metal that had embedded itself in her right side the realization that the metal protruding from her chest had caused all the drag on her body as he struggled to extract her made him almost want to throw up then there was a shout from one of the athena team members of dont drop the wall and he realized how wrong he had been and how incredible nikki rodriguez was while harvath was pulling her out she was pulling out someone else a young woman who had been in the room next to her despite her injuries and the high probability that the rest of the building could have collapsed rodriguez had never let go with his last halfounce of adrenaline harvath leapt to his feet and helped de roons team hold the wall when the second woman was free they attempted to lower the wall as gently as possible but no one had the strength to see it all the way down it landed with a deafening crash which hastened more structural failure and sent them all scrambling from the building casey and cooper carried rodriguez while ericsson and rhodes helped the young prostitute from the room next door out on the street they began to administer first aid harvaths hands elbows and knees were bleeding but he was in much better shape than most of the people around him someone offered him a bottle of water after dousing his wounds he drained what was left and surveyed the devastation around him all of it from a single bomber though it would be no consolation to the families and loved ones of the dead it could have been it was supposed to have been much much worse he resolved to himself that no matter what he had to do he would not let this scene repeat itself in america calling de roon over he said give me your car keys the intelligence officer looked at him you cant drive like that i need to get back to alyaqoubi i need to finish his interrogation de roon looked over harvaths shoulder saw the first waves of dutch rescue personnel arriving on the scene and said ill drive and well finish it together chapter khalil alyaqoubi asked to speak to his family when harvath entered the sacleipeas infirmary he wanted assurances that they were still alive and that they had not been harmed the dst operative in rabat was caseys contact but casey had gone to the hospital with rodriguez while the other team members stayed at the scene to help treat the victims harvath couldnt have called the man if he wanted to not that it mattered alyaqoubi was in no position to ask for anything the deal is off khalil said harvath the moroccan didnt understand but i did everything you asked i told you the truth one of the bombs went off said de roon as he instructed his men to leave the infirmary you could have heard a pin drop as the heavy steel door slammed shut harvath unwound the bandage from the mans left foot what are you doing alyaqoubi demanded im going to make you pay for all of the people who died tonight then i am going to make you pay for all the people who died in paris then i am going to make you pay for rome picking up a forceps and scalpel he told de roon hold down his legs and began probing for the sural nerve it didnt take long to find it the terrorist screamed from the whitehot intensity of the pain after im done making you pay then well call your family and ill let you listen to them pay no alyaqoubi shouted i did everything you asked i will continue to do everything you ask harvath dug the forceps in again its too late khalil he shouted so he could be heard above the mans screaming i warned you what would happen if even one of those bombs went off the man was crying and begged harvath to stop i will do anything anything please de roon looked at harvath and he backed off i want to know who youre working for i dont know he stammered and harvath shoved the forceps back in alyaqoubis body went rigid and he arched his back so high it looked like his spine was about to snap tears were rolling down his face stop lying to me khalil the man was hyperventilating harvath drew back the forceps and waited for him to catch his breath last chance khalil who are you working for im telling you the truth i do not know harvath moved the forceps closer alqaeda the man yelled alqaeda we swore our oath to sheik osama you only say that because thats what you think i want to hear said harvath as he studied the mans face to discern whether or not he was telling the truth its true i swear to you tell me about site what replied alyaqoubi site i dont know what that is i have never heard of it what about the chinese i dont know any chinese harvath sensed he was telling the truth whoever had put this network together especially if it was the chinese would have used thirdparty nationals from top to bottom alyaqoubi probably believed he really was working for alqaeda the idea that his network had been assembled by china only to be hijacked by someone else would have been utterly incomprehensible to him harvath switched his line of questioning where did you train yemen and pakistan who do you report to who gives you your orders i dont know his real name harvath noticed a slight change in the mans expression and rammed the forceps back into his foot once again alyaqoubis body rose off the bed and writhed as he tried to escape the pain aleem he yelled aazim aleem ive never heard of him said harvath as he twisted the tool inside the mans foot like a fork into a plate of spaghetti alyaqoubi howled and had trouble catching his breath he he he preaches on the internet and on cds and cassette tapes they call him the mufti his voice trailed off the what harvath demanded the mufti of jihad that was a name harvath had heard of the man was a rock star to jihadists around the world he kept a very low profile and as far as harvath knew no one had ever been able to identify him harvath disengaged the forceps and slid them out of the mans foot the mufti of jihad is a ghost he said no one knows who he is why would he make his identity known to you it took a moment for alyaqoubi to respond because he and i were in the camps together he was my instructor he recruited me describe him to me the accountant strained at the wrists and remembered that he was tied down he was breathing heavily hands he has no hands only hooks why jihad afghanistan the man was slipping away again focus khalil harvath ordered where is he from dont know saudi arabia egypt what languages does he speak arabic and he said his voice trailing off and what when he didnt answer harvath slapped him what other language does he speak english very good english like an englishman does he live in england is that where hes based who else is involved harvath demanded tell me about america who is in charge of the attacks in america the accountant didnt answer and harvath knew he was on the verge of blacking out again he grabbed a package of smelling salts and looked at de roon the intelligence officer nodded he had no intention of getting in harvaths way this time harvath opened the salts and waved them under the terrorists nose alyaqoubi began coughing and his eyes started to normalize as he shook his head back and forth harvath tossed the salts aside and asked his question again who is in charge of the american attacks there is an iraqi sputtered alyaqoubi he is in charge of american operations whats his name how do i find him i dont know his name aleem was the only one i knew by name the rest of us used code names harvath doubted aleem was his real name he would have used a pseudonym as well the man in america said harvath as he raised the forceps again and hovered over the accountants foot whats his code name yusuf we called him yusuf what else do you know about him he is a businessman of some sort what kind of business i dont know harvath debated shoving the forceps back inside the mans foot but held back you said he was an iraqi how long has he been in the united states i dont know i am losing my patience khalil you dont seem to know much at all where in iraq is the man from fallujah he comes from a large family there how do you know iraqis like to brag about their families he had a cousin who was the local commander of the national guard he talked about him a lot he said that was how he was introduced to alqaeda harvath lowered the forceps what was his cousins name i cant remember try harder harvath shouted your familys life depends on it alyaqoubis pulse was pounding as he searched his brain for the name hadi halef i cant remember harvath looked at de roon call rabat tell the dst that khalil has been uncooperative and that they should begin hakim the accountant yelled the name rushing back to him his cousins name was omarhakim omarhakim was the iraqi national guard commander harvath had forced into helping him take down the alqaeda safe house outside fallujah the same safe house where the child hostages had been kept stunned harvath dropped the surgical instrument he was holding and ran from the infirmary bursting through one of the exterior bulkheads he began dialing the number for his contact in fallujah before he even had a fullstrength signal the call failed harvath cursed and dialed again a few moments later mike dent answered his phone mike its scot said harvath is omarhakim still alive no replied the man from fallujah he was tortured to death a couple of days after you dropped him off are you having an attack of conscience or something the iraqi had gotten what he deserved in fact he probably deserved much worse but that didnt matter now do you know any of his family members in fallujah i dont know any of them but everyone knows of them why he has a cousin a businessman in america i need you to find out everything you can about him how soon do you need it asked dent i need it immediately and i dont care what you have to do to get it do you understand can i use local talent use whoever you have to and agree to pay them whatever they want said harvath but you get me that information and you get it for me asap chapter chicago i have already made provisions for weapons and ammunition said marwan your trip is not necessary focus on the remaining elements which need to be accomplished rashid tried to explain when we left the hotel did you notice the two cops standing there yes i saw them but i dont how about their vests leveltwo soft body armor said the man level three if they have upgraded from what they were given at the police academy thats the armor what about the carriers they use carriers dont provide ballistic protection shahab no they dont replied rashid but a lot of cops now have trauma plates in addition to their armor marwan jarrah waved his hand dismissively as he liked to do when he felt a point was beneath his discussion thats why our men have rifles it will be like shooting through tissue paper it wont be a problem but suppose it is suppose some young cop doesnt mind the weight of hard plates the older man laughed everyone minds the weight you know this you were a soldier no one wears hard armor unless they expect an attack this is going to be a surprise something they will not see coming maybe marwan maybe in fact lets say youre right lets say nobody expects this attack but just for fun lets also say that the two cops we saw at the marriott arent standing outside when our men arrive but they show up one minute after jarrah exhaled and howd they get there this is foolish lets talk about something else its not foolish insisted rashid those cops came in a patrol car patrol officers are now being issued patrol rifles so firepowerwise they are equal to your men and if theyre smart which many of them are especially the younger more aggressive cops they are also going to have hard armor itll take them two seconds to get it out of the trunk and throw it on our men could have plowed through half the lobby but they wont get to the other half much less their next hotel and what if its not patrol officers but one of the citys roving tactical teams that arrives the man was silent as he pieced together what his protégé was saying it will take me less than five hours to go and come back why wisconsin because illinois requires a firearms identification card to buy reloading supplies and wisconsin doesnt it seems like a great risk to me this close to the attack rashid looked at him im going to break up the purchases at three different locations ill get the reloading machine at one powder and primers at another and the rounds and jackets at the third what about video cameras ill be careful what if you get stopped im not going to get stopped marwan but even if i do my drivers license has my christian name on it i want fadim and uday to go with you thats a great idea i think we should all wear turbans and islam is a dynamite religion tshirts how about that im in no mood for disrespect marwan snapped those two get enough looks here in chicago if i take them with me to wisconsin were going to raise a lot of eyebrows or a lot of unibrows in fadim and udays case this is why people in our organization are uncomfortable with you rashid raised his hands palms up because of my sense of humor no it is your belief that you know better than everyone else i do when everyone else is not using their heads cmon marwan the first thing people think of when they see fadim and uday is terrorist you cant walk them into a store that sells guns and not expect to create a stir i thought the idea was not to draw attention to ourselves that is the plan replied jarrah i am sending them along for your protection they will ride in a separate vehicle and keep an eye on you you will not go armed and i do not want you using your cell phone is that understood you go buy the items you need and you return immediately you dont want me using my cell phone now sheik aleem is concerned that the network may have been penetrated because of what happened in london because of london and amsterdam amsterdam said rashid thats the site of the final european attack the man nodded what happened there were six bombers only one successfully detonated sheik aleem is correct to be concerned that the network may have been compromised then all the more reason to put our plans on hold no replied the man it is more important than ever that we succeed thats why i agree with you about the ammunition and why i am letting you go get the things we need but without my cell phone and with fadim and uday keeping me company for once shahab would you do something without arguing with me thats all i ask rashid bowed his head im sorry marwan well do it your way good thank you now we need to talk about the police officers we are holding theyre a liability and need to be dealt with i agree jarrah was taken aback you do yes no good can come from holding on to them so then they should be disposed of yes the man smiled this is very good shahab im pleased that for once you see things my way ill let you then decide how to handle it i already know how i want to handle it said rashid how they are going to be martyrs for our cause and they will take many of their fellow officers with them chapter wednesday it took mike dent about three hours to get harvath the information he needed within fortyfive minutes of dents call he and the remaining athena team members were on a citation x to chicago it was a tough decision to leave their teammate behind in the hospital but they knew rodriguez would have wanted them to finish the job from that point forward the dutch took over the interrogation of alyaqoubi though harvath doubted theyd get much more out of him meanwhile carltons people were still working on adda sterk she was producing only small amounts of intel much of it not very useful the same could be said of the controller for the london cell who had been broken by ashfords team whoever had assembled this network had done a very good job everything was compartmentalized and cutouts had been used all along the way it was only when you got closer to the top as they had with alyaqoubi that the payouts began to get bigger the last piece of information harvath had harvested from the accountant had been the most terrifying whatever yusuf had planned for america it was set to begin in the next fortyeight hours per mike dent yusuf was actually a furniture importer in chicago named marwan jarrah he had fled iraq during the s and eventually became a us citizen he was an influential member of the american branch of the islamic relief foundation or irf a saudi arabiabased charity and member of the conference of ngos the irf had conducted multiple projects with the world health organization the united nations international childrens emergency fund the united nations high commission for refugees and the world food program prominence in this organization had provided jarrah cover to travel anywhere he wanted it was no coincidence that the greatest hotbeds of terrorism and radical islam were in the same parts of the muslim world so keenly focused upon by the irf in order to prevent jarrahs relatives from tipping him off dent had arranged for the ones he had questioned to be detained until harvath okayed their release for the first time since this operation had begun harvath felt that he had been able to take more than just one step forward before getting knocked on his ass he had to block the scenes from amsterdam from his mind or he wouldnt be able to focus on what still needed to be done along with the pit of children from fallujah and the little iraqi boy who had died in his arms he tucked them all into the iron box he kept for the unpleasantness of his job and shoved it back into the deepest recesses of his mind he tried to think of something positive something he could look forward to and was surprised when rileys image bubbled up in his mind it made him feel disloyal to tracy and tracy brought him back to the issue of having children the exact thing hed been sitting on his dock thinking about when all of this had begun as quickly as thoughts of tracy and the hard decision he needed to make about his relationship with her came to mind they were pushed aside by the work he had yet to do there had been some debate as to how the team should proceed once it landed in chicago they had no arrest or law enforcement powers acts of terror plotted and committed on american soil were treated as criminal acts which harvath had always thought a big mistake by not treating them as acts of war the united states government was only inviting escalation greater bloodshed and exponentially greater loss of life the jihadists were at war with america yet american politicians refused to go to war with them they saw them as petty criminals to be tried and given all the benefits of the american legal system the department of defense though saw it a different way the entire idea behind the carlton group was to protect america and her citizens period that was where things were now very sticky harvath and his organization had knowledge of pending terrorist attacks on us soil they also had intelligence regarding the man they believed to be in charge of those attacks inside the us it could very well be argued that the information should have been shared with the fbi but that was not how reed carlton or the small cadre of men to whom he answered inside the pentagon saw it they wanted marwan jarrah all to themselves and they had no intention of sharing him they also had no intention of reading him his miranda rights or helping him secure an attorney there was no telling how many cells he had within the united states they needed to grab him interrogate him and neutralize his network as rapidly as possible and if it meant violating a few terrorists rights along the way then that was the way it was going to be with carlton doing the groundwork for them they used their time aboard the plane to eat check on nikki rodriguez via the inflight satcom system and grab as much sleep as possible when they landed in chicago it was just after three in the morning two vehicles stuffed with gear were waiting for them a windowless chevy astro van and a dented kia sportage with tinted glass harvath was anxious to set up surveillance and put together their plan for taking down jarrah they divided up the equipment and broke into two teams once they had established a rendezvous point each team made a reconnaissance drive through jarrahs residential neighborhood and the neighborhood where his furniture outlet and the american office of record for the irf was located two things immediately became clear the first was that surveilling jarrahs house from a vehicle was going to be next to impossible street parking was by permit only and even if they had a permit there wasnt a single space to be found there were also neighborhood watch we call police signs mounted everywhere including in peoples windows harvath had always hated doing residential surveillance and this was one of the biggest reasons neighbors tended to not only know and watch out for each other but they also knew what everyone drove effectively nonresidents stood out the second problem they faced was that there appeared to be multiple entrances and exits to jarrahs furniture store it was a large threestory commercial building with glass along the front and doors that opened onto the sidewalk there was a fire escape and loading dock area in back that accessed the alley a side door that allowed people to enter from the parking lot and an exit on the far side of the structure that fed into a narrow gangway with the building next door it was a lot to cover there was a third problem that harvath didnt even want to think about the fact that jarrahs home and business were in chicago didnt mean that he was for all harvath knew he could be in new york city getting ready to oversee his first attack chicago had been their best and only lead harvath would have given a years salary to have placed drones overhead at the house and the business or to have satellites retasked to help give him extra sets of eyes but that wasnt going to happen not without setting off a bunch of alarm bells back in dc and getting them all in trouble none of them were supposed to be here posse comitatus notwithstanding if anyone discovered that the dod had created and was running its own covert direct action network thered be absolute hell to pay harvath and his team were going to have to figure out how to get the job done while remaining under everyones radar as they couldnt sit outside jarrahs house megan rhodes suggested they walk right up ring the doorbell and see who answered as soon as the stores opened she could buy an arrangement of flowers and pretend to be delivering them harvath didnt like it and gretchen casey immediately shot it down just like london and amsterdam she said this guys paranoia level is going to be off the charts an incorrect delivery is going to be highly suspect who cares replied rhodes the door opens my glock goes in his face everybody wins not if hes got six other guys behind the door armed better than you are said harvath six guys isnt even a fair fight now if he had twelve then maybe its a nice idea megs but keep thinking said casey who asked harvath what if there was another way we could get close to the house without arousing suspicion id be willing to entertain it what are you thinking do you think we could coopt one of the neighbors harvath shook his head i doubt it i saw two parked cars with iraqi flag stickers either they both belong to jarrah or he and his neighbors share more than just the same zip code im with scot said cooper i think we need to focus on the furniture store casey nodded okay i agree but i still want to see if we cant figure out some way to gain access to his house in the meantime replied harvath i want to get our surveillance network in place before its light if jarrah is there hes not only going to be expecting surveillance hes going to be actively looking for it chapter i dont know said abdul rashid as he pushed himself back from the table he was working at you tell me would you want to already be shooting armorpiercing rounds or swap out magazines once you finally come to the conclusion that youve got a problem thats assuming you can remember which one of your mags is the one with the correct rounds to begin with jarrah looked at the reloading equipment and the piles of ammunition did you get any sleep at all last night no and its a good thing you know what i found continued rashid as he rolled his chair over to the adjoining table picked up a cell phone and tossed it to the man this phone has something wrong with it we tested all the phones whats the problem you tested to see if theyd vibrate and activate the detonators i checked their electrical integrity for some stupid reason every once in a while this one pulses and gives off an electrical charge how strong strong enough that id be worried about it prematurely setting off one of the explosives marwan walked over and kissed the younger man on the forehead what was that for he asked jarrah swept his arm around the room for all of this the improved ammunition the doublechecking of the explosives all of it youve done a very good job shahab we are almost there so how do you want me to load the magazines for the shooters the man thought about it for a moment im apprehensive that we havent had an opportunity to test the new ammunition you have fabricated rashid grabbed one of the rifles and a magazine he had loaded lets go try it in the parking lot right now the iraqi laughed at the young mans joke you are as excited as i am but we must be practical with our orchestration cautious so no plinking in the lot shahab i believe that you know what you are doing i also believe that allah blessed your journey yesterday and that it adds a layer of security to what we are doing good so well use the new ammo jarrah waved his hand dismissively weve already practiced with the other ammo the stuff you got from that gangbanging gunrunner when asked rashid weeks ago the older man replied rashid looked at him youve known all along that this was going to be a mumbaistyle attack im sorry i couldnt tell you shahab the mission must always come first you know that the young man turned away and rolled his chair back to his reloading equipment the iraqi smiled youre tired you should rest tomorrow will be a glorious day inshaallah i still have work to do were going to need to replace the bad cell phone and you havent told me how you want the magazines loaded relax i have an extra cell phone up in the office he replied and as for the armorpiercing rounds load two of the thirtyround magazines for each man thats all rashid asked yes thats all they will use the rounds we have tested as their primary ammunition your armorpiercing rounds will be a backup if they need them so youve got no problem in the heat of battle with them having to remember to transition to armorpiercing when the police show up not at all i have every faith and confidence these men are well trained they will remember its your operation it is our operation shahab and you have contributed many many good things to it tomorrow the infidels will be shaken it will be the first blow of many that we will deliver on their own soil after tomorrow we will discuss the future and what sheik aleem and i have planned for you but now why dont you tell me what you are going to do with our guests the police officers the younger man reached for a piece of paper and a pen he drew three squares whose tops came together to form a triangle these will be the chairs that we duct tape together essentially well be creating three separate blast directions like three claymores so each of the men will be wearing an explosive vest yes but it wont be obvious as with our shahid their vests will be hidden by clothing marwan smiled so you will place them in the center of the room and no matter how their colleagues gather around them they will all be vulnerable exactly and along with ducttaping them to the chairs theyll also have hoods and duct tape around their mouths so they cant speak or gesture very good how will you know the exact moment to detonate with this said rashid as he reached over and picked up one of the remote camera balls john vaughan and paul davidson had been caught placing in the alley behind the mosque the iraqi brought his hands together in a clap this is very good and it will be an excellent beginning to the chaos it will draw tremendous resources to the exact opposite side of the city im proud of you shahab you have indeed done a very good job i just wonder if we should consider using another location no mohammed nasiris apartment is perfect how are we going to get the police officers in there without drawing attention this time it was abdul rashids turn to smile do you have faith in allah marwan chapter as they had a very small surveillance team harvath decided that they could risk exposing only one of their operatives because she was biracial and jarrahs furniture store catered to a largely ethnic clientele alex cooper had nominated herself to go in and look around armed with her camera phone and an exceptional wheniwantyourhelpillaskforit attitude she walked around inside ostensibly taking pictures of furniture while getting the most accurate lay of all three levels that she could she found the door to the basement but it was locked the door to the business office on the other hand was open and she walked right in she was immediately confronted by two very large middle eastern men who told her in broken english that she was in an area offlimits to customers feigning insult cooper scolded them for being rude and demanded to know where the ladies room was one of the men directed her back into the showroom and pointed at a door on the far side after she had washed her hands and come back out the two men were talking to another younger man who also appeared somewhat middle eastern as soon as he saw her he headed straight for her cooper pulled her camera phone back out and began taking pictures again can i help you miss the man asked he was tall and a bit skinny but appeared quite fit no thank you she replied haughtily im just browsing youve been taking a lot of pictures cooper turned to him with her camera in one hand and the other on her hip is there a problem with that he put on a smile spread his hands and replied its unusual its unusual or its unusual when a black woman does it it has nothing to do with the color of your skin oh really his smile faded and he glanced at a closed circuit camera as if someone else might be supervising their exchange and said i just want to know why youre taking pictures you want to know why she said turning the attitude knob all the way up because im tired of sending shit back im tired of my boyfriend not liking a damn thing i buy thats why im taking pictures we do have a web site i know youve got a damn web site id also be happy to get you a catalog cooper clicked her phone shut and got right in the young mans face you know what you can keep your damn catalog and your damn web site im going to find another store that isnt afraid of having black customers the young man reached out may i see your phone before you go cooper drew it to her chest what the hell is wrong with you no you may not you people are crazy she said as she began walking toward the door the young man trotted alongside her and then stepped right into her path youve been in here almost half an hour taking pictures i happen to be moving into a very big house the young man was completely blocking her path now he put his hand straight out give it to me cooper tapped her foot and then rolled her eyes before putting the phone into her purse what are you going to do now rashid reached for the purse and before he knew what had happened cooper had kicked him right in the crotch never mess with a womans purse she said as she stepped over him and quickly exited the store cooper crossed the street walked over two blocks and turned the corner harvath was waiting in the sportage howd it go he asked as she got in you were right theyre beyond paranoid in there did you learn anything from what i could see they take their security very seriously there were a couple of middle easterners who got pretty upset when i stumbled into the office the door to the basement was locked which could mean anything or nothing and their cctv system looked like it came out of a vegas casino it was a little overkill but what do i know maybe they have a problem with people shoplifting dressers and armoires did you see anyone matching jarrahs description no but i did get pictures of his employees and a couple of the goons hes got working there said cooper so we have no idea if hes in the building or not no do you think its worth taking a look after dark asked harvath if we can get around their security system i think it would be a great idea the team spent the rest of the day and into the evening watching jarrahs business as darkness fell the doors were locked and the lights dimmed a handful of employees filed out but missing from their ranks were the man alex had kicked and the two goons who had chased her out of the office shortly before eleven pm there was activity in the alley as a truck pulled up to the loading dock a pakistanilooking driver backed it in and one of the stores large overhead doors was raised casey looked at harvath seems pretty late for a delivery or a pickup he replied as he watched three mediumsized crates being wheeled on dollies into the truck those are the two goons i met earlier said cooper over the encrypted radio as the men dressed in matching delivery uniforms placed the crates in the back of the truck and then were joined by the plainclothes driver and thats the man who tried to take my phone she said as a fourth man appeared he was wearing a matching uniform harvath and casey watched from their vantage point in the kia as the other team members held their positions the young man stepped out onto the loading dock and took a slow look around satisfied he pulled down the trucks rear door enclosing the two goons and the pakistani man with the crates inside he said something over his shoulder and the furniture stores overhead door was closed he then hopped off the loading dock got inside the truck and started it up what the hell are they up to said ericsson do we follow them as the trucks engine rumbled to life and it began to pull away from the loading dock harvath had a decision to make no you stay here he replied well go putting the kia in gear harvath pulled out into traffic and kept as much distance as he could between themselves and the truck as he drove casey reached into the backseat and flipped up the lid of one of the storm cases removing a mm heckler koch mp submachine gun she affixed its rectangular gemtech brick suppressor inserted a fresh magazine and chambered a round something tells me this is going to be a very long night chapter marwan didnt need to tell him to drive carefully but he did anyway with two cops and a private eye boxed up in back rashid wasnt exactly anxious to get pulled over traffic was light and the drive up to nasiris apartment took half an hour the truck was large and difficult to maneuver but he nevertheless conducted several sdrs to make sure he wasnt being followed in the alley behind mohammeds building he stopped and walked around to the back of the truck the exterior stairwell was just as nasiri had described it was going to be a bitch carrying the three crates up to the apartment but without an elevator they had no other choice rashid and nasiri assisted but marwans goons did the bulk of the work they were sweating and cursing quietly even before they got halfway up with the second crate this was probably not how they had envisioned spending their final night alive and that went for nasiri as well they all knew what tomorrow would bring and they probably wished to already have ritually bathed and shaved themselves for their journey to paradise rashid had wondered if aleem would lead the shahid in prayers but marwan explained that the man had already left the city it was important that he see to what was coming next as usual what that was marwan wasnt disposed to say when they got the third and final crate into the apartment they closed the door and rashid made sure the drapes were drawn as tight as possible the odor in the kitchen was terrible there was a plate of rotting food on the table which nasiri picked up and tossed into the garbage he then pulled out some glasses and put on a pot of water for tea rashid closed the blinds in the living room while the goons caught their breath and then set to work opening up the crates the plan had worked perfectly they hadnt seen any neighbors and even if one or two had been watching it would have looked as if mohammed nasiri had purchased a threepiece bedroom set as thats what was spraypainted on the side of the crates and was having it delivered sure it was late at night but with americas culture most of his immigrant neighbors wouldnt know to think anything of it rashid arranged three chairs in the living room just as he had diagrammed it for marwan they then tightly ducttaped the two cops and their detective colleague to them the detective whom he had shot at the mosque had begun bleeding again rashid checked their vests and dismissed the goons to join nasiri in the kitchen for tea he was almost finished after powering up the cell phone detonators he adjusted their clothing to cover up the vests and then hid the camera ball between a couple of nasiris books in the corner of the room satisfied that everything was exactly how he wanted it rashid joined the men for a fast cup of tea marwan would want them back as quickly as possible they gathered up the crating material and rashid made sure to wipe down everything he touched so as not to leave any fingerprints the other men didnt have to worry very soon they wouldnt even have fingers as nasiri and the goons threw the garbage in the back of the truck and climbed in rashid pulled down the door and checked his watch it was after midnight wednesday had passed into thursday the day of the attack had come and now it was only hours away rashid climbed back into truck and started it up as he drove off down the alley he had no idea that harvath and casey had been watching him the entire time chapter as the truck exited the alley and disappeared from view harvath motioned to casey and they stepped away from the dumpster theyd been hiding behind what do you think she asked harvath looked up at the apartment all of the lights had been turned out and the curtains were still drawn i think that theyve got something very bad in those crates thats what im thinking too whatever theyre planning its big and theyve got a lot of it lets go take a look she put her hand on harvaths shoulder and said wait a second shouldnt we be sure theres nobody else up there trust me he replied theres nobody else up there how do you know harvath started down the alley because if they had more men they would have gotten those crates up into the apartment a lot faster despite his confidence that the apartment was empty casey noticed that harvath was still very careful about how he moved he avoided motion lights and stayed close to large objects that could function as cover and concealment it had been hot and humid ever since they had landed in chicago there wasnt any breeze and the alley was thick with the odor of overripe garbage casey was sweating her shirt clung to her back as she followed him their target was a fourstory brick building with a wooden set of fire stairs behind it a section of chainlink fencing with a broken gate separated the property from the alley they walked down the narrow gangway and were about to mount the stairs when coopers voice came over their earpieces two new trucks just pulled up to the loading dock what are they doing harvath whispered bunch of middle eastern guys have come out of the store and are now loading cardboard boxes that place was like a clown car just when you thought it was empty more of them crawled out harvath thought do you want us to follow them she asked only if you see someone matching jarrahs description other than that hold your position and write down the license numbers descriptions of the trucks and anyone you see getting in roger that said cooper looking at casey harvath asked ready she adjusted the laptop bag she was carrying and flashed him the thumbsup harvath opened his messengerstyle bag the rest of the way and wrapped his hand around the grip of his suppressed mp and led the way up the stairs though the weapon was extremely compact it was difficult to conceal beneath casual summer clothing so they carried their mps in bags that wouldnt look out of place in an urban environment beneath their shirts each also carried a glock in a paddle holster all of the apartments they passed were dark when they reached the thirdfloor landing they could hear a television through an open window somewhere off in the distance but nothing from inside the apartment itself they stepped carefully on the landing just in case harvath had been wrong about the unit being empty and a warped board gave them away he moved to the door and pressed his ear against it while casey covered him he still heard nothing from inside he checked the door frame for any alarms or trip devices and when he didnt find any he tried the knob the door was locked harvath removed one of the lockpick guns that had been included with their gear and went to work when the dead bolt slid back he returned the device to his pocket removed his mp completely from his messenger bag and stood back so that casey could grip the doorknob he took a deep breath then nodded and casey quietly pulled the door open harvath swept into the kitchen searching for hostile targets despite the drapes on the window being drawn a certain amount of ambient light from the buildings on the other side of the alley illuminated the room it also smelled like someone had forgotten to take out the garbage with casey behind him he moved past a card table to the other side of the small kitchen across a narrow hallway he could see through an open door into a bedroom next to that was a closed door which he assumed led to the bathroom to see any further he needed to stick his head into the hallway but suddenly the hairs on the back of his neck stood on end harvath hated hallways they had a bad habit of funneling the gunfire of even the worst shooter right at you but that wasnt it not completely at least his sixth sense was trying to tell him something someone else was in the apartment he could feel it now he didnt know if they were in the bedroom closet behind the closed door to the bathroom or at the end of the hallway where he couldnt see wherever it was there was danger in this apartment and his body was tensing up in anticipation of engaging it he signaled casey that he would cover the hallway while she crossed to clear the bedroom when he was ready he nodded and swung out into the hallway and thats when he saw it in the eerie halflight of the living room was the outline of a hooded figure sitting in a chair harvath lit up the scene with a flash from his weapon light and saw that it wasnt just one figure but three he held his position as casey quickly exited the bedroom and cleared the bathroom which was jammed with the shipping crates they had seen being carried upstairs together they moved into the living room and secured it making sure no one was lurking beyond the apartments front door then and only then did they tend to the hostages their chairs had been ducttaped in a sort of circle and the men to them harvath removed their hoods and the hostages wildly gestured with their chins at their chests he opened the shirt of the man nearest him and instantly understood he didnt need to see vests on the other two to know that they had them as well everyone relax were going to get you out of here instead of calming down the man who harvath was standing in front of became even more agitated he was gesturing even more urgently but not at the vest anymore he seemed to be nodding toward the corner of the room harvath turned and looked behind but couldnt understand what the man was trying to tell him when harvath couldnt figure it out the man became even more impatient his eyes were wide and he was yelling from behind the layers of duct tape that had been wrapped around his head and over his mouth dont move harvath said as he pulled out his knife the man didnt listen and harvath had to sling his weapon and grab the mans face as he carefully made an incision along the left side of the tape peeling enough of it away to get a good grip he then pulled backhard the camera john vaughan shouted as the tape came free theres a camera between the books the vests are triggered to remote detonate it took harvath a second but he found the camera and spun it so it faced the wall when he turned back around casey had opened the shirts of the other men revealing their explosive vests get out of here before they detonate said vaughan easy replied harvath the men who brought you here drove off in their truck thats a wireless camera with a limited range if somebody was watching us they would have already detonated im sergeant john vaughan with the chicago police theres going to be a terrorist attack we know said casey as she examined the mans vest with her flashlight but i need you to be still for a minute dont talk okay vaughan fell silent as she examined his vest and then looked under and behind his chair are you looking for the trigger he asked yes theres something in the small of my back i think its a cell phone casey put her flashlight between her teeth bent down and very carefully slid one of her hands behind the police officer i feel it can you disarm it harvath asked i wont know till we get him out of the chair and i see it straightening back up she looked at vaughan and said theres something called a mercury switch the way it works is im a marine i was in iraq interrupted the policeman i know what a mercury switch is im trying to figure out if moving you will trigger this vest we got the crap jostled out of us in those crates trust me theres no mercury switch so all they did was tape you to the chairs yes said vaughan casey took out her knife lets cut him loose once vaughan was free harvath helped him stand while casey studied his vest its similar to the mechanism they used in london probably how the vests in amsterdam were set up who are you asked vaughan thats not important said harvath dont worry added casey i know what im doing thank god because done she replied having disconnected the cell phone trigger what casey raised her finger to her lips for him to be quiet as she studied the buckles on the vest she then put the flashlight back in her mouth and carefully unfastened them now very slowly she ordered nodding at harvath to grab the opposite side of the vest were going to lift up and i want you to slide out of it if you feel even the slightest tug a snag even if you think youre imagining it i want you to freeze okay okay said vaughan good now on three and remember slowly here we go one two three the policeman slowly slid out of the vest and backed away from it harvath then took it from casey and held it up for her to examine her eyes narrowed as she moved in to look at something what the heck is this what did you find asked harvath ill tell you after we look at the other two vests lets hurry up chapter everything went okay asked jarrah when rashid returned no problems he replied everything is in place and mohammed nasiri mohammed is ready as are the rest of our brothers he told me to thank you and that he is sorry for any trouble he may have caused jarrah smiled and looked up at the two men behind rashid you have done very well go and prepare yourselves we will pray together shortly when the two men had left marwan motioned for his protégé to sit with him come and take tea with me i think caffeine is probably the last thing i need right now said rashid as he sat down and dried his palms on his thighs he looked at the empty tables where the suicide vests had been constructed and the reloading equipment he had used to build his special ammunition did you think about what i asked i did and and how are your testicles from where the woman kicked you for the tenth time marwan im fine and in case i didnt make myself clear the other nine times i said it if you ever want something that stupid done again you can do it yourself jarrah pointed at the closed circuit television set near him we have it recorded on video if you would like to watch have you been replaying it for everyone is that what youve been doing you think thats funny she kicks hard like a donkey the man said with a chuckle it took him a minute to compose himself when he had he reached into his pocket and set a pill bottle on the table here rashid picked it up and read the label valium you think ive got some sort of an anxiety disorder it has nothing to do with a disorder it will help you to relax trust me you need it the hell i do theres two left take them no and what do you mean theres two left what happened to the rest of them i gave them to the shahid without asking me i dont need your permission shahab what about your shooters did you give them valium too of course not theyve been given amphetamines rashid shook his head just like mumbai have faith in allah shahab today we will strike a mighty blow for islam inshaallah rashid leaned forward and poured two glasses of tea i guess youre right we have worked very hard for this day yes we have said jarrah accepting his glass and setting it down to cool they were quiet for several moments each man pondering what was soon to happen it was marwan who eventually broke the silence i want you to know something whats that i want you to know that i believe in you lets not go down this road again marwan okay said rashid ive got enough on my mind already the man raised his hand im telling you the truth sheik aleem has gone to los angeles to prepare the next attack he wants you to go to new york are you serious marwan smiled yes rashid thought about that you know after today its going to be nearly impossible to pull off the same kind of attack with allahs help nothing is impossible replied jarrah but sheik aleem and i agree with you which is why the next attacks have been designed to be different rashid leaned forward how different airplanes will rain from the sky radiation and a plague will infect the infidel populations they will know terror like they have never known before and what about the cells are they already in place everything is ready and waiting sheik aleem has prepared a communications protocol that jarrahs voice trailed off as his eyes shifted to his television monitor what is it asked rashid someone is in the store the younger man pulled out his pistol how many where did you see them on the first floor of the showroom the west wall near the stairs to the down here to the basement said rashid as he leapt up stay right there dont move as he stepped into the cinder block hallway he heard a shout seconds later automatic weapons fire began chapter vaughan davidson and levy had no idea where theyd been moved to after being captured and torturedor in levys case shotat the mosque they knew it was a basement room somewhere but that was it as far as why they had been placed at mohammed nasiris apartment vaughan had only been able to pick up bits and pieces but thought that maybe they were going to be used to draw in a bunch of police officers and then their vests would be detonated in hopes of killing as many as possible the only other information the men could contribute was in regard to the tatp they thought the terrorists were going to use and what mohammed nasiri and the other men they had seen looked like it wasnt a lot to go on but it became a large part of harvaths decision to hit marwan jarrahs place of business with all of the activity it was obvious that the attack was about to happen but what had cinched it for harvath was the camera at nasiris apartment even fully charged it would run for only so long whatever the chicago cell had planned it was going to happen very soon harvath had decided they couldnt wait any longer though levy had taken two clean inandout gunshot wounds to the shoulder and someone had done a fair job of patching him up he was still going to need to see a doctor davidson and vaughan had been roughed up pretty good as well vaughan had suffered a broken wrist and both of davidsons eyes were so swollen he could barely see out of them you three need medical attention said harvath the hell with that said davidson were going with you how many fingers am i holding up when the public vehicles officer didnt answer harvath replied i thought so how many fingers am i holding up davidson replied as he flipped harvath the bird i agree said vaughan the hospital can wait we want to help take these guys down harvath took the officer aside and quietly said listen your team has done a great job but youve got to let us finish it and if i say no then im going to hold you in my custody until this is all over and just so you know my version of custody is ducttaping you back up including the gags and placing you in a dumpster somewhere around here if i get shot and dont come back youll be there till trash day or till the rats gnaw through the restraints whichever comes first what authority do you have to said vaughan but harvath interrupted him whether you think so or not you guys need a doctor all of you youre only going to slow us down or worse get us killed vaughan knew harvath was right he didnt like it but he understood it and consented to follow his plan he and davidson would take levy to dennis stern the trauma surgeon who would keep everything quiet not reporting the pending terrorist attack went against his instincts as a cop and his loyalty to his department but harvath had made it very clear that this was now a national security issue and needed to remain classified the men were told they couldnt even contact their wives who had probably already filed missing persons reports until harvath released them to do so vaughan agreed to hole up in sterns office gave harvath the surgeons cell and office numbers and then harvath handed over enough cash for them to get a taxi to the hospital when harvath and casey were back in their vehicle they radioed the rest of the team to get ready to take down jarrahs store fortyfive minutes later when the team was regrouped and ready to take down the store harvath gave the go command ericsson disabled the alarm but that was the extent of their prep work there was no way they could shut down the power which meant the closed circuit camera system would still be operational based on what cooper had seen while inside the store they had developed the best plan they could speed surprise and overwhelming violence of action would have to work they entered from two separate points and moved fast cooper and rhodes took the firstfloor office while harvath casey and ericsson headed for the basement they had just made it to the bottom of the stairs when one of the delivery goons spotted them he was completely naked his skin damp as if hed just stepped out of the shower seeing the intruders he yelled as he disappeared back into the room hed just exited harvath casey and ericsson advanced only to be driven back by a heavy barrage of machinegun fire several of the rounds ricocheted off the walls and ceiling as well as the pipes that surrounded them there was a grunt followed by ericsson saying im hit how bad shouted harvath as he returned fire and tried to keep their attackers pinned down casey examined her teammates wound upper thigh its starting to bleed pretty good damn it harvath replied as he fired another burst office is empty were on our way said cooper over the radio hurry up ordered casey harvath noticed movement in the hallway and let loose another burst from his mp when he realized what had happened he barely had time to yell flash bang as a concussion grenade was banked off the wall at them it went off immediately in a blinding flash of white light with a thunderous boom that overpressured the basement harvath had barely shut his eyes and his mouth was only partway open when it happened not enough to fully mitigate the effects he had no idea if the rest of his team had heard his warning or not his vision blurred from the flash he thought he could see two forms coming right at him he raised his weapon to fire but someone beat him to it there were two loud booms and both figures dropped to the ground he didnt know who had fired and how he could have heard it over the ringing in his ears as everyone on his team was using suppressed weapons then he realized the shots hadnt come from his team theyd come from someone else someone at the other end of the hallway chapter drop your weapon harvath yelled drop it now abdul rashid straightened his trigger finger and allowed the pistol to roll upside down and hang from it harvath repeated the command in arabic im going to bend down and set it on the ground rashid replied in english slowly said harvath his vision and hearing coming back very very slowly im setting it down once the weapon was on the ground harvath said back up five steps and kiss the ground rashid did as he was told and while rhodes helped tend to ericsson harvath and the rest of the team cautiously advanced harvath kept his weapon trained on rashid while casey and cooper cleared the two rooms on either side of the hallway once they were done he checked the two men rashid had shot they were both dead wheres jarrah theres another room at the far end of the basement hes barricaded in there how many other people in the building demanded harvath theres nobody else this is it listen you cant shoot him i need jarrah alive harvath looked at casey and cooper go get him looking down at rashid he removed a pair of ez cuffs and said put your hands behind your back my names sean chase im with the cia ground branch shut up and put your hands behind your back harvath repeated before chase could respond alex cooper yelled gun and all eyes turned to the end of the hallway where marwan jarrah had just stepped from around the corner with an ak and begun firing chapter marwan jarrah never had a chance as the bullets popped and zinged all around her alex cooper stood her ground and returned fire though she wanted to kill him on the spot by putting two rounds right into his head she focused on his chest and didnt lay off of her trigger until he laid off of his the iraqi fell back against the wall and left a trail of blood as he slid down into a sitting position his ak clattered to the ground next to him and cooper kicked it away chase tried to get up but harvath kept his knee in his back as he zipped his cuffs i dont know who the hell you are shouted chase but if he dies youre in a lot of trouble harvath stood up yanked chase to his feet and handed him to casey let him ask any questions he wants but watch him harvath then took cooper to clear the rest of the basement you lied to me murmured jarrah as chase kneeled next to him tell me how i can reach aleem he said knowing full well it was pointless marwan wasnt going to give him up the iraqi laughed and then produced a wet cough as he spat up blood i treated you like a son his eyelids were drooping and his breath was coming in sharp gasps he whispered something further but chase couldnt hear it and so leaned in closer what did you say i have something to tell you the iraqi rasped before his body was racked once more with bloody coughs what is it i have a secret chase was inches away from his face what is it marwan tell me as his final breath escaped his body jarrah looked at his beloved protégé and said i lied to you too after clearing the basement harvath came back to interrogate the man claiming to be from the cia listen theres going to be an attack downtown in two hours lets start with who the hell you are said harvath i told you my name is sean chase call langley and ask to be connected to kip houghton hes my handler harvath nodded at cooper who removed her cell phone and headed for the stairs jarrahs got eight suicide bombers continued chase but you dont need to worry about them what you need to be worried about wait a second interrupted harvath why shouldnt we be worried about eight suicide bombers because their vests dont work i made sure casey looked at him how the circuits not complete the detonators cant get any electricity just like the vests in nasiris apartment where are the bombers now asked harvath thats not important replied chase jarrah has three twoman teams of mumbaistyle shooters that are going to hit a bunch of hotels unless we stop them we need to get going until we get confirmation on who you are youre not going anywhere why was there a camera in nasiris apartment so i could have an excuse to get away from jarrah i wanted him to think i was going to detonate the vests on the hostages myself if i could get away from him then i could try to stop the shooters why not call the cops why go to all this trouble because this isnt the end of it theres somebody else above jarrah a man named aleem aazim aleem harvath replied thats him the guy with the hooks jarrah told me that he has networks in at least two other cities supposedly hes already left for los angeles and i was supposed to coordinate an attack in new york but rashids voice trailed off but what i think he was lying to me about what asked harvath the location of the attacks or the fact that you were supposed to coordinate the one in new york i dont know thats why i wanted jarrah alive he was the only one who knew how to get to aleem harvath pressed him with more questions whyd you torture those cops youre wasting time said chase answer me for fucks sake im the only reason theyre still alive jarrah wanted to kill them but you shot one of them it was clean through and through if id wanted to kill him trust me hed be dead harvath was about to ask another question when cooper hailed him over the radio and told him someone at langley wanted to talk to him chapter after harvath had spoken to kip houghton he hung up and called reed carlton who contacted bruce selleck director of the national clandestine service at cia once they had both vouched for chase and his deepcover operation harvath had been instructed to remove his restraints and allow him to come along chase was part of a small contingent of faux john walker lindhs whom the agency had recruited from various walks of life trained and then set adrift in a handful of madrassas across the islamic world hoping that they might get picked up by alqaeda several of them had but no one had gotten as far as sean chase trained to operate completely on his own chase went for long stretches without contact the assignment and his cover always came first his handler was used to the irregularity with which he reported in but as well as the operation had worked everyone was now extremely concerned that maybe they had let this go too far and that more innocent people were going to die over two hours had passed and harvath was developing a very bad feeling as caseys voice came over his earpiece negative she replied to his request for a sitrep theres no sign of any of them were still all clear at the intercontinental across the street at the marriott hotel harvath looked at chase according to your timetable they should have been here by now i dont know where the hell they are youre positive these were the hotels yes replied the cia operative who was equally frustrated im getting ready to pack it in said harvath i know they should have been here by now give it a few more minutes theyll come i dont think so if the truth be told chase didnt know what to think either but why would marwan have brought him here what was the point the last words the man uttered to him were that he had lied was this what he had lied about it didnt make any sense marwan had six shooters minus the two chase had shot in the basement of the store there were four left two of whom had been wounded by levys shotgun blast where were they if the hotels werent their target what was all of a sudden it hit him the train station thats the target how do you know because i know him he wanted this to be a dramatic attack thats why all the bombers were supposed to detonate in the loop the citys central business district look at this lobby its halfempty where are you going to get the highest body count first thing in the morning you go to where the commuters are i hope to god youre right said harvath as he radioed the other team members so do i chase replied under his breath based on the cia operatives guarantee that the suicide bombers wouldnt be able to detonate they had decided to bring the chicago police department into the plan plainclothes officers had been positioned where the bombers were supposed to appear and tactical teams were placed at the hotels with the morning rush in full swing the streets were jammed with traffic even with lights and sirens theyd never make it on timeunless they could avoid the traffic altogether harvath radioed casey and told her where to meet them next he radioed the chicago police and then he and chase exited the hotel and took off running faster than either of them had ever run before it was three long hard blocks to the river when they arrived casey and a chicago police boat were waiting for them harvath and chase leapt in and the officer behind the wheel spun the craft into the river and put the throttle all the way down casey yelled over the engine noise weve got good news and bad news what do you want first harvaths lungs were on fire and he could barely breathe much less speak he held up two fingers the bad news yelled casey as she pointed at a map is that there are basically five downtown commuter metra stations and because of traffic the tac teams can only get to two of them itll take them at least fifteen minutes to get to the others harvath then raised one finger the good news is that the millennium and van buren stations are near cooper and rhodes theyre the ones with tac teams who can make it so theyll tackle those ogilvie and union station are pretty close to the river but la salle street station is a few blocks inland ill take la salle said chase who was still panting whats our first drop point asked harvath as he tried to steady his breathing casey consulted the officer piloting the boat and then said ogilvie drop off at madison street and its a block and a half west harvath raised himself to standing ill take that one like hell you will replied casey im more rested ill take it you take union station its the next drop and its right at the river im not taking no for an answer harvath bowed his head and kept sucking in air its going to be this bridge said the police officer as they approached starboard side coming up fast as the boat slammed up against the landing harvath looked at casey and said mine before she could respond he had jumped out of the boat and was running up the stairs she yelled out klootzak but had no idea if he heard chapter despite being winded harvath was ready to run when he got up to the street level then he realized how much attention he would be calling to himself and instead walked as quickly as he could toward the station across the street he waited for the light sucked in as many deep breaths as he could and fought to get his heartbeat under control of all the places to try to apprehend a lone gunman a crowded train station had to be one of the worst the northeast illinois regional commuter railroad corporation known as metra served chicago and six counties in a surrounding radius the station was overflowing with commuters harvath followed the signs and made his way to the escalators that led to the upper level where the train platforms were he was only halfway up when the shooting began the people in front of him turned and began running down the up escalator he tried to push through them but they were panicked hopping over the rail onto the stairs he fought through the masses of people and began running the shooter was firing on full auto as he neared the top of the stairs it suddenly stopped magazine change thought harvath and he was right just as quickly as the shooting had stopped it had started again the platforms fed out into a cavernous retail area several stories tall with people running and screaming it was hard to get an exact fix on where the shooter was all he could tell was that the shooting was coming from the other side away from where he now stood he pulled out two spare mags for his mp tucked them in his waistband and tossed away his bag seconds later the sounds of fully automatic fire were joined by the sound of something elsesingleshot fire there was another shooter and he was close through the sea of people harvath caught a glimpse of a metra police officer who had taken a knee out in the open and was engaging the attacker passengers were running everywhere including back out on to the platforms and down onto the tracks harvath couldnt tell why the metra officer hadnt sought cover he was a sitting duck where he was then harvath locked eyes on the attacker and saw what he was focused on pinned near one of the retail stores was a group of children the metra cop was not only engaging the shooter he was trying to draw his fireaway from the children they were very young approximately six or seven years old and were all sobbing two adults in matching tshirts lay in pools of blood on the granite floor in front of them harvath raised his mp to fire at the shooter but as he did he saw the metra cop get shot in the chest and the throat as he fell forward his weapon clattered to the floor its slide locked back the pistol out of ammo with the cop out of the picture the terrorist sprayed a bunch of fleeing passengers who had been running in the other direction it caused a reverse stampede and any clear shot he could have had was now blocked he needed to get to those children but the only path available to him was through the shooters wall of fire running out onto the platform area harvath ran past three sets of tracks and then using the closest entrance for cover risked a peek back into the concourse he was much closer and had a very good view of the shooter a muscular middle easterner with a mustache and short hair the man was hyperalert and caught sight of harvath immediately he turned his weapon toward him and began firing harvath ducked back behind the entrance as masonry metal and glass exploded all around him when the firing stopped he rolled back out to engage but the man had disappeared in the concourse the floor was slick with blood and covered with bodies that had been ripped to shreds it took harvath a moment to realize where the shooter had disappeared to he had leapt behind a concessionstore counter harvath had no idea how thick it was whether it was solid or what was stacked behind it but he knew there wasnt much a mm round couldnt chew through he also knew he had to keep the mans attention off those children so he began firing his rounds tore good pieces out of the counter but he spent his magazine quickly and had to roll back to his cover and reload by the time he did the shooter was up and firing again he was firing at harvaths position which meant he wasnt targeting the children that was good the man though had also switched to threeround bursts which meant he was not only being much more careful but he also knew what he was doing the thing that didnt make any sense though was why he hadnt transitioned to the special armorpiercing ammunition chase had fabricated and which he had explained to harvath that all the shooters were carrying harvath waited for another volley and when it subsided he swung back out and did an entire magazine dump on the counter before ducking back through the smoke he had seen that he had broken through in multiple places it looked like metal canisters of some sort were stored underneath the counter nevertheless the shooter had to know that harvath was getting closer what he didnt know was that harvath only had one magazine for the mp left and had no idea if it would it be enough when the man popped up this time to fire he managed only two rounds before his magazine was empty and he was forced to drop back down and reload harvath spun back around the entrance and making sure to control his muzzle rise focused on one particular area he had been tearing through the counter he emptied the magazine as his rounds went clean through ducking back behind the entrance he dropped the mp and pulled out his glock he had fifteen rounds in the magazine one in the chamber it was makeorbreak time he needed to get to those children crouching he ran to the platform entrance nearest to where they were still paralyzed and crying on the concourse taking a deep breath he counted to three raised his glock and sped out from behind the door the shooter was already waiting for him as harvath appeared he locked his sights on him and pulled his trigger the explosive round detonated inside the terrorists chamber and blew up right in his face just as chase had planned as the mans scream filled the concourse harvath put two rounds into his head and killed him epilogue yemen one month later the end of august was not a good time to be in yemen in fact as far as harvath was concerned there was never a good time to be in yemen or anywhere else on the arabian peninsula he sat at one of the citys few halfway decent cafés his chair propped up against the wall an awning shielding him from the afternoon sun as he took a sip of his chai he thought about everything that had happened with visible tactical teams in plate armor at chicago s millennium and van buren stations the shooters who had come there to cause maximum carnage had immediately switched out their magazines for the ones loaded with chases armorpiercing rounds as their weapons exploded in their faces and civilians scattered both men were gunned down credit was given to the quickthinking cpd tac teams the fallen metra office at the ogilvie transportation center was rightly billed as a hero without whose actions many more innocent lives including those of a small group of sixyearolds would have been lost the slaughter at union station had been worse than ogilvie because it had started three minutes before gretchen casey got there positioned behind the shooter she took a shot from over seventy yards and killed him instantly with one round through the back of his head she then secreted her weapon and quietly left the station while the police in general were given credit for fast action no single officer or department had yet officially been credited for killing the shooter a rumor that it had been done by an undercover us marshal on his way to work had gained wide traction in the press all of the wouldbe suicide bombers were apprehended exactly where sean chase had said they would be neither harvath nor any of the athena team members had seen him again after he had chosen to take the la salle street station according to carlton s contacts at the cia chase had been tasked with hunting down aazim aleem based on chatter the agency had intercepted aleem was convinced that his entire network had been compromised and had fled the country for somewhere in the middle east authorities so far had been unable to uncover any evidence of plots or jarrahaleem cells in los angeles or new york their investigations were ongoing once stabilized nikki rodriguez was transferred stateside and was expected to make a full recovery julie ericsson had been treated for her gunshot wound at stroger hospital in chicago and released she traveled back to ft bragg with her teammates megan rhodes alex cooper and gretchen casey casey had been keeping harvath up to date on their progress and in her last email informed him that upon reflection rodriguez was convinced that he had been looking at her ass in amsterdam she wanted him to call her to discuss the matter further in other words they all sent their best wishes and looked forward to seeing him again soon josh levy the owner of surety private investigations had been discharged from the hospital after being held overnight for observation and was expected to make a full recovery based on a couple of calls from washington john vaughan and paul davidson both received commendations and promotions while davidson was happy where he was vaughan gladly accepted a newly created position with the chicago police departments intelligence unit davidson recruited the pakistani mechanic javed miraj into his network and was using him to help build a case against the three stooges at the crescent garage alison taylor had begun making progress and her family couldnt have been happier mr taylor had paid vaughan the balance of his monies owed and realized that with all of the federal charges against mohammed nasiri alison would probably never get her day in court even so knowing that she was getting better and that nasiri would never walk free was justice enough for him in switzerland adda sterk had been remanded to a dod black site for further interrogation and michael lee was given immunity from prosecution along with a small payment from the carlton group to guarantee his silence he was reunited with his dog and also tracked down sterks contact who had accepted the two decoy dogs that supposedly belonged to nicholas the old man had made it known to harvath that he wanted the settlement money to michael lee to be reimbursed to the carlton group by the troll in person harvath had no idea where he was but he assumed that he and padre peio had returned to the basque country after chicago harvath had intended to return to virginia but instead he had gone to maine he knew it wasnt going to be easy telling tracy things were over she was a beautiful woman and he loved her very much more than he had ever loved anyone else he wanted a family though he had come to the conclusion that he wanted that more than anything else even more than his career he had thought he could have both with her he believed that at one point it had been possible but not the way things were now they drank a lot and stayed in bed together for three entire days when the old man called and harvath told her he had to go she told him she loved him and that she hoped he would keep in touch with her she also told him that she understood and that he was doing the right thing as harvath left he consoled himself with the knowledge that if a great relationship had once been possible with tracy it could be possible with somebody else maybe even riley the doctor carlton had sent to him in geneva for his part though the old man wasnt forthcoming with any further information about her that was okay when he was done in yemen he was seriously considering going to paris to see if he could find her on his own taking another sip of chai he checked his watch and looked across the dusty street at the figure that was approaching youre late he said as the man pulled out one of the rickety chairs and sat down fuck you harvath smiled if he hadnt met sean chase in chicago he never would have been able to pick him out here in yemen or in any other muslim country he blended in perfectly you still mad chases eyes widened is that a serious fucking question because i spent three years of my life infiltrating aleems network only to have you cock it all up youre young therell be other assignments youre an idiot you know that how do you tell somebody to just walk away and forget something like that i didnt tell you to walk away and forget it said harvath i told you that thered be other assignments spoken like a true oldtimer forty makes me an oldtimer it certainly doesnt make you a spring chicken harvath laughed this kid was all mouth and balls he liked him probably because thats exactly the way he had been hot enough for you he asked changing the subject were going to talk about the fucking weather now chase asked i thought you had something for me or did you fly halfway around the world just to pull on my dick harvath laughed again whats so goddamn funny youve got an incredible mouth on you if you dont get a handle on it its going to hold you back what the hell would you know about it i know said harvath trust me so are we going to cuddle up and read chapter two from miss manners or are you going to give me the intel you supposedly uncovered on aleem harvath motioned for the waiter to bring another chai for his guest then turning to chase he said ive got good news for you sean i bet you do what is it aleems close how close harvath pulled a set of car keys from his pocket and dropped them on the table see that white corolla over there chase looked at the car and then back at harvath youve got aleem in there in the trunk harvath nodded holy shit whered you find him we followed the same leads you did here to yemen let me guess age and wisdom over youth and inexperience is that what youre going to tell me from what i understand said harvath youve already got more experience than a lot of people twice your age so what youre trying to tell me youre just that good harvath smiled youre going to learn sean that its often better to be lucky than good chase rolled his eyes whats the catch what do you want personally id like you to sit and have a glass of tea with me and then you can drive me to the airport thats it thats all you want i said thats what i wanted personally professionally we expect you to share everything with us you can download out of aleem but you could do that yourself said chase why give him to me because we want to you worked harder than anyone to get close to this guy and take his network apart a lot of people have been killed because of him and its going to make america look good that we captured him my group doesnt want any publicity the agency on the other hand needs the good press just make sure management doesnt try to grab all the credit thank you said chase as the waiter set down his glass harvaths phone vibrated it was an unknown number and he was tempted not to answer it but for some stupid reason he thought maybe carlton had given in and passed his number along to riley in paris the moment he heard the modulated voice on the other end he knew he had made a mistake you owe my boss some money nicholas and he wants it from you in person said harvath ive got something else the old mans going to want a lot more replied the troll then call him and tell him yourself he said as he reached for more chai im going on vacation i found something on adda sterks thumb drive what thumb drive the one i found in geneva after you dumped her purse out looking for her inhaler thats us government property nicholas wherever in the world he was the troll laughed im doing you a favor i really think you should see this not interested said harvath aazim aleem has a nephew who works at harrods so what so his nephew was a digital courier for him real smart when it came to transmitting information without leaving a trail except he made one mistake and i found it on the thumb drive yes chase was listening intently harvath decided the conversation was over clinking the tiny spoon he had against his glass he said you know what sound that is nicholas thats the bell signaling the commencement of the local cocktail hour im off the clock im sure you can track down my boss if you try hard enough thats when the troll let the other shoe fall a piece of data was transmitted to sterk that never should have been it was highly encrypted and even if she had noticed it buried in another file i dont think she could have decrypted it i think thats why it was left on her thumb drive hidden in plain sight okay i give what is it the troll took a deep breath and let it out site wasnt just about a string of islamic terrorist attacks the attacks are a small wave preceding a giant tsunami meant to crush the united states on a rooftop two blocks away as a man listened to his employer he could picture him sitting in his clubs library his liverspotted hands holding his encrypted cell phone you are positive aleem is in the trunk of the car i am said the man on the rooftop and nothing will be traced back to us nothing at all there was a pause before the man in london finally said you have my permission to proceed with that the line went dead the man on the rooftop plucked out his earbud wrapped the cord around his cell phone and replaced it in his pocket bending over he flipped open the lid of the hard plastic container at his feet and removed the rocketpropelled grenade he flipped up the sights and hoisted the weapon on his shoulder it was heavier than he remembered it took him a moment to focus on the white corolla in the distance when he had his target perfectly
