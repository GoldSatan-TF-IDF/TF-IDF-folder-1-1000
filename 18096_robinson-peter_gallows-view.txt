peter robinson gallows view the first inspector banks mystery for my father clifford robinson and to the memory of my mother miriam robinson now winter nights enlarge the number of their houres and clouds their stormes discharge upon the ayrie towres let now the chimneys blaze and cups oerflow with wine let welltund words amaze with harmonie divine now yellow waxen lights shall waite on hunny love while youthfull revels masks and courtly sights sleepes leaden spels remove thomas campion the third booke of ayres chapter one i the woman stepped into the circle of light and began to undress above her black calflength skirt she wore a silver blouse with dozens of little pearl buttons up the front she tugged it free of the waistband and started undoing the buttons from the bottom very slowly gazing into space as if she were recalling a distant memory with a shrug she slid the blouse off pulling at the left sleeve which stuck to her wrist with static then lowered her head and stretched her arms behind her back like wings to unclasp her bra raising one shoulder and then the other as she slipped off the thin straps her breasts were large and heavy with dark upturned nipples she unzipped her skirt down the left side and let it slide to the floor stepping out of it and bending from the waist she picked it up and laid it neatly over the back of a chair next she rolled her tights down over her hips buttocks and thighs then sat down on the edge of the bed to extricate herself from each leg one at a time careful not to make runs as she bent over the taut skin folded in a dark crease across her stomach and her breasts hung so that each nipple touched each knee in turn standing again she hooked her thumbs into the elastic of her black panties and bent forward as she eased them down as she stepped out of them she caught the waistband with her left foot and flicked them into the corner by the wardrobe at last completely naked she tossed back her wavy blond hair and walked toward the dresser it was then that she looked toward the chink in the curtains his whole body tingled as he watched the shock register in her eyes he couldnt move she gasped and instinctively tried to cover her breasts with her hands and he thought how funny and vulnerable she looked with the triangle of hair between her legs exposed as she grabbed for her dressing gown and dashed toward the window he managed to drag himself away and run off scraping his shin and almost falling as he jumped the low wall he had disappeared into the night by the time she picked up the telephone ii where on earth did i put that sugar bowl alice matlock muttered to herself as she searched the cluttered room it was a birthday present from ethel carstairsa present for her eightyseventh birthday three days ago now it had disappeared alice was having trouble remembering little things like that these days they said it happened when you got older but why then should the past seem so vivid why particularly should that day in when arnold marched off proudly to the trenches seem so much clearer than yesterday what happened yesterday alice asked herself as a test and she did remember little details like visiting the shop polishing her silverware and listening to a play on the radio but had she really done those things yesterday the day before or even last week the memories were there but the string of time that linked them like a pearl necklace was broken all those years agothat beautiful summer when the meadows were full of buttercups none of those nasty new bungalows then the hedgerows bright with cowparsley gypsy she always called it because her mother had told her that if she picked it the gypsies would take her and her garden full of roses chrysanthemums clematis and lupinsarnold had stood there ready to go his buttons reflecting the sunlight in dancing sparks on the whitewashed walls he leaned against the doorway that very same doorway with his kitbag and that lopsided grin on his facesuch a young face one that had never even seen a razorand off he marched erect graceful to the station he never came back like so many others he was destined to lie in a foreign grave alice knew this she knew that he was dead but hadnt she also been waiting for him all these years wasnt that why she had never married even when that handsome shopkeeper jack wormald had proposed down on his knees he was by the falls at rawley force got his knees wet too and that didnt half vex him but she said no kept the house on after her parents died changed things as little as possible there had been another war too she vaguely remembered ration books urgent voices and martial anthems on the radio faraway rumblings that could have been bombs arnold hadnt come back from that war either though she could imagine him fighting in it like a greek god lithe and strong with a stern face a face that had never seen a razor other wars followed or so alice had heard distant ones little wars and he had fought in them all an eternal soldier she knew deep down that he would never come home but she couldnt lose hope without hope there would be nothing left where on earth did i put it she muttered to herself down on her knees rummaging through the cupboard under the sink it must be somewhere id forget my head if it was loose then she heard someone running outside her eyes were not as good as they used to be but she was proud of her hearing and often ticked off the shopgirls and bus conductors who assumed that they had to shout to make her hear them after the sound of running came a gentle knock at her door puzzled she stood up slowly grasped the drainingboard to keep her balance and shuffled through to the living room there was always a chance she had to hope and so she opened the door iii perverts the lot of them detective chief inspector alan banks said adjusting the treble on the stereo including me asked sandra for all i know since when has making artistic representations of the naked human form been a mark of perversion since half of them dont even have films in their cameras but i always have film in my camera yes banks said enthusiastically ive seen the results where on earth do you find those girls theyre mostly students from the art college anyway banks went on returning to his scotch im damn sure jack tatum doesnt have film in his camera and fred barton wouldnt know a wideangle lens from a putting iron i wouldnt be at all surprised if they imagined you posinga nice willowy blond sandra laughed me nonsense and stop playing the yahoo alan it doesnt suit you you dont have a leg to stand on acting the idiot over photography while youre inflicting this bloody opera on me for someone who appreciates artistic representations of the naked human form youre a proper philistine when it comes to music you know music i can take its all this screeching gives me a headache screeching good lord woman this is the sound of the human spirit soaring vissi darte vissi damore bankss soprano imitation made up in volume what it lacked in melody oh put a sock in it sandra sighed reaching for her drink it was always like this when he found a new interest he would pursue it with a passion for anywhere between one and six months then he would have a restless period lose interest and move onto something else of course the detritus would remain and he would always profess to still be deeply interestedjust too pushed for time that was how the house had come to be so cluttered up with the novels of charles dickens winemaking equipment twenties jazz records barely used jogging shoes a collection of birds eggs and books on almost every subject under the sunfrom tudor history to how to fix your own plumbing he had become interested in opera after seeing quite by chance a version of mozarts magic flute on television it was always like that something piqued his curiosity and he wanted to know more there was no order to it neither in his mind nor in his filing system he would plunge into a subject with cavalier disregard for its chronological development and so it was with the opera craze orfeo rubbed shoulders with lulu peter grimes was toscas strange bedfellow and madama butterfly shared shelfspace with the rakes progress much as she loved music opera was driving sandra crazy already complaints from brian and tracy had resulted in the removal of the television to the spare room upstairs and sandra was forever tripping over the booksized cassette boxes which banks preferred to records as he liked to walk to work and listen to purcell or monteverdi on his walkman in the car it was generally puccini or giuseppe verdi good old joe green they were both alike in their thirst for knowledge sandra reflected neither was an academic or intellectual but both pursued selfeducation with an urgency often found in bright workingclass people who hadnt had culture thrust down their throats from the cradle onward if only she wished he would take up something quiet and peaceful like beekeeping or stamp collecting the soprano reached a crescendo which sent involuntary shivers up sandras spine youre surely not serious about some people in the camera club being perverts are you she asked i shouldnt be surprised if one or two of them got more than an artistic kick out of it thats all you could be right you know sandra agreed theyre not only women the models we had a very nice rastafarian the other week lovely pector the phone rang damn and blast it banks cursed and hurried over to pick up the offending instrument sandra took the opportunity to turn down the volume on tosca surreptitiously seems that someones been taking unaskedfor peeks at the naked human form again said banks when he sat down again a few minutes later another of those peeping tom incidents yes you dont have to go in do you no itll wait till morning nobodys been hurt shes more angry than anything else young richmond is taking her statement what happened woman by the name of carol ellis know her no seems she came back from a quiet evening at the pub got undressed for bed and noticed someone watching her through a gap in the curtains he took off as soon as he realized hed been spotted it was on that new estate leaview those ugly bungalows down by the gallows view cottages great places for voyeurs bungalows they dont even need to shin up the drainpipe banks paused and lit a benson and hedges special mild this ones taken a few risks in the past though last time it was a secondfloor maisonette it makes my skin crawl sandra said hugging herself the thought of someone watching when you think youre alone i suppose it would banks agreed but what worries me now is that well have that bloody feminist group down on us again they really seem to think we havent bothered trying to catch him because we secretly approve they believe all men are closet rapists according to them our secret hero is jack the ripper they think weve got pinups on the station walls you do ive seen them not in your office maybe but downstairs i mean pinups of jack the ripper sandra laughed thats going a bit far i agree do you know how difficult it is to catch a peeper banks asked all the bugger does is look and run away into the night no fingerprints no sightings nothing the best we can hope for is to catch him in the act and weve had extra men and women walking the beat in the most likely areas for weeks now still nothing anyway banks said reaching out for her all this talk about naked bodies is exciting me time for bed sorry answered sandra turning off the stereo not tonight dear ive got a headache chapter two i and where the bloody hell do you think you were till all hours last night graham sharp roared at his son over the breakfast table trevor glowered into his cornflakes out i know you were bloody out out with that goodfornothing mick webster ill bet what if i was its my business who i hang out with hes a bad un trevor like his brother and his father before him a rotten apple micks all right i didnt raise you all these years with my own hands just so you could hang about with hooligans and get into trouble well if you werent such a bleeding little hitler my mum might not have run off never mind that graham said quietly you dont know nothing about it you was only a kid i just want you to do well for yourself he pleaded look ive not done much never had the opportunity but youre a bright lad if you work hard you can go to university get yourself a good education whats the point theres no jobs anyway its not always going to be like this trevor i know the countrys going through a bad time right now you dont need to tell me that but look to the future lad itll be five or six years by the time youve done your a levels and your degree things can change a lot in that time all you need to do is stay in a bit more and do your homework you never found it hard you know you can do it its boring look what happened to mick then graham went on his voice rising with anger again left school a year ago and still on the bloody dole sharing a hovel with that layabout brother of his father run off god knows where and his mother never home to take care of him lennys not a layabout he had a job in london just got made redundant thats all it wasnt his fault im not going to argue with you trevor i want you to stay in more and spend some time on your schoolwork i might not have made much out of my life but you can and youre bloody well going to even if it kills me trevor stood up and reached for his satchel better be off he said wouldnt want to be late for school would i after the door slammed graham sharp put his head in his hands and sighed he knew that trevor was at a difficult agehed been a bit of a lad himself at fifteenbut if only he could persuade him that he had so much to lose life was hard enough these days without making it worse for yourself since maureen had walked out ten years ago graham had devoted himself to their only child he would have sent trevor to a public school if hed had enough money but had to settle for the local comprehensive even there despite all the drawbacks the boy had always done welltop of the class prizes every speech dayuntil last year when he took up with mick webster grahams hands shook as he picked up the breakfast dishes and carried them to the sink soon it would be opening time at least since hed stopped doing morning papers he got a bit of a liein in the old days when maureen was around hed had to get up at six oclock and hed kept it going as long as he could now he couldnt afford to employ a flock of papercarriers nor could he manage to pay the assistant he would need to deal with other business as things were he could just about handle it all himselforders accounts stock checks shelf arrangementsand usually still manage to come up with a smile and a hello for the customers his real worry was trevor and he didnt know if he was going about things the right way or not he knew he had a bit of a temper and went on at the lad too much maybe it was better to leave him alone wait till he passed through the phase himself but perhaps then it would be too late graham stacked the dishes in the drainer checked his watch and walked through to the shop five minutes late he turned the sign to read open and unlocked the door grouchy old ted croft was already counting out his pennies shuffling his feet as he waited for his weeks supply of baccy not a good start to the day ii banks reluctantly snapped off his walkman in the middle of didos lament and walked into the station a tudorfronted building in the town center where market street ran into the cobbled square he said good morning to sergeant rowe at the desk and climbed upstairs to his office the whitewashed walls and blackpainted beams of the buildings exterior belied its modern functional innards bankss office for example featured a venetian blind that was almost impossible to work and a gray metal desk with drawers that rattled the only human touch was the calendar on the wall with its series of local scenes the illustration for october showed a stretch of the river wharfe near grassington with trees lining the waterside in full autumn color it was quite a contrast to the real october nothing but gray skies rain and cold winds so far on his desk was a message from superintendent gristhorpe alan come see me in my office soon as you get in g remembering first to unhook the walkman and put it in his desk drawer banks walked along the corridor and knocked on the superintendents door come in gristhorpe called and banks entered inside was luxuryteak desk bookcases shaded table lampsmost of which had been supplied by gristhorpe himself over the years ah good morning alan the superintendent greeted him id like you to meet dr fuller he gestured toward the woman sitting opposite him and she stood up to shake bankss hand she had a shock of curly red hair bright green eyes with crinkly laughlines around the edges and a luscious mouth the turquoise top she was wearing looked like a cross between a straitjacket and a dentists smock below that she wore rustcolored cords that tapered to a halt just above her shapely ankles all in all banks thought the doctor was a knockout please inspector banks dr fuller said as she gently let go of his hand call me jenny jenny it is then banks smiled and dug for a cigarette i suppose that makes me alan not if you dont want to be her sparkling eyes seemed to challenge him not at all its a pleasure he said meeting her gaze then he remembered gristhorpes recent ban against smoking in his office and put the pack away dr fuller is a professor at york university gristhorpe explained but she lives here in eastvale psychologys her field and i brought her in to help with the peeping tom case actually he turned a charming smile in jennys direction dr fullerjennywas recommended by an old and valued friend of mine in the department we were hoping she might be able to work with us on a profile banks nodded it would certainly give us more than weve got already how can i help id just like to talk to you about the details of the incidents jenny said looking up from a notepad that rested on her lap theres been three so far is that right four now counting last nights all blonds jenny nodded and made the change in her notes perhaps the two of you can arrange to meet sometime gristhorpe suggested is now no good banks asked afraid not jenny said this might take a bit of time and ive got a class in just over an hour look what about tonight if its not too much of an imposition on your time banks thought quickly it was tuesday sandra would be at the camera club and the kids now trusted in the house without a sitter would be overjoyed to spend an operafree evening all right he agreed make it seven in the queens arms across the street if thats okay with you when jenny smiled the lines around her eyes crinkled with pleasure and humor why not its an informal kind of procedure anyway i just want to build up a picture of the psychological type ill look forward to it then banks said jenny picked up her briefcase and he held the door open for her gristhorpe caught his eye and beckoned him to stay behind when jenny had gone banks settled back into his chair and the superintendent rang for coffee good woman gristhorpe said rubbing a hairy hand over his red pockmarked face i asked ted simpson to recommend a bright lass for the job and i think he did his homework all right dont you it remains to be seen replied banks but ill agree she bodes well you said a woman why has mrs hawkins stopped cooking and cleaning for you gristhorpe laughed no no still brings me fresh scones and keeps the place neat and tidy no im not after another wife i just thought it would be politic thats all banks had a good idea what gristhorpe meant but he chose to carry on playing dumb politic aye politic diplomatic tactful you know what it means its the biggest part of my job the biggest pain in the arse too weve got the local feminists on our backs havent we arent they saying were not doing our job because its women who are involved well if we can be seen to be working with an obviously capable successful woman then theres not a lot they can say is there banks smiled to himself i see what you mean but how are we going to be seen to be working with jenny fuller its hardly headline material gristhorpe put a finger to the side of his hooked nose jenny fullers attached to the local feminists shell report back everything thats going on is that right banks grinned and im going to be working with her id better be on my toes then hadnt i it shouldnt be any problem should it gristhorpe asked his guileless blue eyes as disconcerting as a newborn babys weve got nothing to hide have we we know were doing our best on this one i just want others to know thats all besides those profiles can be damn useful in a case like this help us predict patterns know where to look and she wont be hard on the eyes will she a right bobbydazzler dont you think she certainly is well then gristhorpe smiled and slapped both his hands on the desk no problem is there now hows that breakin business going its very odd but weve had three of those in a month too all involving old women alone in their homesone even got a broken armand weve got about as far with that as we have with the tom business the thing is though there are no pensioners groups giving us a lot of stick telling us were not doing anything because only old people are getting hurt its the way of the times alan gristhorpe said and you have to admit that the feminists do have a point even if it doesnt apply in this particular case i know that it just irritates me being criticized publicly when im doing the best i can well nows your chance to put that right what about this fence in leeds think itll lead anywhere with the breakins banks shrugged might do depends on mr crutchleys power of recall these things vary according to the level of threat you convey yes i know i should imagine joe barnshaws done some groundwork for you hes a good man why bother yourself why not let him handle it its our case id rather talk to crutchley myself that way i cant blame anyone else if mistakes are made what he says might ring a bell too ill ask inspector barnshaw to show him the pictures later get an artist in if the descriptions good enough gristhorpe nodded makes sense taking sergeant hatchley no ill handle this by myself ill put hatchley on the peeper business till i get back do you think thats wise he cant do much damage in an afternoon can he besides if he does itll give the feminists a target worthy of their wrath gristhorpe laughed away with you alan throwing your sergeant to the wolves like that iii it was raining hard hatchley covered his head with a copy of the sun as he ran with banks across market street to the golden grill it was a narrow street but by the time they got there the pagethree beauty was sodden the two sat down at a window table and looked out at distorted shopfronts through the runnels of rain silent until their standing order of coffee and toasted teacakes was duly delivered by the perky petite young waitress in her red checked dress the relationship between the inspector and his sergeant had changed slowly over the six months banks had been in eastvale at first hatchley had resented an incomer especially one from the big city being brought in to do the job he had expected to get but as they worked together the dalesman had come to respect albeit somewhat grudgingly for a yorkshiremans respect is often tempered with a sarcasm intended to deflate airs and graces his inspectors sharp mind and the effort banks had made to adapt to his new environment hatchley had got plenty of laughs observing this latter process at first banks had been hyperactive running on adrenaline chainsmoking capstan full strength exactly as he had in his london job but all this had changed over the months as he got used to the slower pace in yorkshire outwardly he was now calm and relaxeddeceptively so as hatchley knew for inside he was a dynamo his energy contained and channeled flashing in his bright dark eyes he still had his tempers and he retained a tendency to brood when frustrated but these were good signs they produced results he had also switched to mild cigarettes which he smoked sparingly hatchley felt more comfortable with him now even though they remained two distinctly different breeds and he appreciated his bosss grasp of northern informality a workingclass southerner didnt seem so different from a northerner after all now when hatchley called banks sir it was plain by his tone that he was puzzled or annoyed and banks had learned to recognize the dry yorkshire irony that could sometimes be heard in his sergeants voice for his part banks had learned to accept but not to condone the prejudices of his sergeant and to appreciate his doggedness and the sense of threat that he could when called for convey to a reticent suspect bankss menace was cerebral but some people responded better to hatchleys sheer size and gruff voice though he never actually used violence hatchley made criminals believe that perhaps the days of the rubber hose werent quite over the two also worked well together in interrogation suspects would become particularly confused when the big roughandtumble dalesman turned avuncular and banks who didnt even look tall enough to be a policeman raised his voice hells bloody bells i cant see why i have to spend so much time chasing a bloke who just likes to look at a nice pair of knockers said hatchley as the two of them lit cigarettes and sipped coffee banks sighed why was it he wondered that talking to hatchley always made him a moderate socialist feel like a bleedingheart liberal because the women dont want to be looked at he answered tersely hatchley grunted if you saw the way that carol ellis dressed on a satday night at the oak you wouldnt think that her choice sergeant i assume she wears at least some clothes at the oak otherwise youd be derelict in your duty for not pulling her in on indecent exposure charges whatever it is it aint indecent hatchley winked everybody deserves privacy and this peepers violating it banks argued hes breaking the law and were paid to uphold it simple as that he knew that it was far from simple but had neither the patience nor the inclination to enter into an argument about the police in society with sergeant hatchley but its not as if hes dangerous he is to his victims physical violence isnt the only dangerous crime you mentioned the oak just now does the woman often drink there ive seen her there a few times its my local do you think our man might have seen her there too and followed her home if she dresses like you say he might have got excited looking at her do myself hatchley admitted cheerfully but peepings not my line yes its possible remember it was a monday though so well in my experience sir the women dont dress up quite so much on a monday as a satday see they have to go to work the next day so they cant spend all night all right banks said holding up his hand point taken what about the others what about them carol ellis is the fourth there were three others before her did any of them drink at the oak cant remember i do recollect seeing josie campbell there a few times she was one of them wasnt she yes the second look go over the statements and see if you can find out if any of the others were regulars at the oak go talk to them jog their memories look for some kind of a pattern they neednt have been there just prior to the incidents if not find out where they do drink look up where they were before they were peeped on hatchley suggested banks laughed uneasily yes there isnt really a proper word for it is there talking about peeping i saw a smashing bit of stuff coming out of gristhorpes office is he turning into a dirty old man that was dr jenny fuller banks told him shes a psychologist and im going to be working with her on a profile of our peeper lucky you hope the missus doesnt find out youve got a dirty mind sergeant get over to the oak this lunchtime talk to the bar staff find out if anyone paid too much attention to carol ellis or if anyone seemed to be watching her anything odd you know the routine if the lunchtime staffs different get back there tonight and talk to the ones who were in last night and talk to carol ellis again too while its fresh in her mind this is work sir yes at the oak thats what i said hatchley broke into a big grin like a kid whod lost a penny and found a pound ill see what i can do then he said and with that he was off like a shot after all banks thought as he finished his coffee and watched a woman struggle in the doorway with a transparent umbrella it was eleven oclock opening time iv it was a dull journey down the al to leeds and banks cursed himself for not taking the quieter more picturesque minor roads through ripon and harrogate or even further west via grassington skipton and ilkley there always seemed to be hundreds of ways of getting from a to b in the dales none of them direct but the al was usually the fastest route to leeds unless the farmer just north of wetherby exercised his privilege and switched on the red light while he led his cows across the motorway as if the rain werent bad enough there was also the muddy spray from the juggernauts in fronttranscontinentals most of them traveling from newcastle or edinburgh to lille rotterdam milan or barcelona still it was cozy inside the car and he had rigoletto for company at the wetherby roundabout banks turned onto the a leaving most of the lorries behind and drove by collingham bardsey and scarcroft into leeds itself he carried on through roundhay and harehills and arrived in chapeltown halfway through la donna e mobile it was a desolate area and looked even more so swept by dirty rain under the leaden sky amid the heaps of redbrick rubble a few old houses clung on like obstinate teeth in an empty rotten mouth grim shadows in raincoats pushed prams and shoppingcarts along the pavements as if they were looking for shops and homes they couldnt find it was chapeltown road ripper territory host of the race riots crutchleys shop had barred windows and stood next to a boardedup grocers with a faded sign the paintwork was peeling and a layer of dust covered the objects in the window valves from old radios a clarinet resting on the torn red velvet of its case a guitar with four strings a sheathed bayonet with a black swastika inlaid in its handle chipped plates with views of weymouth and lyme regis painted on them a bicycle pump a scattering of beads and cheap rings the door jerked open after initial resistance and a bell pinged loudly as banks walked in the smell of the placea mixture of mildew furniture polish and rotten eggswas overwhelming out of the back came a roundshouldered shiftylooking man wearing a threadbare sweater and woollen gloves with the fingers cut off he eyed banks suspiciously and his can i help you sounded more like a must i help you mr crutchley banks showed his identification and mentioned inspector barnshaw who had first put him onto the lead crutchley was immediately transformed from mr krook into uriah heep anything i can do sir anything at all he whined rubbing his hands together i try to run an honest shop here but he shrugged you know its difficult i cant check on everything people bring in can i of course not banks agreed amiably brushing off a layer of dust and leaning carefully against the dirty counter inspector barnshaw told me hes thinking of letting it go by this time he asked for my advice we know how hard it is in a business like yours he did say that you might be able to help me though of course sir anything at all we think that the jewelry the constable saw in your window was stolen from an old lady in eastvale you could help us and help yourself if you can give me a description of the man who brought it in crutchley screwed up his face in concentrationnot a pretty sight banks thought looking away at the stuffed birds elephantfoot umbrella stands sentimental victorian prints and other junk my memorys not as good as it used to be sir im not getting any younger of course not none of us are are we banks smiled inspector barnshaw said he thought it would be a crying shame if you had to do time for this what with it not being your fault and at your age crutchley darted banks a sharp mean glance and continued to probe his ailing memory he was quite young he said after a few moments i remember that for sure how young would you say banks asked taking out his notebook twenty thirty early twenties id guess had a little mustache he gestured to his upper lip which was covered with about four days stubble a thin one just down to the edge of the mouth at each side like this he added tracing the outline with a grubby finger good banks said encouraging him what about his hair black red brown fair long short sort of medium i mean you wouldnt really call it brown but it wasnt what id call fair either know what i mean banks shook his head praps youd call it light brown very light brown was the mustache the same he nodded yes very faint and how long was his hair that i remember it was short and combedback like he made a brushing gesture with his hand over his own sparse crop any scars moles crutchley shook his head nothing unusual about his complexion a bit pastyfaced and spotty thats all but they all are these days inspector its the food no goodness in it all how tall would you say he was banks cut in bigger than me oh about he put his hand about four inches above the top of his head of course im not so big myself that would make him about fivefootten then about that medium yes fat or thin skinny well they all are these days arent they not properly fed thats the problem clothes ordinary can you be a bit more specific eh was he wearing a suit jeans leather jacket tshirt pajamaswhat oh no it wasnt leather it was that other stuff bit like it only not as smooth brown roughish orrible to touchfair makes your fingers shiver suede thats it suede a brown suede jacket and jeans just ordinary blue jeans and his shirt dont remember i think he kept his jacket zipped up do you remember anything about his voice any mannerisms come again where would you place his accent local like or maybe lancashire i cant tell the difference though there are some as says they can nothing odd about it highpitched deep husky sounded like he smoked too much i can remember that and he did smoke too coughed every time he lit one up really stank up the shop banks passed on that one so he had a smokers cough and a rough voice with a local accent that right thats right sir crutchley was shifting from foot to foot clearly looking forward to the moment when banks would thank him and leave was his voice deep or high kind of medium if you know what i mean like mine yes like yours sir but not the accent you speak proper you do he didnt what do you mean he didnt speak properly did he have some kind of speech impediment banks could see crutchley mentally kicking himself for being so unwisely unctuous as to prolong the interview no nothing like that i just meant like ordinary folks sir not like you like someone who hadnt been properly educated he didnt stutter or lisp did he no sir fine one last question had you ever seen him before no sir inspector barnshaw will want you to look at some photos later today and hes going to ask you to repeat your description to a police artist so do your best keep him in focus and if you see him again or think of anything else id appreciate your getting in touch with me banks wrote down his name and number on a card ill call you sir ill do that if i ever clap eyes on him again crutchley gushed and banks got the distinct impression that his own methods appealed more than barnshaws banks heard the sigh of relief when he closed his notebook and thanked crutchley avoiding a handshake by moving off rather sharply it wasnt a great description and it didnt ring any bells but it would do it would take him closer to the two balaclavawearing thugs who had robbed three old ladies in one month scared them all half to death vandalized their homes and broken the arm of one seventyfiveyearold woman chapter three i the white cortina skidded to a halt outside eastvale community center splashing up a sheet of spray from the curbside puddles sandra banks jumped out ten minutes late pushed open the creaking door as gently as she could and tiptoed in aware of the talk already in progress one or two of the regulars looked around and smiled as they saw her slip as unobtrusively as possible into the empty chair next to harriet slade sorry she whispered putting her hand to the side of her mouth weather damn car wouldnt start harriet nodded youve not missed much however beautiful majestic or overwhelming the landscape appears to your eyes the speaker said remember you have no guarantee that it will turn out well on film in fact most landscape photographyas im sure those of you who have tried it knowturns out to be extremely disappointing the cameras eye differs from the human eye it lacks all the other senses that feed into our experience remember that holiday in majorca or torremolinos remember how wonderful the hills and sea made you feel with their magical qualities of light and color and remember when you got the holiday photos developedif they came out at allhow bad they were how they failed to capture the beauty youd seen whos this sandra whispered to harriet while the speaker paused to sip from the glass of water on the table in front of him a man called terry whigham he does a lot of pictures for the local tourist boardcalendars that kind of thing what do you think it wasnt anything new to sandra but she had more or less dragged poor harriet into the camera club in the first place and she felt that she owed it to her not to sound too smug interesting she answered covering her mouth like a schoolgirl talking in class he puts it very well i think so too harriet agreed i mean it all seems so obvious but you dont think about it till an expert points it out do you so the next time youre faced with penyghent skiddaw or helvellyn terry whigham continued consider a few simple strategies one obvious trick is to get something in the foreground to give a sense of scale its hard to achieve the feeling of immensity you get when you look at a mountain in a fourbyfive color print but a human figure an old barn or a particularly interesting tree in the foreground will add the perspective you need you can also be a bit more adventurous and let textures draw the viewer in a rising slope of scree or a field full of buttercups will lead the eye to the craggy fells beyond and dont be slaves to the sun either mistshrouded peaks or cloud shadows on hillsides can produce some very interesting effects if you get your exposure right and a few fluffy white clouds pep up a bright blue sky no end after this the lights went down and terry whigham showed some of his favorite slides to illustrate the points he had made they were good sandra recognized that but they also lacked the spark the personal signature that she liked to get into her own photographs even at the expense of wellproven rules harriet was a newcomer to the art but so far she had shown a sharp eye for a photograph even if her technique still had a long way to go sandra had met her at a dreadful coffee morning organized by a neighbor selena harcourt and the two had hit it off instantly in london sandra had never been short of lively company but in the north the people had seemed cold and distant until harriet came along with her pixieish features her slight frame and her deep sense of compassion sandra wasnt going to let her go when the slide show was over and terry whigham left the dais to a smattering of applause the club secretary made announcements about the next meeting and the forthcoming excursion to swaledale then coffee and biscuits were served as usual sandra harriet robin allott and norman chester all preferring stronger refreshments adjourned to the mile post across the road sandra found herself sitting between harriet and robin a young college teacher just getting over his divorce opposite sat norman chester who always seemed more interested in the scientific process than the photographs themselves normally such an oddly assorted group would never have come together but they were united in the need for a real drinkespecially after a longish lectureand in their dislike for fred barton the stiff halitoxic club secretary a strict methodist who would no more set foot in a pub than he would brush the dandruff off the shoulders of his dark blue suit whats it to be then norman asked clapping his hands and beaming at everyone they ordered and a few minutes later he returned with the drinks on a tray after the usual around of commentary on the evenings offeringmost of it this time favorable to terry whigham who would no doubt by now be suffering through bartons fawning proximity or jack tatums condescending sycophancyrobin and norman began to argue about the use of color balance filters while sandra and harriet discussed local crime i suppose youve heard from alan about the latest incident harriet said incident what incident you know the fellow who goes around climbing drainpipes and watching women get undressed sandra laughed yes its difficult to know what to call him isnt it voyeur sounds so romantic and peeping tom sounds so daily mirrorish lets just call him the peeper the one who peeps so you have heard yes last night but how do you know about it it was on the radio this afternoon local radio they did an interview with dorothy wycombeyou know the one who made all the fuss about hiring policies in local government i know of her what did she have to say oh just the usual what youd expect said it was tantamount to an act of rape and the police couldnt be bothered to make much of an effort because it only affected women christ sandra said fumbling for a cigarette that woman makes me mad shes not that stupid surely ive respected the way shes dealt with a lot of things so far but this time dont you think youre only getting upset because alans involved harriet suggested i mean that makes it personal doesnt it in a way sandra admitted but it also puts me on the inside and i know that he cares and that hes doing the best he can just as much as he would for any other case what about jim hatchley sandra snorted as far as i know theyre keeping hatchley as far away from the business as possible oh alan gets along with him well enough now theyve both broken each other in so to speak but the mans a boor they surely didnt let him talk to the press oh no at least not as far as i know no names were mentioned she just made it sound as if all the police were sexual deviants well thats a typical attitude isnt it did she call them the pigs too harriet laughed not exactly what do you think of this business anyway i dont really know ive thought about what what i would feel like if he watched me it gives me the shivers its like someone going through your most private memories youd feel soiled used it gives me the creeps too said sandra suddenly aware that the others had finished their own conversations and were listening in with interest but you know harriet went on slowly embarrassed by the larger audience i do feel sorry for him in a way i mean hed have to be very unhappy to go around doing that very frustrated i do think its a bit sad dont you sandra laughed and put her hand on harriets arm harriet slade she said im sure you feel sorry for margaret thatcher every time another thousand people lose their jobs have you never thought that were most likely to find the culprit among ourselves norman suggested that hes probably a member of the club everyones a voyeur you know he announced pushing back a lock of limp dark hair from his pale forehead especially us photographers true enough sandra agreed but we dont spy on people do we what about candids norman replied ive done it often enough myselfshoot from the hip when you think theyre not looking women undressing good lord no tramps asleep on park benches old men chatting on a bridge courting couples sunbathing it really is a kind of spying though isnt it robin cut in but its not the same norman argued youre not invading someones privacy when theyre in a public place like a park or a beach are you its not as if they think theyre alone in their own bedrooms and anyway youre doing it for an artistic purpose not just for a sexual thrill im not always sure theres much of a difference robin said besides it was you who suggested it suggested what that it might be a member of the clubthat were all voyeurs norman colored and reached for his drink i did didnt i perhaps it wasnt a very funny remark oh i dont know sandra said i could certainly see jack tatum staring through bedroom windows harriet shivered yes every time he looks at you you feel like he can see right through your clothes im sure the peepers someone much more ordinary though sandra said it always seems the case that people who do the most outlandish things live quite normal lives most of the time i suppose a policemans wife would know about things like that robin said no more than anyone who can read a book theyre all over the place arent they biographies of the yorkshire ripper dennis nilsen brady and hindley youre not suggesting the peepers as dangerous as that are you norman asked i dont know all i can say is that its a bloody weird thing to do and i dont understand it do you think he understands it himself robin asked probably not replied sandra thats why harriet feels sorry for him isnt it dear youre a beast harriet said and flicked a few drops of lager and lime in her direction sandra bought the next around and the conversation shifted to the upcoming club trip to swaledale and a recent exhibition at the national museum of photography in bradford when they had all said their goodbyes sandra dropped harriet off and carried on home turning into the driveway she was surprised to hear no opera coming from the front room and even a little angry to find brian and tracy still up watching a risqué film on channel it was almost eleven oclock and alan wasnt back yet ii if you picture the yorkshire dales as a splayed hand pointing east then you will find eastvale close to the tip of the middle finger the town stands at the eastern limit of swainsdale a long valley which starts in the precipitous fells of the west and broadens into meandering rivermeadows in the east drystone walls crisscross the lower valleysides like ancient runes until in some places the grassy slopes rise steeply into long sheer cliffs known locally as scars at their summits they flatten out to become wild lonely moorlands covered in yellow gorse and pinkish ling crossed only by unfenced minor roads where horned sheep wander and the wind always rages the rock is mostly limestone which juts through in graywhite scars and crags that change hue with the weather like pearls rolled under candlelight here and there a more sinister outcrop of dark millstone grit thrusts out or layers of shale and sandstone streak an old quarry eastvale itself is a busy market town of about fourteen thousand people it slopes up from swainsdales eastern edge where the river swain turns southeast toward the ouse rises to a peak at castle hill then drops gradually eastward in a series of terraces past the river and the railway tracks the town is certainly picturesque it has a cobbled market square complete with ancient cross andnorman church treeshaded river falls somber castle ruins and excavations going back to preroman times but it has some less salubrious areas that tourists never visit among them the east side estate a sprawl of council housing put up in the sixties and declining fast a visitor sitting in the flower gardens on the western bank of the river swain would probably be surprised at some of the things that go on across the river beyond the poplars and the row of renovated georgian houses stretch about fifty yards of grass and trees called the green and beyond that lies the east side estate amid the graffitiscarred walls abandoned prams and tires uncontrolled dogs and scruffy children the inhabitants of the overcrowded estate try to survive the failure of the towns two main industries outside of tourisma woollen mill on the river to the northwest and a chocolate factory near the eastern boundary some are quiet peaceloving families who keep themselves to themselves and try to make ends meet on the dole but others are violent and angry a mixed bunch of deadbeats alcoholics wife beaters child abusers and junkies drawing the east side beat as it is known in the police station is a duty most young constables do their utmost to avoid of course there had been protests over the councils plan but the sixties was an era of optimism and new ideas so the houses went up it was also a period of rank political corruption so many councillors enjoyed holidays abroad at the expense of various contractors and a great deal of taxfree money changed hands meanwhile the tenants crammed into their terrace blocks towers and maisonettes just had to put up with the flimsy walls inadequate heating and faulty plumbing many thought themselves lucky they were living in the country at last the railway track raised high on its embankments ran north to south and cut right through the estate giving its passengers a fine view of the overgrown back gardens with their lines of washing tiny greenhouses and rabbit hutches several low narrow tunnels ran under the tracks to link one part of the estate to another and it was in one of these that trevor sharp and mick webster stood smoking and discussing business the tunnel had been christened gluesniffers ginnel by the estates residents because of the great numbers of plastic bags that littered its pathway it was a dark place lit at one end by a jaundiced streetlamp and it reeked of glue dog piss and stale vomit locals avoided it mick webster whatever one might call him was not one of the gluesniffers naturally he had tried it along with just about everything else but he had decided it was for the birds it dulled the brain and made you spotty like lenny not that lenny sniffed glue thoughhe just ate too much greasy fish and chips mick preferred those little red pills that lenny seemed to possess in abundance the ones that made his heart race and made him feel like superman he was a squat loutish sixteenyearold with a pug nose a skinhead crop and a permanent sneer people crossed the street when they saw him coming trevor on the other hand was not the kind of boy that the average townsperson would take for a bad sort he was quite handsome like his father and was a slave to fashion in neither clothing nor haircut because he was regarded as an exceptionally hard case nobody ever ragged him about his neat conservative appearance the from harrogate rattled overhead and trevor lit another cigarette lenny says its time we stopped it with the old dears and got onto something a bit more profitable mick announced kicking at some shards of broken glass like what like doing houses proper houses where rich folk live when theyre out like lenny says he can let us know where and when ail we got to do is get in pick up the gear and get out what about burglar alarms they aint got burglar alarms mick said scornfully peaceful little place this is never have any crime trevor thought it over when do we start when lenny gives us a tip lennys been taking too much of a cut mick it hardly makes it worth our while youd better ask him to give us a bigger percentage if were gonna get onto this lark yeah yeah all right it wasnt a new subject and mick was getting tired of trevors constant harping besides he was too scared of lenny to mention anything about it how are we going to break in trevor asked i dont fucking know window back door lennyll give us what we need itll be people on holidays or away for the weekend that kind of thing dead easy he keeps his ear to the ground got the money for that last lot oh nearly forgot mick grinned and pulled out a wad of bills from his hip pocket he said he only got fifty for the gear thats ten quid for you and ten for me trevor shook his head its not right mick thats sixty percent hes taking and how do we know he only got fifty quid for it looked like it was worth nearer a hundred to me we believe him cos hes my fucking brother thats why mick said getting nettled and without him we wouldnt be able to get rid of any of the stuff we wouldnt get nothing man so forty percent of what he does is better than a hundred percent of fuck all right we could fence it ourselves it cant be that difficult how many times do i have to tell you you need the contacts lennys got contacts you cant just walk into one of those wanky antique shops on market street and ask the geezer if he wants to buy a pile of stolen jewelry or a fancy camera can you i just dont think it can be all that difficult thats all look weve got a nice little racket going here lets leave it the way it is ill try and get us up to fifty percent all right trevor shrugged okay did i tell you lennys got a shooter mick went on excitedly no whered he get it from down the smoke this bloke what owns a club in soho big fucker it is too just like on telly does it work of course it works what goods a shooter that dont work have you tried it do you know it works of course i havent fucking tried it what do you expect me to do walk downtown on market day and start fucking target practice so you dont know for sure if it works mick sighed and explained as if to a small child these blokes down the smoke they dont give you dud shooters do they wouldnt be in their interest what kind is it i dont fucking know a big one like the ones on telly like that one clint eastwood carries in those dirty harry flicks a magnum thats right one of those powerful shooter trevor said seeing as this is a fortyfour magnum the most powerful handgun in the world and can blow your head clean off you gotta ask yourself punk do i feel lucky today well do ya punk the dirty harry impersonation went down very well and the two traded shooting noises until the to ripon clattered overhead and drowned them out iii look before we start jenny fuller said id like to tell you that i know why i was chosen to help on this case oh said banks what do you mean you know damn well what i mean dont think i didnt notice that eye contact between you and gristhorpe this morning there are at least two male professors in the area better qualified to deal with this kind of thingboth experts on deviant psychology you wanted a woman because it looks good in the public eye and you wanted me because ive had connections with dorothy wycombe they were lounging comfortably in armchairs by the crackling fire banks cradling a pint of bitter jenny a half its not that i mind she went on i just want you to know i dont like being taken for a fool point taken and another thing you neednt imagine im going to go reporting to dorothy wycombe on everything that goes on im a professional not a snooper ive been asked to help and i intend to do my best good so now we know where we stand im glad you said that because i didnt feel too happy about working with a spy whatever the circumstances jenny smiled and her whole face lit up she really was an extraordinarily beautiful woman banks thought feeling rather distressing tugs of desire as he watched her shift her body in the chair she was wearing tight jeans and a simple white tshirt under a loose lemon jacket her dark red hair spilled over her shoulders banks himself had paid more attention than usual to his appearance that evening at least as much more attention as he could without giving sandra cause for suspicion over a hasty supper he had told her he would be spending the evening with dr fuller discussing the psychological angle of the peeper case getting ready he had resisted the temptation to apply some of the unopened cologne a distant relative had bought him several christmases ago and settled instead for a close shave and a liberal application of right guard he had also taken care to smooth down his short black hair even though it was always cut so close to the skull that it never got a chance to stand on end he had arrived at the queens arms at least ten minutes before jenny was duenot simply because he didnt believe in keeping a woman waiting but because he didnt like the idea of her waiting alone in a pub even a place as congenial as the queens arms when she walked in five minutes late all the heads at the bar turned in her direction so where do we start he asked lighting a cigarette and opening his notebook oh put that thing away jenny protested lets keep this informal while we build up some kind of a picture ill give you a full report when ive got things worked out thus admonished banks put away his notebook what are your own ideas she asked i know im supposed to be the expert but id like to know what you think there was a slightly taunting tone in her voice and he wondered if she was trying to draw him out make a fool of him it was probably just her seminar manner he decided like doctors have bedside manners teachers have classroom manners im afraid i wouldnt know where to begin let me help do you think the women ask for it by the way they dress it was a loaded question exactly the one he had expected they might well be inviting someone to try and pick them up in a normal civilized way he answered but of course theyre not inviting voyeurs or rapists no he could tell that she approved by the way she looked at him on the other hand he went on just to provoke her if they walk in dark alleys after ten oclock at night dressed in high heels miniskirts and lowcut blouses then id say they were at least being foolish if not asking for something so you do think they ask for it she accused him green eyes flashing not at all i just think that people especially women ought to be more careful these days we all know what the cities are like and theres no longer any reason to think a place like eastvale is immune from sex offenders but why shouldnt we be able to go where we want when we want and dressed how we want you should in a perfect world this isnt a perfect world well thank you for pointing that out to me bit of a philosopher arent you i do my best look is this what you want some kind of sparring match over womens issues i thought you were playing straight with me all right so im a man guilty and i can never in a million years fully understand what its like to be a woman but im not a narrowminded hypocrite at least i dont think i am so dont treat me like one okay im sorry im not really a shrill virago either im just interested in mens attitudes thats all its my fieldmale and female masculine and feminine psychology similarities differences thats why they thought i was the next best thing to a brilliant ideally qualified man for this job she laughed at herself and banks laughed with her then she held out her hands as if holding up a clapperboard snapped them together and said banks and fuller cooperationtake two more drinks first though no ill get them this time enjoying the slow feline grace of her movements banks watched her walk to the bar and lean on it as the barman drew the beer when she got back she smiled and put the drinks on the table right she said down to business what do you want to know a great deal well thatll take a long time im sure itll be time well spent jenny smiled in agreement yes she said i do believe youre right to cut through the silence that followed banks put his first question is there any chance of this peeper moving onto more violent sex acts mmmm jenny said im afraid im going to seem as noncommittal as any scientist on some of these matters according to most of the evidence voyeurism in itself isnt regarded as a very serious disorder and its unlikely to spiral into other forms but but its only unlikely according to existing evidence all that means is that we dont have many documented cases of voyeurs becoming rapistspeeping is usually about as far as they can go it doesnt mean there are no cases though and it doesnt mean that your man might not be one of them something could snap if just looking ceases to give him what he needs he could either break down or turn to other more aggravated forms of sexual violence ill see if i can look up some case histories for you you call it violence but he hasnt physically hurt anyone i call it violence purposely because thats what it is look at it this way we all like to watch the opposite sex men more than womenand i think i can safely say that your peepers definitely not a woman so why do men do this theres always the sense in childhood of not being permitted to look at a womans body so it becomes mysterious and desirable you dont need a degree in psychology to figure out why men like breasts for exampletheyre one of the first sources of love and nourishment we ever experience okay so far banks nodded so we all like to look you look at women in the street they seem to dress just to make you look at them and why not it makes the world go round keeps the race going but at what point does looking the kind we all doand women these days now and then glance at a mans bum or the bulge in his pantsbecome voyeurism in the streets in pubs in all public places its fine theres an implicit permission to look we even have special places such as stripclubs which legitimize the voyeuristic impulseall quite legal but when a woman is in her bedroom getting undressed for bed unless shes doing it for her husband or lover she doesnt want anyone to watch often enough she doesnt even want her husband to watch the permission is no longer there and to look then is an act of sexual violence because its an intrusion a violation a penetration into her world it degrades her by turning her into an object am i making myself clear very banks said what does the voyeur get out of it then why does he do it theyre both very difficult questions to answer for one thing hes getting power over her a certain triumph in dehumanizing her and perhaps hes also getting revenge for some past wrong that he imagines women have done him at the same time hes reenacting a primal sexual scene whatever it was that first excited him he just keeps on repeating himself because its the only way he can achieve sexual pleasure you see how complicated it is when the voyeur penetrates his victims privacy then he dominates her and the element of risk of sin involved only endows that act with a special intensity for him does your man masturbate while hes watching i dont know we havent found any traces of semen have you looked the lab boys have been brought in on every incident im sure if it was there theyd find it okay it doesnt really matter i suppose his pants would act as a prophylacticeither that or he stores the image and masturbates later what kind of person are we talking about his personality yes again im going to have to be a bit vague he could be an introvert or an extrovert tall or short thin or fat thats certainly vague jenny laughed yes it is sorry but theres no one type in a way its much easier to describe the true psychopatha sex murderer for example a voyeurthe scientific term is scopophiliac by the wayis not simply a grubby loner in a dirty raincoat our mans actions are caused by frustration basically intense frustration with life in general and with relationships in particular it might be that the most meaningful early sexual experience he had was voyeuristiche saw something he shouldnt have seen like his parents making loveand since then everythings been a letdown especially sex hed certainly have difficulty handling the real thing what makes voyeurism or scopophilia what we call abnormal is simply that the scopophiliac gets all his gratification from looking nobody would deny that looking is an integral part of the sex act lots of men like to watch their partners undress it excites them plenty of men like to go to stripclubs too and whatever the womens movement thinks of that nobody would seriously consider such men to be clinically abnormal the scopophiliac though gets stuck at the pregenital stagehis development gets shortcircuited whatever relationship hes living inalone with a wife or a dominating mother or fatherits essentially a frustrating one and he probably feels great pressure an intense desire to break through its unlikely that hes married but if he is there are serious problems in all probability though hes living alone his sexuality wouldnt be mature enough to deal with the demands of a real fleshandblood woman unless shes a particularly unusual person herself i see said banks lighting a cigarette it doesnt look like its going to be easy does it no it never is when it comes to people were all such incredibly complex beings oh i always thought of myself as simple and straightforward youre probably one of the most complex of the lot alan banks first off whats a nice man like you doing in the police force earning a living and trying to uphold the law see simple would you uphold a law you didnt believe in i dont know what if the law said that anyone caught stealing a loaf of bread should lose his or her hand would you actively go looking for people stealing bread i think that in that kind of society i wouldnt be a policeman oh what an evasive answer banks shrugged what can i say at least its an honest one all right what about the drug laws what about students smoking pot what are you asking me do you pester them do you think people should be prosecuted for smoking pot as long as its against the law yes if you want to know whether i agree with every law in the country the answers no theres a certain amount of discretion allowed in the enforcement you know we dont tend to bother students smoking pot so much these days but we are interested in people bringing heroin up from london or the midlands why shouldnt a person take heroin if he or she wants to it doesnt hurt anyone else i could well ask why shouldnt a man go around watching women get undressed that doesnt hurt anyone either its not the same thing and you know it besides the woman is hurt shes shocked degraded only the ones who know what think of it this way so far four incidents have been reported how many do you think have gone unnoticed how many times has he got away with it i never really thought of that jenny admitted and by the way im not going to forget our discussion of a few moments ago before you so cleverly sidetracked me back to work she smiled sharply at him as he went off to buy two more drinks i suppose she said when banks returned that he could actually do it every night though i doubt it why most sexual activities normal or perverted require a kind of gestation period between acts it varies the pressure builds again and theres only one way to relieve it i see would once or twice a week be too much for who you or me dont distract me for our man no id say once a week might do him fine two at the most she broke into a fit of laughter and covered her mouth with her hand sorry i get a bit gigglish sometimes i think you must make me nervous it comes with the job though i sometimes wonder which came first a chicken or egg thing do i make people nervous because ive learned to do it unconsciously through dealing with so many criminals or was i like that in the first place is that why the job suited me well i didnt say i knew the answer only that i wonder sometimes dont worry when you get to know me better it wont bother you a promise lets get back to business all right jenny wiped her eyes full of tears of laughter sat up straight and once again broke into a laughing fit banks watched her smiling and soon the others in the pub were looking jenny was turning as red as her hair which was shaking like the fire in the grate oh im sorry i really am she said whenever i get like this its so hard to stop you must think im a real idiot not at all banks said dryly i appreciate a person with a sense of humor i think its better now she said sipping cautiously at her half of bitter its just all those double entendres oops she said putting her hand to her chest now ive got hiccups drink a glass of water in an inverted position banks told her best cure for hiccups ive ever known jenny frowned at him standing on my head no not like that banks was just about to demonstrate to her using his pint glass when he sensed a shadow over the table and heard a polite cough it was fred rowe the station desksergeant pardon me for bothering you sir rowe said quietly pulling up a chair but theres been some trouble go on banks said putting down his glass its an old woman sir shes been found dead cause we cant say yet sir but it looks suspicious the friend who reported it said the place had been robbed all right thanks fred ill get right over address number two gallows view thats down by yes i know it look get onto sergeant hatchley hell be in the oak and get dr glendenning and the photographer out there and as many of the sceneofcrime boys as you can rustle up better get dc richmond along too does the super know yes sir fine tell him im on my way then sergeant rowe returned to the station and banks stood up to leave making his apologies to jenny then he remembered that sandra had taken the cortina dammit he cursed ill have to go over and sign out a car cant i drive you jenny offered i know where gallows view is would you of course youre probably over the limit anyway ive only been drinking halves youll have to keep out of the way stay in the car i understand right then lets go yes sir jenny said saluting him chapter four i it had stopped raining only an hour earlier and the air was still damp and chilly trevor held his jacket collar tight around his neck as he set off across the green thinking over what mick had said past the georgian semis he crossed the fourteenthcentury bridge and spat in the water that cascaded over the terraced falls then he strode through the riverside gardens and took the road that curved around castle hill to the market square sometimes mick scared him not his physical presence but his stupidity there would be no increased percentage from lenny trevor was certain because mick wouldnt even dare ask him trevor would he wasnt frightened of lenny gun or no gun the gun didnt really interest him at all it seemed more like a silly toy for mick to show off about it was the pills most likely them and natural stupidity trevor was sick of seeing mick sweating and ranting on hopping from one foot to the other as if he wanted to piss all the time it was pathetic he hadnt tried them himself though he thought he might one day after all he wasnt mick they wouldnt affect him the same way he hadnt tried sex either mick kept boasting about having it off with some scrubber up against an alley wall but trevor was unimpressed even if it was true it wasnt the kind of fun he was interested in he would do it all drugs sex whatever all in his own sweet time and he would know when the time was right as for the new idea it made sense old people seemed to have nothing worth much these days probably had to pawn all their old keepsakes just to keep them in pabulum trevor laughed at the image the first time it had been fun a change from dipping or mugging the odd touristjust doing my bit for the tourist board your honor trying to make the new yorkers feel at homeit was exciting being able to do whatever you wanted in somebody elses house break stuff and them too feeble to do a thing about it not that trevor was a bully he would never touch the old women more out of disgust than kindness though that was micks specialtymick was a bully this would be something different the old folks houses all smelled of the past lavender water vicks chest rub commodes old dead skin this time they would be in the classy homes places with vcrs fancy music centers dishwashers freezers full of whole cows they could take their time enjoy it maybe even do some real damage after all they wouldnt be able to carry everything away best stick to the portables cash jewelry silver gold he could just imagine mick and lenny being stupid enough to try and sell stolen color tellys and videos at eastvale market these days everyone wrote their bloody names and zip codes on everything from microwaves to washingmachines with those ultraviolet pens and the cops could read them under special lights he hoped mick was right about burglar alarms too it seemed that people were becoming very securityconscious these days he crossed the south side of the deserted market square and walked through the complex of narrow twisted streets to king street then he cut through leaview estate toward gallows view the terrace of old cottages stood like a wizened finger pointing west to the dales as he passed the bungalows and crossed cardigan drive to the dirt track in front of the cottages trevor noticed some activity outside the first house number two that was where the old bag matlock lived he walked by slowly and saw a crowd of people through the open door there was that hotshot copper from london banks whod got his picture in the local paper when hed got the job a few months back that wellknown local thug hatchley who looked a bit unsteady on his pins and the woman standing in the doorway what on earth was she doing there he was sure it was her the one who lived in the fancy georgian semis across the green from the east side estate the one mick was always saying hed like to fuck maybe she was a cop too you never could tell he walked into number eight to confront his father once again over homework not done ii jenny who had disobeyed bankss orders and stood unobserved in the doorway had never seen a corpse before and this one looked particularly bad its wrinkled bluishgray face was frozen in a grimace of anger and pain and pools of dark blood had coagulated under the head on the stone flags of the room alice matlock lay on her back at the foot of a table on the corner of which it appeared she had fractured her skull while falling backwards these were only appearances though jenny realized and the battery of experts arriving in dribs and drabs would soon piece together what had really happened despite the horror of the scene jenny felt outside it all taking in the little details as an objective observer perhaps she thought that was one of the qualities that made her a good psychologist the ability to stand outside the flux of human emotions and pay careful attention outside looking in perhaps it also made her not so acceptable as a womanat least one or two of her lovers had complained that however enjoyable she was in bed and however much fun she was to be with they felt that they couldnt really get close to her and were always aware of themselves being studied like subjects in a mysterious experiment jenny brushed aside the selfcriticism if she didnt conform to mens ideas of what a woman should befainting crying subjective irrational intuitive sentimentalthen screw them the house was oppressive not just because of the allpervading presence of death but because it was absolutely cluttered with the past the walls seemed unusually honeycombed with little alcoves nooks and crannies where painted easter eggs and silver teaspoons from rhyll or morecambe nestled alongside old snuff boxes delicate china figurines a ship in a bottle yellowed birthday cards and miniatures the mantelpiece was littered with sepia photographs family groups stiff and formal before the camera four women in nurses uniforms standing in front of an oldfashioned army ambulance and the remaining wall space seemed taken up by framed samplers and watercolors of wildflowers birds and butterflies jenny shuddered her own house though structurally old was sparse and modern inside it would drive her crazy to live in a mausoleum like this she watched banks at work as she had expected he was professional and efficient but he often seemed distracted and sometimes a look of pain and sadness crossed his features when he leaned against the wall and gazed at the old womans body the photographer popped his flash from every angle he looked far too young jenny thought to be so matteroffact about death the doctor one of those older cigarettesmoking types who pay house calls when you have flu or tonsillitis busied himself with thermometers charts and other tools of his trade out of decency jenny turned away and tried to name the wildflowers depicted on the walls she felt invisible standing by the doorway arms folded across her breasts everyone seemed to think she had come with banks nobody even paid her the slightest bit of attention no one that is except the slightly drunk detective she had seen earlier on her visit to the station who occasionally cast lecherous glances in her direction jenny ignored him and watched the men at work also in the midst of this routine robotic activity sat ethel carstairs who had discovered the body though trembling and white with shock as she sipped the brandy a police constable had brought her from alice s medicinal bottle in the kitchen she had regained enough control to talk to banks alice was supposed to call on me this evening said ethel in a weak shaky voice she always comes on sundays and tuesdays we play rummy shes not on the phone so when she didnt come there wasnt much i could do as time went on i got worried then i decided to walk over and see if she was all right she was eightyseven just last week inspector i bought her that sugar bowl broken on the floor there it looked as if someone had pulled all the drawers out of the old oak sideboard and a pretty rosepatterned sugar bowl lay in several places on the flags she always did have a sweet tooth despite what the doctor told her ethel went on pausing to wipe her eyes with a laceedged handkerchief is this exactly how you found her banks asked gently yes i didnt touch a thing i watch a lot of telly inspector i know about fingerprints and all that i just stood in the doorway there saw her and all the mess and went to the box on the corner of cardigan drive and phoned the police banks nodded good you did exactly the right thing what about the door what the door you must have touched it to get in oh yes silly of me im sorry but i did have to open the door i must have smudged all the prints banks smiled over at vic manson who was busy dusting the furniture with aluminium powder dont worry mrs carstairs manson assured her whoever it was probably wore gloves the criminals watch a lot of telly these days too we have to look though just in case the door banks went on was it ajar open locked it was just open i knocked first then when i got no answer i tried the handle and it just opened theres no sign of forced entry sir added detective constable richmond who had been examining the doorframe beside jenny whoever it was she must have let them in hatchley came down from his search of the upper rooms he wasnt irredeemably drunk only about two sheets to the wind and like most professionals he could snap back into gear in a crisis its been gone over pretty thoroughly he said to banks wardrobe drawers laundry chest the lot do you know if mrs matlock owned anything of value mrs carstairs banks asked its miss matlock inspector alice was a spinster she never married so she has no immediate family nobody she outlived them all did she own anything valuable not really what youd call valuable inspector not to anyone else that is there was some silverwareshe kept that in the sideboard cupboard bottom shelf the cupboard door gaped open and there was no sign of cutlery among the bricabrac scattered on the flags but her most valuable possessions were these ethel gestured toward the knickknacks and photographs that filled the room her memories what about money did she keep much cash in the house she used to keep a bit around just for emergencies she usually kept it in the bottom drawer of her dressing table how much did she have there as a rule oh not much about fifty pounds or so banks glanced at hatchley who shook his head its a mess up there he said if there was any money its gone now do you think our man or men knew where to look not by the looks of it hatchley answered they searched everywhere same pattern as the other breakins yes banks said quietly almost to himself the victims always let them in youd think older people would be more careful these days prosopagnosia announced jenny who had been listening carefully to all this pardon banks said seeming as surprised to see her there as she was by the sound of her own voice the others looked around too with an angry glance banks introduced her dr fuller shes helping us with a case everyone smiled or nodded and went back to work can you explain it then banks asked prosopagnosia its the inability to recognize faces people sometimes get it after brain damage but its most common in senility i dont quite see the connection alice wasnt senile young lady ethel carstairs cut in but its true that she was beginning to forget little daytoday things and the past was much closer to her jenny nodded i didnt mean to be insulting mrs carstairs i just meant its part of the aging process it happens to us all sooner or later she turned back to banks most of us when we see a face compare it with our files of known faces we either recognize it or we dont all in about a split second with prosopagnosia the observer can see all the components of the face but cant assemble the whole to check against memory files it makes elderly people vulnerable to strangers thats why i mentioned it you mean she might have thought she recognized whoever it was banks asked or thought she should have and not wanted to be rude thats the most common problem if youre a kind polite person youll want to avoid giving offense so youll pretend you know who it is its like when you forget the name of an acquaintance and find ways of avoiding having to say it only this must be much worse dr glendenning packed up his battered brown bag lit a cigarettestrictly forbidden at the scene of a crime but generally overlooked in his caseand shambled over to banks and jenny dead about twentyfour hours he said out of the corner of his mouth in a nicotineravaged voice with a strong trace of edinburgh in it cause of death fractured skull most likely inflicted by that table edge there can you tell if she was pushed looks like it one or two bruises on the upper arms and shoulders thats just preliminary though cant tell you more till after the autopsy but unless the old dear was poisoned too i shouldnt imagine therell be much more to tell you can get her to the morgue now therell be a coroners inquest of course he said and walked out everybody had finished manson had plenty of fingerprints to play with most of them probably alice matlocks and the other two sceneofcrime boys had envelopes filled with hairs fragments of clothing and blood scrapings you can go now mrs carstairs banks said id appreciate it if youd drop by the station in the morning and give a formal statement he called detective constable richmond to drive ethel home and instructed him also to pick her up in the morning and take her statement right then im off home too banks said in a tired voice its up to you now sergeant see theres someone posted here all night deal with the ambulance and you might as well start talking to the neighbors theyll still be up curiositys a great cause of insomnia do gallows view and the six end bungalows over the street here the rest can wait till tomorrow remember the doctor puts the time of death at about twentyfour hours agolets say between ten oclock and midnight last night find out if anyone saw or heard anything okay hatchley nodded glumly then his expression brightened when he saw richmond leading ethel carstairs outside dont be long lad he said baring his yellow teeth in what passed for a smile ive got work for you to do banks and jenny left she was surprised that he didnt vent his anger at her disobedience but they broke the silence in the car only to arrange another meeting to work on the profile later in the week then she dropped him off and drove home unable to get the image of alice matlocks body out of her mind iii detective constable philip richmond was almost as pleased with his recent promotion to the cid as he was with his new mustache the latter made him look older more distinguished and the former more important successful he had worn the uniform driven the panda cars and walked the beat in eastvale for as long as he cared to and he had an intimate knowledge of every alley snicket and back street in the town every lovers lane every villains hangout and every pub where visiting squaddies from catterick camp were likely to cut up a bit rough at closing time he also knew gallows view the cottages at the far western edge of the town developers had petitioned for their demolition especially when leaview estate was under construction but the council under pressure from the parks and monuments commission had reluctantly decided that they could stay there were after all only five cottages and two of those at the western end of the street had been knocked together into a shop and living quarters richmond had often bought gobstoppers tizer and luckybags there as a lad later graduating to cigarettes which the owner would often trade him for his mothers coupons giving threepence off tide or stardrops richmond stood in the street drawing his raincoat tighter to keep out the chill and cursed that damned slave driver hatchley to himself the bastard was probably guzzling the dead womans medicinal brandy while his junior paid the house calls in the rain well blow him richmond thought damned if hes going to get credit for anything i come up with resigned he knocked on the door of number four which was opened almost immediately by an attractive young woman holding the lapels of her dressing gown close around her throat richmond showed his identification proudly stroked his mustache and followed her indoors the place might be an old cottage he thought but by heck theyd done a good job on the inside doubleglazing central heating stucco walls nice framed paintings a bit abstract for his taste but none of your woolworths tat and one of those glasstopped coffee tables between two tubeandcushion armchairs he accepted her offer of coffeeit would help keep him awakebut was surprised at how long she took to make it and at the odd whirring noises he heard coming from the kitchen when he finally got to taste the coffee he knew it was made from freshground beans filterdripped and it tasted delicious she put a coaster on the low table in front of hima wild flower wood sorrel he guessed pressed between two circles of glass the circumference bound in bamboothen at last he was able to get down to business first he took her name andrea rigby and discovered that she lived there with her husband a systems analyst who was often away during the week working on projects in london or bristol they had lived in gallows view for three years ever since he had landed the wellpaying job and been able to fulfill his dream of country living the woman had an italian or spanish look about her richmond couldnt decide which but her maiden name was smith and she came originally from leominster whats happened andrea asked is it miss matlock next door yes richmond answered unwilling to give away too much did you know her i wouldnt say i knew her not well at any rate we said hello to each other and i went to the shops a few times for her when she was ill last year were interested to know if you heard anything odd last night between ten and midnight mrs rigby last night let me see that was monday wasnt it ronnie had gone back down to london i just sat around reading and watching television i do remember hearing someone running in the street over in cardigan drive it must have been about eleven because the news had finished and id been watching an old film for about half an hour then i turned it off because it was boring someone running thats all yes you didnt go to the window and look out no why should i it was probably just kids richmond jotted in his notebook anything else did you hear any sounds from next door i thought i heard someone knocking at a door after the running but i cant be sure it sounded muffled distant im sorry i really wasnt paying attention how long after the running right after the one stopped then i heard the other did the running fade into the distance or stop abruptly andrea thought for a moment more abruptly really as soon as people or cars or anything pass the corner of our street you cant hear them anymore so it doesnt mean much did you hear any sounds at all from miss matlocks next door no nothing but then i never do not even when her friend comes to see her i can hear knocking at the door but nothing from inside the way these old places were built the walls are very thick and we both have our staircases back to back so theres quite a gap really between her living room and mine i sometimes hear the stairs creak when shes going up to bed but thats all richmond nodded closing his notebook you havent noticed anyone hanging around here lately have you kids a stranger andrea shook her head richmond couldnt think of anymore questions and it was getting latehe still had others to talk to he thanked andrea rigby for her excellent coffee then went to knock at number six the door opened a crack and a man wearing thick glasses peered out once richmond had gained entry he recognized henry wooller the branch librarian a bit of an oddball loner dry stick woollers house was a tip scraps of newspaper dirty plates worn socks and halffull cups of tea with clumps of mold floating in them were strewn all over the room and the place stank an acrid animal smell richmond noticed the corner of a pornographic magazine sticking out from under the sunday times review section where it had probably been hastily hidden it was one he recognized imported from denmark and the uncy of its name bignbouncy was clearly visible wooller made a pretense of tidying things up a bit and was careful to hide the magazine completely richmond asked the same questions hed put to andrea rigby but wooller insisted that he had heard nothing at all it was true that he was one cottage further from cardigan drive which ran at right angles to the easternmost end of gallows view along the western edge of leaview estate but richmond didnt think the distance was a factor he felt not only that wooller didnt want to get involved a common enough reaction to police inquiries but also that he was hiding something the expression behind the distorting glasses however remained fixed and deadpan wooller was giving nothing away richmond thanked him cursorily and left making a note of his dissatisfaction the entrance to the living quarters of the shop was what used to be the door to number eight hearing voices raised richmond paused outside hoping to learn something of value he could only catch the odd wordthe door must have been thick or perhaps they were in the backbut it didnt take long to work out that a young lad was being told off for staying out too late and for not spending enough time on his schoolwork richmond smiled feeling an immediate sympathy for the boy how many times had he heard the same sermon himself when he knocked the voices stopped immediately and the door was opened abruptly graham sharp looked worried when he found out that a policeman wanted to see him everybody did richmond reflected and it usually meant nothing more than an outstanding parking ticket no i didnt know her well he said she came in here to do some of her shopping it was convenient for her i suppose but she kept herself to herself what happened to her did you hear anything around eleven oclock last night richmond asked no nothing sharp answered i was watching telly in the room upstairs weve converted one of the old bedrooms into a kind of sitting room its right at the western end as far as you can get in eastvale without being in a field so i wouldnt be able to hear anything from cardigan drive way noticed anything odd lately any strangers kids hanging about no no newcomers in the shop nobody asking questions only you sharp smiled tightly clearly relieved to see richmond pocketing his notebook could i speak to your son for a moment sir richmond asked before leaving my son sharp echoed sounding nervous again what for hes just a young lad only fifteen he might be able to help very well sharp called trevor from upstairs and the boy slouched down moodily where were you at about eleven oclock last night richmond asked he was here with me sharp butted in didnt i already tell you we were upstairs watching telly richmond flipped back through his notebook mostly for effect because his memory was good you told me that you were upstairs watching television sir you didnt say anything about your son well thats what i meant i just took it for granted i mean where else would he be at that time he put his arm around trevors shoulder the boy winced visibly well richmond addressed trevor its like he says we were watching telly not much else to do around here is there richmond thanked them both and left again jotting down his reservations in his book and also noting that he thought he recognized trevor sharp from somewhere all in all it wasnt turning out to be a bad evenings haul already he was enjoying the responsibility of interrogation and feeling less vitriolic toward sergeant hatchley nobody was at home in the first two houses on cardigan drive residents of two of the others had been out late at a club fundraiser the previous evening and the remaining two had heard somebody running past at about eleven but neither had looked out of their windows nor heard anyone knocking on alice matlocks door richmond who had thought to show some keenness by doing more than the first six houses was beginning to tire a little by then and as hed done his duty he decided to report back to hatchley he found the sergeant sitting in alice matlocks armchair his feet up on the stool snoring loudly the body was gone and all that remained were the chalk outline on the worn flags and the pools of dried blood the place was still dusty with mansons aluminium powder the level in the brandy bottle had dropped considerably richmond coughed and hatchley opened a bloodshot eye ah back already lad just thinking about the case taking in the atmosphere done all the houses richmond nodded good lad i think wed better be off now youll need your beauty sleep for all the report writing youve got to do in the morning inspector banks said to leave someone on duty here sir did he yes of course one of the uniformed blokes look you hang on here and ill call the station on my way someone should be down in about fifteen minutes all right lad weary cold and wet richmond mumbled yes sir and settled down to comfort himself with thoughts of the beautiful andrea rigby not more than about seven or eight feet away from him through the wall taking out his notebook he thought he might as well draft the outline of his report and he began to look over his small neat handwriting to see how it all added up chapter five i wednesday was a difficult morning for banks his desk was littered with reports and he couldnt get jenny fuller out of his mind there was nothing wrong with his marriagesandra was all if not more than he had ever expected in a partnerso there was no reason banks told himself why he should find himself interested in another woman it was paul newman he remembered who had said why go out for hamburger if you can get steak at home but banks couldnt remember the name of the subversive wit who had countered what if you want pizza at thirtysix he surely couldnt have hit middleage crisis point but there was no doubt that he was strongly attracted to the bright redheaded doctor of philosophy the sensation had been immediate like a mild electric shock and he was certain that she had felt it too their two meetings had been charged with a strong undercurrent and banks didnt know what to do about it the sensible thing would be to walk away and avoid seeing her anymore but his job made that impractical he slugged back some hot bitter station coffee and told himself not to take the matter so seriously there was nothing to feel guilty about in fancying an attractive woman he was after all a normal heterosexual male another mouthful of black coffee tightened him back into the job at hand reports he read over richmond s interview statements and thought about the young detectives reservations for a while before deciding that they should be pursued he also remembered trevor sharp who had been a suspect in a tourist mugging shortly after banks had arrived in eastvale the boy hadnt been charged because his father had given him a solid alibi and the victim an innocent abroad from oskaloosa iowa wasnt able to give a positive identification when the case relied solely on his word hatchley had wasted his time at the oak he had talked to the bar staff and to the regular customers and would no doubt be putting in a lengthy expenses claim but nobody remembered anything special about carol ellis that night it had been a quiet evening as mondays usually were and she had sat at a corner table all evening talking to her friend molly torbeck both had left before closing time and had presumably gone their separate ways nobody had tried to pick either of them up and nobody had spent the evening giving them the eye the sergeant had also talked to carol molly and the three other victims when it was all added up two of the four josie campbell and carol ellis had been in the oak on the nights in question and the other two in pubs at opposite ends of eastvale it wasnt the kind of pattern banks had been hoping to find but it was a pattern pubs jenny fuller might have something to say about that skipping his morning break al the golden grill banks tidied up his own report on the interview with crutchley and left the file in his pending tray to await the artists impression he missed his lunch too looking over the preliminary postmortem report on alice matlock which offered no new information but confirmed glendennings earlier opinions about time and cause the bruises on her wrists and arms indicated that there had been a struggle in which the woman had been pushed backwards catching the back of her head on the table corner glendenning was nothing if not thorough and he had a reputation as one of the best pathologists in the country he had looked for evidence of a blow by a blunt instrument prior to the fall which might then have been engineered to cover up the true cause but had discovered only a typical contrecoup head injury though the skull had splintered into the brain tissue at the point of impact the occipital region there was also damage to the frontal lobes and that only occurs when the body is falling the effect glendenning had noted is similar to that of a passenger bumping his head on the windscreen when a car brakes abruptly if however the blow is delivered while the victims head is stationary then the wound is restricted to the area of impact the blow that killed alice matlock was the kind of blow that could have killed anyoneand she was old her bones were brittlebut it wasnt necessarily murder it could have been accidental it could have been manslaughter a redeyed richmond brought in ethel carstairs statement again there was nothing new but she had given an itemized description of the missing silverware manson had found only two different sets of fingerprints in the house one belonged to the dead woman herself and the other to ethel who had been good enough to offer hers for comparison at about twofifteen superintendent gristhorpe stuck his head around the door still at it alan banks nodded gesturing to the papers that covered his desk gristhorpe looked at his watch go get a pie and a pint over the road i think wed better have a conference about three oclock and i dont want your stomach rumbling all through it a conference aye a lots been happening the peeper the breakins now this alice matlock business i dont like it its time we threw a few ideas around just me you hatchley and richmond have you read the young lads reports by the way yes ive just finished good arent they detailed no split infinitives or dangling modifiers hell go far that lad see you at three in the boardroom ii the boardroom was so called because it was the most spacious room in the station at its center was a large shiny oval table around which stood ten matching stiffbacked chairs the setup looked impressive but the conference was informal a coffee pot sat on its warmer in the middle surrounded by files pencils and notepads there were no ashtrays though unless he was in a pub or a coffee shop where it was unavoidable gristhorpe didnt approve of people smoking in his presence right the superintendent announced when they had all arranged their papers and helped themselves to coffee weve got four breakinsall at old peoples housesinvolving one assault and one death weve also got a peeping tom running around town looking in any window he damn well pleases and weve got hardly a thing to go on in either case i reckon its about time we pooled what brainpower weve got and lets see if we cant come up with some ideas alan banks coughed he needed a cigarette but had to content himself by fiddling with a paper clip while he spoke i think detective constable richmond should speak first sir he conducted interviews with the dead womans neighbors last night gristhorpe looked at richmond inviting him to begin well sir youve all seen copies of the report i dont really have anything to add we had a uniformed man on duty all night and another made inquiries all the way down cardigan drive a couple of people heard someone running but that was all we know who that someone was dont we gristhorpe asked well not his identity sir but yes it was that chap whos been looking in on women getting undressed right gristhorpe said turning over a page of the report in front of him now andrea rigby says that she heard running then a knock at a door never mind the alternative explanations for the moment could there be any possibility that it was the peeper not a burglar who killed alice matlock maybe she knew him maybe he came for help or protection or to confess she threatened to report him they struggled and he pushed her manslaughter the place had been gone over just like the others sir sergeant hatchley pointed out and no prints no prints sir couldnt it have been made to look like it was a burglary how would the peeper know to do that banks asked surely he must read the papers gristhorpe suggested it doesnt fit though its all too deliberate if it happened as you say then it was probably an accident he probably just panicked and ran people have been known to cover their tracks after crimes of passion alan i know sir it just doesnt seem to fit the profile we have so far goon dr fullerthere it was again so formal why couldnt he call her jenny in front of othersdr fuller said were dealing with a very frustrated man whos probably going about as far as he dares in peeping through windows no one can be certain but she said its unlikely that a voyeur would progress to more serious sex crimes on the other hand as the pressure builds in him he might feel the need to break out its a trap hes in a treadmill and theres no predicting what hed do to escape it but this wasnt a sex crime alan alice matlock thank the lord hadnt been interfered with in any way i know sir but it still doesnt fit the peeper does what he does when pressure or tension builds up and he can only find one way of releasing it watching women undress it wouldnt even really work for him in a stripclubthe women would have to be unaware of him he would have to get that feeling of power of dominance when hes done it though the pressures released a personality like that is hardly likely to go running to an old woman and confess let alone murder her just after hes satisfied himself i see your point alan gristhorpe agreed his bushy eyebrows joined in the middle and drew a thick gray line over his childlike blue eyes perhaps the best thing to do would be to rule it out by checking into who alice matlock knew she seemed to be a bit of a loner sir richmond chipped in most of the neighbors didnt know much about her not much more than to say hello if they met in the street i knew alice matlock gristhorpe told them she was a friend of my mothers used to come to the farm for fresh eggs when i was a kid she always brought me some boiled sweets but youre right lad she was a bit of a recluse more so as she got older lost her young man in the first war as i recall never did marry anyway look into it see if shes been at all friendly with a likely young peeper there is one other thing yes alan even if it wasnt the same person if it was the usual lot did the breakin and the peeper just looked and ran they might have seen each other you mean if we get one we might get a lead on the other yes but right now weve very little on either thats right where do you think our best chance lies the breakins banks answered without hesitation ill be getting an artists impression of the man who fenced the stuff in leeds any time now ive already got a fairly good description but it doesnt check with any of the local villains i know sergeant hatchley and constable richmond dont recognize him either so maybe hes not local new in town or been away richmond suggested only here every now and then possible know anyone who fits that profile richmond shook his head only andrea rigbys husband hes a computer whiz and he spends a lot of time away but i saw a photo of him on the mantelpiece and he doesnt fit the description he wouldnt be the type anyway from what i could see he gets plenty of money from fiddling about with computers ask around then gristhorpe advised see if you can come up with anything you mentioned wooller in your report richmond he seemed suspicious anything in particular well no sir richmond felt flustered caught out on a hunch there was the dirty magazine sir thats in the report yes gristhorpe said dismissively but most of us have looked at pictures of naked women now and then havent we its not just naked women sir richmond pressed on realizing only when it was too late that he had walked right into it some of them are tied up sir his voice faltered and they do it with animals well gristhorpe said beaming at him i can see youve been doing your homework lad but even if the stuff is illegally imported theres not a lot we can do what exactly are you getting at just that he seemed suspicious sir completely uncommunicative shifty acted as if he was hiding something think he might be our peeper do you could be sir alan banks shrugged ive not had the pleasure of meeting him but ive been told that our man could take any size shape or form certainly if he lives a frustrated existence and gets his kicks from bondage and bestiality magazines then theres a chance all right gristhorpe said making a note keep an eye on him drop by for a chat nothing heavy though he glanced sternly at hatchley who looked down at his notes and straightened his tie the kid sir trevor sharp richmond said yes there was something funny about that too i heard them arguing about him being late all the time and neglecting his homework and when i asked about the night before his father only mentioned himself at first sir said he was watching telly right at the far end of the block then later when i asked he said the kid was with him too think he was lying could be we had the kid on suspicion of mugging four months ago banks added no case well gristhorpe said seeing as the only information weve got on the burglars so far is that theyre young we might as well follow up maybe you could talk to them alan father and son together see if you get the same impression as richmond here all right banks agreed ill drop by after school today might be a good idea to have a word with the head too you never know some of em keep tabs on the kids what school is it eastvale comprehensive sir richmond answered same place i went to thatll be old buxton right yes sir boxer buxton we used to call him he must be close to retiring age now hes been at that school going on for forty years been head for twenty or more since back when it was eastvale grammar school hes a bit of a dodderer now lost in his own world but have a word with him about young trevor anyway see if hes been acting strangely playing truant associating with a bad crowd is there anything else gristhorpe turned to sergeant hatchley anything for us sergeant i cant seem to find a pattern to the peepers operation sir hatchley said except that he always picks blonds what do you mean how he chooses his victims sir how he latches onto them knows who to follow the women werent all single were they gristhorpe asked bloody hell no sir hatchley said one of em had her husband right there in bed dozing off while our chap was doing his bit through the curtains he must do some reconnaissance first banks added he knows which window to look through knows the layout of the house even picks the best time to be there so he chooses his victims well in advance must do theyd all been in pubs the nights they were peeped on hatchley said but i couldnt find any evidence that they were being watched that would explain it though wouldnt it banks said if he already knew who he was going to spy on hed know something about their habits if hed watched the houses hed know when a woman comes home from the pub and how soon the bedroom light goes on hed know if the husband stayed downstairs or took a bath while she undressed he must do his groundwork fair enough alan gristhorpe said but it doesnt help us much does it we could warn people to make sure theyre not being followed to keep an eye out for strangers hanging about the street i suppose we could gristhorpe sighed and ran his hand through his hair anythings better than nothing you talked to the victims again sergeant hatchley yes sir but i didnt find out anything new just that all the incidents had occurred after a night out maybe it makes him feel that theyre sinners or something banks guessed its possible that he needs to feel like that about them a lot of men dont like the idea of women smoking or going to pubs they think it cheapens them maybe its like that with him perhaps he needs to feel that theyre impure in the first place gristhorpe scratched his neck and frowned i think youve been talking to dr fuller too much alan he said but maybe youve got a point follow it up with her when are you meeting again tomorrow evening banks felt himself begin to flush were both too busy during the day sir hatchley suppressed a guffaw by covering the lower half of his face with a huge dirty handkerchief and blowing hard richmond shifted uneasily in his seat banks could sense their reactions and he felt angry he wanted to say something to tell them it was just bloody work thats all but he knew that if he did they would think he was protesting too much so he kept quiet and seethed inside put it to her then gristhorpe said ignoring the others ask her if there could be any connection between the peeper and alice matlocks death and find out if its likely our man has a thing about women in pubs shell probably laugh at me banks said we all seem to fancy ourselves as amateur psychologists at one time or another not surprising though is it alan wed be a pretty bloody incurious race if we didnt think about our nature and behavior once in a while wouldnt we especially us coppers is that all he asked rising to end the meeting everyone kept silent fine then thats it follow up wooller and the sharp kid get that drawing circulated soon as it comes in and check with ethel carstairs about any other friends alice matlock may have had should we say anything to the press banks asked a warning to women about keeping their eyes open for strangers it cant do any harm can it ill take care of that off you go then meeting adjourned iii graham sharp rolled off andrea rigby and sighed with pleasure ah wednesdays thank god for halfday closing andrea giggled and snuggled in the crook of his arm he could feel the weight of her breasts against his rib cage the nipples still hard and the sharp milky scent of sex made them both warm and sleepy andrea traced a line from his throat to his pubic hair that was wonderful gray she said dreamily its always wonderful with you see how much better you feel now i was just a bit preoccupied thats all you were all tense andrea said massaging his shoulders then she laughed whatever it was it certainly made you wild though when are you going to tell him oh gray she snuggled closer her breasts crushed against his chest dont spoil it dont make me think about bad things graham smiled and caressed her hair sorry love its the secrecy it gets me down sometimes i just want us to be together all the time we will be we will andrea murmured rubbing against him slowly as she felt him begin to stiffen again oh god gray she breathed hard as he took hold of her breast and squeezed the nipple between thumb and forefinger yes yes graham knew in his more rational moments thathey would never be together all the time whatever andrea thought about her husband he wasnt such a bad sort really he didnt beat her and as far as graham knew he didnt cheat on her either they got on well enough when he was around which wasnt often and perhaps more important than andrea would have cared to admit to herselfespecially now as she was nearing orgasmhe made a lot of money soon in fact she had told graham sadly they would be moving from their first country home into something a bit more authentic an isolated dales cottage or perhaps somewhere in the cotswolds where the climate was milder why he wanted to live in the country andrea said she had no ideahe was hardly ever there anywaybut she had found eastvale a great deal more interesting than she had expected graham also knew deep down that trevor would never accept another mother especially one who lived two doors away and was at twentyfour closer to the age of an older sister there was the money too graham could hardly make ends meet and if he really thought about it which he tried not to he couldnt see andrea as a shopkeepers wife not her with her paris fashions original art works and holidays in new york or bangkok no just as he knew that trevor would never accept her he also knew she would never give up her way of life but they were both romantics at heart at first andrea had come to the shop more and more often just for little things like a packet of jacobs cream crackers some fresh baps or perhaps a bottle of tarragon vinegar and if there had been no other customers around she had lingered a little longer to talk each time over a week or two graham had come to know quite a lot about her especially about how her husband was away so much and how bored she got then one evening one of her fuses blew and she had no idea how to fix it she went to graham for help and he came along with flashlight and fuse wire and did it in a jiffy coffee followed and after that an exciting session of kissing and groping on the sofa which being one of those modern things made up of blocks you can rearrange any way you want was soon transformed into an adequate approximation of a bed since then for about two months graham and andrea had been meeting quite regularly theirs was a circumscribed life however they couldnt go out together though they did once spend a nervous evening in york having dinner looking over their shoulders the whole time and they had to be very careful about being seen in each others company at all always graham would visit andrea using the back way where the high walls of the back yards kept him from view and muffled the sound of his passing sometimes they had candlelight dinners first other times they threw themselves straight into lovemaking andrea was more passionate and abandoned in bed than anyone graham had ever known and she had led him to new heights of joy it was easier at first trevor spent three weeks in france on a school trip so graham was a free agent on the boys return though there were difficulties which was why halfday closing was such a joy weekends were out of course that was when andreas husband was around so the most they could manage was the occasional evening when trevor was allowed to go out to the movies with his mates to the youth club or a local dance lately though with trevor being out so often and taking so little notice graham had spent much more time with andrea when they had finished they lay back and lit cigarettes andrea blew the smoke out of her nose like an actress in a forties movie did they talk to you last night he asked the police yes what do you think happened the old woman alice matlock shes dead andrea frowned was it murder they must think so or they wouldnt waste their time asking everyone what they were doing and where they were he sounded irritated andrea stroked his chest dont worry about it darling its nothing to do with us is it no course not he said turning and running his palm over her damp stomach he loved andreas body it was so different from maureens she had had smooth skin smooth as marble and sometimes as cold he had hardly dared touch it fearing it would be some kind of violation but andreas skin had grain to it a certain friction you could feel when you ran your hand over her buttocks or shoulders even when they were moist as they were now what did they want to know he asked her just if i heard anything the night before last and did you after youd gone yes i heard someone running along cardigan drive then someone knocking at a door the same person could have been there was a woman peeped on in cardigan drive monday evening graham told her i read about it in the paper another of those peeping tom things yes andrea shivered and nestled closer so they think it might be the same person i guess they must graham said what did they ask you same thing if i heard anything and they asked trevor where he was theyre always picking on kids gray you know that it doesnt mean anything since all that unemployment they automatically think kids are delinquents these days true enough what did you tell them that he was home with me of course oh gray should you have i mean what if someone saw him somewhere else it could make things really bad he didnt do it andrea hes not that kind of a lad and im damned if im going to let the police get their hooks into him once they latch on they never let go it was bad enough last time its not going to happen again if you think its best gray graham frowned at her i know you dont think hes worth it he said but hes a good lad hell turn out well in the end youll see andrea put her arms around him i dont think ill of him really i dont its just that you seem to dote on him so much he cant do any wrong in your eyes im his father arent i im all hes got he smiled and kissed her i know what im doing love dont worry he looked at his watch on the bedside table bloody hell id better be going trevorll be home from school any minute andrea moved away from him sadly you know i hate it when you leave gray she said its so lonely and boring being here all by myself in the evenings graham kissed her lightly on the lips i know ill try and get back later if i can i dont know what trevors got planned for tonight graham slipped into his trousers as andrea watched from the bed im getting a bit worried about wooller gray she said just before he left what about him i dont know if im being paranoid or feeling guilty or what but its just the way he looks at me as if he knows and worse its as if hes thinking about what to do with what he knows do you know what i mean i feel like hes seen all of me all of us dont worry about it graham said sitting down on the edge of the bed and taking her hand youre probably overreacting weve been discreet the walls are very thickim sure he wouldnt be able to hear a thing and im always careful when i call really love dont worry about it must rush he patted her hand and kissed her on the forehead andrea yawned and stretched then turned over and lay in the impression his body had made the bed still smelled of his old spice she pulled the sheets around her shoulders and waved goodbye lazily as he slipped out through the door iv it was six oclock when banks pulled up outside number eight gallows view he had decided to take on the sharps himself and leave wooller to hatchley good evening he said politely introducing himself as graham sharp opened the door a forkful of sausage in his hand were just having dinner cant it wait wont take long banks said already inside just carry on eating the room wasnt exactly a living room it was more of a storage place full of boxes of tinned goods and crisps that could be easily carried into the shop at the back though was a fairly modern kitchen complete with a microwave oven and banks guessed that the real living quarters must be upstairs spread out over the two adjoined cottages graham and trevor sat at the formicatopped table finishing what looked like bangers and mash with baked beans big white mugs of tea steamed in front of them what is it then graham asked polite enough not to talk with his mouth full we talked to one of your chaps last night told him all we knew yes banks said thats why im here i just want to clear up a few things in the statement detective constable richmond is new to the job if you know what i mean we have to keep a close eye on new chaps see that they get it right go by the book you mean youre here because youre doing some kind of job performance check on the young bloke sharp asked incredulously it wasnt in the least bit true but banks thought it might put the sharps at ease for as long as he wanted them to let their guards down after that of course there were ways of putting them on the defensive again a position which often turned out to be much more illuminating well i never sharp went on you know i never really thought about the police force as a job like any other i suppose you get wages as well and complain about payrises and poor canteen food banks laughed we dont have a canteen but yes we complain a lot about payrises or the lack of them innocently he took out his notebook detective constable richmond tells me that you heard nothing at around eleven oclock on monday night is that correct it is where were you watching television in the sitting room he pointed toward the upstairs far end of the house have a look if you want oh i dont think that will be necessary thanks all the same you said you were watching television all evening well from about eight oclock to midnight anyway good banks said peering into his notebook it looks like our man did a good job you wouldnt of course hear anything from as far away as cardigan drive or even number two gallows view if you were in the sitting room with the television on would you nothing you can try it if you want banks waved aside his offer then turned sharply to trevor and where were you trevor taken by surprise halfway through a mouthful of sausage and beans spoke through the mush of semimasticated food with him he mumbled pointing his fork at his father mr sharp banks said returning to graham and frowning dc richmond says that when you first told him you were watching television you made no mention of your son whatsoever it was all in the first person as if trevor wasnt even home what are you getting at sharp said belligerently putting down his knife and fork just checking up on the constables statement sir want to see if he got it right he was a bit curious about this one point he put a question mark by it sharp glared at banks for a few moments while trevor went on chewing his food if youre insinuating that my trevor had anything to do with this youre barking up the wrong tree hes straight as a die always has been ask anyone im not insinuating anything mr sharp id just like to know why the constable should mention this it was a way of speaking i suppose sharp said you dont always think youre going to have to account for the person who was with you do you i mean if someone asked you what you did last night and you stayed home watching telly you probably wouldnt say my wife and i blahblahblah would you youve got a point there mr sharp i probably wouldnt so let me get this straight you and trevor spent the whole evening from about eight till midnight watching television and you neither heard nor saw anything unusual am i right thats right only trevor went to bed about eleven needs his sleep for school of course what did you watch trevor banks asked casually turning to the boy we watched im asking trevor mr sharp what did you watch son dont really remember trevor said there was one of them american cop shows you know all car chases and shootouts he shrugged half the time i was reading my book and not paying attention what book was that now look here graham burst out the vein on his temple pulsating with anger you cant just come in here and interrogate my son like this accuse us of lying to you i told you trevor was with me all evening until he went to bed at about eleven oclock what was he reading eh the book what was he reading it was the shining trevor answered stephen king do you know it no banks said smiling at trevor any good yeah better than the film banks nodded and packed away his notebook well i think ive got all i need ill let you finish your meal in peace no dont bother he said putting out his arm to stop graham from standing up i can see myself out and with that he was gone the sharps ate the rest of their dinner slowly in silence chapter six i thursday morning hit like a cold shower in the dumpy form of ms dorothy wycombe she was in gristhorpes office when banks arrived at the station and the superintendent called him in the moment he snapped off his walkman gristhorpe clearly had no idea how to deal with her for all his learning and compassion he was a country gentleman and was not used to dealing with crusaders like ms wycombe he looked lost some people are susceptible to environment but dorothy wycombe was not gristhorpes office was a cozy livedin room with a studious air about it but she might just as well have been standing on a platform at leeds city station waiting with her arms crossed for the to kings cross glaring at everything within her field of vision the dominant expression on her face during the meeting that followed was one of distaste as if she had just eaten a particularly sour gooseberry er miss er ms wycombe meet detective chief inspector banks gristhorpe muttered by way of introduction pleased to meet you banks said apprehensively no reply through his job banks had come to realize that it was unwise to expect stereotypes to do so only led to misunderstandings on the other hand he had also been forced to admit the existence of stereotypes having met more than once among others the lisping mincing homosexual the tweedy retired colonel with handlebar mustache and shootingstick and the whore with the heart of gold so when dorothy wycombe stood before him looking like everymans parody of a womens libber he could hardly claim surprise disappointment perhaps but not surprise seems theres been a complaint alan gristhorpe began slowly its about sergeant hatchley but i thought you ought to hear it first banks nodded and looked at dorothy wycombe whose chins jutted out in challenge that she was unattractive was obvious what was not clear was how much of this was due to nature itself and how much to her own efforts she had frizzed all the life out of her colorless hair and the bulky sack that passed for a dress bulged in the most unlikely places above her doublechin was a tight mean mouth lined around the edges from constant clenching and a dull suet complexion behind the national health glasses shone eyes whose intelligence which banks had no doubt she possessed was glazed over with revolutionary zeal her speech was jagged with italics i have been informed she began consulting a small black notebook for dramatic effect that while questioning the victims of your peeping tom your sergeants attitude was flippant and furthermore that he expressed the desire to commit a similar act of violence against one interviewee in particular those are serious charges banks said wishing he could smoke a cigarette who made them i did i dont remember you ever being a victim of the scopophiliac pardon i said i dont recall that you ever reported any invasion of your privacy thats not the point youre simply trying to obscure the issue what issue your sergeants lewd and lascivious suggestionsan attitude might i add that reflects on the entire investigation of this whole scandalous affair who made the charges banks repeated i told you im bringing them to your attention on whose authority i represent the local women who says so inspector banks this is infuriating will you or will you not listen to the charges ill listen to them when i know who made them and what gives you the authority to pass them on dorothy wycombe moved further away from banks and puffed herself up to her full size i am the chairperson of weef weef weef inspector banks the women of eastvale for emancipation and freedom weef banks had often thought it was amusing how groups twisted the language so that acronyms of organizations would sound like snappy words it had started with nato seato uno and other important groups progressed through such local manifestations as spit shot and spear and now there was week it didnt seem to matter at all that women of eastvale sounded vaguely medieval or that freedom and emancipation meant more or less the same thing they simply existed to give birth to weef which sounded to banks like an impoverished woof or the kind of squeak a frightened mouse might utter very well banks conceded making a note and who brought the complaint to your attention im not under any obligation to divulge my source dorothy wycombe snapped back quick as a reporter in the dock yesterday banks sighed sergeant hatchley spoke to carol ellis mandy selkirk josie campbell and ellen parry about their experiences he also spoke to molly torbeck who had been with carol ellis in the oak on the night of the incident would you like me to interview each in turn and find out for myself i can do that you know do what you want im not going to tell you right banks said standing up to leave then ive no intention of taking your complaint seriously you must realize that we get a lot of unfounded allegations made against us usually by overzealous members of the public so many that weve got quite an elaborate system of screening them im sure that as a defender of freedom and emancipation you wouldnt want anyones career to suffer from injustice brought about by smear campaigns would you banks thought dorothy wycombe was about to explode so red did her face become her chins trembled and her knuckles whitened as she grasped the edge of gristhorpes desk this is outrageous she shouted ill not have my movement dictated to by a fascist police force im sorry banks said heading for the door we just cant deal with unidentified complainants carol ellis the name burst from dorothy wycombes tight mouth like a huge buildup of steam from a stuck valve now will you sit down and listen to me yes maam banks said taking out his notebook again its ms wycombe she told him and i expect you to treat this matter seriously its a serious charge banks agreed as i said earlier thats why i want it fully documented what exactly did carol ellis say she said that sergeant hatchley seemed to treat the whole peeping tom business as a bit of a lark that he seemed either bored or amused whilst interviewing her and that he made certain suggestions about her body bored or amused ms wycombe which theyre very different you know both atdifferent times certain suggestions about her body what kind of suggestions lewd offensive what other kind are there inspector he hinted that the peeping tom must have had quite a treat is that all isnt it enough what kind of i mean are there any other allegations no thats all i wanted to say i hope i can trust you inspector to see that something is done about this dont worry ms wycombe ill get to the bottom of it if theres any truth in the charges sergeant hatchley will be disciplined you can be sure of that dorothy wycombe smiled grimly and suspiciously then swished out of the office gristhorpe took a deep breath alan he said when i made that joke about throwing your sergeant to the wolves the other day i didnt mean it bloody literally whatever we might think about ms wycombe and her manner weve got to concede that shes got a point dont you agree if what she says is true yes you think it might not be we both know how the truth gets twisted in emotional situations sir let me get hatchleys version before we go any further very well but let me know alan are you getting any further no but im seeing jenny fuller again today perhaps shell have a bit more light to shed on things if we can narrow the field down a bit we might at least be able to start checking around what about alice matlock nothing yet get a move on alan too many things are piling up for my liking ii back in his office banks found a note from inspector barnshaw accompanying a police artists drawing of the man that the leeds junk dealer crutchley had described he had recognized none of the file photographs but the sketch was a good realization of the description banks had taken he lit a cigarette tidied the files on his desk and sent for sergeant hatchley who arrived about five minutes later sit down banks said his abrupt tone foreshadowing the chewing out the sergeant was in for banks decided not to beat about the bush instead he told hatchley exactly what dorothy wycombe had said and asked him for his version of what had happened during the carol ellis interview hatchley blushed and scratched his chin avoiding bankss glance is it true banks pressed thats all i want to know well yes and no hatchley admitted meaning look sir i know carol ellis im a bachelor and shes not married either and im not denying ive had my eye on her for some timelong before this business ever started go on when i talked to her yesterday shed got over what happened after all it was just a bit of a shock nobody got hurt and she was even joking about it a bit wishing shed worn her best underwear given a better show that kind of thing appen she was saying it to cover up her nerves or maybe she was embarrassed i dont know but like i told you i know her and i quite fancy her myself so i might have joked along you know made things a bit more personal might have all right i did were you bored with carol ellis around you must be joking sir a bit casual maybe its not like interrogating someone you dont know or a villain did you suggest that the peeper must have had quite a treat i dont rightly recollect i might have joked along with her like when she said about wearing her best undies i probably said shed look fine to me in any underwear you know just like a compliment a bit cheeky but banks sighed it was clear to him what had happened but it was equally clear that it shouldnt have the worst he could accuse hatchley of was tactlessness and allowing personal affairs to come before police work whatever carol ellis had said to dorothy wycombe had probably been said in a spirit of fun and was no doubt grossly distorted i dont need to tell you that it was a bloody stupid thing to do do i he said to hatchley who didnt reply because of your actions were in for a lot more bad publicity and weve got to spend time placating dorothy bloody wycombe i do wish youd learn to keep your urges to yourself its one thing to chat the woman up in a pub but quite another to do it while youre interviewing her about a crime am i making myself clear hatchley pressed his lips together and nodded are you sure that carol ellis took your remarks in the spirit they were intended here hatchley beamed shes going out with me on saturday night sir if thats of any account banks couldnt help but smile something must have got twisted in the communication network then he muttered ill talk to her myself and straighten it out but be bloody careful in future i dont need the aggro and the superintendent certainly doesnt youd better stay out of the peeper case in future and youd better stay out of the old mans way for a day or two as well what do you want me to do concentrate on the breakins and the alice matlock killing he passed hatchley the drawing get copies done of this and spread them around help richmond find out if alice matlock had any younger friends any lame ducks lonely hearts that kind of thing did you see wooller bytheway yes last night anything hatchley shook his head nah hes an odd one all right but im pretty damn sure he didnt see or hear anything did you get the impression he was holding something back lots of things hes a dark horse sure enough but nothing about the matlock case no i still reckon hes worth keeping an eye on for the other business though you definitely get a kind of dirty feeling talking to him okay banks said but youre off that and if the press get hold of dorothy wycombes story which im sure they will i want no comments from you none at all that understood yes sir bit of an amazon eh that dorothy wycombe off you go sergeant hatchley left and banks relaxed glad it was over he didnt mind yelling at the sergeant in the course of duty but he hated the formality of the official reprimand it was easy to see why gristhorpe had passed the buck to him in the first place the superintendent was diplomatic enough all right but he was also too softhearted when it came to his men he looked at his watch it was just after eleven he decided to take his coffee and toasted teacake alone this morning and leave hatchley to lick his wounded pride for a while iii eastvale comprehensive used to be called eastvale grammar school in the old days it was a respectable institution attended by promising children from miles around many of whom gained scholarships to oxford or cambridge or went on to the northern redbrick universities closer to home the building itself was victorian attractive in a gothic way from the outside with turrets a clock and a bell tower and full of high gloomy corridors within a number of temporary classrooms trailers propped up on bricks for the most part had been added to the original building in the early seventies and they looked as if they were definitely there to stay things changed for the school when the comprehensive system was turned loose on the country now teachers struggled with overcrowded classes of such mixed abilities that it was impossible to nurture the bright and do justice to the slow often the children had to suffer inept teaching by fools who knew more about athletics and rugby than caesars conquest shakespeare or the square roots of negative numbers banks knew the place though he had never set foot inside the main building before both brian and tracy went there and the tales they told did a lot to undermine bankss faith in the comprehensive system as a workingclass boy in peterborough he had always felt a strong aversion to any kind of elitism yet as a moderately welleducated man with a taste for knowledge he had to admit that no amount of special treatment and mollycoddling could turn a lazy hostile slob into a star pupil far from it too many mediocre minds could do nothing but discourage exceptional students from doing their best at school he remembered kids want to belong they do not want to be ostracized by their peers which happens if they excel at anything other than sports as far as natural abilities went he had no real opinion perhaps some were born with better brains than others but that wasnt to him the issuethe point was that everybody should be given the chance to find out and the idealistic basis of the comprehensive system seemed to grant just that possibility in practice it didnt seem to be turning out that way in his own education he had been very lucky indeed after failing his elevenplus exam he had been condemned to the local secondary modern school there to be molded into an ideal electrician bricklayer or road sweeper he had nothing against manual occupations his own father had been a sheetmetal worker until angina forced an early retirementexcept that he wasnt interested in any of them fortunately because he did well at his studies he got a shot at the fourteenplus he worked long and hard passed and found himself a new boy an outsider at the grammar school it seemed that all the relationships had been formed already during the three years he had spent in exile and for the first two terms he despaired of making any friends it was only typical schoolboy standoffishness though as soon as the others found out that he was a terror in a scrap owned the toughest conker in the school and made perhaps the finest rugger scrumhalf the team had ever seen he had no problem gaining acceptance it had been a cruel process though he reflected the first exam split his groups of friends in the most divisive way grammar school kids rarely talked to secondary modern boys no matter how many games of commandos or cricket they had played together in their childhood and his next exam accomplished much the same thing in reverse this time however the friends that banks had made at the secondary modern school never spoke to him again because they thought he had betrayed them entering the gates of eastvale comprehensive somehow brought back the good and the bad of his own schooldays when banks walked through the yard it was lunchtime the children played handtennis or cricket against stumps chalked on the wall in the yard or smoked behind the cycle sheds and the teachers lounged in the smoky staff room reading the guardian or grappling with the sun crossword the head however was in his sanctuary and it was into this haven that banks was ushered by a slim pretty secretary who looked hardly older than schoolleaving age herself the institutionalgreen corridors were half glass so that anyone passing by could look into the classrooms now the desks stood empty and the blackboards were still partly covered in indecipherable scrawl many of the desks banks noticed were just as desecrated with the carved initials of girlfriends and the names of famous cricketers footballers and rockandroll bands as they had been in his own schooldays only the names had changed and the place smelled pleasantly of bubble gum chalk dust and satchel leather the head was sipping tea in his paneled office a wellthumbed copy of cicero on the desk in front of him he greeted banks and turned sadly to the book latin inspector such an elegant noble language quite easily capable of sustaining lengthy flights of poetry nobody it seems has any use for it these days anyway he sighed standing up youve not come to hear about my problems have you the head like his book looked as though he had seen better days his face was haggard his hair gray and he had a pronounced stoop his most noticeable feature however was a big red nose and it didnt take much imagination to guess what nicknames the kids had for him though he wore a batlike cape there was no mortarboard in sight the study looked so much like bankss old headmasters lair that he felt the same quiver of adrenaline as he had all those years ago while waiting for the cane no sir banks smiled slipping easily into the language of respect i came to ask a few questions about one of your boys oh dear not been getting himself into trouble has he im afraid these days its very difficult to keep track of them and there are several bad elements in the school do sit down thank you sir its nothing definite banks went on were just faced with one or two discrepancies in a statement and wed like to know if you can tell us anything about trevor sharp there was no flash of recognition in buxtons expression obviously he had long since given up trying to keep track of all his pupils he got up and walked toward his filing cabinet from which after much muttering and tuttutting he pulled out a sheaf of papers reports he said tapping the papers with a bony finger these should tell us what you want to know id appreciate it though inspector if this got no further than you and me these are supposed to be confidential of course in return id be pleased if you didnt mention my visit especially to the boy himself or to anyone who might tell him the head nodded and started turning the pages let me see no winter summer excellent ninety percent very good and he went on in this fashion for some time before returning to banks a bright boy young master sharp the name suits him look at this and he passed banks the reports for the previous year they were full of excellents and high marks in all subjects except geography about that his teacher had said does not seem interested obviously capable but unwilling to work hard enough as it turned out that lone failure foreshadowed the more recent reports which were scattered with remarks such as could do better does not try hard enough and takes negative attitude toward subject there were also several complaints from the teachers about his absences if trevor were in class more often he would attain a better grasp of the subject wrote mr fox his english teacher and failure to hand in homework and to appear in class have contributed greatly toward trevors disappointing performance in history this term commented mr rhodes what this adds up to then banks said is a promising pupil who seems to have lost his way yes mr buxton agreed sadly it happens so often these days there seem to be so many distractions for the boys of course in most cases its a phase they have to go through rebellion have to get it out of their systems you know banks knew but the transformation from star pupil with a great career ahead into truant and slacker was certainly open to other interpretations who are his friends banks asked who does he hang around with im afraid i wouldnt know inspector its so hard to keep trackhis form master mr price might be able to tell you he picked up his phone handling it as if it were a severed limb ill ask sonia to bring him in when mr price arrived he looked both annoyed at having been disturbed on his dinner break and apprehensive about the purpose of the call the head soon put him at ease and curiosity then gained the better edge turning him into a garrulous pedant after trying to impress both banks and the head for several minutes with his modern approach to language teaching and his theories on classroom management he finally had to be brought around to the point of his visit ive come to inquire about one of your students mr pricetrevor sharp ah sharp yes odd fellow really doesnt have much of anything to do with the other lads rather sullen and hostile one simply tends to stay away from him is that what the other boys do seems so nobodys actively against him or anything like that but he goes his way and they go theirs so he has no close friends here none is he a bully not at all though he could be if he wanted tough kid very good at games he always dresses conservatively while the others are trying to get away with whatever they canpurple hair mohawk cuts spiky bracelets studded leather jackets you name it not sharp though the others dont make fun of him no hes the biggest in the class nobody bothers him i understand from his school reports that hes been absent a lot lately have you talked to him about this yes certainly in fact last parents day i had a long chat with his father who seemed very concerned doesnt seem to have done much good though sharp still comes and goes as he pleases personally i think hes just bored hes bright and hes bored there was nothing more to say especially as banks had no concrete grounds on which to investigate trevor he thanked both the headmaster and mr price repeated his request for discretion and left iv as banks was shuffling through the reports in the headmasters office trevor himself was about a mile away he had gone out of bounds to meet mick at a pub where the question of drinking age was rarely broached especially if the coins kept passing over the counter they sat over the last quarters of their pints smoking and listening to the songs that mick had chosen on the jukebox trevor kept sucking and probing at his front teeth pulling a face whats the matter with you mick asked its driving me bleeding crazy all that fucking around with your gob dont know trevor answered hurts a bit feels rough i think ive lost a filling lets take a look trevor bared his teeth in an evil grin like a horse with the bit in its mouth while mick looked and pronounced his verdict yeah one of ems getting a bit black around the edgesthat little one next to the big yellow one id see a fucking dentist if i was you i dont like dentists fucking coward mick jeered trevor shrugged maybe so but i dont like them anyway you said wed got two jobs on he asked when the music had finished thats right one tonight one next monday why tonight it seems pretty short notice to me coming back from oliday tomorrow arent they and lenny says the pickingsu be good what about next monday bird always goes to her country club mondays lennys heard she always keeps quite a bit of jewelry around the place rich divorcee like has lenny given you any idea about how we get in better mick grinned pimplishly hes given me this and he opened his parka to show trevor the tip of what looked like a crowbar easy he went on just stick it between the door and the post and youre home free what if someone sees us nobody will these are big ouses detached like and well go in the back way all quiet nobody around better wear the balas to be on the safe side though trevor nodded the thought of breaking into a big empty dark house was frightening and exciting well need flashlights he said little ones those penlights got em mick said proudly lenny gave us a couple before he split for the smoke fine then trevor smiled were on were on mick echoed and they drank to it chapter seven i jenny laughed at bankss theory about the peeper spying on female pub habituees only been working for me three days and already coming up with ideas of your own eh but is it any good might be yes it could be part of his pattern like his fixation on blonds on the other hand it was perhaps just the most convenient time a time when nobody would miss him or see him or a time when he could depend on his victims going to bed after a few drinks he wouldnt have to hang around too long to get what he came for now youre doing my job jenny smiled they sat in deep comfortable chairs by the crackling fire and looked as if they should have been drinking brandy and smoking cigars but both preferred theakstons bitter and only banks puffed sparingly at his benson and hedges special milds how many pubs are there in eastvale jenny asked fiftyseven i checked jenny whistled through her teeth alcoholics paradise but still you must know which areas he operates in random so far hes spread himself around except for picking two from the same pub so that doesnt help us much but we do have some evidence that indicates a possible link between our peeper and the alice matlock killing could it be the same person do you expect a yesorno answer all i want is your opinion is it likely that the peeper after watching carol ellis get undressed ran down the street knocked on alice matlocks door and for some reason killed her either intentionally or accidentally you want an answer based purely on psychological considerations yes id say no then its very unlikely in the first place he would have no reason to run to alice matlocks house if hed been spotted his impulse would be to get as far away as possible as quickly as possible youre still doing my job well dammit jenny said theyre so close what do you want me to say i dont know something about a peeper not being the murdering kind jenny laughed primaryschool psychology you wont get that from me ive told you its unlikely and ive given you one good reason if he got the release he needed from watching carol ellis i doubt that hed be emotionally capable of murder immediately afterwards thats what i said to the superintendent well why the bloody hell jenny started and then began to laugh we really are doing each others jobs arent we but seriously alan i say its unlikely but its not impossible would he go to her to confess perhaps jenny shook her head i dont think so not to an old woman doesnt fit at all offhand id say youre looking for a bald shortsighted middleaged man wearing a plastic raincoat bicycleclips and galoshes if only stereotypes do exist you know oh i know believe me i do what do you mean dorothy wycombe ah jenny said had a visit have you this morning ah yes dorothys quite a formidable opponent dont you think i find her a bit hard to take myself i thought you two were friends acquaintances weve worked together on one or two projects thats all we dont really have a lot in common but dorothy is energetic and very good at her job weef yes weef pretty pathetic isnt it banks nodded anyway jenny went on dorothy is an intelligent woman but she lets her dogma get in the way of her thinking what was it all about if its not private it is a bit delicate banks told her then gave an abbreviated account not mentioning any names and they both had another laugh the poor man jenny sympathized he was just trying to chat her up not so much of the poor man if you please he should have known better but why did she report him to dorothy she didnt i popped around to see her on my way here and she was very annoyed by what had happened apparently ms wycombe had been visiting the victimsrather like some victorian lady visiting the poor i should imagineand trying to gather some ammunition against us the woman chatted in quite a friendly way to ms wycombe and joked about my mans visit shed actually been quite flattered as shed had her eye on him for a while and wondered when if ever he was going to make his move anyway dorothy wycombe twisted the information to suit her purposes and marched in demanding blood what a job you do i know its a dirty job but somebodys got to do it talking of dirty jobs jenny went on ive dug out a couple of case histories for you im listening ever heard of charles floyd or patrick byrne banks shook his head im afraid my history of crimes not what it should be tell me patrick byrne murdered a girl in the birmingham ywca in he was a laborer on a building site near the hostel and one afternoon he got sent back to the yard by his foreman for returning to work drunk after lunch hed often peeped on the girls undressing in the hostel but this time he went in and strangled a girl after that he undressed her raped her then cut off her head with a table knife he also made an attempt to eat one of her breasts with sugar thats not a very encouraging tale is it no apparently byrne had had sadistic fantasies including cutting women in half with a circular saw since he was about seventeen he said he wanted to get his own back on women for causing him nervous tension through sex before that hed been content with simply watching girls undress but because he was drunk and upset by being told off by his foreman he went beyond everything hed ever done before he also left a note that read this was what i thought would never happen is the other case just as heartening yes about the only consolation is that it happened in texas in the forties charles floyd started by watching women get undressed then he waited till they went to sleep killed them and raped them in that order there was one woman who never closed her curtains and he watched her for several nights before he finally climbed in after she fell asleep he battered her to death then wrapped her head in a sheet and raped her after that he spent the rest of the night in bed with her he killed other women too and when he got caught he admitted hed been a peeping tom who turned to murder and rape when the sexual excitement got too much for him the woman didnt close her curtains banks commented surely that was asking for it in a way jenny shot him a cold glance weve already been through that and i did say that women should be careful not to appear to be inviting men to sex and i said that we should be able to dress how we like and go where we damn well please so we agree to differ it looks like it but please understand im not condoning the woman leaving her curtains open it was probably a very stupid thing to do all im saying is that what floyd did was an act of violence more than of sex and that such things will happen anyway whatever we do until more men start to see women as people not as sex objects i dont believe the solution is as simple as that admirable as it sounds banks said yes they are acts of violence but its violence that is highly sexual in nature i think its true that at least one of the reasons for the rise in sex crimes is the increase in stimulation and that includes fashions pornography advertising films tv the lot and who determines womens fashions mostly men i should imagine thats right you dress us the way you want us you create us in the image you desire and then you have the gall to accuse us of asking for it okay calm down banks said concerned at seeing jenny so hurt and angry he put his hand on her shoulder and she didnt brush it off i understand what youre saying its a very complex subject and its hard to portion out blame im willing to take my share how about you jenny nodded and they shook hands what conclusions have you drawn from those cases banks asked none really only the most obvious ones i must be thick nothings obvious to me until we know our mans motivation we cant know whether some kind of trigger might exist for him or how close he is to reaching it look banks said glancing at his watch its almost ten oclock can i get you another drink yes please right you are and while im at the bar think about this is there any indication at all from what little we know already that our man might cross the same borders as floyd and byrne did ii the area around the lock splintered easily when mick pushed on the crowbar and the two of them broke into the dark silent house in no time the light from their small flashlights crisscrossed the kitchen picking out the gleaming appliances fridge washing machine microwave dishwasher oven quickly they moved on only the poor kept their money in jamjars in the kitchen down a short hallway was the splitlevel living room and mick cursed as he tripped over the divide it was a big room sparsely furnished as far as they could make out their flashlights picked out a threepiece suite tv and video on a stand and a music center by the door stood a tall cabinet full of china and crystal glasses mick opened the lower doors and found it full of booze scotch gin vodka brandy rum everything under the sunand he grabbed a bottle of remy martin by the neck he slugged it back greedily and began to cough and splutter trevor told him to keep quiet trevor was awed just to be in the place already hed forgotten what they came for and was trembling with the excitement of violation this was someones home someones castle and he wasnt supposed to be in it it felt like a vast cave full of possibilities one of those boat rides through dark tunnels he used to take as a child at blackpool pleasure beacha ghost train even because he did feel fear and each tiny detail his light picked out was a surprise a walllamp curving upwards like a bent arm holding a torch an ornate standard lamp with carved snakes winding around its column an antique pipe on the mantelpiece and his light caught occasional images from the big framed paintings on the walls a giant bird terrorizing a man some naked tart standing on a seashell he could hear his heartbeat his breathing and every movement he made was a further violation of somebody elses silence mick finished with the cognac and dropped the bottle on the floor wiping his lips with the back of his hand he tapped trevor on the shoulder and suggested that they look around upstairs in the master bedroom their eyes now accustomed to the dark picked out the outlines of bed wardrobe and dresser the gleam of a streetlamp through the net curtains helped visibility too and they turned off their penlights trevor began searching through the drawers using his light again to illuminate the contents he found dark silky underwear bras panties tights slips camisoles they were soft and slippery in his hands charging him with static and he rubbed them against his face smelling the fresh lemony scent of the woman he also found an old cigar box in a drawer full of the mans socks string vests and underpants inside it were a set of keys and about a hundred and fifty pounds in cash mick found what looked like a jewelry box on the dresser when he opened it up a ballet dancer began spinning to tinkling music he dropped the box and spilled the jewels on the floor then cursing he bent and scooped them up trevor looked around for any locked cabinets that the keys might fit but he found nothing the two of them went back downstairs feet sinking luxuriously into the deep pile carpeting and shining their flashlights again had another look around the living room there in a corner set into the wall was what looked like a safe trevor tried his keys but none fit mick tried the crowbar but it bent eventually they gave up lets take the vcr mick whispered no its too heavy too easy to trace lennyll get rid of it in london no mick were not taking big stuff like that itll slow us down youve got the jewels and ive got a hundred quid its enough enough mick snorted these people are fucking rolling in it weve not got much more than we get from the old bags yes we have and people are more careful these dayswere bloody lucky to have got so much reluctantly mick gave up the idea and agreed to leave trevor was still enjoying just being there though still tingling and he wanted to do something finally he unzipped his fly and started to urinate over the tv vcr and music center spraying lavishly on the carpet paintings and mantelpiece too it seemed to go on forever a powerful translucent stream glittering in the penlights beam and with it he felt himself relax felt a delicious warmth infuse his bones not to be outdone mick lowered his pants and dropped a steaming pile on the sheepskin rug in front of the fireplace giggling softly to himself as he did it when theyd both finished they left the way they came pausing only briefly to check the kitchen drawers and cupboards just in case iii theres no evidence that weve got a byrne or a floyd on our hands jenny said sipping her half of bitter i think that if we had something would have happened before now the trouble with psychology is that it works best when you know all the facts its hard to make guesses in the dark its also unscientific police works the same banks added theres nothing like facts but ive always found that occasional guesses or some kind of hunch based on limited knowledge can often work well it gives you a bit of room for the intuition imagination thats surprising coming from you jenny said looking at him as if all her earlier theories had been wrong why it just is i suppose ive been used to you asking for facts looking for evidence its important im not denying it but more often than not forensic evidence is only useful in getting a conviction first you have to catch the criminal and hes as cunning and imaginative as can be some arent of course some are plain stupid but theyre the easy ones i should think your peeper is probably quite intelligent again this is mostly guesswork but he has avoided capture so far and hes got his system worked out quite well it remains to be seen how adaptable he is hes certainly not a fool back to my original question banks said you dont think hell escalate i said i didnt think we had a serious sex criminal on our hands i dont think hes likely to move on to necrophilia or eating breasts with or without sugar but i wouldnt be too sure that merely peeping will keep him happy for much longer it might be getting too easy for him especially if hes intelligent if he stops getting his thrills that way then she shrugged at best he might turn to exhibitionism at worst some kind of attack molestation rape ultimately although it might not be rape in the legal sense there may be no penetration he might simply force women to strip i dont know im just trying to project the pattern he might feel the need for greater danger more risk he might need to see and absorb the fear of his victims yes it could happen especially the closer he gets to his original impulse what do you mean if he finds someone who reminds him of his mother or whoever he was first struck by then the stimulus might be too much it might cause him to push through to another level what can we do with what weve got so far then banks asked you want me to tell you your job why not youve not done so badly at it so far all right what id do is this find out how many men between the ages of about twenty and thirtyfive are either living alone or with a single parent most likely a mother why its just what the statistics show not completely reliable of course but better than a slap in the face with a wet fish wouldnt you say i would i was just wondering about the singleparent business i think theres generally more stability with both parents around unless the marriage is in a really bad way its what the stats show anyway shall i go on yes there shouldnt be all that many in eastvale i dont think most people move away or get married next id stake out selected pubs as they say on the telly ive told you how many pubs there are in eastvale we dont have anything like the manpower use what you have hes tried the same pub twice why not a third time theres one you can cover and you must have some pretty policewomen around whod be happy to work overtime to help get rid of this particular criminal surely banks nodded go on as far as the other two pubs are concerned you can cover them too if he struck lucky once he might try for a second time so you suggest that we cover the pubs hes already operated in yes good were already doing that bastard jenny laughed and slapped his arm playfully youve got to admit though i was on the right track wasnt i definitely any time you need a job is there anything else you might check around the pornographic bookshopsif there are any in eastvaleand the stripclubs i dont mean that you should pester everyone who enjoys seeing a bit of tit and ass now and then but make your presence felt maybe if you put the wind up him hell make a mistake you think hes likely to hang around such places its possible after all its looking isnt it even if its not as thrilling as the other kind by the way are there places like that in eastvale one or two we keep an eye on them but ill do as you recommend push a bit harder jenny nodded excuse me for asking she said but how did you get that scar and she leaned forward and touched the small scar by bankss right eye accident he said tersely years ago how disappointing and i thought you must have got it in some heroic struggle with a knifewielding maniac or perhaps from a gun that went off as you grappled to save someones life youve got quite a romantic imagination for a psychologist and youve got none come on where did you get it i told you an accident what kind of accident i fell off my tricycle liar youre only doing this because you think it makes you mysterious arent you and youre only teasing me because youve had too much to drink ooh i havent banks laughed perhaps not but if you drink any more you will have and then ill have to book you for drunken driving i havent got my car i walked up to town before we met and spent an hour or so in the library ive got mine todayand i havent had too much to drink come on ill give you a lift it was raining fast again and banks drove carefully around the base of castle hill down the narrow winding streets crossed the river and pulled up outside jennys house by the green about five minutes later coming in for a coffee she asked just a quick one iv trevor and mick sat in the front room sharing out the money trevor had already palmed about fifty pounds and he then managed to persuade mick to tell lenny that theyd only found fifty he knew that lenny would make up his profit by selling the jewelry anyway mick was restless hed taken some uppers before going out and some downers when they got back just to take the edge off now the drugs were clashing and fighting it out in his body he couldnt settle and listen to music or watch telly and trevor bored with him was getting ready to go they looked out of the window at the rain across the green they saw a car pull up outside one of the old houses its that bird mick said the redhead with the long legs ooh id like to feel them wrapped around my waist whos she with some fucking wanker for sure i think its that copper trevor said recognizing banks funny that i saw him with her the other night at the old bags house maybe shes a cop then waste of a good screw if you ask me nice pair of tits shes got though maybe hes just knocking her off trevor said hes going in anyway lucky bastard its funny though seeing them twice like that whats so funny i see her all the time she only lives across the green you know i mean seeing them together like that hes probably poking her fucking hell wouldnt i just like those long legs wrapped around my waist but mick was fast slipping into the arms of morpheus the amphetamine already mostly burned up was losing to the barbiturate and he felt as if his brain was slowly turning to cottonwool and his senses were closing like valves the light around the edges of his eyes dimmed and he could hear a gentle whooshing like the ocean in his ears his tongue felt too tired and too heavy to speak trevor recognized the signs put on his coat and left it had been a good night one of the best in years and he felt as he walked home through the quiet town reliving the excitement that he could hardly wait for next monday chapter eight i the sudden creaking of rusty hinges broke the silence in the cool church sandra and harriet looked around and saw robin allott coming in followed closely by norman chester so this is where youre hiding norman said as he shut the heavy door behind them we were wondering where the lovely ladies had got to his voice echoed from the stone walls what are you doing robin asked waiting for the sun sandra replied i want to get a good shot of the stainedglass window here it shouldnt be long robin said walking down the aisle toward them the clouds seem to be breaking up and the winds pushing them along nicely it is quite beautiful isnt it sandra nodded glancing up again at the east window they stood in the parish church of st mary muker one of the places the camera club was visiting on its trip to swaledale most club members were out walking along ivelet side putting terry whighams ideas on landscape photography into practice with shots of the spectacular view of oxnop muker side and the dark mass of great shunner fell harriet and sandra however had stuck to the village itself photographing the craft center village store and old literary institute before approaching st marys its supposed to depict the landscape outside robin went on pointing to the window you can see christ the good shepherd there leading his flock and carrying a lambreal horned swaledale sheep the hill is kisdon that big one out there and you can see the river swale to the right and muker beck to the left you seem to know a bit about it sandra said have you been here before once or twice norman s footsteps echoed as he wandered around examining the font and chalice it is a wonderful church though robin said and the cemeterys interesting too its the kind of place i wouldnt mind being buried in how morbid not at all they used to have to carry people in wicker coffins ten or fifteen miles away to grinton church before this place was built they took the old corpse way along ivelet side people wanted to be buried on consecrated ground id hope for a long and healthy life first though like poor alice matlock alice matlock yes the old lady they found dead in her cottage the other day surely your husband must have mentioned her yes of course sandra said i was just surprised to hear you talk about her thats all robin looked up at the dim stained glass i knew her thats all i was a bit shaken to hear that someone whod lived through so much should have died so violently does your husband have any clues none that hes told me about how did you come to know her i suppose im exaggerating a bit i havent seen her for a few years you know how it is we lose touch with the old so easily she was a friend of my grandmothers my fathers mother they were about the same age and both of them worked as nurses at eastvale infirmary for years my gran used to take me over to visit alice when i was a kid havent you thought that you might be able to help sandra asked me said robin startled how i said i hadnt seen her for years alan says its frustrating not to know much about her background most of her friends are dead anything you could tell him might be a help i dont see how when youve lived with a policeman for as long as i have sandra said you dont ask how would you be willing to see him i dont know i i cant see how it could help come on alan wont eat you you said you were upset about her death surely its not too much to ask no no i dont suppose it is if you think itll help of course it might very well good ill tell him then if i see him hes not home much these days still we are supposed to be going out tonight if he hasnt forgotten whens a good time im sure he wont want to inconvenience you i dont know this weekend sometime i should be home fine sandra took robins address and turned her attention back to the stainedglass window come on come on she urged the sun they stood there a full minute or more until slowly the glass brightened and the red of christs robe the blue of the rivers at his feet and the purple orange and green of the hills behind began to glow sandra selected a wide aperture and let the builtin exposuremeter set the shutter speed its strange robin said watching but it sometimes seems to me as if were looking outside through a clear window at some idealized image yes it does harriet agreed like a vision ooh look how the colors are shining on us vision indeed norman sneered walking over from the northwest window a right lot of romantics you are and he joined them as they took it in turns to capture the stained glass on film ii friday brought a lull in affairs at the eastvale station nothing had come of the previous evenings pub surveillance and richmond said that hed shown the artists impression of their one suspect in the robberies to some of the lads on the beat but nobody had recognized him after sending the detective constable to the town hall to check on the statistics of young men living alone or with single parents banks found himself with little to do no dorothy wycombe marched in to liven up the day no jenny fuller nothing he had plenty of time to think though and spent the rest of the morning puzzling over the three cases whose outlines had become blurred in his mind there was a peeping tom in eastvale that was clear enough also two young thugs had robbed defenseless old women but had any of them killed alice matlock on the evidence so far it looked like it she had been old and alone her home had been left in a shambles and money and silverware had been stolen it was certainly possible that she had tried to struggle with them and had fallen or been pushed backwards catching the back of her head on the sharp corner of the table there was still room for doubt though and banks found himself wondering if it could have happened some other way for some other reason he had ruled out the peeper after what jenny had said so the next step was to try and discover if anyone had a motive for getting rid of alice matlock or at least for engaging in such a violent confrontation with her according to sergeant hatchley ethel carstairs had said that alice had kept herself to herself over the past few years and that she had not been the type to takein strays or befriend strangers if the two young tearaways were not responsible for her death then who was and why unfortunately the slow afternoon allowed banks more time than he would have liked to reflect on the events of the previous evening sandra had been asleep when he got home so he was spared a telling off but she had been very frosty in the morning reminding him that they had arranged to go out that evening with harriet slade and her husband who had already booked a sitter and that hed promised to take the kids up to castle hill on saturday morning it was her way of hinting that he wasnt spending enough time with his nearest and dearest whatever else he might be up to though he certainly felt pangs of guilt he hadnt really been up to anything much at all his first move after jenny had led him into her front room had been to remark on the expensive stereo system and the lack of a television i used to have one she said heading for the kitchen but i gave it to a colleague without it i get much more donereading listening to music going out seeing films when i had it i was terribly lazy i always take the line of least resistance it doesnt look much like a professors living room banks shouted through there were only a couple of recent psychology journals and a folder of notes on the table the studys upstairs she yelled back i do work hard honestly inspector milk and sugar no thanks banks squinted at the framed print on the wall it showed an enormous dark mountain more steep than broad completely dominating a small village in the foreground who did this he asked jenny when she came into the room carrying two mugs of coffee that its an emily carr ive never heard of her said banks who had gained a basic knowledge of art through sandra thats not surprising shes a canadian i spent three years doing postgraduate work in vancouver shes a west coast artist did a lot of totem poles and forest scenes oddly enough i saw that painting in a gallery at kleinburg near toronto i fell in love with it right away everything looks alive dont you think yes in a dark creepy kind of way but im not sure it would pass my simple test for paintings dont tell me she said imitating a yorkshire accent ah dont know much about art burah knows wharah likes not bad for a leicester girl eh banks laughed better than i could do anyway thats not my test i just ask myself if i could live with it on my living room wall and you couldnt no not that what could you live with it sounds like a very hard test banks thought back over some of the paintings sandra had introduced him to modiglianis reclining nude maybe chagalls and the village monets waterlilies good lord youd need an entire room for that one yes but it would be worth it with the coffees jenny also poured out generous measures of cognac giving banks no time to refuse then she put some music on the cassette deck and sat down beside him this is good music he said what is it bruchs violin concerto mmm ive never heard it before are you a classical music buff oh no i mean i enjoy classical but i like a bit of everything really i like jazzmiles davis and monk i still love some of the old sixties stuffbeatles dylan stonesbut my old copies are a bit scratched up by now for a psychology teacher you seem to know a lot about the arts english was my second subject and my father was a bit of an amateur artist even now i seem to spend more time with the arts faculty than the sciences most psychologists are so boring do you like opera thats one thing i dont know very well my sister took me to an opera north performance of la traviata once years ago but im afraid i dont remember much about it try some ill lend you a couple of tapes tosca thats a good one whats it about an evil chief of police who tries to coerce a singer into sleeping with him by threatening to have her lover killed that sounds cheerful jenny said then she shivered someone just walked over my grave the musics good some fine arias all right heres to opera said jenny smiling and clinking glasses do you think we did a good evenings work yes i think so we didnt expect miracles thats not why we brought you in charming i know why you brought me in i mean why we brought a psychologist in yes i know that too why you were all afraid that this was going to spiral into a rash of rapes and sex murders and you wanted to check on the evidence partly true and given that we also wanted to make damn sure we had a better chance of stopping him before he went too far are you any closer that remains to be seen as they sat in silence banks could feel his heart beating faster and his throat constricting he knew he shouldnt be there knew there could only be one interpretation of his accepting the offer of coffee and he was nervous about what to do the music flowed around them and the tension grew so strong it made the muscles in his jaw ache jenny stirred and her scent wafted toward him it was too subtle to be called a perfume it was the kind of fresh and happy smell that took him back to carefree childhood trips to the country look banks finally blurted out putting down his coffee and facing jenny im sorry if ive given you the impression that the wrong impression but im married then having confessed in what he felt to be as graceless a manner as possible he started to apologize and rephrase but jenny cut in i know that you fool you think a psychologist cant spot a married man a mile off you know then jenny shrugged im not trying to seduce you if thats what you mean yes i like you im attracted to you i get the impression that you feel the same way dammit then maybe i am trying to seduce you i dont know she reached out and touched his face no strings alan why must you always be so serious immediately he felt himself freeze and it shocked her so much that she jumped away and turned her face to the wall all right she said ive made in idiot of myself now go go on go listen jenny banks said youre not wrong about anything im sorry i shouldnt have come why did you then jenny asked softening a little but still not facing him banks shrugged and lit a cigarette if i went to bed with you once he said i wouldnt want it to stop there you dont know till you try it she said turning and managing a thin smile yes i do i might be lousy in bed thats not the point i knew you wouldnt do it anyway you did im a psychologist remember ive spent enough time with you to know youre not frivolous and that youre probably a very monogamous person am i so transparent not at all im an expert maybe you were testing yourself taking a risk well they do say theres no better test of virtue than temptation and how do you feel now intolerably virtuous jenny laughed and kissed him swiftly on the lips it was a friendly sort of kiss and instead of increasing bankss desire it seemed to diffuse it and put things back on a simpler more relaxed level dont go just yet jenny said if you do ill think its because of all this and itll keep me awake all night all right but only if i get another black coffeeand no more cognac coming up sir by the way banks asked as jenny headed for the kitchen what about you divorced single single jenny leaned against the doorpost marriage never happened to me not even almost oh yes almost but you cant be almost married can you that would be like being a little bit pregnant and she turned to go and make the coffee leaving a smile behind her which faded slowly like the cheshire cats banks snapped out of his reverie feeling halfremorseful for having gone so far and halfregretful that he hadnt seized the moment and abandoned himself to eros he put on his headphones rewound dido and aeneas to the lament when i am laid in earth and left the building abandoned by her lover queen dido sang remember me remember me it sent shivers up and down bankss spine iii the evening out with harriet and david went well they drove along the dale on the road by the river swain which was coursing high and fast after the recent rains beyond the sloping commons dark valley sides rose steeply on both sides like sleeping whales at fortford david took an unfenced minor road over the hills and down into the village of axeby the greyhound an old lowceilinged pub with walls three feet thick held a folk night there every friday that was so well respected it even drew people from as far afield as leeds bradford and manchester they were early enough to find a table for four near the back which provided a relatively unobstructed view of the small stage david brought the first round and they drank to a good evening though banks thought david an assistant bank manager a bit of a bore he made an effort to like him for sandras sake and the two of them got on well enough but banks still found himself wondering what such a lively and interesting woman as harriet saw in her husband the music was good there were none of the modern whining protest songs that got up bankss nose you could usually depend on the greyhound for solid traditional folk musicsir patrick spens the wife of ushers well marie hamilton the unquiet grave and the likeand that night there was nothing to spoil bankss joy in the old ballads which he loved almost as much as opera the high and low or culture and folk distinctions didnt concern him at allit was the sense of a story of drama and tension in the music that enthralled him because it was davids turn to drive that night banks was allowed more than his usual two pints and as the beer at the greyhoundbrewed on the premiseswas famous for its quality he indulged himself freely he could take his drink though for a small man and the only signs that hed had one or two too many were that he smoked and talked more than usual sandra stuck to gin and tonic and drank slowly the day which had been heavy with disturbing feelings for banks seemed to be ending well this evening out with sandra and the slades good music and good beer was driving jenny from his mind looking back from a distance of four or five pints what he had done didnt seem so bad many men would have done much worse true he had sounded terribly moral and sanctimoniousbut how else can you sound he asked himself if you have to say no to a beautiful intelligent woman as he reached for a cigarette sandra glanced over from her conversation and they smiled at each other iv it was a good position on the sloping roof because lying down he seemed to melt into the slates but it was very uncomfortable and he was getting tired of waiting hed done his reconnaissance well enoughnot hanging around the front especially as the street was a culdesac but just passing by occasionally watching from the unlit alley at the back nothing more than a narrow dirt track between fenced back gardens ideal hed slipped through the fence climbed the pipe up the side of the wallit was an addition to the house a kind of storeroom or workshop attached to the backand found himself just on a level with the bedroom window he knew it was the right one because hed seen the childrens wallpaper in the front rooms as hed passed by one day he also knew that she tended to go to bed first the husband would often stay up in the front room and listen to music or read for a while what was keeping her theyd been home half an hour and still no sign finally the bedroom light came on and he took his position by the chink at the bottom of the curtains the woman tied back her straight blond hair and reached behind her back for her zipper slowly she pulled it down and slipped the black silky dress from her pale shoulders letting it fall all the way to the carpet then picked it up and hung it carefully in the wardrobe there she stood the dark v of cleavage clear at the front of her bra the inviting curve in at the waist and out again softly at the hips her figure was slight there was nothing out of proportion nothing in excess it was what he had been waiting for what had first stirred his feelings and had eluded him ever since he felt himself getting more and more excited as she sat at the dressing table and removed her makeup before undressing anymore he could see her reflection her concentration as she applied the tufts of cotton wool it was just like he remembered almost unconsciously he rubbed himself as he watched not wanting her to finish willing it to go on forever finally she stood up again and pulled her nightdress out from under the pillow facing him she undipped her bra and he watched her small breasts fall slightly as it loosened he was rubbing himself all the time faster and faster and then it happened what hed been waiting for she saw him it all happened in slow motion one moment she was taking off the bra the next a look of shock spread across her face slowly like spilled milk on a table as she caught his eye at the same moment he climaxed and the spasms shook his body with pleasure he slid off the roof dropped to the garden and shot out through the fence before she could even open the curtains sandra couldnt say exactly how or at what moment she knew she was being watched it was sudden a feeling of not being alone and when she looked she saw an eye it seemed disembodied just hanging there in the gap in the curtains but as she ran forward yelling for alan at the same time she caught a glimpse of a figure in a dark raincoat slipping through the gap in the fence and making off down the back alley banks came running up and then left sandra to calm down the children who had heard her cry out while he gave chase there was nobody in the alley and it was too dark to see clearly anyway first banks ran up to the main road end but there was nobody in sight then he walked slowly and quietly in the other direction wishing hed had the foresight to bring a flashlight but he saw nothing move in the shadows and however still he stood he couldnt hear breathing or rustlingnothing all he managed to do was disturb a cat which darted across his path and almost gave him a heart attack he walked as far down as the narrow gap at the far end that led to the park but it was pitch black there was no point in going any further whoever it was had melted back into the darkness another victory banks cursed and kicked the rickety fence hard before storming back indoors chapter nine i on saturday morning as promised banks stood high on the castle battlements and looked out over his patch or manor as he would have called it in london it was a sharp fresh day and all the clouds had gone the sky was not the deep warm cerulean of summer but a lighter more piercing blue as if the cold of the coming winter had already wormed its way into the air banks looked down over the cobbled market square the ancient cross and squaretowered church were almost lost among the makeshift wooden stalls and the riot of color that blossomed every market day the bus station to the east was full of red singledecker buses and in the adjacent car park green and white coaches dwarfed the cars small parties of tourists ambled around bright yellow and orange anoraks zipped up against the surprising nip in the air banks wore his donkeyjacket buttoned right up to the collar and the children wore kagoules over their woollen sweaters to tracy eastvale castle represented a living slice of history an elizabethan palace where it was rumored mary queen of scots had been imprisoned for a while and a richard or a henry had briefly held court ladiesinwaiting whispered royal secrets to one another in echoing galleries while barons and earls danced galliards and pavanes with their elegant wives at banquets to brian the place evoked a more barbarous era of history it was a stronghold from which ancient britons poured down boiling oil on roman invaders a citadel riddled with dank dungeons where thumbscrews rack and iron maiden awaited unfortunate prisoners neither was entirely correct the castle was in fact built by the normans at about the same time as richmond and like its more famous contemporary it was built of stone and had an unusually massive keep while the children explored the ruins banks looked over the roofs below checkerboard patterns of red pantile stone and welsh slate and let his eyes follow the contours of the hills where they rose to peaks and fells in the west and flattened into a gently undulating plain to the east in all directions the trees were tinged with autumns rust just like the picture on his calendar banks could make out the towns limits beyond the river the east side estate with its two ugly tower blocks sprawled until it petered out into fields and in the west gallows view pointed its dark shriveled finger toward swainsdale to the north the town seemed to spread out between the fork of two diverging roads one leading to the northern dales and the lakes the other to tyneside and the east coast beyond these older residential areas there were only a few scattered farmhouses and outlying hamlets though he saw the view banks could hardly take it in still troubled as he was by the events of the previous evening he hadnt reported the incident and that nagged at his sense of integrity on the other hand as he and sandra had decided it would probably have been a lot more embarrassing and galling all around to have reported it it was easy to imagine the headlines the sniggers and even as he worried about his own decision banks also wondered how many others had not seen fit to tell the police of similar incidents if women were still reluctant to report rape for example would many of them not also balk at reporting a peeping tom for banks though the problem was even more involved he was a policeman therefore he was expected to set an example to follow the letter of the law himself in the past he may have occasionally driven at a little over the speed limit or worse had perhaps one drink too many before driving home from a christmas party but he had never been faced with such a conflict between professional and family duty before sandra and he had decided though over a long talk in bed and that decision was final they had also told the children who had heard sandras scream that she had thought someone was trying to break in but had been mistaken what bothered banks was that if there was no investigation then valuable clues or information might be sacrificed to put that right as far as possible sandra had offered to talk to the neighbors discreetly to ask if anyone had noticed any strangers hanging around it wasnt much but it was better than nothing so that was that banks shrugged and watched a red bus try to extricate itself from an awkward parking spot off the square the gold hands against the blue face of the church clock said eleventhirty he had promised that they would be home for lunch by twelve rounding up brian and tracy who had fallen to arguing about the history of the castle banks ushered them toward the exit of course its an ancient castle brian argued theyve got dungeons with chains on the walls and its all falling to pieces tracy despite her anachronistic image of the period knew quite well that the castle was built in the early part of the twelfth century and she said so in no uncertain terms dont be silly brian shot back look at what a state its in it must have taken thousands of years to get so bad for one thing tracy countered with a longsuffering sigh its built of stone they didnt build things out of stone as long ago as that besides its in the history book ask the teacher dummy youll see if im not right brian retreated defensively into fantasy he was a brave knight and tracy was a damsel in distress letting down her hair from a high narrow window he gave it a long hard pull and swaggered off to fight a dragon they wound their way down to the market square which though it had seemed to move as slowly and silently as in a dream from high up buzzed with noisy activity at close quarters the vendors sold everything from toys cassette tapes and flashlight batteries to lace curtains paintbrushes and used paperbacks but mostly they sold clothes jeans jackets shirts lingerie socks shoes a regular whom banks had christened flash harry because of his pencilthin mustache flat cap and spivlike air juggled with china plates and cups as he extolled the virtues of his wares tourists and locals clustered around the drafty stalls handling goods and haggling with the redfaced holders who sipped hot oxo and wore fingerless woollen gloves to keep their hands warm without inhibiting the counting of money after a quick look at some childrens shoesas cheap in quality as they were in pricebanks led brian and tracy south along market street under the overhanging secondfloor bay windows about a quarter of a mile further on beyond where the narrow street widened was the culdesac where they lived it was five to twelve superintendent gristhorpe called sandra said as soon as they got in about fifteen minutes ago youre to get over to number clarence gardens as soon as you can he didnt say what it was about bloody hell banks grumbled buttoning up his donkeyjacket again can you keep lunch warm sandra nodded cant say how long ill be it doesnt matter she said and smiled as he kissed her its only a casserole oh i almost forgot he invited us to sunday dinner tomorrow as well thats some consolation i suppose banks said as he walked out to the garage ii its a bloody disgrace thats what it is maurice ottershaw announced hands on hips banks wasnt sure whether he meant the burglary itself or the fact that the police hadnt managed to prevent it ottershaw was a difficult character a tall grayhaired man deeply tanned from his recent holiday he seemed to think that all the public services were there simply for his benefit and he consequently treated their representatives like personal valets stopping just short of telling banks to go and make some tea its not unusual banks offered by way of meager compensation for the mess on the walls carpet and appliances a lot of burglars desecrate the places they rob i dont bloody care about that ottershaw went on the redness of his anger imposing itself even on his tan i want these bloody vandals caught were doing our best banks told him patiently unfortunately we dont have a lot to go on richmond and hatchley had already talked to the neighbors who had either been out or had heard nothing manson had been unable to find any fingerprints except for those of the owners and their cleaning lady who had been in just the other day to give the place a thorough goingover there was no way of telling exactly on what day the robbery had taken place although it must have happened between tuesday the day of the cleaners visit and the ottershaws return early that saturday morning can you give me a list of whats missing one hundred and fiftytwo pounds seventyfive pence in cash for a start ottershaw said why did you leave so much cash lying around the place it wasnt lying around it was in a box in a drawer it was just petty cash for paying tradesmen and such i dont often have cash on me use the card most of the time i see youre an art lover banks said looking toward the large framed prints of boschs gardenofearthly delights and botticellis the birth of venus hanging on the walls banks wasnt sure whether he could live with either of them ottershaw nodded just prints of course good ones mind you i have invested in one or two original works he pointed to a rough white canvas with yellow and black lines scratched across it like railway tracks converging and diverging london artist doing very well for herself these days not when i bought it though got it for a song poor girl must have been starving any pictures missing ottershaw shook his head antiques banks gestured toward the standard lamp crystalware and bone china no its still all there and in one piece thank the lord anything else some jewelry imitation but still worth about five hundred pounds my wife can give you descriptions of individual pieces and theres all this of course my wife wont watch this tv again nor will she touch the hifi itll all have to be replaced theyve even spilled the remy this last remark seemed a bit melodramatic to banks but he let it slip by where is your wife sir he asked lying down shes a very highly strung woman and this on top of being stuck at the bloody airport for a whole night it was just too much for her you were supposed to be home yesterday yes i told you didnt i bloody airport wallahs went on strike did anyone know you were away neighbors a couple of friends at work and the club what club would that be sir eastvale golf club ottershaw announced puffing out his chest as you probably know its an exclusive kind of place so its very unlikely that any criminal elements would gain access we have to keep all possibilities open banks said managing to avoid ottershaws scornful glare by scribbling nonsense in his notebook there was no point in getting involved in a staring match with a victim he thought anyone else not that i know of would your wife be likely to have told anyone ive covered everyone we know where do you work sir ottershaw kilney and glenbaum banks had seen the sign often enough the solicitors offices were on market street just a little further south than the police station whos going to clear all this up ottershaw demanded roughly gesturing around the disaster area of his living room the feces lay curled on the rug staining the white fibers around and underneath it the tv video and stereo looked as if theyd been sprayed with a hose but it was quite obvious what had actually happened amateurs banks thought to himself kids probably out on a lark maybe the same kids whod done the old ladies houses graduating to the big time but somebody had told them where to come that the ottershaws were away and if he could find out who then the rest would follow i really dont know banks said maybe forensic would take it away with them perhaps with a bit of luck theyd be able to reconstruct the whole person from the feces height weight coloring eating habits health complexion some hope thats fine that is ottershaw complained we go away for a tenday holiday and if its not enough that the bloody wallahs choose to go on strike the day we leave we come home to find the house covered in shit he said the last word very loudly so much so that the lab men going over the room smiled at each other as banks grimaced were not a cleaning service you know sir he chided ottershaw mildly as if talking to a child if we were then wed never have time to find out who did this would we shock could kill the wife you know ottershaw said ignoring him doctor said so weak heart no sudden shocks to the system shes a very squeamish womanand thats her favorite rug that sheepskin shell never be able to manage it then perhaps sir youd better handle it yourself banks suggested glancing toward the offending ordure before walking out and leaving the house to the experts iii the oak turned out to be one of those huge victorian monstrositiesusually called the jubilee or the victoriacurving around the corner where cardigan drive met elmet street about half a mile north of gallows view it was all glossy tiles and stained glass and it reminded banks very much of the prince william in peterborough outside which he used to play marbles with the other local kids while they all waited for their parents inside generations of spilt beer and stale cigarette smoke gave the place a brownish glow and a sticky carpet but the atmosphere in the spacious lounge was cheery and warm the gaudy ceiling was high and the bar had clearly been moved from its original central position to make room for a small dance floor it now stretched the whole length of one of the walls and a staffor what looked more like a squadronof buxom barmaids flexed their muscles on the pumps and tried to keep smiling as they rushed around to keep up with the demand the mirrors along the back reflecting chandeliers rows of exotic spirits bottles and the impatient customers heightened the sense of goodnatured chaos saturday night at the oak was kneesup night and a local comedian alternated with a pop group whose roots both musical and sartorial were firmly planted in the early sixties what on earth made you bring me to a place like this jenny fuller asked a puzzled smile on her face atmosphere banks answered smiling at her itll be an education ill bet you said theres been a new development something you wanted to tell me banks took a deep breath and regretted it immediately the air in the oak wasnt of the highest quality even by modern pollution standards fortunately both the comedian and the pop group were between sets and the only noise was the laughter and chatter of the drinkers when banks had phoned jenny after hed left the ottershaws house he hadnt been sure why he wanted her to meet him at the oak or what he wanted to say to her he had brougnt the tosca cassettes that he had promised to lend her but that wasnt excuse enough in itself she had been obliging but said she had to be off by nine as there was a small party honoring a visiting lecturer at the university banks also wanted to be home early for sandras sake so the arrangement suited him last night we had a visit from the peeper he said finally at least sandra did my god jenny gasped wideeyed and openmouthed what happened not much she spotted him quite early on and he ran off down the back alley i went out there but hed already disappeared into the night how is she shes fine taking it all very philosophically but shes a deep one sandra she doesnt always let people know what her real feelings areespecially me i should imagine she feels like the othershurt violated dirty angry jenny nodded most likely isnt it a bit awkward for you as far as your jobs concerned thats something else i wanted to tell you i havent reported it jenny stared at banks far too long for his comfort it was an intense curious kind of look and he finally gave in by going to the bar for two more drinks the crowd was about five deep with what looked like at least two local rugby teams and banks was smaller and slighter than most of the men who waved their glasses in the air and yelled over the heads of others three pints of black and tan elsie love please vodka and slimline two pints of stella cherry b and a brandy and creme de menthe five pints of guinness kahlua and coke and a ginandit for the wife love everybody seemed to be placing such large orders fortunately banks spotted richmond tall and distinctive closer to the bar he caught the constables attentionthe man was on duty after alland asked for oneandahalf pints of bitter surprised but immediately compliant richmond added it to his own order rather than demand waiter service of his young constable banks waited till richmond had got the drinks paid him and made off what are you thinking he asked sitting next to jenny again jenny laughed it wasnt anything serious remember the other night so the ice was broken the subject wasnt taboo after all yes he answered waiting i said i knew how youd behave even though i hoped it would be different something like that well i was just trying to work out where id have placed my bet reporting or not reporting i think id have been wrong its not that i think youre a slave to duty or anything like that but you like to do things right youre honest id guess that if you dont do things the way you know they should be done you suffer for it conscience too much of it probably i never asked for it banks replied lighting his second cigarette of the evening you werent born with it either no no conditioning i didnt ask for that either no you didnt none of us do youve surprised me this time though id have guessed that you would report the incident no matter how much embarrassment it might cause banks shook his head there would be too much unfavorable publicity all around not only for sandra but for the department too that wycombe woman would just love to get her hands on something like this if it were made public and we solved the case quickly according to her it would only be because a policemans wife was among the victims no id rather keep it quiet but what about interviews questioning people sandra and i will do that locally well ask if anyone has seen any strangers hanging around jenny looked at him quizzically im not judging you you know im not the authorities i know banks said i needed to tell someone i couldnt think of anyone else whod automatically be on your side i was going to say understand but i suppose youre right i did count on your support you have it whether you need it or not and your secrets safe with me there is something a bit more technical i want to ask you too banks went on this new incident the fact that it was sandra my wife do you think that means anything if he knew who it was and i think he probably did then yes i do think its a development goon it means that hes getting bolder he needs to take greater risks to get his satisfaction unless hes some kind of hermit or human ostrich he must have read about reactions to what hes been doing probably with a kind of pride therefore he must know that youve been heading an investigation into the case he does a bit of research on you finds you have an attractive blond wife or knows her already banks cut in what makes you think that he could simply have watched the house discreetly seen her come and go its just a feeling ive got yes but what basis does it have where does it come from banks thought as deeply as he could given that the pop group had started its set with a carbon copy of the ancient searchers hit love potion number nine we were talking about the camera club sandra belongs to he answered slowly sometimes they have nude models and i said that most of the men probably dont even have films in their cameras it was just a joke at the time but could there be any connection im not sure jenny replied a camera club does grant permission for its members to look at the models though if someone really didnt have film in his camera it might give the illusion of peeping of doing something vaguely wrong thats a bit farfetched im afraid but then so is your theory we can at least expect our man to be interested in naked women although its spying on them that gives him his real thrills what happened about this other fellow you got onto wooller if thats his name yes wooller lives on gallows view we did a bit of very discreet checking and it turns out that he was on a twoweek library sciences course in cardiff when two of the incidents took place that lets him out however much pornography hes got hidden away sorry jenny said glancing at her watch but ive got to dash the department head will have apoplexy if im not there to greet our eminent visitor she patted bankss arm dont worry i think you made the right decision and one more point id say that our mans recent actions also show that hes got a sense of humor its a bit of a joke to him leaving you with egg on your face wouldnt you say call me after the weekend banks nodded and watched jenny walk away he noticed richmond glancing over at him and wondered how bad it lookeda detective chief inspector spending saturday evening in the oak with an attractive woman he saw jenny in his minds eye just as she had looked on thursday night after telling him she knew he wouldnt sleep with her was it being predictable that annoyed him so much if so he could console himself with thoughts of having won a small victory this time or was it guilt over what he had really wanted to do maybe he would do it anyway he thought sauntering out into the chilly october evening it wasnt too late yet surely a man like a woman could change his mind after all what harm would it do no strings jenny had said banks turned up his collar as he walked back to the cortina he needed cigarettes and fortunately there was an offlicense next door to the pub as he picked up his change he paused for a moment before pocketing it hatchley might have questioned the barmaids at the oak but he hadnt said anything about talking to the local shopkeepers banks identified himself and asked the owners name patel the man answered cautiously what time do you close ten oclock its not against the law is it mr patel answered in a broad yorkshire accent no not at all its nothing to do with that banks assured him think back to last monday night did you notice anybody hanging around outside here during the evening mr patel shook his head it had probably been too early in the evening for the peeper and too long ago for the shopkeeper to remember as banks had feared a bit later though mr patel went on i noticed a bloke waiting at the bus stop for a bloody long time there must have been two or three buses went by and ee were still there i think that were monday last what time was this after id closed up ee just sat there in that bus shelter over tstreet banks looked out of the window and saw the shelter a dark rectangle set back from the road where were you he asked home mr patel said turning up his eyes the flats above tshop very convenient yes yes indeed banks said getting more interested tell me more i remember because i was just closing tcurtains when a bus went by and i noticed that bloke was still in tshelter it seemed a bit odd to me i mean why would a chap sit in a bus shelter if ee werent waiting on a bus why indeed banks said go on nothing more to tell a bit later i looked again and ee were still there what time did he leave i didnt actually see him leave but eed gone by eleven oclock that were tlast time i looked out and the time before that excuse me when was the last time you looked out and saw him about alf past ten can you describe the man mr patel shook his head sadly sorry it were too dark i think ee were wearing a dark overcoat or a raincoat though slim a bit taller than you i got the impression ee were youngish someow it was ard to pick him out from the shadows dont worry about it banks said at least the color of the coat matched the description that sandra and the other victims had given it had to be the man they could talk to other people in the street shopkeepers locals even the bus drivers maybe somebody else would have noticed a man waiting for a bus he never caught on monday night look banks said this is very important youve been a great help mr patel shrugged and shook his head shyly have you ever seen the man before i dont think so but how would i know i couldnt recognize him from adam could i if you see him again or anyone you think looks like him anyone hanging about the bus stop without catching a bus or acting oddly in any way let me know will you banks wrote his number on a card and passed it to mr patel who nodded and promised to keep his eyes skinned for the first time in days banks felt quite cheerful as he drove home to the delightful melodies of the magic flute chapter ten i on sunday morning banks paid his visit to robin allott who lived in his parents modest semi about ten minutes walk away a tiny birdlike woman answered his knock and fluttered around him all the way into the living room do sit down inspector she said pulling out a chair ill call robin hes in his room reading the sunday papers banks looked quickly around the room the furniture was a little threadbare and there was no vcr or music center only an ancientlooking television quite a contrast from the ottershaws opulence he thought hes coming down mrs allott said can i make you a cup of tea yes please banks said partly to get her out of the way for a while she made him nervous with her constant hovering i hope im not disturbing you and mr allott he said oh no not at all she lowered her voice my husbands an invalid inspector he had a serious stroke about two years ago and he cant get around much he stays in bed most of the time and i look after him as best i can that explained the badly worn furnishings banks thought whatever help the social services gave the loss of the breadwinner was a serious financial setback for most families its been a great help having robin home since his divorce she added then shrugged but he cant stay forever can he banks heard footsteps on the stairs and as robin entered the room mrs allott went to make the tea hello robin said shaking bankss hand he looked an almost unnaturally healthy and handsome young man despite the unmistakable signs of his chestnutbrown hair receding at the temples sandra said you might call its about alice matlock banks said id just like to find out as much as i can about her i dont really see how i can help you inspector robin said i told sandra the same but she seemed quite insistent surely youll have found out all you want to know from her close friends she only had one it seems a lady called ethel carstairs and even they havent been friends for long most of alice s contemporaries appear to have died i suppose thats what happens when you reach her age anyway as i said i dont know how i can help but fire away had you seen her recently not for a while no if i remember correctly the last time was about three years ago i was interested in portrait photography and i thought shed make a splendid subject i have the picture somewhereill dig it out for you later and before that i hadnt seen her since my gran died she and your grandmother were close friends yes my fathers mother they grew up together and both worked most of their lives in the hospital eastvales not such a big place or it wasnt then so it was quite natural theyd be close they went through the wars together too that creates quite a bond between people when i was a child my gran would often take me over to alice s mrs allott appeared with the tea and perched at the opposite end of the table can you tell me anything about her past banks asked robin nothing you couldnt find out from anyone else i dont think i did realize later though when i was old enough to understand what a fascinating life shed led all the changes shed witnessed can you imagine it when she was a girl cars were few and far between and people didnt move around much and it wasnt only technology look at how our attitudes have changed how the whole structure of society is different how did alice relate to all this believe it or not inspector she was quite a radical she was an early struggler for womens rights and she even went so far as to serve with the international brigade as a nurse in the spanish civil war was she a communist not in the strict sense as far as i know a lot of people who fought against franco werent what were your impressions of her impressions i suppose when i was a child i was just fascinated with the cottage she lived in it was so full of odds and ends all those alcoves just overflowing with knickknacks shed collected over the years tarnished cigarette lighters victorian pennies and those old silver threepenny bitsall kinds of wonderful junk i dont imagine i paid much attention to alice herself i remember i was always fascinated by that ship in the bottle the miranda i stared at it for hours on end it was alive for me a real ship i even imagined the crew manning the sails doing battle with pirates mrs allott poured the tea and laughed he always did have plenty of imagination my robin didnt you robin ignored her how did it happen anyway how was she killed were still not sure banks said it looks like she might have fallen over in a struggle with some kids come to rob her but were trying to cover any other possibilities have you any ideas i shouldnt think it was kids surely why not weil they wouldnt kill a frail old woman would they youd be surprised at what kids do these days mr allott as i said they might not have killed her intentionally robin smiled im a teacher at the college of further education inspector so im no great believer in the innocence and purity of youth but couldnt it have happened some other way we dont know thats what im trying to determine what do you have in mind nothing im afraid it was just an idea you cant think of anyone who might have held a grudge or wanted her out of the way for some other reason im sorry no i wish i could help but thats all right banks said standing to leave i wasnt expecting you to give us the answer is there anything else you can think of no i can dig out that portrait for you though if youre interested out of politeness sake banks accompanied robin upstairs and waited as he flipped through one of his many boxes of photographs the picture of alice when he found it was mounted on a mat and still seemed in very good shape it showed a closeup of the old womans head in semiprofile and highcontrast processing had brought out the network of lines and wrinkles the vivid topography of alice matlocks face her expression was proud her eyes clear and lively its very good banks said how long have you been interested in photography ever since i was at school ever thought of taking it up professionally as a police photographer banks laughed i didnt have anything as specific as that in mind he said ive thought of trying it as a freelance yes robin said but its too unpredictable better to stick to teaching there is one more thing while im here banks said handing the photograph back to robin its just something im curious about do you ever get the impression that anyone at the camera club might be not too serious might be more interested in the models you get occasionally than in the artistic side it was robins turn to laugh what an odd question he said but yes theres always one or two seem to turn up only when weve got a model in what did sandra say to tell the truth banks said i didnt like to ask her shes a bit sensitive about it and ive probably teased her too much as it is i see who are these people their names yes well i dont know robin said hesitantly dont worry banks assured him you wont be getting them into trouble they wont even know weve heard their names if theyve done nothing wrong all right robin took a deep breath geoff welling and barry scott are the ones who spring to mind they seem decent enough sorts but they hardly ever turn up and ive never seen any examples of their work thank you banks said writing down the names what do they look like theyre both in their late twenties about my age fiveten to six feet barrys got a bit of a beer belly but geoff seems fit enough whats all this about that peeping tom business robin mrs allott shouted from the bottom of the stairs can you come and take your dad up his tea and biscuits coming robin yelled back and followed banks down the stairs another cup of tea inspector mrs allott asked no i wont if you dont mind banks said have to get home as he walked the short distance back home banks tried to pinpoint exactly what it was that robin had said to increase his uneasy feeling about the alice matlock killing ii apart from the immediate shock which had made her scream sandra felt very calm about her experience one minute she had been undressing for bed as she had done thousands of times before absorbed in her own private rituals and the next moment that world was in tatters would probably never really be the same again she realized that the idea of such permanent ruin was melodramatic so she kept it to herself but she could think of no other way to express the complex sense of violation she had experienced she wasnt scared she wasnt even angry after the shock had worn off and the adrenaline dispersed surprisingly her main feeling was pityharriets compassionbecause sandra did feel sorry for the man in a way she found impossible to explain even to herself it was something to do with the unnaturalness of his act sandra had always been fortunate in having a healthy attitude toward sex she had neither needed nor wanted the help of manuals marital aids awkward positions or suburban wifeswapping clubs to keep her sex life interesting and it was partly because of this her own sexual healthiness that she felt sorry for the pathetic man who could only enjoy sex in such a vicarious secretive way her pity was not a soft and loving feeling though it was more akin to contempt that sunday morning as she rang selena harcourts doorbell which played a fragment of laras theme from doctor zhivago she thanked her lucky stars for the hundredth time that she had managed to persuade alan not to report the incident it had gone against all his instincts and the task had required all of sandras rhetorical expertise but she had done it and here she was about to fulfill her part of the bargain oh hello sandra do come in selena said in her cooing voice excuse the mess there was of course no mess selenas living room was spick and span as always it smelled of pine airfreshener and lemonscented disinfectant and all the souvenir ashtrays and costumedolls from the algarve the costa del sol and various other european resorts simply glowed with health and shone with cleanliness the only new addition to the household was a gloomy poodle called pepe who turned around slowly from his spot by the fireplace and looked at sandra as if to apologize for his ridiculous appearance the clippings and bows that selena had inflicted on him in the hope that he might win a prize in the upcoming dog show sandra duly lavished hypocritical praise upon the poor creature who gave her a very sympathetic and conspiratorial look then she sat uneasily on the sofa she always sat uneasily in selenas house because everything looked as if it were on show not quite real or functional i was just saying to kenneth we havent seen very much of you lately youve not been to one of our coffee mornings for simply ages its the job sandra explained i work three mornings a week for dr maxwell now remember of course selena said the dentist somehow or other she managed to give the word just the right shade of emphasis to imply that although dentists might be necessary they were certainly not desirable in respectable society thats right so what else have you been up to since we last had a little chat sandra couldnt remember when that was so she gave a potted history of the last month to which selena listened politely before offering tea have you heard about this peeping tom business she called through from the kitchen yes sandra shouted back of course i keep forgetting your hubbys on the force you must know all about it then selena said as she brought in the tray bearing tea and a selection of very fattening confectionery on the force indeed sandra thought selena knew damn well that alan was a policemanin fact that was the only reason she had ever talked to sandra in the first placeand her way of digging for gossip was about as subtle as a margaret thatcher pep talk not much sandra lied theres not much to know really that dorothy wycombes been having a right go at alan hasnt she selena noted with so much glee that the lahdedah inflection she usually imposed on her northern accent slipped drastically around having a right go you could say that sandra admitted gritting her teeth is it true is what true that the police arent doing much now you know im no womenslibber sandra but we do get treated just a teeny bit unfairly sometimes it is a mans world you know yes as a matter of fact though theyre doing quite a lot theyve brought in a psychologist from the university oh selena raised her eyebrows whats he supposed to do she helps tell the police what kind of person this peeper is but surely they know that already he likes to watch women undress yes sandra said but theres more to it than that why does he like to watch what does he do while hes watching why doesnt he have a normal sex life thats the kind of thing the psychologists are working on well thats not much use is it selena observed not until theyve caught him anyway thats what i came to see you about sandra said forging ahead theyre worried that he might not stop at lookingthat might be just the beginningso theyre really stepping up the investigation theyve already got enough information to know that he checks out his areas before he strikes so he knows something about the layout of the house he probably finds out when people go to bed whether the woman goes up alone first that kind of thing so i suggested that it would be a good idea if we all kept our eyes open for strangers or anyone acting strangely around here that way we could catch him before he did any real harm good lord selena exclaimed you dont really think hed come around here do you sandra shrugged theres no telling where hell go theyve not found any rhyme or reason to his movements yet selenas hand shook slightly as she poured more tea and she bit her bottom lip between her teeth there was something she started it was last week wednesday i thinkit startled me at the time but i never really gave it much thought later what was it well i was walking back from eloise harrisons she lives on culpepper avenue you know two streets down and its such a long way around if you go right to the main road and along so i cut through the back here theres a little snicket between the houses in the next street you know so i just go out of our back gate into the alley then cut through the snicket cross the street do the same again and im right in eloises back garden coming back on wednesday it was quite dark and wet a nasty night and when i cut into our back alley i almost bumped into this man it was funny i thought because he looked like he was just standing there i dont know why but i think if wed both been moving wed have really bumped into each other well it made me jump i can tell you that theres no light out there except what shines from the houses and its a lonely sort of place anyway i just hurried on through the back gate and into the house and i never really thought much more of it but if you ask me id say he was just standing there loitering do you remember what he looked like im sorry dear i really didnt get a good look as i said it was dark and what with the shock and all i just hurried on i think he was wearing a black raincoat with a belt and he had his collar turned up he was wearing a hat too because of the rain i suppose so i couldnt have seen his face even if id wanted to it was one of those what do you call them trilbies thats it i think he was quite young though not the dirtyoldman type what made you think that i dont know really selena answered slowly as if she was finding it difficult to put her instincts and intuitions into words just the way he moved and the trilby looked too old for him thank you sandra said anxious to get home and make notes while it was all still fresh in her mind do you think it was him i dont know but the police will be thankful for any information about suspicious strangers at the moment selena fingered the plunging neckline of her dress which revealed exactly the right amount of creamy skin to complement her peroxide curls moonshaped face and excessive makeup if it was him then hes been watching us it could be any of us hes after me you josephine annabel this is terrible i shouldnt worry about it that much selena sandra said taking malicious pleasure in comforting the woman for worries that she herself had raised it was probably just someone taking a short cut but it was such a nasty night what normal person would want to stand out there on a night like that he must have been up to something watching ill tell alan and im sure the police will look into it you never know selena your information might lead to an arrest it might well yes if it is him but i wouldnt be able to identify him not in a court of law or one of those lineups they have i didnt really get a good look thats not what i mean dont worry nobodys going to make you do that i just meant that if hes been seen in the area the police will know where to look selena nodded mouth open unconvinced then poured more tea sandra refused suddenly at the door selenas face brightened again i keep forgetting she said putting her hand to her mouth to stifle a giggle its so silly of me ive got nothing to worry about i live right next door to a policeman iii sunday afternoon at gristhorpes farmhouse was a great success though it did little for bankss emotional confusion on the way he was not allowed to play opera in the car and instead had to put up with some dull mechanical pop music on radio onemostly drummachine and synthesizerto keep brian and tracy happy it was a beautiful day the autumn sky was sharp blue again and the seasons hues glowed on the trees by the riverbank in daylight the steep dale sides showed a varied range of color from the greens of common grazing slopes to the pink yellow and purple of heather and gorse and the occasional bright edge of a limestone outcrop gristhorpe greeted them and almost immediately the children went off for a predinner walk while the three adults drank tea in the cluttered living room the conversation was general and easy until gristhorpe asked banks how he was getting on with the lovely jenny fuller sandra raised her dark eyebrows always a bad sign as far as banks was concerned would that be the dr fuller youve been spending so much time with lately alan she asked mildly i knew she was a woman but id no idea she was young and lovely didnt he tell you gristhorpe said mischievously quite a stunner our jenny isnt she alan yes banks admitted shes very pretty oh come on alan you can do better than that sandra teased pretty whats that supposed to mean all right beautiful then banks growled sexy sultry a knockout is that what you want maybe hes smitten with her gristhorpe suggested im not smitten banks countered but realized as he did so that he was probably protesting too forcefully shes being very helpful he went on quickly and he said to sandra just so that i dont get accused of being chauvinistic about this let me put it on record that dr fuller is a very competent and intelligent psychologist brains and beauty sandra mocked how on earth can you resist alan as they both laughed at him banks slumped back into the armchair craving a cigarette soon the talk changed direction and he was off the hook the dinner presented by a proud mrs hawkins was superb roast beef still pink in the middle and yorkshire puddings cooked in the dripping with exactly the right balance of crispness outside and moistness within smothered in rich gravy after a brief postprandial rest brian and tracy were off playing cathy and heathcliffe again on the moorland above gristhorpes few acres of land and sandra took a stroll with her camera do you know gristhorpe mused as they stood in the back garden watching sandra and the children walk up the grassy slope millions of years ago this whole area was under a tropical sea all that limestone you see was formed from dead shellfish he swept out his arm in an allembracing gesture banks shook his head geology was definitely not his forte after that between the ice ages it was as warm as equatorial africa we had lions hyenas elephants and hippopotami walking the dales gristhorpe spoke as if he had been there as if he was somehow implicated in all he said come on he took banks by the arm youll think im turning into a dotty old man ive got something to show you banks looked apprehensively at the embryonic drystone wall and the pile of stones to which gristhorpe led him they amaze me those things he said i cant imagine how they stand up to the wind and rain or how anyone finds the patience to build them gristhorpe laugheda great booming sound from deep inside ill not say its easy wall buildings a dying art alan and youre right about the patience sometimes the bugger runs me to the end of my tether gristhorpes voice was gruff and the accent was clearly north yorkshire but it also had a cultured edge the mark of a man who has read and traveled widely here he said moving aside why dont you have a go me i couldnt banks stammered i mean i wouldnt know where to start i dont know the first thing about it gristhorpe grinned in challenge no matter its just like building a case test your mettle come on have a go banks edged toward the heap of stones none of which looked to him as if it could be fitted into the awesome design he picked some up weighed them in his hand squinted at the wall turned them over squinted again then picked a smooth wedgeshaped piece and fitted it well enough into place gristhorpe looked at the stone expressionlessly then at banks he reached out picked it up turned it around and fixed it back into place there he said perfect a damn good choice banks couldnt help but laugh what was wrong with the way i put it in he asked wrong way around thats all gristhorpe explained this is a simple wall you should have seen the ones my grandfather builtlike bloody cathedrals they were still standing too some of them anyway you start by digging a trench along your line and you put in two parallel rows of footing stones big ones square as you can get them between those rows you put in the hearting lots of small stones like pebbles these bind together under pressure see after that you can start to build narrowing all the time two rows rising up from the footing stones you keep that gap filled tight with hearting and make sure you bind it all together with plenty of throughstones now that stone you put in fit all right but it sloped inward they have to slope outward see else the rainll get in and soak the hearting if that happens when the first frost comes itll expand you see he held his hands close together and moved them slowly apart and that can bring the whole bloody thing tumbling down i see banks nodded ashamed at how such basic common sense could have been beyond him country wisdom he guessed a good drystone wall the superintendent went on can stand any weather it can even stand bloody sheep scrambling over it some of these you see around here have been up since the eighteenth century of course they need a bit of maintenance now and then but who doesnt he laughed you and that lass jenny he asked suddenly owt in it surprised at the question coming out of the blue like that banks blushed a little as he shook his head i like her i like her a lot but no gristhorpe nodded satisfied placed a throughstone and rubbed his hands together gleefully that evening back at home alan and sandra shared a nightcap after they had sent tracy and brian off to bed the opera ban was lifted but it had to be quiet banks played a tape of kiri te kanawa singing famous arias from verdi and puccini they snuggled close on the sofa and as sandra put her empty glass down she turned to banks and asked have you ever been unfaithful without hesitation he replied no it was true but it didnt feel true he was beginning to understand what jimmy carters predicament had been when he said that he had committed adultery in his mind chapter eleven i by midday on monday dc richmond had not only discovered from the eastvale census records and electoral lists that there were almost eight hundred men aged between twenty and thirtyfive living either alone or with a single parent but he also had a list of their names marvelous what computers can do these days sir he said to banks as he handed over the report keen on them are you banks asked looking up and smiling yes sir ive applied for that course next summer i hope youll be able to spare me lord knows whatll be going on next summer banks said i thought i was all set for the quiet life when i came up here and look whats happened so far ill bear it in mind anyway i know the supers keen on new technologyat least as far as the workplace is concerned thank you sir was there anything else sit down a minute banks said as he started reading quickly through the list the only names he recognized at first glance were those he had heard from robin allott the previous day geoff welling and barry scott right he said shoving the papers toward richmond theres a bit more legwork to be done first of all i want you to check into the two names ive ticked here but for gods sake do it discreetly i dont want anyone to know were checking up on private citizens on so little evidence he grinned at richmond use your imagination eh first thing to find out is if they have alibis for the peeping incidents clear so far yes sir the next job might take a bit more doing banks explained about mr patels observations hoping that he might also relieve any anxieties richmond had about his being in the oak with jenny on saturday evening someone else might have seen him in the area so talk to the residents and local shopkeepers also see if you can find out who the bus drivers were on the routes past the oak that night talk to them find out if they noticed our man all right yes sir richmond said a bit more hesitantly what is it lad im not complaining sir but its going to take a long time without help get sergeant hatchley to help you if hes not too busy when richmond hardly appeared to jump with joy banks suppressed a smile and ask sergeant rowe if he can spare you a couple of uniformed boys yes sir richmond said more cheerfully right off you go banks had no great hopes for the inquiry but it had to be carried out it was the same with every case thousands of manhours seemed to amount to nothing until that one fragment of information turned up in the most unexpected place and led them to the solution he remembered his mental note to visit alice matlocks cottage again and see if he could nose out what it was that had bothered him since his talk with robin as it was a pleasant if chilly day he put on his light overcoat and set off turning left into the market square then left again he walked through the network of old cobbled streets to king street then wound his way down through leaview estate to gallows view alice matlocks house was exactly as the police had left it almost a week ago and banks wondered who was going to inherit the mess ethel carstairs if there was anything of value would it have been worth killing for no will had been discovered so far but that didnt mean alice hadnt made one she had no next of kin so the odds were that at some point she had considered what to do about bequeathing her worldly goods it was worth looking into as he stood in the small cluttered living room banks tried to work out exactly what it was that bothered him again he made the rounds of the alcoves with their handpainted figurines of nurseryrhyme and fairytale figures like miss muffet and little jack homer their old giltframed sepia photographs and teaspoons from almost every coastal resort in britain he picked up a glassencased dales scene and watched the snow fall on the shepherd and his sheep as he shook it moving on he found an exquisitely engraved silver snuffbox dented on one edge opening it up he noticed the initials a g m on the inside of the lid alice surely not still robin allott had said she was a radical a fighter for womens rights and banks had seen photographs of pioneer feminists smoking cigars or pipes so why not take snuff too on the other hand he was certain she had no middle name but there had been a boyfriend who had died in the great war perhaps the snuffbox had been his the dent might even have been caused by the bullet that killed him banks found himself thinking there was something about alice s house that made him feel fanciful as if he were in a tiny personal museum next he peered closely at the ship in the bottle banks could easily imagine a young boy populating the ship with sailors and inventing adventures for them its name miranda was clear on its side and all the details of deck mast ropes and sails were reproduced in miniature there was even a tiny figurehead of a naked woman with streaming hairmiranda herself perhaps as he moved back to the center of the room and looked around again at alice s carefully preserved possessions he realized exactly what it was that had been nagging away at the back of his mind when robin had mentioned the ship banks had visualized it clearly just as he had been able to remember many of the other articles in the room true the place had been a messcupboards and sideboards had been emptied and their contents scattered over the floorbut there had been no gratuitous damage one of the features of the ottershaw burglary that led banks to believe it was the work of the same youths who had been robbing the old women was the wanton destruction of property the urine and feces that had defaced ottershaws paintings music center television and vcr it was slim evidence to base a decision on banks realized but it confirmed the hunch he already had about the matlock killing if the same youths had been responsible they would according to form have smashed the ship in the bottle the snowstorm and any other fragile object on display but no this thief had only made a straightforward utilitarian search for cash and such things as could be easily translated into money the gratuitous element was entirely missing pulling his collar up against the breeze banks set off deep in thought back to the station ii im worried gray andrea said as they dipped into a dessert of cherry pie and ice cream after a main course of lasagne and salad it was monday eveningandreas husband was off in bristol for the week and it was trevors youthclub nightso graham and andrea could actually have dinner together like a normal couple the romantic peace of their candlelit dinner was spoiled however by her obvious distress what is it graham asked spooning up another mouthful of pie dont tell me ronnies getting suspicious no its not that andrea reassured him quickly but it could lead to that she looked beautiful across the table her breasts pushed at the tight black blouse which revealed tiny ovals of olive skin between the buttons and her glossy hair equally black swept down across her shoulders and shimmered every time she tossed her head her red lipstick emphasized her full lips and her dark eyes reflected the candle flames like brightly polished oak graham was excited and andreas preoccupied mood irritated him whats happened then he asked sighing and putting his spoon down andrea leaned forward on the table cupping her chin with her hands its that man next door wooller yes him what about him i know hes a bit of a creep but remember last week i told you i thought hed been looking at me funny yes well he actually spoke to me this morning i was just going to the shops and he caught up with me at the end of the street and walked along beside me bloody cheek go on graham prompted her curious did he try to pick you up no it wasnt like that well not really like that she shivered he makes my skin crawl those thin dry lips of his and that weird smile hes always got on his face as if he knows something you dont he knows about us gray im sure of it did he say so not in so many words he wasnt direct about it first he just went on about how lonely it must be with my husband away so much then he said it was so nice that id found a friend that nice mr sharp from the shop he said hed seen you coming and going out of the back window and he thought it was so good of you to keep me company especially when you had a son to look after too it was the way he said it though gray his voice his tone it was dirty is that all he said graham asked what do you mean about seeing me visit you yes i told you it wasnt what he said but the way he said it as if he knew much more go on graham started chewing on his bottom lip as andrea continued her story he said that not everyone was as sympathetic as him and maybe my husband wouldnt be so understandinghe might worry about people talking for example even though there was nothing really going on but he was leering at me all the time as if he was nudging me and saying we both know theres something going on dont we i just ignored him and tried to walk faster but he kept up with me and even turned the corner when i did he went on about what a pity it would be if my husband did find out and wasnt understandingthen id be all lonely again and id never have any nice friends again however innocent their intentions were i asked him to get to the point to tell me what he was getting at and he pretended to take offense what does he want graham asked impatiently money i dont think so no i think he wants to go to bed with me he what he wants me himself i couldnt bear it gray id be sick i know i would she was almost in tears now dont worry graham comforted her it wont come to that you can be certain what did he say he just said that there was no reason why i shouldnt have another friend like him for example and what a good friend he could be and all that he never really said anything you know explicit nothing you could put your finger on but we both knew what he was talking about he said how pretty he thought i was what nice legs i had and i could feel his eyes crawling all over my body while he spoke then he said we should all have tea together soon and hed be happy just to sit there and watch usoh hes disgusting gray what am i going to do youre not to worry graham said moving his chair next to hers and stroking her hair ill take care of him will you she turned her face so that it was close to his he could smell the cherries on her breath what will you do never you mind about that love ive told you ill deal with him dont i always keep my word andrea nodded then youve nothing to worry about have you you wont hear anything from him again he wont even so much as glance in your direction if he sees you in the street i promise you that you wont hurt him will you gray i dont want you to get into trouble you know what that might lead to at least then graham said wearily wed be out in the open we could go away together yes andrea agreed but it wouldnt be a good start would it i want things to be better than that for us i suppose so graham said sitting back but youll really deal with him will you and not make any trouble graham nodded and smiled at her andrea caught his look and stood up to clear the table not yet you goat she said wait till ive cleared the dishes they can wait graham said reaching out for her i cant she moved away playfully and his hand caught the collar of her blouse as she stepped back the material ripped down the front and the buttons flew off pinging against wine glasses and plates the blouse hung open revealing andreas semitransparent black brassiere the one that stood out in clear relief against her pale skin and exposed a great deal of inviting cleavage graham froze for a second he didnt know what her reaction would be perhaps it was an expensive blouseit felt soft like silkand she would be angry with him he was all set to apologize and offer to buy her another when she laughed and reached forward to pull at his shirt come on then she said smiling at him if you really cant wait and they rolled to the floor laughing and tearing at each others clothes afterwards sweaty and out of breath they lay back and laughed again then went up to the bedroom to continue making love in a more leisurely way for another two hours finally it was time to go trevor was due back in about half an hour and graham had promised to drop in on wooller on his way home remember andrea said kissing him as he left no trouble ask him nicely tell him theres nothing in it iii graham sharp knocked softly at the door of number six gallows view and a few seconds later wooller peered around the chain squinting through his thick glasses mr sharp he exclaimed what a pleasant surprise come in come in the messy room smelled of old socks and boiled cabbage wooller obviously thinking that sharp had come to make some arrangement about andrea rigby scooped some newspapers from a straightbacked chair and bade him sit down tea or perhaps something a little stronger no thanks graham said stiffly and i wont sit down either ill not be stopping long oh said wooller standing in the kitchen doorway sure i cant persuade you no sharp said walking toward him you cant bloody persuade me but i think i can persuade you wooller looked puzzled until graham grabbed him by the front of his pullover bunching the wool in his fist and halflifting the frail librarian from the floor sharp was much taller and in far better physical shape he began to shake wooller gently at first then more violently against the kitchen doorjamb each time woollers back hit the wood graham spat out a word dont you ever threaten andrea rigby again you smelly little prick do you under stand it was hard to tell if wooller was nodding or not but he looked scared enough stop it wooller whined putting his hand to the back of his head youve split my skull look blood he thrust his open palm under grahams eyes and there was clearly blood on it sharp felt a sudden lurch of fear in his stomach he let go of wooller and leaned against the doorway pale and trembling wooller stared at him with his mouth open quickly graham made the effort to pull himself together he grabbed a glass from the drainingboard and without even bothering to see if it was clean or not filled it with cold water from the tap and gulped it down feeling a little better he ran his hand through his hair and faced a confused woolier grasping the front of his pullover again im not going to tell you again he said injecting as much quiet menace into his tone as he could manage do you understand me wooiler swallowed and nodded let me go let me go if you say one more word to mrs rigby graham went on even if you so much as look at her in a way she doesnt like ill be back to finish what i started and dont think of talking to her husband either true you might cause a bit of trouble if you do but not half as much trouble as youll be causing for yourself get it again woollers adams apple bobbed as he nodded let me go please graham relaxed his grip a bit more but didnt quite let go of woollers bunchedup pullover i want to hear you say you understand me first he said i want you to tell me you wont talk to anyone about thisnot her husband not the police not anyone because if you do woolier i swear it ill break every fucking bone in your stinking little body woolier was shaking all right he whimpered trying to wriggle free all right ill say nothing ill leave her alone i only wanted to be her friend thats all i wanted graham raised his fist angered again by woollers pathetic lie but he made the effort and restrained himself he had almost gone too far and he was certain now that andrea and he would have no more trouble from wooller iv as soon as the back door cracked open trevor felt the thrill it set his blood dancing and made the sweat prickle on his forehead and cheeks the rough wool of the balaclava scratched at his face and made it itch like mad the two of them entered the house cautiously but all was as they had expecteddark and quiet the narrow beams of their flashlights picked out dishes piled up for washing a table littered with shadowy objects a newspaper open at a halffinished crossword puzzle again they were in a kitchen but it seemed much less clean and tidy than the one theyd been in a few days ago the living room too turned out to be in a bit of a mess sundays paper lay scattered on the carpet and trevors beam picked out a halffull coffee mug on the mantelpiece theyd been tipped by lenny that the woman who lived there kept a lot of expensive jewelry which he could easily fence in london so they ignored the living room and keeping their flashlight beams pointed toward the floor headed up the stairs the first room they entered was empty except for a single beda guestroom most likelyand two others were similarly ascetic it felt eerie as if the woman had once had family and now they were gone and the house was empty and bare you could tell from the downstairs that she couldnt be bothered much anymore yet she was supposed to be well off finally after more false starts in the bathroom and airingcupboard they found what seemed to be her bedroom at first they couldnt make it out but by running the flashlights over a wider area they discovered that a large fourposter bed stood at the center of the room mick sat on the edge of the mattress and bounced up and down for a while before pronouncing it too lumpy then they began their search again there was an assortment of clothes this time all female and trevor noticed that this womans underwear was far more exotic than the others there were brassieres cut so low that they were practically nonexistent skimpy seethrough panties a garter belt with roses embroidered on it stockings with dark borders around the tops and short lacy nightdresses the lingerie was all clean and it smelled of something faintly exotic jasmine trevor thought it was his mother had bought some jasmine tea once many years ago and the smell took him back and made him think of her he remembered that none of them had liked the tea and his mother had laughed at their lack of adventurous spirit they found the jewelry in a lacquered box with a chinese landscape painted on it the box was locked but it broke open easily and they pocketed its contents they poked around the room a bit longer looking for cash but found none that made trevor angry because with cash he didnt have to rely on lennys spurious deals they set off back downstairs and just as they were about to turn the final bend into the front hallway the door opened and closed the hall light came on and a woman began to take off her sleek fur coat cautiously mick led the way down the last stair creaked and the woman turned but mick got his hand over her mouth before she could scream they dragged her into the living room and switched on the standardlamp the curtains were already closed mick took the womans headscarf and fastened it tight like a bit between her teeth then he took the belt from her raincoat and tied her hands crudely behind her back we need time to get away he said to trevor weve got to make sure she keeps quiet for long enough bring me that candlestick over there trevor looked and saw an old brass candlestick with a heavy base the woman whimpered behind her gag and struggled to free herself no he said come on mick urged him weve got to we cant risk getting caught now slowly trevor walked over to the mantelpiece picked up the candlestick felt its weight then dropped it on the floor no he said again youd probably kill her you dont know how little strength it takes so what mick argued stretching out his hand scornfully give it here ive got a better idea trevor said what trevor looked at the woman sprawled awkwardly on the sofa she was about thirtyeight forty maybe but very well preserved her hair was blond but the dark roots showed and perhaps she was wearing just a little too much mascara but apart from that she looked very tasty indeed to trevor her breasts jutted behind the polonecked sweater and her skirt had already slipped up high enough to show a spread of thigh he got an eerie feeling that his moment had come at last you must be mad mick gasped realizing what trevor meant we cant hang around here why not we know she lives alone shes here so who else is going to come mick thought for a moment licking his lips all right then he agreed and began to move forward trevor stood in front of him and nudged him gently out of the way me first there was something determined in his tone so mick just shrugged and moved back trevor maneuverd the woman awkwardly onto the floor she didnt struggle but she seemed to have gone limp and heavy he pulled the sweater up around her breasts but couldnt get it off while here hands were tied there were some scissors by the stack of magazines on the coffee table so he picked them up and carefully cut the material underneath her bra was pink and the hard nipples poked at its cups trevor grabbed the elastic in the middle and tried to tear it off but it proved stronger than it looked again he used the scissors the whole thing was beginning to seem a lot harder than hed imagined for fucks sake hurry up mick urged him get on with it trevor squeezed the womans breasts they were soft and slack and he didnt like the feel of them slowly he cut off the rest of her clothes again she didnt struggle she just lay there like a sack of potatoes finally he pushed her legs apart unbuckled his belt and unzipped his trousers it was his first time but it felt right he knew what to do he tried to avoid looking her in the face because of the scarf between her teeth she seemed to be grinning maliciously and when he caught her eyes he thought he saw mockery in them not just fear hed soon teach her when he started he thought he heard her grunt with pain behind her gag as she whipped her head from side to side and he could see her eyes were blurred with tears now the pressure was strong in trevor and he could manage no more than three or four rough thrusts before it was all over exhausted even by such a meager effort he got to his knees and pulled up his pants the woman just lay there she wasnt crying now her eyes were far away and the taut scarf still made her appear to grin your turn he said turning to mick not on your bleeding nelly if you think im taking your sloppy seconds youve got another bloody think coming mate lets piss off out of here before they left mick gave the woman a hard kick to the side of her head and told her thered be more of that if she didnt keep her mouth shut trevor noticed a thin trickle of blood shining in her hair before he turned and followed mick out through the kitchen chapter twelve i after a dull elementary talk by fred barton on the properties of the medium telephoto lens the tuesday evening camera club was devoted to mutual criticism of work produced at the session two weeks earlier when a nude model had been the subject as expected some ribald remarks came from less mature male amateurs but on the whole the brief informal session was productive sandra looked over norman s work and had to admit if only to herself that she liked it it was far more experimental than anyone elses she imagined and she felt some sympathy because she too liked to take risks though she rarely went as far as norman he had used a fast film and blown up the prints to give them a very coarse grain consequently the photographs did not look like shots of a naked woman they looked more like moonscapes the usual crowd gathered at the mile post later the pub was busier than usual rock n roll on the jukebox and bleeping video games made conversation difficult there was also a group of local fanners celebrating something with a great deal of laughter and the occasional song and some of the lads from the racing stables in middleham were out enjoying a night on the town have you seen that new minolta norman asked getting comfortable in his chair and arranging pipe and matches neatly in front of him on the varnished table thats not a camera robin said its a computer all you have to do is program it and it does everything for you including focus what do you think youre doing when you set your shutter speed and your aperture norman asked youre programming your camera then arent you thats different as far as im concerned sandra chipped in anything that makes the technical side easier and allows me to concentrate more on the photograph is fine by me norman smiled indulgently well put sandra although i would add that the technical side as you term it is an integral part of the photograph i know the selections are important sandra agreed and id always want a manual overridebut the easier the better as far as im concerned ive never found it particularly difficult to set the camera robin said or to focus i dont really see what all the fuss is about typical reactionary attitude norman sneered you cant ignore the new technology lad you might as well make good use of it ive really nothing against it robin argued quietly i just dont think i need one thats all no more than i need an electric toothbrush oh youd be happy with a bloody pinhole camera you would norman sighed my excuse is that i cant afford one sandra said i dont think any of us can harriet echoed its a very expensive hobby photography true enough norman agreed id have to sell all the camera equipment ive already got it might be worth it though ill look into it a bit more closely another round when norman came back with the drinks the conversation had shifted subtly to the evenings session sandra complimented him on his photos and he grudgingly admitted that hers though they were in color and had obviously been cropped were fine compositions he told her that she had done particularly interesting and unusual things with skin tone where are yours norman asked robin i dont think any of us had a look at them theyre not back yet i took slides and i didnt finish the film i only sent it off a couple of days ago slides exclaimed norman what an odd thing to do i used an ektachrome robin argued its very good for that kind of thing but all the same norman repeated slides in a studio nude session ill bet you never even had film in your camera eh robin ill bet thats why youve got nothing to show us robin ignored him and looked over to sandra i talked to your husband he said but i cant see how i was any help sandra shrugged you never know hes got to gather all the information he can i should imagine its like counting the grains of sand on a beach i think id find that too frustrating sandra laughed oh im sure alan does too especially when theres so many cases going at once and they keep him out till all hours still thats not all there is to it a policemans lot quoted norman is not a happy one i wouldnt agree with that sandra said smiling alans usually perfectly happy unless hes dealing with particularly unpleasant crimes like the killing of a defenseless old woman and a peeping tom norman added lets not forget our peeping tom no lets not sandra said anyway robin you might have been helpful alan says its often hard to know exactly where the solution comes from everything gets mixed in together when are we going to see these slides then norman asked robin impatiently they should be back soon ill bet you dont even have a slide projector so what i could always borrow one not from me you couldnt i havent got one either i havent even been able to show anyone last years holiday pictures yet surely robin must have one if hes been taking slides harriet said no i dont robin mumbled apologetically im afraid ive never done transparencies before i do have a small viewer of course but thats not much use well i do have a projector and a screen sandra told them and if any of you want to borrow it youre quite welcome just drop around sometime you know where i live is that an invitation sandra norman leered oh shut up she said and pushed him playfully away dont you think theres something unnatural about taking pictures of nudes at the camera club harriet asked suddenly i mean were all talking about it as if its the most normal thing in the world why demanded norman its the only chance some of us get what sandra joked a gay young blade like yourself norman surely theyre just flocking to your studio dying to take their clothes off for you less of the gay if you please love and i dont have a studio what about you robin what about me do you agree with harriet that its unnatural to photograph nudes in a studio i wouldnt say its unnatural no i dont think my mother would approve though he added in an attempt at humor i sometimes have a devil of a job keeping things to myself at about ten oclock there was a general movement homewards but sandra managed to catch harriets eye and signal discreetly for her to stay after the others had gone harriet moved her chair closer another drink she asked please sandra said she needed it she also needed somebody to talk to and the only person she could think of was harriet even then it would take another drink to make her open up the empty seats at the table were soon taken by a noisy but polite group of stablelads when she had adjusted to the new volume level harriet who drove a mobile library around some of the more remote dales villages began to talk about work yesterday i got a puncture near the butter tubs pass above wensleydale she said a car full of tourists came speeding around the corner and i had to pull over quick some of those stones by the side of the road are very sharp i can tell you i was stuck there for ages till a kind young vet stopped to help me when i got to angram old mrs wytherbottom played heck about having to wait so long for her new agatha christie she paused sandra whats wrong you havent listened to a word ive said what oh sorry sandra gulped down the last of her vodka and slimline and took the plunge it happened to me harriet she said quietly what we were talking about last week it happened to me on friday good lord harriet whispered putting her hand on sandras wrist what how just like everyone else i was getting ready for bed and he was watching through the bottom of the curtains did you see him i saw him before id got too far fortunately but he was off like a shot i didnt get a good look at him the thing is harriet this has got to be in strict confidence alan didnt report it because of the embarrassment it would cause us both he feels bad enough about that but if he thought anyone else knew i understand dont worry sandra i wont tell a soul not even david thank you how do you feel now fine it seems very distant already it was a shock at first and i certainly felt violated but i wanted to tell you that i also felt some sort of pity for the man its odd but when i could first think about it rationally it just seemed so childish thats the word that came to mind childish he needs help not punishment maybe both i dont know it depends which gets the better of me anger or pity every time i think about it they seem to be fighting in me it was silly of me to say what i did last week harriet apologized about feeling sorry for him id no idea i mean ive still no idea what it actually feels like but theyre closer than you think arent they anger and pity yes anyway its not as bad as youd imagine sandra said smiling you soon get over it i doubt that it leaves any lasting scars on anyone unlike most sex crimes even as she spoke the words they sounded too glib to be true i dont know has alan got any leads yet not much no a vague description one of our neighbors saw a man hanging around the back alley a few days ago he was dressed pretty much the same as the man i saw but neither of us could give a clear description anyway keep an eye on your neighbourhood harriet it seems that he does a bit of research before he comes in to get his jollies yes i read about that in the paper superintendent gristhorpe gave a press release anyway sandra said theres a lot of women in eastvale so i would think the odds against you are pretty high harriet smiled but why you what do you mean the odds against you must have been high too alan thinks its because of who i am he says the mans getting bolder more cocky throwing down the gauntlet a peeping tom with a sense of humor why not plenty of psychos have one you dont think hes looking for someone do you looking for someone who what do you mean someone in particular you know like jack the ripper always said that womans name mary kelly thats just a rumor though why would he be looking for someone in particular i dont know it was just a thought somebody who reminds him of his first time his first love or someone like that youre quite the amateur psychologist arent you sandra said looking at harriet through narrowed eyes its just something i thought of thats all harriet shrugged theyve brought a professional psychologist in sandra said woman called fuller dr jenny fuller according to gristhorpe shes quite a looker and alans been working late several evenings oh sandra harriet exclaimed you surely cant think alan relax sandra said laughing and touching harriets arm no i dont think anything like that i do think he fancies her though how do you know a woman can tell surely you could tell if david had his eyes on another woman well i suppose so he is rather transparent exactly i wouldnt use that word to describe alan but its in what he doesnt say and how he reacts when the subjects brought up hes been very cagey he didnt even tell me it was an attractive woman he was working with does it worry you no i trust him and if he does yield to temptation he wouldnt be the first but what would you do nothing would he tell you yes eventually men like alan usually do you know they think its because theyre being honest with you but its really because the guilt is too much of a burden they cant bear it alone id probably rather not know but he wouldnt consider that oh sandra harriet snorted youre being a proper cynic dont you think youre being a bit hard on him sandra laughed i wouldnt be able to say it if i didnt love him warts and all and dont get upset i dont think anything will come of it if shes as beautiful as gristhorpe says alan would hardly be normal if he didnt feel some attraction hes a big boy he can deal with it you havent met her then no hes not offered to introduce me maybe harriet suggested leaning forward and lowering her voice you should get him to invite her for dinner or just suggest a drink together see what he says sandra beamed what a good idea im sure itd be a lot of fun yes i think ill get working on it itll be interesting to see how he reacts ii police constable craig was one of the uniformed officers temporarily in plain clothes on the peeper case it was his job to walk between as many pubs as possible within his designated area and to keep an eye open for any loiterers the job was tiring and frustrating as he was not allowed to enter any of the pubs he simply had to walk the streets and pass each place more than once to see if anyone was hanging around for too long as he approached the oak near the end of his beat for the second time that evening he noticed the same man standing in the shadows of the bus shelter from the few details that craig could make out the man was slim of medium height and wearing a dark belted raincoat and a flat cap it wasnt a trilby but there was no law against a mans owning more than one hat craig also knew that at least two buses must have stopped there since he had last walked by the oak following instructions he went inside the noisy pub and sought out dc richmond who was by now sick to death of spending every eveningduty or noin that loud garish ginpalace richmond hearing craigs story suggested that they call the station first then check once more in about fifteen minutes if the man was still there they would approach him for questioning gratefully craig accepted a half of guinness and the chance to sit down and take the weight off his feet meanwhile mr patel who had become quite the sleuth since bankss visit glanced frequently out of his shop window and wrote down in a notebook bought especially for the purpose that a man resembling the suspect he had already described to the police had been standing in the shelter for fortyeight minutes he timed his entry tuesday pm then picked up the phone and asked for detective chief inspector banks banks was not at first happy to take the message he was enjoying a pleasant evening with the childrenno opera no televisionhelping brian construct a complicated extension of track for his electric train tracy was stretched out on her stomach too deciding where to place bridges signal boxes and papiermâché mountains everyone pulled a face when the phone rang but banks became excited when sergeant rowe passed on mr pates information back at the oak the fifteen minutes was up richmond had reported in as arranged and now it was time to approach the suspect and ask a few questions as he and craig headed for the pubs heavy smokedglass and oak doors banks was just arriving at mr patels shop walking in as casually as any customer is that him he asked i cant say for certain mr patel answered scratching his head but ee looks the same ee werent wearing an at last time though how long did you say hes been there mr patel looked first at his watch then down at his notebook sixtythree minutes he answered after a brief calculation and how many buses have gone by three one to ripon and two to york the bus shelter stood at the apex of a triangle the base of which was formed by a line between mr patels shop and the oak itself banks was already at the door keeping his eyes on the suspect across the road to his right when craig and richmond walking much too purposefully toward their man were spotted and the dark figure took off down the street but what could have been a complete disaster was suddenly transformed into a triumphant success as the man sprinted by mr patels shop with a good lead on his pursuers banks rushed out and performed the best rugby tackle he could remember making since hed played scrumhalf in a school game over twenty years ago the quartet returned to eastvale station at tenthirty and the suspect protesting loudly was led into the interview room a stark place with three stiffbacked chairs pale green walls and a metal desk richmond and craig thought they were in for a tellingoff but banks surprised them by thanking them for their help they both knew that if the man had got away things would have been very different the suspect was ronald markham age twentyeight a plumber in eastvale and apart from the headgear his clothing matched all earlier descriptions of the peepers at first he was outraged at being attacked in such a violent manner then he became sullen and sarcastic what were you doing in the shelter banks asked with richmond standing behind him instead of hatchley whom nobody had thought to disturb waiting for a bus markham snapped did you get that constable richmond yes sir suspect replied that he was waiting for a bus richmond quoted which bus banks asked any bus where were you going anywhere banks walked over to richmond and whispered in his ear then he turned to markham said wont be a minute sir and the two of them disappeared leaving a uniformed constable to guard the room about fortyfive minutes later when they returned after a hastily grabbed pint and sandwich at the queens arms markham was livid again you cant treat me like this he protested i know my rights what were you doing in the shelter banks asked him calmly markham didnt answer he ran his thick fingers through his hair turned his eyes up to the ceiling then glared at banks who repeated his question what were you doing in the shelter keeping an eye on my wife markham finally blurted out why do you think you need to do that isnt it bloody obvious markham replied scornfully because i think shes having it off with someone else thats why she thinks im out of town on a job but i followed her to the oak did she enter alone or with a man alone but she was meeting him there i know she was i was waiting for them to come out what were you going to do then do markham ran his hand through his thin sandy hair again i dont know hadnt thought of it were you going to confront them i told you i dont know or were you just going to keep watching them spying on them maybe why would you do that to make sure like that they were having it off so youre not sure i told you im not sure no thats what i was doing trying to make sure what would it take to convince you banks asked what do you mean what kind of evidence were you hoping to get i dont know i wanted to see where they went what they did did you hope to watch them having sex is that what you wanted to see markham snorted its hardly what i wanted to see but i expected it yes how were you going to watch them what do you mean the logistics how were you going to spy on them use binoculars climb a drainpipe what were you going to take photographs too i said before i hadnt thought that far ahead i was just going to follow them and see where they went after that he shrugged anyway just what the hell are you getting at after that you were going to watch them and see what they did right perhaps wouldnt you want to know if it was your wife have you done this kind of thing before what kind of thing followed people and spied on them why would i im asking you no i havent and i dont see the point of all these questions by now theyre probably at it in some pokey bungalow bungalow you know where he lives then no i dont even know who he is but you said bungalow you know he lives in abungalow no why did you say it then for gods sake whats it matter markham cried burying his long face in his hands its over now anyway whats over my marriage the cow have you ever watched anybody getting undressed in a bungalow banks persisted though he was quickly becoming certain that it was all in vain now that they had the wrong man no markham answered of course i havent then he laughed bloody hell you think im that peeping tom dont you you think im the bloody peeper why did you run away when you saw my men approaching you i didnt know they were police did i they werent wearing uniforms but why run they might simply have been walking to the bus stop mightnt they it was just a feeling the way they were walking they looked like heavies to me and i wasnt hanging around to get mugged you thought they were going to mug you was that the reason partly it did cross my mind that they might be pals of the bloke my wife was meetingthat id been seen like and they wanted to warn me off i dont know all i can say is they didnt look like they were coming to wait for a bus it was almost midnight markham said that he was expected home late at about one oclock he had arranged it that way so that he could give his wife enough time enough rope to hang herself with banks suggested that to clear things up once and for all they should return to markham s house and wait for her the house on coleman avenue about a mile northwest of the market square was so spacious and well furnished that banks found himself wondering if it was true true that plumbers earned a fortune the predominant colors were dark browns and greens which banks thought made the place seem a little too somber for his taste at a quarter to one the key turned in the door markham s wife had told him that she was visiting a friend and that if he did get home before her he shouldnt be surprised if she was a bit late curious about the light in the living room she peered around the door and walked in slowly when she saw her husband with a stranger mrs markham was a rather plain brunette in her late twenties and banks found it hard to imagine her as the type to have an affair still it took all sorts he reminded himself and it never did to pigeonhole people before you knew them after identifying himself banks asked mrs markham where she had spent the evening she sat down stiffly and started strangling one of her black leather gloves with a friend she answered cautiously whats all this about name sheila croft is she on the phone yes would you call her please now why this is very important mrs markham banks explained patiently your husband might be in serious trouble and i have to verify your story mrs markham bit her thin lower lip and glanced over at her husband there was fear in her eyes the number banks repeated its late shell be in bed now besides we werent at her house mrs markham dithered where were you we went to a pub the oak you werent with no sheila croft either you bloody lying cow markham cut in i saw you go in there by yourself all tarted up and look at yourself now couldnt even be bothered to put a bit of makeup on again after mrs markham paled call sheila then she shouted just you ask her she was already there i was late sheila would lie her pants off to protect you and you bloody well know it who is he you bitch he got to his feet as if to strike her and banks stepped forward to push him back down its all right markham said bitterly i wouldnt hit her she knows that who is he you slut at this point mrs markham started weeping and complaining about being neglected banks depressed by the entire scene and angry that it had not been the peeper they had caught made his exit quietly iii a chill wind blew through gluesniffers ginnel where mick and trevor stood jackets buttoned up tight smoking and chatting did you like it then last night mick asked not much trevor answered i suppose it was all right but what too tight yeah hurt a bit dry as a bone at first just wait till you get one thats willing slides in easy then it does plenty of em like it the hard way though you know they like you to show em whos boss trevor shrugged wheres the loot got it hidden at my place its safe looks like weve struck the jackpot there too mate never seen any that sparkled so much that depends on lenny doesnt it i told you hes got the contacts hell get us the best he can probably a few g there sure and how much of that will we see oh dont go on about it trev mick grumbled shifting from one foot to the other as if he had ants in his pants well get whats coming and you did get a little bonus didnt you he leered whats lenny doing still in the smoke setting up a business deal bit tightlipped about it right now whens he coming back dont know few days a week when are we going to get rid of the stuff what the bloody hells wrong with you tonight trev nothing but fucking moan moan moan you havent spent all your readies yet have you no i just dont like the idea of that jewelry lying about thats all dont worry i told you its safe hell be back soon heard from him have you got a letter from him this morning careful our lenny is thinks the blower might be tapped he said he thought itd be a good idea if we laid off on the jobs for a while just till things cool down like ive not noticed any heat bound to be going on though aint it behind the scenes stands to reason theres been a lot of bother lately and the rozzers must be getting their bleeding arses flayed mark my words mate theyll be working their balls off best lay off for a few weeks weve got plenty to be going on with it wasnt the money that interested trevor so much it was the thrill of breaking in the way it made his heart beat faster and louder in the darkness penlights picking out odd details of paintings on walls or bottlelabels and family snapshots on tables but he couldnt explain that to mick well what do you think mick asked i suppose hes right trevor answered his mind wandering to the possibility of doing jobs alone that would be much more exciting the privacy too he could savour somehow mick just seemed too coarse and vulgar to appreciate the true joy and beauty of what they were doing so we lie low then all right till we hear from lenny yes a train rumbled over on the tracks above the ginnel mick looked at his watch and grinned late what is tenten from arrogate twenty minutes late typical bloody british rail chapter thirteen i banks spent most of the week in his office brooding on the three cases and smoking too much but the figures refused to become clear the shadowy man in the dark belted raincoat seemed to float around in his mind with the two faceless youths watching them watching the sailors on the deck of alice matlocks ship in a bottle the miranda and somewhere among the crowd were all the people he had talked to in connection with the cases ethel carstairs the sharps boxer buxton the headmaster mr price the formmaster dorothy wycombe robin allott mr patel alice matlock herself dead on the cold stone flags and jenny fuller jenny fuller twice during the week he picked up the phone to call her and twice he put it down without dialling he had no excuse to see hernothing new had happenedand he felt he had already misled her enough when on wednesday evening sandra suggested that they invite jenny to dinner a silly argument followed in which banks protested that he hardly knew the woman and that their relationship was purely professional his nose grew an inch or two and sandra backed down gracefully richmond and hatchley were in and out of his office with information none of it very encouraging geoff welling and barry scott appeared to be normal enough lads and they had gone off on holiday to italy the day before the carol ellis incident so that let them out sandra continued talking to the neighbors but none of them had anything to add to selena harcourts information the search continued for passersby shopkeepers and bus drivers who might have been near the oak the night mr patel saw the loiterer yes one of the bus drivers remembered seeing him but no he couldnt offer a description the man had been standing in the shadows and the driver had been paying attention to the road all the shopkeepers had closed for the night and none of them lived like mr patel above their premises so far no pedestrians had come forward despite the appeal in the yorkshirepost richmond had conducted a thorough search of alice matlocks cottage but no will turned up alice had nothing to her name but a post office savings account the balance of which stood at exactly one hundred and five pounds fiftysix pence on the day of her death she seemed to be one of that rare breed who do not live beyond their means all her life she had made do with what she earned whether it was her nurses salary or her pension ethel carstairs said she had never heard alice talk of a will and the whole motive of murder for gain crumbled before it was fully constructed on friday morning banks walked into the station absorbed in monteverdis orfeo orpheus was pleading with charon to allow him to enter the underworld and see eurydice non vivio no chepoi de vita e priva mia cara sposa u cor non e piu meco esenza cor comesserpud chio viva sang the man who could tame wild beasts with music i am no longer alive for since my dear wife is deprived of life my heart remains no longer with me and without a heart how can it be that i am living he didnt notice the woman waiting by the front desk to see him until the desksergeant coughed and tapped him on the arm as he drifted by entranced the embarrassed sergeant introduced them then went back to his duties as banks awkwardly removing his headphones led the woman thelma pitt upstairs to his office she seemed very tense as she accepted the chair banks drew out for her though her hair was blond the dark roots were clearly visible and they combined with the haggard cast of her stillattractive heartshaped face and a skirt too short for someone of her age to give the impression of a once gay and beautiful woman going downhill fast beside her right eye was a purplishyellow bruise banks took out a new file and wrote down first her personal details he vaguely recognized her name then remembered that she and her husband a local farm laborer had won over a quarter of a million pounds on the pools ten years ago banks had read all about them in the sunday papers they had been a young married couple at the time the husband was twentysix thelma twentyfive for a while their new jetsetting way of life had been a cause celebre in eastvale until thelma had walked out on her husband to become something of a local femme fatale why wondered banks were these delicate phrases always in french and always untranslatable thelmas legendary parties which some said were thinly disguised orgies involved a number of prominent eastvalers who were all eventually embarrassed one way or another when the party was over thelma retreated into wellheeled obscurity her husband was later killed in an automobile accident in france it was a sad enough story in itself now the woman sat before banks looking ten years older than she was hands clasped over her handbag on her lap clearly with another tale of hard times to tell i want to report a robbery she said tightly twisting a large ruby ring around the second finger of her right hand who was robbed banks asked i assume it was yes it was me when did it happen monday evening at your home yes what time it was just after ten i got home early where had you been where i usually go on mondays the golf club are you a player no she smiled weakly relaxing a little just a drinker you realize its friday now banks prompted her eager to set her at ease but puzzled about the circumstances you say the robbery took place on monday its a long time to wait before reporting it i know thelma pitt said and im sorry but theres something else banks looked at her his wideopen eyes asking the question i was raped banks put his pen down on the table are you sure you wouldnt like to see a policewoman he asked no it doesnt matter she leaned forward inspector ive lived with this night and day since monday i couldnt come in before because i was ashamed to i felt dirty i believed it was all my faulta punishment for past sins if you like im a catholic though not a very good one i havent left the house since then this morning i woke up angry do you understand i feel angry and i want to do whatever i can to see that the criminals are caught the robbery doesnt matter the jewels were worth a great deal but not as much not as much she gripped the sides of her chair until her knuckles turned white then struggled for control of her emotions again banks who had been thinking that now the peeper had escalated to more serious crimes was surprised by thelmas description criminals he asked you mean there was more than one there were two of them kids i think they were wearing balaclavas only one of them raped me the other said he didnt fancy sloppy seconds thats the way he put it inspector his exact wordssloppy seconds she pointed to her bruise hes the one that kicked me banks didnt know what to say and into the uneasy silence thelma dropped what turned out to be the best lead of all theres another thing she said looking away from him toward the wall as if she were examining the idyllic autumn scene on the calendar ive got vd ii over the next halfhour banks listened to the details of thelma pitts story as pc susan gay transcribed them every monday night thelma went to the bar of the eastvale golf club where she kept up her association with some of the people she had got to know in earlier better days there was one man in particular a lewis micklethwaite with whom she had been going out for several weeks during a long weekend in london with a female friend a couple of weeks ago thelma had while not entirely sober allowed herself to be picked up by a younger man in a pub and had subsequently spent the night with him she didnt remember much about the experience but the following morning she felt terrible physically and emotionally hungover the young man lived in a small flat off the brixton road and thelma rushed outside as fast as she could and unable to find a taxi took the first bus into central london returning to her friend at the hotel to cut a long story short she said i found out just over a week later that the bastard had kindly passed on his disease to megonorrhea that was why she had left the golf club early she didnt want to tell lewis nor did she want to infect him they argued he seemed unusually perturbed about her going but she ran off anyway and as a result of that she had disturbed the burglars and got herself raped can you describe them at all banks asked you said they were wearing balaclavas yes what color gray both gray any idea how old they were by the way they spoke and acted id say they were both in their teens how can you be sure the one who raped me was inexperienced it was all over mercifully fast id say it was his first time a woman can tell these things you know inspector what about the other i think he was scared he talked tough but i dont think he dared do anything he was smaller more squat and he had a very ugly voice raspy and piggy eyes he was edgy i think he might have been on drugs the one who raped me was leaner and taller he didnt say an awful lot i noticed nothing peculiar about his voice his eyes were blue and his breath didnt smell too good did they call each other by name no they were careful not to do that what about the rest of their clothing anything distinctive thelma pitt shook her head just what lots of kids wear these days bomber jackets jeans theres nothing else you can remember oh i remember it all quite vividly inspector ive replayed it over in my mind a hundred times since monday but thats all there is thats likely to help you unless its of any use to know that the boy who raped me was wearing white yfronts marks and sparks i think she added bitterly then she put her head in her hands and started to weep susan gay comforted her and after a few moments thelma pitt again made the effort to control her feelings im sorry she apologized that was uncalled for banks shrugged it must have been a terrifying experience he said feeling completely inadequate would you recognize them again yes i think so in the same circumstances but that wouldnt help you because i cant identify their faces that might not be necessary id recognize the squat ones voice and eyes any time as for the other i do remember that he had a bit of decay between one of his front teeth and the one next to it as if a filling had come out but i couldnt give you a positive identification i couldnt swear to anything in court she was remarkably calm as she relived it banks thought trying to imagine the inner strength and courage it took to deal with such horror finally she described the jewelry that had been stolen along with a valuable camera then banks let her leave promising to get in touch as soon as anything happened he also suggested though it was much too late that she see a doctor and have him look for and record any signs of assault for the purposes of evidence as soon as pc gay had escorted thelma pitt from his office banks phoned dr glendenning he was with a patient so his receptionist said but would call back in about ten minutes what is it the old doctor asked brusquely about twenty minutes later vd banks said gonorrhea to be specific what do you know about it ah gonorrhea glendenning said wanning to the subject like a general admiring a brave opponent more commonly known as the clap cupids revenge what are the symptoms discharge a burning sensation while urinating inspector banks i hope youre not trying to tell me that you its not me banks snapped adding you silly old sod under his breath how soon do the symptoms appear it varies glendenning went on unruffled three to ten days is about usual treatment penicillin there have to be tests first of course just to make sure it isnt something elseparticularly syphilis the early symptoms can be similar where would a person find treatment well in the old days of course hed go to his gp or perhaps to the infirmary but nowadays what with all the sexual promiscuity and what not there are specialized vd clinics all over the place confidential treatment naturally banks had indeed heard of such places theres one here in eastvale right he asked attached to the hospital yes and one in york none nearer not unless you count darlington or leeds thank you doctor banks said hurriedly thank you very much as soon as hed hung up he called in hatchley and richmond and after explaining the situation had them phone all the clinics within a fiftymile radius and ask about a lean tall teenager with decay between his front teeth who would probably be very vague about where he had contracted the disease fifteen minutes later he was informed that nobody fitting that description had been into any of the clinics which meant either that the suspect had not experienced the symptoms yet or that he was still worrying about what to do hatchley and richmond had also requested that the staff of each clinic be on the lookout and that they call their nearest police station if they became suspicious about anyone looking for treatment after that hatchley phoned the local police in each area and asked them to detain the boy if he appeared at the clinic and to call banks immediately later banks talked to jenny fuller at her york university office and told her about thelma pitt it wasnt part of the peeper case but it was a sexual crime and he needed a womans advice have you sent her for any help jenny asked i suggested she see a doctor mostly for our own official purposes i have to admit that wont do her a lot of good alan theres a rape crisis center in york a place where people can talk about their problems im surprised you dont know about it a lot of women find it hard to get on with their lives after an experience like that some never recover anyway these people can help theyre not just doctorsa lot of them have been rape victims themselves just a minute and ill get you the number banks wrote down the telephone number and assured jenny that he would pass it on to thelma pitt are we going to meet again soon she asked of course ive got a lot on with this thelma pitt business at the moment though and there are no real developments on our case ill give you a call the brushoff jenny cried melodramatically dont be stupid he laughed see you soon and you never know he added you might even get invited to dinner then he hung up before jenny could respond the next job was to get mr lewis micklethwaite in banks pulled the local directory out of his rattling desk drawer and reached for the phone again iii micklethwaite was reluctant to drop in at eastvale police station after work he was also unwilling to have banks call on him at home in fact micklethwaite wanted to avoid all contact with the local constabulary and when he finally did come to the office under threat of arrest banks immediately knew why if it isnt my old pal larry moxton banks said offering the man a cigarette i dont know what you mean my names micklethwaite but there was no mistaking himthe receding hairline dark beady eyes black beard swarthy skin fleshy lipsit was moxton all right come on larry banks urged him you remember me surely ive told you micklethwaite repeated squirming in his chair i dont know what youre talking about banks sighed larry moxton exaccountant i put you away about ten years ago in london remember when you swindled that divorcee out of her savings what was itprime florida real estate or was it giltedged securities it was a bloody frameup thats what it was moxton burst out it wasnt my fault my bloody partner took off with the funds banks stroked his chin bit of bad luck that larry i agree we never did find him did we probably sunning himself in spain now still thats the way it goes moxton glared at him what do you want this time im straight have been ever since i came out and moved up north and the new names legit so dont waste your time on that it was hard to believe that such a surly sneaky man had enough charm to cheat intelligent women out of their money but that had been moxtons speciality for some reason inexplicable to banks women found him hard to resist thelma pitt larry i want to know about thelma pitt what about her you do know her dont you so what if i do what are you after larry a rich widow this time youve no right to make accusations like that ive served my timefor a crime i didnt commitand its no bloody business of yours who i spend my time with when was the last time you saw her hey what is this moxton demanded grasping the flimsy desk and half rising nothings happened to her has it never mind that and sit down when did you last see her i want to know ive got a right to know sit down youve got a right to know nothing larry now answer my questions you wouldnt want me to lose my temper like last time would you when did you see her last moxton like many others had learned from experience that it was no use arguing with banks that he had the patience and persistence of a cat after a bird he might not actually hit you but youd go away thinking it would have been easier if he had monday night he answered sullenly i saw her on monday night where eastvale golf club you a member larry course i am i told you im a respectable businessman i am a ca you know youre an effing c too as far as im concerned larry but thats beside the point isnt it how long have you been a member two years two years and to think that ottershaw had told him it was an exclusive placeno riffraff i dont know what the worlds coming to larry i really dont banks said moxton glowered at him get to the point inspector he snapped looking at his watch ive got things to do ill bet you have all right so you know thelma pitt whats your relationship with her none of your business good friends business partners lovers so we go out together have a bit of fun whats it to you whats happened to her he did seem genuinely concerned about the womans welfare but banks considered it unethical to tell him that thelma pitt had been robbed and raped if she wanted him to know she would tell him herself what time did you leave her on monday banks pressed on i didnt she left me it was earlier than usualabout a quarter to ten i dont know why she was upset i suppose you could say we argued could i what about none of your oh he sighed and turned up his hands why not she wanted to be alone thats all i wanted her to come with me as usual where did the two of you usually go to my place did you spend the night there sometimes yes why didnt you go there last monday i told you she wouldnt said she had a headache you know women but you pressed her to stay at the club of course i did i was enjoying her company even though she didnt feel very well it didnt look like anything to me i think it was just an excuse she seemed fine physically just a bit upset about something any idea what no she wasnt very communicative she just stormed off after youd tried very hard to persuade her to stay and to accompany you to your house is that right what are you getting at nothing im just trying to establish the facts thats all well yes naturally i wanted her to stay with me im a man like any other i enjoy the company of attractive women so thelma pitt isnt the only one were not engaged to be married or anything if thats what youre getting at come on ive had enough of this pussyfooting around whats it all about know anyone else at the golf club one or two it is a social place for professional men you know maurice ottershaw a look of fear flashed in moxtons eyes it didnt last long but banks saw it maurice ottershaw he repeated i know him i mean weve had a few drinks together i wouldnt really say i know him what is it youre getting at ill tell you larry banks said leaning forward on the desk and holding moxtons eyes with his i think youve been fingering jobs for someone thats what i think you know when your rich friends at the club are likely to be away and you tip someone off but it went wrong with thelma pitt didnt it you couldnt keep her away from home long enough moxton looked really frightened now whats happened to her youve got to tell me she isnt hurt is she why would she be after what you said i thought dont worry about it you cant prove anything you know i know banks admitted but i also know you did it look i wouldnt shit on my own doorstep would i a creep like you would shit anywhere moxton were going to be watching you keeping an eye on you you wont be able to crap anywhere without being watched understand thats intimidation harassment moxton yelled jumping to his feet in exasperation oh piss off banks said and pointed to the door chapter fourteen i when trevor awoke on monday morning he knew something was wrong trevor his father shouted as usual breakfasts on the table if you dont hurry up youll be late for school at least he knew there would be no row over the table this morning all day sunday he had stayed in like a dutiful son hed helped his dad with the stock and had even done some homework such gestures as that could earn him a few days peace if not more pity about the homework he thought it was a waste really because he wouldnt be there to hand it in he was taking the afternoon off to go and discuss future plans with mick just because lenny had told them to lay off the breakins for a while didnt mean they couldnt find some other ways of amusing themselves perhaps out of town but something was wrong he didnt feel right he lay there with the sheets pulled up and looked at the glossy posters of pop stars on his walls wondering if the stickiness he felt meant that hed had a wet dream cautiously he pushed the bedclothes aside and sat up on the edge of the bed the front of his pajamas was stained and when he looked more closely he noticed a kind of yellowish discharge alarmed trevor rushed to the bathroom and washed himself when he stood to urinate the fear really took hold of him it hurt like hell it felt as if he was pissing redhot needles he leaned against the wall in a cold sweat pressing his forehead against the tiles when hed finished the pain faded and all that remained was a lingering throb the echo of an ache trevor washed his face and stared at himself in the mirror the dark patch between his teeth was spreading quickly and he had two spots one still embryonic wedged between the edge of his nostril and his upper lip the other yellow and juicy exactly at the point where his chin curved under to become his throat but they were the least of his worries he was pale and his eyes were dull he knew what hed got hed got the clap that fucking cunt had given him the clap with a great effort trevor pulled himself together he finished washing then returned to his bedroom to get dressed hurry up our trev his father called your bacon and eggs are going cold coming dad he yelled back wont be a minute he pulled his white shirt and gray slacks on picked out a sleeveless vneck pullover with a muted pattern of gray and mauve and he was ready they ate breakfast together quickly graham beaming at his son it was a good day we had yesterday wasnt it he asked yes trevor lied got a lot of work done we did didnt we and all your homework too thats right believe me trevor its worth it you might not think so now but youll be grateful in the future mark my words i suppose so trevor mumbled look at the time ill be late off you go then graham said ruffling trevors hair and smiling at him and dont forget to hand that homework in dont worry i wont trevor said forcing a grin and picking up his satchel and youd better get that tooth seen to too lad graham added or itll only get worse see if you can get an appointment with the school dentist all right dad trevor replied and rushed off he had no intention of making any appointment with the school dentist or with any other dentist for that matter it was dr himmler as he called the school dentist and his assistant griselda who had put trevor off dentists in the first place the man was grubby and his national health glasses were stuck together across the bridge with elastoplast griselda stood by whitefaced and redlipped like some medieval witch passing him the instruments of torture he never gave anaesthetics for fillings you simply had to grip the chair for extractions he administered nitrous oxide and trevor would never forget that feeling of suffocation as the mask was finally pressed over his nose and mouth like a polythene bag clinging to the pores keeping all the air out and afterwards he would stand up groggily and stagger to the next room where the previous patients were still standing around water fountains spitting or swilling the blood from their mouths trevor set off in the right direction for school he walked up through leaview estate which was already busy with the postman the milkman and wives seeing husbands off to work then turned onto king street with its cobbles and trendy tourist shops the places all had lookingglass windows and blackleaded railings leading down to basements stuffed with mildewed books spinning wheels bobbins and other relics of the woollen industry which were now sold as antiques the school was at the bottom of a narrow street to his left and trevor could see the white tips of the rugby posts and the dirty redbrick victorian clocktower instead of turning down school drive though he took the narrow winding streets to the market square on the eastern side of the square between the national westminster bank and joplings newsagents a short flight of worn stone steps led down to the el toro coffee bar a dim room with bullfight posters castanets and maracas on the walls trevor slumped into the darkest corner ordered an espresso coffee and settled down to think he knew he had vd because hed heard other kids talking and joking about it at school nobody ever thought it would happen to them though and because trevors intelligence was imaginative rather than scientific his ideas about the consequences of the disease were farfetched to say the least he pictured his penis turning black and rotten the flesh coming away in great gobbets in his hands the next time he had to go to the toilet he was convinced that it would drop off altogether within hours there was treatment he knew though he had no idea what it was but anything was better than dying that way even the school dentist would be better than that he could not go to his gp dr fanner because his father would find out he could bear the embarrassment but not disclosure too many awkward questions would be asked there were special clinics or so hed heard people say and he figured that one of those was his best bet there had been nothing in the papers about the woman he had raped so trevor assumed that micks boot had done the trick and she was keeping quiet for fear of worse reprisals still the police didnt publicize everything they knew so it would be best to avoid eastvale just in case trevor asked the owner for the phone directory and looked up hospitals and clinics as he had guessed there was a place in york he scribbled down the address on a page torn out of a school exercise book and left the el toro at the bus station he put his satchel and school blazer in a locker wearing only his dufflecoat over his shirt and pullover that way he didnt look at all like a schoolboy the next bus for york was due to leave in fifteen minutes he bought a copy of melody maker at the newsstand and sat on the cracked green bench to wait ii all day monday banks seethed with impatience he had made great efforts to put the thelma pitt business out of his mind over the weekend mostly for the sake of his family on saturday they had driven into york to do some shopping and on sunday they had all gone on a vigorous walk from bainbridge to semerwater in wensleydale it was a brisk day sunny and cool but they were all warm enough in their walking gear on monday morning though banks took off his walkman hardly having noticed which opera hed been listening to slammed it shut in the drawer and shouted for hatchley sir the sergeant said redfaced with the effort of running upstairs banks looked at him sternly youd better do something about the shape youre in sergeant he said first youd not be much use in a chase would you no sir hatchley replied gasping for breath anyway thats not what i want to see you about anything from the clinics no sir damn banks thumped the desk you did ask us to let you know sir hatchley reminded him im sure youd have heard if thered been any news over the weekend banks glared at him of course he said scratching his head and sitting down it can takeup to ten days sir when would that take us to wednesday or thursday sir thursday banks repeated tapping a ruler against his thigh anything could happen before then what about moxton moxton sir micklethwaite as he calls himself now oh him nothing there either im afraid banks had ordered surveillance on moxton assuming that he might try to warn his partner whoever that was he didnt do much at all hatchley added though he did go and visit the woman thelma pitt yes sir and and nothing sir stayed about fifteen minutes then drove home seemed a bit pissed off if you ask me slammed the car door he stayed in all saturday night went for a walk on sunday morning washed his car dropped in for a quick drink at that posh place the hope and anchor about nine oclock then went home and stayed there did he talk to anyone at the hope and anchor only the landlord sir anyone we know no sir straight as a die never even sold short measure far as we can tell banks took a deep breath all right sergeant thank you he said softening his tone a little to mollify hatchley have some coffee sent up will you sir banks grinned i know its awful muck but i need it all the same will do hatchley said lingering er sir what is it have you got any idea who it was sir the rapist im not sure sergeant it could be that sharp kid and his mate or a pair very much like them its the same ones who robbed the old ladies and pissed on the ottershaws vcrthat i am sure about and the matlock killing banks shook his head i dont think so thats something different another problem altogether why not bring the sharp kid in for questioning because i cant prove anything do you think i wouldnt have had him in before if i had something on him besides im not certain yet that he is the one i just got the feeling there was something wrong when i talked to him and his father that bit about the bad tooth sir if he banks waved his hand as if to brush aside a fly by itself its nothing you know that as well as i do on the other hand if hes got the clap we could always bring him in just to shake him up a bit no good his father would insist on being present hed probably send for a bloody lawyer too then theyd just clam up on us if sharps our lad we need evidence before we tackle him again or well lose him for good hatchley scratched the seat of his pants what about the woman he asked thelma pitt yes she said she couldnt positively identify them we dont want to take any risks on this when we get him i want him to stay not walk off on some technicality besides id rather not put her through it until weve got a bit more to go on if its sharp we know hes got the clap sooner or later hell turn up at one of the clinics then well haul him in hatchley nodded and went back downstairs when the coffee came banks realized all over again why he usually took his breaks in the golden grill he sat with his chair turned to face the window smoked and stared blankly over the market square watching the first activities of the morning delivery vans double parked outside the shops the minister glancing at his watch hurried into the church a housewife in a paisley headscarf rattled the door of bradwells grocery which didnt appear to be open yet but all this was mere activity without meaning to banks he was close to solving the robberies and the rape of thelma pitthe knew that he could feel it in his bonesbut there was nothing he could do to hurry things along as so often in his job he had to be patient this time he literally had to let nature take its course slowly while he smoked yet another cigarette the market square came to life as the first tourists stepped into the norman church bradwells grocery finally opened its doors and took delivery of boxes of fruit from an orange van with a sombrero painted on its side the woman in the paisley headscarf was nowhere to be seen by midmorning banks was sick of being cooped up in his office he told sergeant rowe he was going out for half an hour or so then went for a walk to burn off some of his impatience he hurried across the market square fastening his overcoat as he went then cut down the narrow backstreets and through the flower gardens to the riverside the slowly increasing cloud cover had not yet quite blotted out the sun but it had drawn a thin veil over it that weakened the light and gave the whole landscape the look of a watercolor in pale greens yellows orange brown and red the scent of rain came on a chilling wind which seemed to be blowing from the northwest along the channel of swainsdale itself the breeze hurried the river over the terraced falls and set up a constant skittering sound in the trees that lined the banks leaves were already falling and scraping along the ground most of them ended up in the water across the swain was another pathway and behind that more trees and flowerbeds the houses that banks could just see through the waving branches were the ones fronting the green which separated them from the east side estate banks knew that jennys house was among them but he couldnt tell which one it was from that distance and angle he pushed his hands deep into his overcoat pockets hunched his shoulders and hurried on the exercise was doing the trick driving chaotic thoughts from his mind and helping him work up an appetite for lunch he doubled back around the castle to the market square hatchley and richmond were lunching in the queens arms when he got there and hatchley stopped in midsentence when he saw his boss enter banks remembered that he had been rude to the sergeant that morning and guessed that they were complaining about him taking a deep breath he joined them at their table and set things right again by buying both his men a pint iii the york bus arrived at the station by the roman wall at tenthirty trevor walked along the wall passed the railway station then crossed the ouse over lendal bridge by the ruins of st marys abbey and the yorkshire museum after that he wandered in a daze around the busy city until he felt hungry just after opening time he found a pub on stonegatewith his height and outofschool dress he certainly looked over eighteenwhere he ate a steakandmushroom pie along with his pint of keg beer he lingered there for almost two hours nursing his pint and reading every word including the musicians wanted column in his melody maker before venturing out into the streets again everywhere he walked he seemed to stumble across pairs of american tourists most of them complaining because they were inadequately dressed for the cool weather goddamn suns out he heard one fat man in thin cotton slacks and a blazer grumble youd think thered be some goddamn heat for christs sake oh elmer his wife said weve been in yoorp for a month now you oughtta know it never gets hot north of athens trevor sneered silly sods he thought why even bother to come here and litter up the streets if they were too soft to take a bit of autumn chill he imagined america as a vast continent baking in the sunpavements you could fry eggs on people stripped to the waist all the time having barbecues enormous uninhabitable stretches of desert and jungle about an hour later he knew he was lost he seemed to have wandered outside the city walls this was no tourist area he was in it was too workingclass the long straight rows of tiny backtobacks built of dusty pink bricks seemed endless washing flapped on lines hung across the narrow streets trevor turned back and at the end of the street saw the minsters bright towers in the distance he started walking in their direction hed put it off for long enough he decided if he didnt want his penis to shrivel up and drop off hed better go for treatment however frightening the prospect seemed in a newsagents he found time to look up the location of the clinic in a street guide before the suspicious owner told him to clear off if he wasnt going to buy anything bleeding paki trevor muttered under his breath as he found himself being ushered out but hed got what hed come for the clinic not very far from the hub of the city was a squat modern building of windowless concrete with a fiat asphalt roof trevor presented himself at reception where he was told to take a seat and wait until a doctor became available there were two other people before him a middleaged man and a scruffy female student and both of them looked embarrassed as they waited nobody spoke and they all avoided even accidental eye contact about an hour later it was trevors turn a bald longfaced doctor led him into a small room and bid him sit in front of the desk trevor shifted anxiously wishing to god the whole thing was over and done with the place smelled of dettol and carbolic it reminded him of the dentists right the doctor said brightly after scribbling a few notes on a form what can we do for you young man what a stupid question trevor thought what the hell does he think im here for to have my bunions seen to ive got a problem he mumbled and gave the doctor the details whats your name the doctor asked after umming and ahing over trevors description of his symptoms peter upshaw trevor answered smartly it was something hed had the foresight to work out in advance a name he had picked out from the columns of melody maker address fortytwo arrowsmith drive the doctor glanced at him sharply is that here in york yes whereabouts he scratched his shiny pate with his ballpoint pen i dont believe i know it its by the minster trevor blurted out reddening he hadnt anticipated that the quack would be so inquisitive the minster ah yesthe doctor made an entry on the form all right peter he said putting down his pen well have some tests to do of course but first i have to ask you where you caught this disease who you caught it from trevor certainly hadnt bargained for this he couldnt tell the truth he couldnt name anyone he knew and he certainly couldnt answer nobody a prostitute he replied quickly it was the first thing that came into his mind the doctor raised his thin eyebrows a prostitute where was this peter here in york yes when about a week ago what was her name jane where does she live it was all going too fast for trevor he began to stumble over his answers i i dont know i was with some other boys wed had a bit too much to drink then we walked around and she just came up to us in the street yes but you must have gone somewhere no i mean yes the doctor stared at him in an alley trevor went on we went in an alley there was nobody around we stood up leaning against a wall what about your friends did they er no trevor assured him hastily he realized that he would be asked to name anybody else he implicated the doctor frowned are you sure yes it was only me it was my birthday ah the doctor said smiling benignly i understand but you dont know where this woman lived no have you been with anyone else since it happened no very well peter if youll just walk down the corridor to the room at the end youll find a nurse there shell take a blood samplejust to make sure after that come back here and well get on with it the room was like the school chemistry laboratory with glassfronted cupboards full of labelled jars and long tables covered with retorts bunsen burners pipettes and racks of test tubes it made trevor nervous the nurse was quite pretty relax she said rolling up his sleeve it wont hurt and it didnt he couldnt feel the needle going in at all but he turned his head away so he wouldnt see the blood running into the syringe he felt a slight prick as it came out there the nurse said smiling and wiping the spot with cottonwool soaked in alcohol all done you can go back to doctor willis now trevor went back to the small examination room where doctor willis greeted him i want you to sit back on that chair over there and relax peter he said in a soft hypnotic voice this wont take very long just another little test willis turned his back to trevor and picked up something shiny from a white kidneyshaped tray just remove your trousers peter underpants too thats right the doctor said and came toward him willis held in his hand what looked like a sewingneedle he seemed to be holding it by the point though and the angled eye was larger than normal trevor tensed as willis came closer for a moment the doctor seemed to be wearing a dirty smock and his national health glasses were held together at the bridge by elastoplast now relax peter he said bending forward im just going to insert this gently inside iv the phone call came through at chief inspector banks it was an unfamiliar voice yes this is inspector maclean here york cid banks tightened his grip on the receiver his palms sweating slippery against the black bakelite yes go on its about your request the local clapshop called us a few minutes ago seems theyve got a kid down there looks about eighteen but could be younger and doesnt appear to know york very well he was very vague about how he picked up the disease some claptrap excuse the punabout having a prossie in a back alley doctor got the distinct impression that he was making it up as he went along sound like your laddie it certainly does banks said drumming on his desk with excitement tell me more not a lot more to tell maclean went on in his deadpan voice some decay between the front teeth all right but most kids have rotten teeth these days i was over in the states two years ago on an exchange and they think its criminal there the way the british treat their teethor dont treat them if you catch my drift they say you can always spot a brit by his teeth you know inspector banks cut in sorry maclean said you must be eager to get your mitts on him i am rather where is he still at the clapshop were holding him there got a couple of uniforms on the job we let him have his treatment of course you realize hell need a few more shots yet do you want him delivered no thanks ill pick him up myself im glad you said that were a bit short of staff down here what name did he give upshaw peter upshaw ring a bell no but itd be false wouldnt it banks took down the address of the clinic be there in about an hour and thank you inspector maclean youre welcome maclean said and hung up sergeant hatchley banks bellowed jumping up and flinging open his door for the second time that day hatchley arrived red faced and breathless but banks made no comment on his physical condition his dark eyes glittering with success he clapped his hand gleefully on the sergeants broad wellpadded shoulder and said fancy a ride to york trevor meanwhile sat glumly in the examination room under the bored eyes of a freshfaced constable no more than three or four years his senior the other officer of similar age and appearance so much so that locals on their beat called them the bobbie twins stood in the reception area waiting for the cid bigwig after the slight discomfort and great humiliation of his examination trevor had been told to await the test results he felt edgy and afraid but not of the police there was room only for one worry at a time in his youthful mind it was with great surprise then that he noted the arrival of constable parker who preceded dr willis through the door sorry about this willis said embarrassedly taking off his glasses and cleaning them on his smock a little misunderstanding im sure soon have it straightened out eh and under the policemans eyes he administered the first injection in trevors course of treatment after that there was nothing to do but wait and one worry very quickly replaced another in trevors mind it was closer to six oclock when banks and hatchley arrived at the clinic they hadnt reckoned on the rushhour snarlup in york s maze of oneway streets constable spinks led them to the examination room and trevor sneered when he saw banks walk in well trevor banks greeted him i see youve lost a filling since we last talked trevor said nothing but got sullenly to his feet and followed the two men out to their car the drive back to eastvale in the dark passed in silence the law stated that a juvenile could not be charged unless his parents were present and as a charge was likely banks had to call graham sharp in as soon as the trio arrived back at the eastvale station nobody said a word to trevor until his father arrived when graham sharp was shown into the already crowded office by pc gay banks was just finishing his call to sandra letting her know that he would be late home again that evening finally with both trevor and his father sitting opposite him at the desk and sergeant hatchley standing by the window with his notebook gazing down on the quiet darkening market square banks was ready to begin he tidied the files on his desk arranged the pencils in front of him and caught trevors eye what were you doing at that clinic he opened what do you think trevor mumbled scornfully well you werent having your filling replaced thats for certain whats all this graham sharp butted in what clinic what are you talking about mr sharp banks said patiently according to the law you have to be present if charges are likely to be laid but im the one whos asking the questions all right ive got a right to protect my son yes you have youre perfectly at liberty to advise him not to answer if you wish but please bear in mind that he hasnt been charged with anything yet graham sharp settled back in his chair looking angry and confused why didnt you go to the eastvale clinic banks asked trevor didnt know there was one how did you find out about york a schoolmate told me who did you get the clap from now wait a minute sharp interrupted again this is going too far what clap whos got vd your son has gonorrhea mr sharp havent you lad trevor said nothing theres no point denying it banks pressed the doctor did the tests we can easily call him and have him talk to your dad trevor turned away from his father and nodded graham sharp put his head in his hands lets get back to my original question banks continued where did you get this disease you dont catch it from toilet seats you know it was like i told the doctor trevor answered ah yes banks said speaking up so that graham sharp could hear him clearly you had a prostitute against a wall down a back alley in york is that right trevor nodded pale when was this about a week ago last monday you were in york last monday yes what time did he get home mr sharp sharp snapped to attention at the sound of his name what what time did your son get home last monday night banks repeated about eleven he always has to be in by eleven its his bedtime see did you know where he was he said he was going to york yes sharp said who did he go with i dont know a friend he didnt say a friend i suppose so not friends for gods sake i dont know you see the thing is mr sharp he told the doctor he went with a group of friends to celebrate his birthday and that his friends got together and bought him so to speak a prostitute as a present was it your sons birthday last monday mr sharp yes yes it was as a matter of fact you realize banks said that we can always check the records well it wasnt officially his birthday no but it was his mothers birthday he always used to celebrate his mothers birthday he was very attached to her is that really what happened trevor banks asked to celebrate your mothers birthday you had a prostitute up against a wall in a back alley in york she said her name was jane and youve no idea where she lives trevor nodded do you know trevor that we can question every prostitute in york if we have to its not as big as leeds or bradford and there arent very many of them the police know them all theyre on good termsyou know you scratch my back ill scratch yours that kind of thing it wouldnt take us long to find out whether your storys true or not all right trevor said defiantly ask them bloody well ask them for all i care mind your language trevor his father said sergeant hatchley who had remained as impassive as a buddha throughout the interrogation suddenly moved away from the window and began pacing around the small office making the floor creak trevor shot nervous glances at him and seemed to tense up when hatchley walked behind him care to tell us the names of your friends trevor just so we can corroborate your story banks asked no trevor glanced sideways at hatchley who leaned against the wall for a moment and cracked his knuckles before turning another page in his notebook where were you a week last thursday evening he was at home with me graham sharp answered quickly i asked trevor like he says trevor looked at his father doing what watched a bit of telly read a bit did some homework what about tuesday wednesday friday saturday sunday same thing dont have much of a social life do you trevor when i was a lad i was all over the place my mother and father couldnt keep track of me trevor shrugged look graham sharp cut in eyeing hatchley who moved casually away from the wall and back over to the window this has gone far enough whats it all about whats my trevor supposed to have done when what do you mean when i mean that we think trevors done a lot of things i was asking you which night you meant dont be ridiculous trevors a good kid hes doing well at school and hell be going on to university hes going to make something out of his life banks shook his head hes not doing so well at school you know ive checked sharps mouth dropped open then he pulled himself together all right so hes having one or two problems at the moment we all go through difficult phases inspector you must know that yes i know that banks replied evenly but im afraid that in your trevors case its something more serious what is it sharp pleaded what on earth is he supposed to have done hatchley turned from the window and startled everybody with his gruff voice he spoke however with a quiet intensity that enthralled his audience completely last monday he said two lads broke into a womans house they thought she was out and wouldnt be back till late as it happened she had a fight with her fancy man and came home early she caught them at it burgling her house they tied her up then one of them raped her and the other kicked her in the head we think the crime was committed by the same two youths who also burgled a mr maurice ottershaws house assaulted and robbed four old ladies and possibly he glanced at banks who nodded killed your neighbor alice matlock and youre saying my trevor had something to do with this sharp cried getting to his feet the veins on his temples stood out throbbing wildly you must be insane he banged on the flimsy desk i want my lawyer here i want him here now before you say another word youre perfectly at liberty to request that of course sir banks said mildly giving hatchley the signal to fade into the woodwork again but i must repeat your son hasnt been charged with anything yet hes simply helping us with our inquiries the cliché seemed to calm sharp down a little he eased himself slowly back into his chair and brushed back the hair from his forehead i thought your man here just accused my son of rape burglary and murder he snarled glaring at hatchleys back nothing of the sort banks assured him he simply gave details of the crimes we think your son might be able to help us with though he no longer linked the robberies with the death of alice matlock banks knew how to exploit an unsolved killing in his favor if trevor thought he was going to get alice s murder pinned on him too there was a slim chance he might confess to the other offenses what makes you think my trevor knows anything about it sharp asked because the woman who was raped had just discovered that she had contracted gonorrhea banks said directing his words at trevor who stared down at his knees and your son has just returned from a vd clinic in york where he was diagnosed as having gonorrhea the symptoms show up so im told anywhere between three and ten days id say that seven days fits into that time scale quite well wouldnt you but surely sharp objected there are other people visiting these clinics if trevor really did go with a prostitute and catch vd from her as he saysand i believe himthen thats no crime its just youthful high spirits i was a bit of a lad myself at his age are robbery rape assault and murder just youthful high spirits too banks asked sarcastically now look here you said you werent accusing my son of anything im not accusing him im trying to get to the truth i never said he wasnt a suspect though are you sure he went to york last monday thats where he said he was going when did you lose that filling trevor banks asked wednesday trevor replied but not before his father had said thursday you see banks went on the woman who was raped said she remembered the kids front teeth that there was some decay between them as if he had a missing filling she said shed recognize it again she said shed know his voice too and here he directed his words at trevor shed know his technique she said she could tell he was just an inexperienced kid because he shot his load almost as soon as he stuck it in trevor flushed with anger and grasped the edge of the desk graham put a restraining hand on his shoulder well bring her in trevor shes not afraid to give evidence you know despite what your friend did to her and well question all the prostitutes in york well talk to the bus drivers and see if any of them remember you and if you tell us you went by train well talk to the ticket collectors and train crews well find out who else went to york that night and well ask if any of them saw you and your friends seeing as there were a few of you i should imagine you were quite noisyyouthful high spirits and all thatand someone in whatever pub you were in is bound to remember so why dont you make it easier for us trevor make it easier for everyone its up to you well nail you in the end anyway come on trev hatchley piped up putting a fatherly hand on the boys shoulder before it goes too far itll go easier on you this way trevor shook his hand off i refuse to believe this said sharp my son isnt capable of such actions he cant be i raised him myself after his mother left gave him everything he wanted if hes done anything wrongand i dont think he has then he was led on he was led on by that bloody mick webster its him you want not my trevor shut up dad trevor snapped for gods sake shut up and he lapsed back into sullen silence banks got to his feet and smiled down at trevor who caught his eye before turning away both of them knew in that split second of eye contact that banks had won he had nowhere near enough evidence yet to make a conviction but if mick webster thought that trevor had snitched on him where does he live this webster banks asked graham on the east side estate that first street the one that faces the green i know it number i dont know but its the fifth house down after the tobacconists ive seen him coming and going a few times when ive been picking up stock got that banks asked hatchley who nodded take richmond and hurry up bring in mick webster chapter fifteen i after alans phone call sandra packed brian off to the lifeboys and tracy to the guides they hadnt been interested in such organizations back in london but since theyd started school in eastvale and discovered that many of the other children were members they decided it would be a good way to make friends tracy was still quite happy with it but brian was already chafing at the bit he complained that he didnt like drill and that he liked the leader who spat as he shouted even less sandra having been a loner as a child thought the whole network of scouts cubs brownies and the rest rather silly but she would never say anything about that in front of the children when they had finally gone she took a deep breath and looked around the living room wondering what to do first though she managed to be a fairly efficient housewife she wasnt an obsessive cleaner alan also helped out on the weekends taking on jobs she didnt like such as hoovering the staircase and cleaning the bathroom it was seven oclock she didnt know when alan would be back hed said he was questioning a suspect sandra was trying to decide between doing some darkroom work or settling down with the biography of alfred hitchcock she had taken out of eastvale library that morning when there was a knock at the door puzzled she went to answer it expecting perhaps selena harcourt wanting to borrow a cup of sugar but it was robin allott from the camera club you told us you were willing to lend out your slide projector remember he said standing in the doorway oh of course robin sandra said im so sorry it slipped my mind i must have looked quite unwelcoming for a moment please come in i hope ive not called at an inconvenient time not at all ive just sent the children off and i was wondering what to do yes i saw them robin said smiling lifeboys and guides it reminds me of my own childhood he wiped his feet carefully on the doormat and sandra hung up his navyblue raincoat in the hall closet then directed him into the front room which he admired politely he unslung his old heavy pentax from his shoulder and put it on the table by the front window silly habit he said but i always carry it with me you never know sandra laughed thats the sign of a true professional do sit down robin can i get you a drink yes please if its no trouble none at all gin or scotch im afraid thats all weve got quite all right scotchll do fine water ice no just as it comes for me please sandra poured his drink mixed herself a gin and slimline tonic then sat in the armchair opposite him he seemed more shy than he usually did in the mile post as if he was embarrassed to be alone with her in the house so sandra broke the ice and asked him if hed done anything interesting over the weekend robin shook his head not really i did take a ride to the coast on sunday but it clouded over there so i couldnt get any good shots what about the evenings sandra asked dont you go to clubs or concerts no i dont do much of that oh i drop in at the local for the odd jar but thats about all thats not much of a social life is it what about girlfriends surely there must be someone not really robin answered looking down into his drink since my divorce ive been well a bit of a hermit really it wouldnt feel right going out with anybody else so soon its not as if youre a widower you know sandra argued when you get divorced its all right to go out and have fun if you feel like it was it mutual robin nodded hastily and sandra sensed that he felt uncomfortable with the subject anyway she said youll get over it dont worry ill just nip upstairs and fetch the projector would you like me to help robin offered awkwardly i mean it must be heavy no not at all sandra said waving him back onto the sofa theyre all made of light plastic these days robin was gazing at the books on the shelves by the fireplace when sandra came back down with the slide projector here it is she said its easy to work do you know how im not sure robin said outside of cameras im not very mechanically minded look he went on ive got those slides back the ones i took at the camera club would you like to see them you can show me how to set up the machine why not sandra set up the projector on the table at the far end of the room and fetched the screen from upstairs she then drew the curtains and placed it in front of the window finally she showed robin how to switch on the power and fit the slides he gave her into the circular tray its automatic she explained once youve got it all set up you just press this button when you want to move onto the next slide or this one if you want to go back and this is how you focus she showed him the controls robin nodded excuse me he said i think i would like some ice and water with my whiskey after all sandra moved forward to take his glass no its all right he said i can get it myself you set up the show and he went into the kitchen sandra adjusted the height of the projector and turned off the light robin came back with his whiskey as the first slide zoomed into focus it really was quite remarkable the model was sitting with her legs tucked under her gazing away from the camera the lines drew the eye right into the composition and robin had obviously used one of the series filters to bring out the warm flesh tones what was especially odd about the whole thing was that the model didnt seem to be posing she looked as if she were staring into space thinking of a distant memory its excellent sandra remarked over the hum of the projector i really didnt think a modelling session like that would work out well on slides but its really amazing beautiful she heard the ice tinkling in robins glass thank you he said in a faroff voice yes they did work out well shes not as beautiful as you though something in the way he said it sent a shiver of fear up sandras spine and she froze for a moment before turning slowly to look at him it was too dark to see anything except his silhouette but in the light that escaped from the edges of the lens she could see the sharp blade of one of her kitchen knives glinting robin was on his feet quite close to her she could hear him breathing quickly she backed away and found herself between the projector and the screen the projection of the nude model distorted as it wrapped around her figure like an avantgarde dress design and she froze again as a transformed robin moved closer ii mick gobbled up another mouthful of pills and went over to the window again it was dark outside and the tall sodium lights glowed an eerie red the way they always did before they turned jaundice yellow still no sign mick started pacing the room again one batch of amphetamines wearing off and the new ones beginning to take effect sweat prickled on his forehead and skull itching between the spikes of hair his heart was pounding like a barrage of artillery but he didnt feel good he was worried where the hell was trevor the bastard was supposed to arrive two hours ago as the lights yellowed like old paper mick got more edgy and jittery the room felt claustrophobic too small to contain him his muscles were straining at his clothes and his brain felt like it was pushing at the inner edges of his skull something was going on they were onto him he looked out of the window again careful not to be seen this time there was a man in a homburg walking his jack russell hed been walking that dog for hours up and down the street by the edge of the green under the lights and mick was sure he kept glancing covertly toward the house a little further into the green where the lights of the posher houses at the other side seemed to twinkle between the leaves and branches that danced in the breeze a young couple stood under a tree the girl was leaning against the tree and the boy was talking to her one arm outstretched supporting his weight on the trunk above her head sure they looked like lovers mick thought that was the idea but he wasnt fooled he could see the way she kept looking sideways at him when she should have been paying closer attention to her man he was probably speaking into a walkietalkie or a microphone hidden in his lapel they were communicating with the dogwalker and they werent the only ones deeper in the trees what he had thought to be shadows and thick tree trunks turned into people and if he listened closely enough he could hear them whispering to each other he put his hands over his ears and retreated into the room he put a loud rock record on the stereo to shut out the noise of the whisperers but it didnt work they were in his head already and even the music seemed part of a sinister plot it was meant to put him offguard that was it he snatched at the needle scratching the record and returned to the window vigilance that was what was called for nothing had changed the man with the dog was walking back down the street he stopped by a tree holding the leash loosely and looking up at the sky as the dog cocked its leg the couple on the green was pretending to kiss now perhaps there was time to get away mick thought licking his lips and wiping his forehead with the back of his hand he had to get himself ready they probably didnt even know he was there yet to escape though meant leaving the window for a few minutes something he couldnt bear to do but he had to he couldnt let them catch him unprepared he dashed upstairs to lennys room first and pulled out the heavy gun from under the mattress then he went into his own messy room and took all his cash out of its hiding place a hollowedout book called the practical way to keep fit he had almost a hundred pounds it should be enough rushing back downstairs he grabbed his parka from the hook in the hall shoved the gun and money into its deep pockets and went back to watch from the window now he was ready now he could take on anybody the familiar effect of the pills was returning he felt the weight of the big gun in his pocket and waves of adrenaline surged through his veins flooding him with a sense of power and wellbeing but he had to do something he had so much energy it was boiling over the man with the dog had gone and the young couple had moved to another tree they thought they could fool him but he wasnt that stupid the green was full of young couples now they leaned against every tree pretending to be kissing and feeling each other up mick felt a jolt of energy in his loins as he watched the erotic tableau of shadows when the police car finally came he was ready he saw its headlights approaching slowly dispersing the watchers on the green as its beams sought the right house and he left softly by the back door he had a plan there was only one sensible thing he could do and that was get out of eastvale disappear go down to join lenny in london for a while to get out of eastvale he had to cross the green then the river and walk up around the castle to the bus station at the back of the market square it was no good running east in that direction there was nothing but fields and the long flat vale he would be an easy target out in the open there cautiously he edged down the back alley to the end of the block where a narrow snicket separated two terraces as he crept out into the street again he was about four houses north of the police now all he had to do was disappear quietly into the trees and he was home free he crossed the street without attracting any attention and stood on the verge of the green the police were still knocking at his door and trying to peer in through the windows the fools a few more paces and he would be among the shadows the shadows that belonged to him again suddenly a voice called out behind him and for a moment he stopped dead in his tracks feeling the adrenaline prickle inside him hey you the voice called again stop where you are police for a second he thought it was all over that they had him but then he remembered he had an edgethe gun and the power he felt crackling inside him the new plan came as a brainstorm and he laughed out loud at the beauty of it as he ran across the green with the police close behind still shouting he would never make it to the bus station he knew that now and even if he did they would be waiting for him talking to each other on the airwaves so he had to improvise try something different the light was on that was a good sign without hesitating he leaped up the steps three at a time and ran his shoulder into the front door it didnt give at once the police were clearing the trees now only about seventyfive yards away mick took a few paces back and crashed into the door again this time it splintered open the woman alarmed by his first attempt was peering frightened through a door in the hallway mick rushed in grabbed her by her hair and dragged her to the front window the police were halfway across the street by now taking out his gun mick smashed the window and held jenny up by the hair stop he screamed at them dont move another inch ive got a gun and ive got the woman and if you dont do what i say ill fucking shoot the bitch iii even robins voice was different it had lost its timber of shy cheerfulness and become forced and clipped sandra edged backwards until she could feel the screen against her back she was almost perfectly lined up with the projected model whose image was wrapped around her body the girls face superimposed on her own robin she said as calmly and quietly as she could manage you dont really want to do this do you dont let things go too far i have to robin said tersely its already gone beyond beyond what beyond where i thought i could go you can still stop it no yes you can sandra insisted gently no cant you see i have to go further always further or its no good theres no point when i watched you sandra watched you undressing in your bedroom it was the best it was just like i didnt think i could go any further than that i didnt think i could ever go any further do you know what i mean the ultimate sandra nodded the models face remained still and detached fixed on that faroff memory sandra felt as if she were tied to the screen by the projection she wanted to tell robin to turn it off but she didnt dare the way he was talking he was beyond reason there was nothing she could do but keep asking him calmly to put the knife down and stop but she knew he wouldnt hed gone too far now and he could only go further hed made his greatest step and the rest would have to follow he was coming closer the projected model bending around the knife blade throwing its shadow onto sandras chest she was backed up as far against the screen as she could get robin stopped still at an angle so as not to block the image projected on her take your clothes off he ordered twitching the knife no sandra replied you cant mean it put the knife away robin its not too late take your clothes off he repeated i do mean it do as i say it was futile to protest any more sandra clenched her teeth holding back the tears and brought her trembling hands to the buttons on her shirt dont hurry robin said take your time do it slow each button seemed to take an eternity but finally the shirt was undone she dropped it on the floor and waited go on he said the jeans sandra was wearing tight levis she undid the top button and pulled down the zipper it wasnt easy but she managed to fold them over her hips and get out of each leg while still standing up she stood before robin in her white bra and panties shaking all over the image was still wrapped around her and now it seemed welcome offering her a little covering some protection robin pulled the slide out of its slot and the bright piercing light of the lens pinned sandra to the screen she put up a hand to shield her eyes robin said nothing for a long time he seemed to be just gazing at her a slender figure with long blond hair and shapely long legs he was awestruck she could feel his eyes as they slid over her body probing every curve every shadow she noticed that the hand that held the knife was trembling now the rest he ordered in a voice that seemed caught deep in his throat sandra started to obey slower robin commanded her finally she stood naked in the harsh glare of the slide projector now she made no pretense of not crying her shoulders shook and the tears flowed down her cheeks fell onto her chest and trickled across her breasts suddenly robin gave a strangled cry dropped the knife and hurled himself down on his knees in front of her the abruptness of his action shocked sandra out of her fear he put his arms around her hips and buried his face in her loins she could hear him sobbing and she could feel his warm tears quickly she stretched out her left hand to grab the camera that robin had left on the table beside the screen then with both hands she lifted it high in the air and brought it down hard on the top of his head iv it was quiet in bankss office he sat smoking a cigarette feeling very pleased with himself waiting to hear from hatchley and richmond opposite trevor sat sullen and withdrawn while his father seemed nervous tapping on the edge of the desk and whistling between his teeth there was a soft knock at the door and sergeant rowes grayhaired head popped around indicating that he had something to say phone call he said in the corridor looking worried your wife sir said it was urgent she sounded very upset banks had asked that all calls be intercepted while he was interrogating trevor he hadnt wanted to be interrupted puzzled and worried that something might have happened to brian or tracy he told rowe to keep an eye on the suspect for a few moments and ducked into the nearest empty room to take the call alan thank god sandra breathed rowe was right banks had never heard her sound like that before what is it whats wrong it was robin alan the peeper he came here he had a knife what happened are you all right yes yes im all right a bit scared and shaky but he didnt hurt me alan i think ive killed him i hit him with the camera too hard i wasnt thinking i was so frightened and angry stay there sandra banks told her dont move ill be over in a few minutes understand yes hurry alan please i will banks got rowe out of his office again and told the sergeant that an emergency had arisen and he had to rush home what about those two rowe asked ill be back banks said thinking quickly have sergeant hatchley call me at home when they get back with webster and dont under any circumstances let the two kids see each other right sir got it rowe said banks could tell that he wanted to ask what was wrong or offer some sort of sympathy but discretion got the better of him and he went back into bankss office shutting the door softly behind him banks got as far as the front door before pc craig on temporary desk duty shouted after him sir inspector banks sir banks turned what is it he snapped still edging toward the door a call sir sergeant hatchley says its an emergency banks was of two minds whether to take it or not but his professional instinct made him reach for the phone at least sandra wasnt in immediate danger any longer a minute or two more wouldnt hurt what is it sergeant the kid sir webster he gave us the slip well go after him its not as simple as that we know where he is get to the bloody point sergeant banks growled ive got one bloody emergency on my hands already he ran across the green and broke into a womans house sir hes got her held hostage there hes got a gun banks felt his stomach tighten which house its that doctor woman sir the one i saw coming out of the supers office christ banks gasped rubbing his free hand over his eyes but theres more sir he says he wants you there he asked for you and said if you didnt get here in twenty minutes hed kill the woman banks had to think more quickly than he had ever done in his life it was probably no more than a split second before he gave hatchley his instructions but in that period banks felt as if he had been to hell and back the two women flashed before his eyes if he deserted sandra when she needed him he thought things might never be right again she would never fully trust him if he didnt go to help jenny on the other hand she would surely die banks reasoned that sandra would somehow understand this if she knew that his duty was to try to save a life rather than console his wife after she had already succeeded in freeing herself from a dangerous terrifying situation though he was thinking specifically that it was jenny in danger that he couldnt let jenny die he knew he would also have to go even if it was a stranger mick webster had taken hostage it was personal yes and this intensified his concern but his job demanded that he do the same for anyone somebody however would have to go to sandra there was always the chance that the man would return to consciousness again and if someone else dealt with it then it would be official business it was official anyway he realized it had gone too far to be covered up as easily as the peeper episode no matter who went to sandra now all the details would have to come out ill be there sergeant banks said quickly send dc richmond over to my house got it my house immediately ive not got time to explain but its urgent tell him to hurry and to explain to my wife about the situation here yes sir hatchley said sounding puzzled and let the super know banks added well need him down there if theres any negotiating to be done hes already on his way hatchley said and hung up not wasting another moment banks rushed through the desk area picked up the keys to the same car he had driven to york and without signing for them dashed out of the back into the yard where the vehicles were parked in seven minutes he was outside jennys house hatchley and two uniformed men stood by the low wall at the bottom of the garden which sloped upwards quite steeply to the bay window the light in the front room was on and banks could hear the strains of tosca playing in the background any developments he asked hatchley no sir the sergeant replied havent seen hide nor hair of him since he told us to send for you theyre inside though i sent bradley and jennings around the back told them not to do nothing just keep their eyes open banks nodded hatchley had done well considering that this was the first time he had had to deal with hostage taking it was a difficult business as banks had found out for himself on one or two occasions down in london but it was of chief importance to maintain as calm and reasonable an atmosphere as possible for negotiations another car drew up by the curb and superintendent gristhorpe got out he looked like a bulky absentminded professor with his unkempt thatch of hair blowing in the breeze and his bushy eyebrows meeting in the middle of his frown banks explained the situation to him as quickly as possible why does he want you here gristhorpe asked i dont know have you told him youve arrived not yet better do it alan he might be getting impatient is there a megaphone banks asked gristhorpe smiled wryly now where the bloody hell would we get a megaphone alan banks acknowledged this fact then simply spoke out loud toward the broken window mick mick webster im here its inspector banks there were sounds of scuffling inside then webster appeared at the window gun pointed at the side of jennys head what do you want banks asked why do you want me here i want you in here mick shouted back why do you want me youve already got the girl just do as i say get in here and no tricks mick send the girl out send her out and then ill come in nothing doing come in now or ill blow her fucking head off come on mick lets play fair let her go we give a little and you give a little send her out and ill come in i told you banks either you come in now or she dies ill give you thirty seconds better do it alan gristhorpe said heavily hes not stable you cant reason with him have you dealt with anything like this before yes banks answered a couple of times usually with pros though but you know the ropes banks nodded ill try and keep him talking gristhorpe said keep negotiations open your times running out banks mick yelled all right banks said climbing the steps im coming in mick and as he walked he thought of sandra mick webster was in a dangerously unstable state banks could see that at once as he obeyed orders and emptied out his pockets the boy was constantly edgy always scratching sweating fidgeting shifting from one foot to the other and it didnt take banks long to recognize the signs of an amphetamine user jenny appeared to be calm enough her left cheek was inflamed as if she had been hit but she seemed to be trying to reassure him with the look in her eyes that all was well and that now he was here they had a chance to work together and get out alive she was quick banks knew that and he also felt that a certain intuitive bond had quickly been forged between them if there was an opportunity he thought then they could probably do something about it between them it was just a matter of waiting to see who took the initiative micks moods were shifting minute by minute one moment hed be joking the next hed become morose and say he had nothing to lose and all that pacing and jittering was driving banks crazy tosca still played in the background well into the second act and the cassette box lay on a pine table by the broken window all right mick banks said quietly what is it you want what do you think mick sneered i want out of here he swaggered over to the window and shouted i want ten thousand quid and safe passage out of the country or the girl and the cop die got it outside in the cold evening gristhorpe whispered to hatchley not a snowball in hells chance and said back to mick all right well work on it stay in communication and well let you know i dont want to talk to you fuckers mick yelled back i know you and all your games just get me what i asked for and fuck off out of the way he kept the gun pointed at jenny hurry up get back in those trees where i cant see you or ill kill the girl now reluctantly gristhorpe hatchley and the two uniformed men moved back across the road onto the green thats right mick shouted at them and fucking well stay there till youve got something to tell me banks stood as close to mick and jenny as he dared mick he said theyre not going to do it you dont stand a chance theyll do it mick said they dont want to see your brains splattered all over the garden or hers they cant do it mick banks went on patiently they cant give in to demands like that if they did then every tom dick and harry would start taking hostages and asking for the world mick laughed maybe ill start a trend then eh theyll do it and youd better hope they do both of you the music went on quietly and the cool night air came in through the broken window outside banks could hear talking on a car radio they would already have the street cordonned off and should have evacuated the neighbors mick licked his lips and looked from one to the other of them well he said what shall we do when the transport comes and his eyes stayed on jenny who stood by the tile fireplace banks stuck close to the table by the window dont make things worse mick banks said if you give up now itll be taken into consideration things wouldnt go too badly for you but if you go any further you know as well as i do mick said turning to banks that im in about as deep as can be thats not true mick theres a way out of this and whats going to happen to me then i cant make any promises mick you know that but itll go in your favor yeah itll go in my fucking favor ill only get twenty years instead of twentyfive is that what youre telling me youll get a lot more if you hurt anyone mick no ones been hurt yet remember that mick turned to jenny this is what were gonna do he said when they fix up my transport youre coming with me and hes staying hell know if he lets his copper mates do anything to stop us youll be dead they might not think i mean it but he does no jenny said what do you mean no you cunt what the fuck do you think this is in my hand a fucking capgun jenny shook her head im not going anywhere with you im not going to let you lay one dirty finger on me mick reddened and looked to banks dangerously near the end of his tether but jenny was the psychologist and she seemed to have taken the initiative it was up to banks to follow while mick glared at jenny banks picked up the cassette box from the table and tossed it out through the broken window there was a sudden clattering sound on the path and mick turned to aim the gun toward the noise banks was close enough to jump him when the gun was pointing out of the window but before banks could make his move mick actually fired into the garden the gun made a dull explosion and they both heard mick scream slowly he turned back toward the room his face white mouth and eyes wide open with shock and pain the blood from his hand dripped onto the clean pine table chapter sixteen i as soon as hatchley and gristhorpe heard the shot and the scream they dashed out of the trees toward the house inside jenny rushed to help banks who had already ripped off micks shirtsleeve to apply as a tourniquet its a mess he said tying the knot then he caught jennys eye you did well he told her but for a minute i thought you were going to push him too far me too the idea was just to confuse him then attract his attention the kid was so stoned he didnt know what was happening im glad you caught the signal when banks heard the others reach the steps he walked over to the window to tell them it was all clear inside the house after that it was chaosseveral people asking different questions at the same time orders being given to uniformed men phone calls being made for the ambulance and sceneofcrime squadand throughout it all nobody thought to turn off the stereo tosca was still singing nellora del dolore perche perchi signor perche me ne rimuneri cosi a still point for a moment at the center of all the frenetic activity banks took in the familiar words in this my hour of grief and tribulation why heavenly father why hast thou forsaken me good work alan gristhorpe said snapping banks out of the music all right fine you look a bit pale i always do when ive been in close contact with guns gristhorpe looked down at mick if all guns reacted the way that one did alan it might be a better world im not a religious man as you knowtoo much of that pernicious yorkshire methodism in my background but maybe sometimes god is there when we need him banks looked over at jenny who was telling a constable what had happened she was certainly there he went onto explain about sandra and asked permission to go home and skip the formalities until later of course gristhorpe said you should have told me earlier are you sure she sounded all right a bit shook up but in control richmond s still with her off you go then gristhorpe said giving banks a gentle push in the small of the back it was time to face sandra as he walked to the door he saw jenny neglected now slumped on the sofa with her face in her hands he looked around the room againthe cold night air coming in through the broken window the blood on the table the shards of glass on the floor jenny he called softly holding out his hand come with me she did as she was asked and on the way home banks told her about sandras ordeal do you think itll be all right she asked you know me coming with you to tell you the truth jenny i dont know what to expect i couldnt leave you there though dont worry the superintendent will see that everythings taken care of jenny shivered i dont think i could have stayed there id have gone to a hotel i still can i shouldnt come with you dont be silly banks drove on in silence finally they arrived at the house and hurried up the path sandra flung open the door banks winced as she ran toward him but she threw her arms around him alan alan thank god youre all right she sobbed burying her face in his shoulder he stroked her hair im all right dont worry lets go inside i could do with a drink richmond stood up as they entered the living room the young dc stroked his mustache and cleared his throat banks suddenly remembered that it was richmond he had seen that night in the oak jenny had been with him then and they must have seemed very close god only knew what he was thinking there i told you richmond said to sandra i told you hed be all right he turned to banks and gave him a nod as if to signify that all was well the two of them walked together to the door ive taken your wifes statement sir its all very clear what happened hes the peeper no doubt about it how is he dont know yet sir it didnt look serious to me they took him to the hospital about half an hour ago will that be all sir banks could tell that richmond was anxious to leave that being involved with his inspector in such a personal way was exceedingly uncomfortable for him yes he said you can go now and detective richmond yes sir thanks richmond blushed and muttered something about it being nothing before he took off at a fair pace down the path banks closed the door and noticed jenny and sandra looking at each other he knew that sandra would be embarrassed at showing so much emotion in front of a stranger im sorry he apologized wearily running his hand over his closecropped hair i didnt introduce you did i after the introduction sandra offered jenny a chair banks went straight to the drinks cabinet something a bit stronger than tea i think scotch all round yes please the two women nodded it was hard to know what to do to break the ice banks realized as he poured them all generous measures of macallan single malt jenny could hardly say to sandra i heard you had a terrible ordeal tonight dear nor could sandra answer oh yes absolutely dreadful i thought i was going to be raped then murdered you didnt have such an easy time yourself i hear so they sipped scotch and said nothing for a while and banks smoked a muchneeded cigarette look if youd rather i went jenny said im feeling much better now nonsense sandra told her you cant go back there youre staying here with us ill make up the spare bed oh alan its nearly time to pick the children up from the meetings shall i go no banks said putting his hand on her shoulder youve had enough for tonight let me go its only down the road youll tell them ill tell them that we had a breakin and you caught a burglar youll be a real heroine in their eyes then itll be in the papers wont it later probably well cross that bridge when we get there will you two be all right of course we will sandra said smiling at jenny were a couple of heroes didnt you just say so i thought it was heroines sandra shook her head somehow heroines doesnt have the right ring to it i think heroines are always victims theyre pale and wan and they make a lot of noise more scotch jenny banks walked to the car on the way back from the church hall he told brian and tracy that they had a guest for the evening and that they were to behave themselves and go to bed as soon as theyd had their cocoa there seemed no point in even mentioning what had happened back at the house they interrupted sandra and jenny deep in conversation and brian and tracy were bursting with comments about their evening brian announced that he was sick to death of the lifeboys and he was never going again banks helped get them ready for bed took them upstairs and tucked them in then yawning he walked back downstairs i have to go in he said theres a few loose ends to tie up sandra nodded it was nothing new to her ill probably be late he added so dont wait up it was confusing saying goodbye to the two of them he bent and kissed sandras cheek then nodded at jenny and hurried out even though hed got his priorities sorted out there was something disturbing about being with both women at once it was extremely disconcerting and the more banks analyzed the feeling as he walkedwalkmanless but grateful to be breathing the cool night airthe more he decided that it wasnt sexual it had nothing at all to do with the beauty and desirability of both women but everything to do with his sensing a strong bond between them that put him on the outside they didnt even have to talk to make it clear banks had felt as if he were a clumsy primitive beast in the presence of two alien creatures ii the station was humming with activity already those on duty in plain clothes had been recalled from the pubs and were clustering around the duty roster trying to decide who should go home and who should stay and downstairs the phone kept ringing residents of the east side estate were still calling to report the gunshot upstairs things were quieter the sharps had been taken to an interview room and gristhorpes door was open as soon as banks rounded the corner the superintendent popped his head out and invited him in one shaded table lamp provided the only illumination and the bookcases and deep leather chairs gleamed in its dim light the only thing banks needed was another cigarette as if reading his mind gristhorpe took a queens arms ashtray out of his bottom drawer and pushed it over to him just this once alan i can see you need it though god knows why a person would crave something thats a proven carcinogen theres none worse than exsmokers banks joked everybody knew that gristhorpes antismoking campaign was of fairly recent origin how are things alan pretty good considering its nice to be able to relax for a moment i havent really managed to bring my mind to bear on what happened yet plenty of time write it down in the morning sandras well yes shes either tougher than i thought or shes a good actress i think shes just got hidden depths alan strong reserves youd be surprised how many have my wife god bless her was the mildest gentlest woman on the face of the earth talk about frailyoud think shed faint at a cuss word but she was a nurse in the war just like alice matlock and she saw more than one member of her family from this world to the next but she never once flinched or complained even when the cancer got hold of her course she was a yorkshire woman banks smiled of course many a copper would have run straight to his wife alan you did the right thing you weighed up both situations and decided where you could do the most good it didnt seem as logical a process as that when it comes down to it there was only one place where i had to be i know that and so do you but a lesser man might have let emotion confuse the issue there were times when i thought i had whats happened to robin allott mild concussion hell be all right still at the hospital if that camera had been out of its leather case and if sandra had hit him on the temple or the base of the skull he might have been dead it was an old one metal body instead of that plastic they use nowadays the young fellow was very lucky indeed sandra too no blame would have been attached to her but imagine how shed feel even so aye gristhorpe said rubbing his prickly chin has he said anything not a dicky bird yet still too dazed i dont think hell hold back on us though sandra made a very clear statement his bushy brows knitted in a deep frown she went through a lot you know i know at least i think i do i dont know all the details yet one of the uniformed constables knocked softly at the halfopen door before delivering a tray of coffee and biscuits theyre from downstairs the biscuits sir he said we keep a few packets in club together like thought you might appreciate some thank you constable craig gristhorpe said much appreciated you on late duty tonight yes sir me and susan gay there was something in the constables clipped tone that prompted gristhorpe to ask if anything was wrong well sir craig said i dont mean to complain but every time were on duty together and something like this comes upmaking coffee or delivering biscuits she always manages to push me into doing it his face reddened its that blooming womens lib is what it is sir gristhorpe laughed its what we call positive discrimination lad and youll just have to get used to it stick up for yourself and i hope this coffees a bit better than the usual muck we get around here it should be sir craig said proudly a satisfied customer presented us with one of those automatic dripfilter things earlier this evening sir i went across to that fancy tea and coffee shop on king street and got some freshground colombian beans the superintendent turned his baby blue eyes on craig did you now not only accepting gifts from the public but playing truant eh yes sir sorry sir craig replied standing stiffly at attention its all right gristhorpe said only joking lad wherever it came from its most welcome the chief inspectoral be able to drink it black off you go lad the coffee was good the best theyd tasted in a long time and banks had a fondness for mcvities chocolate digestives gristhorpe was on yet another diet though and refused to give in to his sweet tooth hows mick webster banks asked hell live lost a lot of blood but that tourniquet of yours did the trick his hand lost two fingers and the doc says he might lose another if surgery doesnt go well have you any idea where he got the gun from no the first i heard of webster was from trevor sharp earlier tonight i think we should get a warrant and search his place its already being done thats where richmond and hatchley are now if i were you alan id go home take care of my wife and get some sleep i want to talk to sharp itll wait alan no i can do it i started it and id hate to have to begin all over again gristhorpe tapped a pencil on his blotter youve got a point i suppose we dont want him fresh again after a nights sleep does he know about webster no good sure youre up to it yes i wouldnt get any sleep for thinking about it anyway gristhorpe pointed toward the corridor interview room number three i think sergeant rowes still with them hell be worn out by now iii banks took his second cup of black coffee into the small interview room graham sharp jumped to his feet you cant keep us here like this he said weve been cooped up here for hours its not a police state yet you know banks sat down and spoke to sergeant rowe you can go now sergeant could you send someone in to take notes constable craig will do he didnt speak until craig arrived then he lit a cigarette and took a long pull on his coffee right he said looking at trevor weve got your mate webster and hes told us all about your little capers youre lying trevor said you must think im stupid to fall for that one what one the one where the cops tell a suspect his accomplice has confessed and expect him to break down ive seen it on telly accomplice accomplice in what its just a word yes i knw but words mean things whats more they imply things too accomplice implies that you worked together in committing a crime i told you its just a word stop beating around the bush graham sharp said if we have to stay until youve finished at least get on with it its true banks said to trevor and noticed that the boy had started to chew his bottom lip he told us all about the breakinsfirst the old ladies then the ottershaws and thelma pitt he told us how he tried to stop you from raping her but you were like a mad dog those were his words mad dog hes a liar trevor said what do you mean trevor that you werent like a mad dog i didnt rape anybody why would he lie we found thelma pitts jewelry in his house and some bits and pieces from the other robberies banks knew he was treading on very shaky ground by lying in the hope of getting a confession but he kept his fingers crossed and trusted that richmond and hatchley would turn up something why would he lie trevor its all up for him and he knows it hes trying to put the blame on someone else thats all but there were two of you we know that a gangly one and a squat one the gangly one had decay between his front teeth and caught the clap from thelma pitt the squat one had piggy eyes and a raspy voice youve got to admit that fits mick to a tee and your father told us about mick remember he said mick webster was to blame if youd done anything wrong now mick says youre both to blame what am i supposed to believe believe what you want i dont care but you should trevor your father does he cares enough to lie for you now just a minute be quiet mr sharp you lied for your son and you know damn well you did well trevor well what why dont you admit it that way we can say you helped us and itll go easier for you in court if we have to prove a case we can but itll be more trouble for all of us admit what the truth ive told you not the truth not like mick did he was on drugs you know remember what he gets like you cant trust him at all when hes on drugs and you cant believe him either i do a jury will how about it trevor what tell me what you did i didnt do nothing alice matlock he never killed anyone graham sharp protested how do you know hes lied to you about everything else sharp looked at his son who turned to face the wall he didnt i just know he couldnt hes not capable of it it didnt take much strength you know banks said probably an accident youll never prove it graham said banks shrugged what do you think trevor did mick tell you that tell me what that we killed the old bag down the street what if he did then youre lying trevor said gripping the table edge and rising from his chair youre bloody lying we didnt kill nobody we didnt have nothing to do with alice matlock if you say he told you that then youre a fucking liar im right about the rest though arent i you made it all up you dont even have mick im not saying another word in the silence that followed pc craig answered the gentle tapping on the door and whispered to banks who left the room in the corridor stood hatchley and richmond both looking pleased as punch dont just stand there like the cats that got the cream banks said what did you find we got back the ottershaw and pitt jewelry and one or two other trinkets prints vic manson says so on the camera and a large brooch banks breathed a sigh of relief and hatchley added weve got a damn good idea who the fence is go on there was a snapshot in one of the drawers not a good one a bit blurred but as far as i could tell it matched the sketch we got from leeds hatchley explained and there was a letter from london from a chap called lenny apparently hes websters brother does he have a record hatchley shook his head not up here not as far as we know spends most of his time down in the smoke ill check with records do that have you got an address yes excellent perhaps youd better take your findings to superintendent gristhorpe hell get in touch with london cid and have lenny webster picked up then well see what we shall see banks yawned sorry lads afraid im tired go on up the supers still in his office yes sir richmond said heading for the stairs hatchley hung back for a moment shifting awkwardly something else sergeant banks asked his hand on the door handle its just what you did tonight sir i just wanted to say i admired you for it it was a brave thing to do i dont reckon im no softie myself but ive never been stuck up with a gun the very thought of it gives me the bloody collywobbles lets hope you never will be banks said it happens a lot less often up here than down south i know hatchley agreed i never thought id see the day when i was glad we had a southerner on the eastvale force that final disclosure seemed too much for hatchleys tightlipped nature and he rushed off banks thought before he went too far and his boss could accuse him of sentimentality smiling banks returned to the interview room graham sharp was pale and trevor wore his customary scowl though the father might never admit it banks knew that he now thought trevor was guilty the boys reactions had convinced him just as they had confirmed beyond any doubt two things banks already believed that they had definitely not killed alice matlock and that they had done everything else when banks sat down and lit a cigarette trevor began to look apprehensive sipping tepid coffee banks let the silence stretch until both father and son were clearly as tense and anxious as he wanted them to be then he turned to pc craig and pointed at trevor hold him constable suspicion of burglary assault and rape will do for a start ive had quite enough of his company for the time being get him fingerprinted immediately graham sharp tried to block his way as he left the room but banks pushed him gently aside the constable here will explain your sons rights he said it was late well after midnight and the town outside was dark and quiet only the bell of the church clock broke the silence every fifteen minutes back in his office banks looked out through the slats of his venetian blinds there wasnt a soul in sight all the lights were out except for the oldstyle gas lamps around the market square and a shop window to the right across market street in which elegant mannequins modelled the kind of long expensive dresses that grace kelly wore in rear window banks lit another cigarette and drank some more hot coffee then turned to the first buff folder on his desk it was sandras statement not much of her personality came through in richmond s precise analytical prose nor did any of her feelings banks could only imagine them and he found himself doing so only too well as he read of her being forced back toward the screen at knifepoint and made to strip to what point an obviously embarrassed richmond had asked to her skin tears burned his eyes and anger seethed in his veins he closed the folder and slammed it with his fist at least from what sandra had remembered of robin allotts wordsand she had done well to remember so muchit sounded as if he was their man it also sounded as if he had broken down at the end that he couldnt go through with it banks recalled jenny once saying that the man might have to keep going further and further to satisfy himself but that he might also reach breaking point before doing any serious damage whether he had done any serious damage or not was a moot point it had been a long day banks yawned and felt his eyelids suddenly become heavy and scratchy it was time to go home he pulled up his coat collar and stepped out into market street the chill october air was invigorating but banks felt tired beyond revival all the way home something nagged at his mind something about the sharp interview trevors reaction to the alice matlock business certainly confirmed his earlier suspicions but that wasnt it there was something else it was no good trying to think though he decided it would have to wait until tomorrow iv jenny and sandra were still talking when banks walked in the front door they were drinking cocoa laced with scotch and sandra had lent jenny one of her old dressinggowns to wear i thought youd be in bed by now banks said hanging up his overcoat we didnt feel like sleeping sandra replied but now you mention it i do feel tired me too jenny echoed ive made up the bed sandra told her i hope its comfortable enough for you i could sleep on a slab of stone jenny smiled and stood up good night you two and thanks very much she went upstairs and banks flopped down on the sofa beside sandra again he had noticed a strange atmosphere between them as if they were in a world that excluded him but he was too tired to delve into it about ten minutes later they followed jenny up and slipped between the sheets what were you talking about he asked as they snuggled close oh this and that me a bit mostly what it felt like what did it feel like youll never know you could try and describe it for me i dont want to go through it all again tonight alan some other time maybe it felt something like being held up at gunpoint maybe it did ill tell you something though its very odd i was terrified and i hated him but afterwards i felt sorry for him he was like a little child when i hit him alan he was down on his knees hed dropped his knife and he was like a child i couldnt handle the feelings at the time i was scared angry hurt and i hit him i wanted to kill him i really did but it was pathetic he was like a child crying out for his mother you did the right thing banks said holding her and feeling her warm tears on his shoulder i know but thats what i mean when i said youd never understand you never could there are some things men could never grasp in a million years banks felt shut out again and it irked him that sandra was probably right he wanted to understand everything and he had sympathy feelings and imagination enough to do so or so he had thought now sandra was telling him that no matter how hard he tried he could never fathom the bond that united her and jenny and excluded him simply because he was a man they had both been victims and he was a member of the sex that had the power to humiliate them in a way it didnt matter how gentle and understanding he was he was guilty by association but perhaps he thought as he drifted into sleep it was neither as important nor as devastating as it seemed at that moment after all he was tired out and the evenings events had left their unassimilated residue in him too he was simply recognizing a chasm that had always existed even before sandra had been so abused that unbridgeable gap had not interfered seriously with their happiness and closeness before and it probably wouldnt do so in the future the human spirit was a great deal more resilient than one imagined in ones darker moments still the distance between them was more apparent now than ever and it would have to be dealt with he would have to make attempts to cross it he held sandra tighter and told her he loved her but she was already asleep sighing he turned over and fell into his own dreamless darkness chapter seventeen i when banks met robin allott the next morning he could see exactly what sandra meant he had expected to hate the man but robin looking rather like a tonsured monk with the dressing fixed over the shaved center of his skull was pathetic banks found it easy to detach himself and deal with him as he would with any other criminal richmond sat in the corner taking notes what did the hospital say he asked allott shrugged and avoided looking banks in the eye not very much they dressed the wound and sent me away with this he held up a card which explained how to handle patients with head wounds i spent the rest of the night in your cells want to talk allott nodded the first thing he did was apologize then he confessed to all the reported peeping incidents in addition to several more that had gone either unnoticed or unreported by the victims there was however another important matter to discuss the timing of allotts peeping on carol ellis coincided almost exactly with alice matlocks late evening visitor who if he wasnt her killer was the last person to see her alive banks asked him if he had seen anyone as he ran along cardigan drive yes allott said eagerly i liked alice ive been wanting to tell you but i couldnt find a way without its been torturing me ever since at first i thought he would have reported me then when he didnt im so glad its all over i tried to suggest it might not have been kids that it might have happened some other way when you came to talk to me i remember banks said but you didnt express the theory very forcefully how could i i was scared for myself who did you see it wasnt anyone i knew but it was a man in his late thirties or early forties id say medium height slim he had light brown hair combed back with a parting on the left what was he wearing a beige overcoat i think i remember it was a chilly night and gloves fawn gloves did you see where he came from no he was by the end of alice s house when i ran by on the other side of the street you know the end of the block that runs at right angles to cardigan drive gallows view so he was actually on cardigan drive walking by the end house of gallows view yes just across the street from me and you got a good look at him good enough theres a streetlamp only yards from the junction would you recognize him again yes are you sure definitely jenny had asked if she could talk to allott and banks had agreed stipulating that he be present throughout the interview when he had finished with his questions he asked richmond to call in at the interview room where she was waiting and send her along there was still something nagging at his mind though it often worked wonders on halfformed ideas sleep had failed to solve the problem this time it was like having the right word on the tip of his tongue but being unable to utter it jenny seemed to be making a deliberate effort to hide her beauty by wearing some very unflattering horn rimmed glasses and drab baggy clothes that made her figure seem shapeless she also wore her hair tied back in a severe bun robin allott looked up when she walked in stiffly with a file folder under her arm and a pencil behind her ear she sat down opposite him opened the folder and only then banks noticed did she look him in the eye would you like to tell me when you started watching women undress she asked first in a businesslike tone now banks thought its my turn to watch the professional at work allott looked away at the autumn scene on the calendar it was after my wife left me i couldnt she wasnt happy she put up with me for a long time but finally she couldnt stand it any longer we hadnt had a proper life together a real marriage you know what i mean why was that i dont know i didnt like to touch her i couldnt be a man for her i just wasnt interested it wasnt her fault she was a good woman really she put up with a great deal what did she think she once told me she thought i was a latent homosexual but i knew that was wrong i never had any feelings like that for men the whole idea repelled me i never had any real feelings at all what do you mean you didnt have any real feelings you know the things people are supposed to feel and do everything normal and carefree like talking and kissing and loving i felt like there was a big wall between me and the rest of the world especially my wife so she left you and then you started watching women get undressed why did you do that it was what i wanted to do all i wanted to do really there was nothing else that gave me such a thrill i know it was wrong but i couldnt i tried to stop can you think of any reason why you chose to do that particular thing why only that could satisfy you allott hesitated and bit his lip yes he said after a few moments i did it beforea long time ago when i was a boyand i couldnt get it out of my mind what happened he took a deep breath and his gaze turned inward we lived on a narrow street with a pub on the cornerthe barley mow it was calledand lots of times when i was supposed to be asleep in my room id see this woman opposite walk back from the pub alone go upstairs and undress for bed she always left the curtains open and i watched her she was a beautiful woman and nobody in the neighborhood really knew her she never spoke to anyone and people tended to keep away from her as if she was cold or above them somehow people said she was foreign a refugee from eastern europe but nobody really knew she was always alone she was a mystery but i could watch her unveil herself at first it didnt feel like much but i suppose it was just about that time of life when you change and over a few weeks i had strange feelings watching her feelings id never had before they scared me but they were exciting i suppose i started to to play with myself unconsciously and i remember thinking what if she sees me what will she do til be in trouble then but in a way i wanted her to see me too i wanted her to know about me he leaned forward on his chair and his liquid brown eyes began to shine as he talked did she ever see you no one day she was just gone simple as that i was devastated id thought it would go on forever that she was doing it just for me when she left it felt as if my whole life had been smashed in pieces oh i did all the usual things like the other boys but it always felt like there was something missingit was never as wonderful as the others made out it was as i thought it should be even girls real girls why did you marry it was the normal thing to do my mother helped me arranged introductions that kind of thing it just didnt work though i was always thinking of this woman even i could only do it if i thought of her when my wife left something snapped in me it was like a sort of fog came over my mind but at the same time i felt free i felt like i could do what i wanted i didnt have to pretend anymore oh i could always be with other people easily enoughi had the camera club and all but it was all inside the mist i felt i had to find her again recapture what id lost and did you no what was she like beautiful slender and beautiful and she had black eyebrows and long goldenblond hair that excited me i dont know why maybe it was the contrast long straight blond hair down over her shoulders she looked like sandra thats why i wouldnt have hurt her never and when it had gone so far i just couldnt go through with it he glanced over at banks who lit a cigarette and looked out of the window on the bustle of the market square what did you have in mind nothing clear i wanted to touch her make love to her i suppose but i couldnt please believe me i wouldnt have hurt her honestly but you did hurt her he hung his head i know id like to tell her say im sorry i dont think she wants to see you you frightened her a great deal i didnt mean to it seemed like the only way im not here to judge you jenny said whats going to happen to me you need help well try to help you you not me but somebody qualified robin gave a resigned nod i didnt mean to scare her i would never have harmed a hair on her head youve got to believe me i thought it was the only way i had to find out what it felt like to touch her to have her in my power but i couldnt do anything i couldnt jenny and banks left him with a uniformed constable and walked out into the corridor jenny leaned against the institutionalgreen wall and took a deep breath then she removed her glasses and loosened her hair well banks asked i think hes harmless she said you heard him insist that he wouldnt have hurt sandra i believe him but he did hurt her i told him that and i think he understood he meant physically what more can i say alan hes suffering part of me hates him for what he did but another partthe professional bit i supposeunderstands in a way that its not his fault that he needs help not punishment banks nodded coffee oh yes please they walked across market street to the golden grill you still seem a bit preoccupied alan jenny said sipping her coffee is there something else i thought youd caught enough criminals for one night lack of sleep i suppose that all probably not theres something bothering me but im not quite sure what it is you know we havent got alice matlocks killer yet yes allott gave us a description its definitely not the kids so i feel that i ought to know who it is and why like its staring me in the face and i just cant bring it into focus is there some clue you cant think of no its nothing like that its a whole jumble of impressions not to worry another nights sleep might do it maybe ill even try an afternoon nap and hurry it along so its not all over not yet and our intrepid chief inspector wont rest until it is banks smiled something like that ill tell you one thing though when i moved up to yorkshire i sure as hell expected a softer time of it than this ii back at the station an excited sergeant hatchley came rushing to meet banks weve got him who lenny webster the fence micks brother banks grinned so london came through then didnt they just paid him a visit in the middle of the night at that address we got from the letter yes and sure enough he was there babysitting an assortment of drugsmarijuana cocaine uppers downers even some heroin enough to put him away for a while enough to put him away for a long while sir ill bet he was intending to bring it all back up here to sell am i right exactly and theres more go on it seems that young lennys not as tough as he makes out if you know what i mean in fact a little heavy leaning and he breaks down completely first off theyve got the bloke who gave him the gun and they found three more at his placenot duff ones mind you and next lenny sings all about his plans with micklethwaite moxton pardon thats his real name moxton larry moxton oh well webster knows him as micklethwaite and they were going to unload the stuff between them also micklethwaite put him onto the ottershaw and pitt jobs right wed better bring larry in then hadnt we do you think weve got enough to nail him i think so if we add it to what thelma pitt and ottershaw have to tell us what puzzles me is how a con man like larry could get mixed up with a lowlife thug like webster thats explained in the telex hatchley said apparently its through the chap who was getting the drugs for them hed served time with micklethwaite and when he heard he was going to relocate up north he put him in touch with lenny ah the oldboy network right little den of thieves weve caught havent we hatchley beamed his red balloonface glowing with success aye we have that sir oh i almost forgot theres a woman waiting in your office for you not no not that wycombe woman ive never seen this one before wouldnt say who she was wants to see you though curious banks poked his head around the office door it was mrs allott robins mother whats all this nonsense about my son robin she asked puffing herself up banks took a deep breath and sat down it was the last thing he needed another irate parent your son has been charged on several counts of voyeurism mrs allott and on one count of attempted rape he threatened a woman at knifepoint that woman happened to be my wife mrs allotts tone altered not a jot always look after your own you coppers do well youve got the wrong man this time my robin wouldnt hurt a fly perhaps not banks conceded but hes behaved very badly toward women who saw him then how many witnesses have you got we dont need witnesses mrs allott your son gave us a full confession well you must have sweated it out of him you must have got the rubber hose out banks got to his feet mrs allott its a cutanddried case theres nothing more to be said about it if youll excuse me ive got work to do he was with me she persisted all those times you say he was snooping on women he was with me ive looked after him ever since that bitch of a wife ran off and left him the nogood hussy i warned him about her i did told him shed only bring trouble why dont you give a list of the dates and times your son was with you to the desk sergeant then well see if we can match them with the incidents i have to repeat though its no use your son has already confessed under duress im sure he cant have done those things you say he did i can assure you thathe did do them then that wife of his drove him to it make up your mind mrs allott how could he be driven to do things you said he didnt do he was with me she repeated firmly banks couldnt be bothered to tell her that in addition to her sons confession he also had sandras statement it was futile robins innocence was fixed in her mind and that was that no amount of reason would change her opinion she would even lie on the witness stand to save him look banks said in as kind a tone as he could manage i really do have a lot of work to do if youd care to give the dates to the sergeant at the front desk im not going to be softsoaped like that youre not going to fob me off with some menial i demand my rights she was clinging as tight as a limpet and banks was nearing the end of his tether brusquely he picked up a clean sheet of paper and took out his pen all right then the dates i cant remember the exact dates what do you think i am a computer hes always at home you know youve seen him there he helps me take care of his dad i saw him there once mrs allott and he was expecting me are you telling me hes at home every night yes including tuesdays she thought for a moment a wary expression flickering over her pinched face tuesdays he goes to the camera club on tuesdays with his friends any of them will tell you what a good boy he is banks could think of one who certainly wouldnt but he said nothing in fact mrs allotts presence began to recede far into the distance as the subject of his recent brooding came slowly into focus she had given him an idea it still wasnt fully formed yet and he wasnt sure what to do about it but the lens was definitely closing in he forced his attention reluctantly back to the business at hand so what youre telling me mrs allott is that every night of the week except tuesdays robin was with you from the moment he left work till the moment he went again the next morning thats right he never went out no all right banks said losing interest in her lies again as his idea came into sharper focus ill get somebody to take your statement mrs allott you can go home now she got to her feet and flapped out of the office almost as soon as she had slammed the door banks forgot her he reached for a cigarette asked craig to send up some of the special new coffee and slouched deep in his chair to think one hour three cigarettes and two cups of black coffee later he knew what had been bothering him and what to do about it he snatched up the phone and dialled the front desk put sergeant hatchley on he snapped he knew that hatchley had a habit of chatting with rowe sir hatchley answered sergeant i want you to go to sharps place and ask graham sharp to drop by and see me right away tell him its to do with his sons statement and its urgent got that yes sir and dont take no for an answer sergeant if he grumbles about locking up the shop and losing business remind him what a difficult position young trevors in right hatchley answered im on my way sir iii trevor sharps been bound over to the youth authorities richmond was saying do you want me to get him over here no banks answered it doesnt matter hows webster the last i heard sir hes in fair shape the surgeon managed to save that finger have you seen my report no i havent its been a busy morning no time for reading give me a summary it was just to tell you that vic manson got some good prints from the jewelry sir it seems the lads must have handled it at home after the burglaries when they felt safe and and both sharps and websters prints showed up sir weve got the buggers then looks like it sir websters been doing a bit of talking too that shock to his system has shaken his ideas around no end the doc wont let us talk to him for long yet but hes already told us it was him and sharp did the jobs good work banks said could you bring in allott for me please the peeper sir yes robin allott bring him up very well sir im afraid his mothers still downstairs on the bench refuses to leave until she sees the superintendent banks scratched his chin it was itchy because he hadnt shaved that morning i wouldnt wish her on him he said try and get rid of her and whatever you do make sure she doesnt see her son coming up ill do my best sir a few moments later robin allott was escorted into bankss office and told to make himself comfortable allott still couldnt meet the inspectors eyes and banks almost felt like telling him to stop dwelling on it that it was all over and done with but he didnt why let the bastard off the hook after what hed done to sandra if she hadnt already known allott banks thought there wouldnt have been any pity in her feelings toward him about fifteen minutes later there was a knock at the door banks opened it to sergeant hatchley with an anxious graham sharp in tow what is it inspector sharp demanded angrily as he charged across the threshold your sergeant told me it and he froze as the newcomer entered the room robin allott had turned to see what the commotion was and his jaw dropped in immediate recognition thats him he said pointing at sharp thats the man i saw graham sharp looked at him then at banks his face drained of color and he reached out to support himself on the edge of the flimsy desk banks gestured to a confused hatchley to stay and to pull up a chair for him like to tell me about it mr sharp he asked what made you think of me somebody else in your position what do you mean banks looked at robin then back at sharp his mother came in and swore blind he was with her when he had already admitted to being the peeper i just got to thinking about the lengths some people would go to protect their families after a while it all seemed to fit your son insisted that he and webster had nothing to do with alice matlocks death and that was the only thing i believed from him id already suspected that it was a different kind of crime there was no senseless damage to alice s sentimental possessions as there had been in the other cases and she was the first victim to die the problem then was who on earth would want to kill a harmless old woman and why robins mother gave me the answer i remembered how protective you had been about trevor ready to perjure yourself and swear blind to false alibis it didnt take much stretching of the imagination to figure out that you might go a lot further to protect your illusion of him the simple fact is mr sharp that your sons a callous vicious bastard but to you hes a bright lad with a promising future you would do anything to protect that future am i right sharp nodded i dont know all the details banks went on but i think that alice matlock found out something about your son maybe she saw him leaving the scene of a breakin saw him with some stolen goods or noticed him hiding his balaclava she wasnt a very sociable person but everybody knew about the other women whod been robbed am i still right sharp sighed and accepted a cigarette with a trembling hand he seemed on the verge of a nervous collapse are you all right banks asked yes inspector its just the relief youve no idea what a burden this has been for me i dont think i could have stood it much longer pushing it to the back of my mind pretending it never really happened it was an accident you know do you mean you would have come forward eventually possibly i cant say i know how far id go to protect my son but not how far id go to save myself tell me about it yes alice matlock told me that she had heard trevor bragging about the robberies with another boy one evening when she was walking home from a friends house she came into my shop that monday just before closing and told me about it said she was going to report him to the police the next day she had no proof no evidence and at first it didnt bother me much because i thought nobody would take any notice of an old woman but then i got to worrying about what damage it might do what questions we might have to answer i couldnt believe trevor was guilty even though i knew there was something wrong maybe i did know it deep down i cant say but i wanted to protect him is that so unusual in a father i thought that whatever it was it was just a phase he would pass through i didnt want his life ruined because of a few foolish juvenile exploits if youd come forward with your suspicions a long time ago banks remarked you would have saved everybody including your son a lot of grief especially thelma pitt sharp shook his head i still cant believe my trevor did that take my word for it mr sharp he did thats just the point sharp flicked the ash off his cigarette and looked at the floor what happened banks asked i went to talk to her that night just talk to her i knocked on the door and she answered it im not really sure that she recognized me she seemed to think i was someone else i told her what a good future trevor had and what a crime it would be to spoil it for him i was desperate inspector i even pleaded with her but it was no good what did she say nothing that made much sense to me she said there was no point coming back and pretending to be him i wasnt him i was an evil imposter and she was going to the police i couldnt talk any sense into her and when she started going on about calling the police i lost my temper and reached for her i didnt intend to kill her honestly but she was so frail ive got a terrible temper always have had i couldnt help myself she fell backwards i tried to reach out to stop her but it all seemed to happen in slow motion like one of them dreams when you cant run fast enough i heard the sound her skull cracking on the edge of the table and the blood on the flags i sharp put his head in his hands and sobbed what happened next banks asked after giving him a couple of minutes to pull himself together i messed the place up a bit as if id been a burglar and i took some thingssome money a set of silver cutlery youll find it all buried on the edge of gallows field i didnt touch a penny of the money honest i didnt you didnt think to call an ambulance i was scared there would have been questions we didnt find any fingerprints mr sharp were you wearing gloves yes that would explain the muffled knocking hatchley interrupted looking up from his note taking that rigby woman said the knocking sounded muffled distant like it could have been a long way away banks nodded why were you wearing gloves mr sharp it was a cold night ive got bad circulation but you didnt have very far to go no i suppose not and you didnt take them off when you got inside i never thought things just started happening too fast dont you believe me are you suggesting i intended to kill the woman thats for the court to decide banks said im just gathering the evidence did you see mr allott yes on my way in he looked like he was running away from something himself i didnt think he got a really good look at me still i was a bit worried for a few days but then i realized that whoever he was he hadnt come forward perhaps he hadnt heard of the old womans death or maybe he had his own secret to hide i dont know did you have any idea why alice matlock didnt seem to recognize you but let you in anyway graham shrugged i cant say i gave it much thought she was old i suppose she did ramble a bit sometimes close banks said she probably couldnt even remember what day she overheard webster and your son you see the irony of it is mr sharp that by the morning she would most likely have forgotten all about the incident anyway and you were quite right to think that nobody would believe a woman who was beginning to live more in the past than the present you killed her for nothing iv there wasnt much left to do statements had to be written up and filed charges laid hearing dates fixed but as far as banks was concerned the real job was finished the rest was up to the courts and the twelve jurors good and true he believed that sharp had killed alice matlock by accident that he was basically a good man driven too far but so many criminals were good men gone wrong it sometimes seemed a pity or at least an inconvenience that society seemed to have discarded the concept of evil something which in bankss mind would always separate trevor sharp from his father as he had no other pressing business he decided to go home early and spend some time with sandra he would see jenny again too no doubt sandra would insist that she come over for dinner some evening but not for a while it was time to heal the wound and attempt to build more frail bridges between male and female and the fewer confusing distractions the easier that would be he would buy sandra a small present perhaps that simple gold chain she had admired in h samuels window the last time they were in leeds or the new lightweight camerabag at erricks in bradford or he could take her
